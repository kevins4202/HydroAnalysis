24845,ecosystem modelling is a useful tool for exploring the potential outcomes of policy options and conducting experiments that would otherwise be impractical in the real world however ecosystem models have been limited in their ability to engage in the management of living marine resources due in part to high levels of uncertainty in model parameters and model outputs additionally for multispecies or food web models there is uncertainty about the predator prey functional response which can have implications for population dynamics in this study we evaluate the sensitivity of large marine food webs in alaska to parameter uncertainty including parameters that govern the predator prey functional response we use rpath an r implementation of the food web modeling program ecopath with ecosim ewe to conduct a series of mortality based perturbations to examine the sensitivity and recovery time of higher trophic level groups in the eastern chukchi sea eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska we use a monte carlo approach to generate thousands of plausible ecosystems by drawing parameter sets from the range of uncertainty around the base model parameters we subjected the ecosystem ensembles to a series of mortality based perturbations to identify which functional groups the higher trophic level groups are most sensitive to when their mortality was increased whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation and how long it took to return to that state in all three ecosystems we found that the number of disrupted ensemble food webs was positively related to the biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed functional group and negatively related to trophic level the eastern chukchi sea was most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups the eastern bering sea was most sensitive to shrimp and walleye pollock and the gulf of alaska was most sensitive to shrimps pelagic forage fish and zooplankton recovery time to perturbations were generally less than 5 years in all three ecosystems the recovery times when fish groups were perturbed were generally longer than when benthic invertebrates were perturbed and recovery times were shortest when it was pelagic invertebrates the single model ensemble approach produced simulation results that described a range of possible outcomes to the prescribed perturbations and provided a sense for how robust the results are to parameter uncertainty keywords rpath ecosim food web chukchi sea bering sea gulf of alaska 1 introduction in recent decades the incorporation of ecosystem considerations into the management of living marine resources has been undertaken to varying degrees in several jurisdictions and large marine ecosystems fao 2003 pitcher et al 2009 national ocean council 2013 to consider the broader ecosystem effects of marine resource management actions it is necessary to make decisions between policy options based on predicted or expected outcomes and to consider tradeoffs among competing interests walters and martell 2004 link 2010 thus ecosystem modelling of possible outcomes to policy actions or inaction are required to explore potential future ecosystem states that may result from management decisions walters and martell 2004 hollowed et al 2011 lehuta et al 2016 modelling in its many forms is integral to the management of living marine resources and to the implementation of an ecosystem based approach to management plagányi 2007 coll and libralato 2012 fogarty 2014 busch et al 2016 national marine fisheries service 2016 models can be qualitative or quantitative and can be used to enhance general ecosystem understanding or to inform strategic guidance and tactical management decisions hollowed et al 2000 plagányi 2007 harvey et al 2016 additionally experiments can be conducted with models that would otherwise be impractical in the real world permitting the exploration of policy options climate effects or other anticipated stressors and help to discern important ecological thresholds and tradeoffs a major impediment to the adoption and use of ecosystem models in ecosystem based management ebm is addressing uncertainty in models and their outputs in a satisfactory manner murawski 2007 link et al 2012 patrick and link 2015 there are a wide range of ecosystem models with differing levels of complexity from multispecies and models of intermediate complexity mice plaganyi et al 2014 to models of whole food webs bio economic models and end to end bio physical models there is a tradeoff between increasing the realism and complexity of a model and a commensurate increase in the overall uncertainty associated with the model collie et al 2016 this has led to a concern among some scientists and stakeholders that some ecosystem models are too complex and too ambitious in the scope and scale of the processes they are attempting to represent that these models require more data and information than we possess or could ever attain and therefore their outputs are of little value beckage et al 2011 ruiz and kuikka 2012 planque 2016 thus it is critically important for models intended to support ebm to be candid about uncertainty and to provide accurate accounts of the sources and degree of uncertainty in a model and its parameters and to characterize that uncertainty in model results link et al 2012 several modeling studies and workshops have attempted to address concerns about uncertainty and have assembled lists of best practices for modelling in support of marine ebm e g fao 2008 townsend et al 2008 link et al 2010 kaplan and marshall 2016 these comprehensive lists of best practices are often applicable to a broad range of ecosystem models and do not necessarily target one model type or specific model framework a common entry to these best practices is a call for explicit characterization of uncertainty in model inputs and parameters and to carry this uncertainty through the modelling or simulation process to indicate the uncertainty in model outputs including the uncertainty in simulation results helps to avoid a false sense of certainty in model outcomes and can help to communicate the strength of results to managers and stakeholders another recommended best practice for multispecies ecological models is to consider the importance of the predator prey functional response to biomass dynamics and to evaluate the robustness of model results to alternative forms of this response fao 2008 the specific form of the predator prey functional response is generally not well known for any particular trophic relationship however it can have a profound impact on biomass dynamics mackinson et al 2003 gaichas et al 2011 gaichas et al 2012 in this study we focus our attention on the treatment of parameter uncertainty in the widely used marine food web modelling framework ecopath with ecosim ewe ecopath org christensen and walters 2004 we employ a simplified bayesian synthesis routine givens et al 1993 for ewe that addresses the aforementioned best practices by including uncertainty in the predator prey functional response for each trophic interaction incorporating uncertainty into model simulations for all of the base model parameters and capturing the effect of that parameter uncertainty in model outputs we use a single model ensemble approach gal et al 2014 to generate multiple versions of the same ewe model by allowing the base model parameters and the predator prey functional response to vary within a prescribed range based on a data pedigree we then perform simulations on the ensemble of generated models to produce a range of outcomes to the simulated scenarios and examine the robustness of model outcomes to parameter uncertainty the static mass balance model ecopath was originally developed by polovina 1984 to produce estimates of biomass and production for species and functional groups in a coral reef ecosystem in the french frigate shoals the program has since had the time dynamic modeling framework ecosim walters et al 1997 added which allows for simulations hypothesis testing and policy exploration since its introduction more than 400 unique ewe models have been developed describing freshwater and marine ecosystems from the tropics to polar regions colléter et al 2015 there have been several efforts to address input parameter sensitivity and uncertainty in ewe models previous versions of ewe contained a monte carlo routine called ecoranger which used a data pedigree and corresponding confidence intervals to generate an ensemble of static ecopath models to explore model sensitivity to uncertain parameter estimates recently steenbeek et al 2018 has developed the ecosampler module for the ewe program which also uses a monte carlo routine and data pedigree to generate ensembles of balanced ecopath models which can be passed to ecosim ecospace or other ewe plug ins for further analysis other routines for generating ecopath model ensembles have been developed independent of ewe and implemented in matlab kearney 2017 and r koehn et al 2016 aydin et al 2005 developed a similar routine called ecosense for generating ensembles of ecosim parameters from a single ecopath model in the c environment enabling dynamic simulations with all ensemble members aydin et al 2003 gaichas et al 2015 with ecosense the user can vary the base model parameters diet compositions non predation natural mortality and the parameters governing the predator prey functional response gaichas et al 2012 for this study we use the ecosense routine to generate ewe model ensembles but have adapted the routine to work with a prototype of an independent version of ewe called rpath lucey et al 2020 which was developed to work with the open source statistical program r r core team 2015 rpath uses the same equations and algorithms of ewe but has the advantages of improved access to the model code and the flexibility to modify the code for user defined analyses and simulations in this study we execute a series of time dynamic simulations with ewe model ensembles of three distinct marine ecosystems in alaska the eastern chukchi sea the eastern bering sea and the gulf of alaska to investigate the sensitivity of higher trophic level groups to mortality based perturbations a perturbation analysis is a useful way to gain insight into population dynamics and how species interact with each other in a food web mediated by their trophic interactions bender et al 1984 schmitz 1997 using a comparative approach can help highlight results that distinguish one ecosystem from the others features that might otherwise go unnoticed megrey et al 2009 we attempt to identify which functional groups the higher trophic levels are most sensitive to when their mortality is increased whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation and how long it took to return to that state by incorporating the uncertainty in the base ecopath model parameters the predator prey functional response and using an ensemble approach we are able to characterize uncertainty in ecosim results by describing the range of possible outcomes among ensemble members additionally we look for correlations between the number of disrupted ensemble food webs and the trophic level biomass and number of trophic links of the perturbed group 2 methods 2 1 modeling framework we use existing trophic mass balance food web models of the eastern chukchi sea whitehouse and aydin 2016 eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska aydin et al 2007 that were developed using the ewe framework ecopath is a biomass compartment model where each compartment represents a species or functional group of multiple species and describes the network of energy flows between groups in a food web ecopath is a static mass balanced model and it provides a spatially homogeneous snapshot of the trophic structure and function of an ecosystem the mass balance requirement ensures there is sufficient production in any compartment to meet the modeled demand from predators or any fishery removals the interactions between species in a food web are described by ecopath with a set of linear equations for each group i with predator j as 1 b i p b i e e i c i b a i j b j q b j d c i j where b is biomass t km 2 p b yr 1 is the production to biomass ratio q b yr 1 is the consumption to biomass ratio dcij is the proportion of prey i in the diet of predator j ba is a biomass accumulation term c is subsistence harvest or fisheries catch t km 2 and ee is ecotrophic efficiency which is the proportion of production bi p b i that is consumed by predators and removed by harvests fisheries included in the model mass balance is achieved when the system of linear equations is solved for one missing parameter for each functional group a diet matrix dci and bai term if bai 0 must be entered by the user and typically estimates for b p b q b are c are also provided by the user and the equation s solved for ee values of ee range from 0 to 1 and are close to one for groups subject to heavy predation and or fishing pressure and it is close to zero for groups that experience little predation and or fishing pressure christensen et al 2005 often initial attempts to balance a model are unsuccessful and several functional groups may be out of balance ee 1 indicating they are being consumed and or removed at a rate greater than their production this is often the result of an incompatible set of model inputs e g predator consumption in excess of prey production or due to an error in the model e g misplaced decimal when parameters are determined to be incompatible they will need to be reconciled to bring the model into balance this can involve recalculating or manually adjusting a parameter based on new information selecting an alternative parameter from the literature or using ecopath to solve for the parameter in question by fixing ee and solving for the suspect parameter a data pedigree see section 2 3 incorporating parameter uncertainty can be used to determine which parameters have the greatest uncertainty and should be considered first for adjustment the models used in the current study are already balanced and no additional modifications were required ecosim is the time dynamic counterpart of ecopath and provides the user with the ability to conduct simulations and to test hypotheses on the entire food web walters et al 1997 in ecosim the system of ecopath mass balance equations are converted to a set of differential equations describing the biomass dynamics of functional groups linked together through their trophic interactions and predator prey functional responses the biomass dynamics of each functional group is modeled as 2 d b i d t g e i p r e y q b i b p r e y f i b i m 0 i b i p r e d q b p r e d b i where ge is the growth efficiency and is equal to the production rate p b divided by the consumption rate q b q is consumption t km 1 yr 1 f is the fishing exploitation rate yr 1 and m0 is other mortality yr 1 not explicitly represented in the model m0i is equal to 1 eei and includes mortality sources such as disease senescence starvation or outmigration the terms q bi bj represent the functional response equations the strength of predator prey interactions can have a strong impact on biomass dynamics and the shape of the functional response can be different for each trophic link in the food web ecosim employs a foraging arena model to represent the functional response of groups to changing biomass and consumption walters et al 1997 ahrens et al 2012 the foraging arena model assumes that at any given time only a proportion of the prey population is vulnerable to a predator following aydin 2004 the predator prey functional response is expressed as 3 q b p r e d p r e d p r e y t q b p r e d x p r e d p r e y d c p r e d p r e y b p r e y t b p r e y x p r e d p r e y 1 b p r e d t b p r e d where q b is the predator q b from the base ecopath starting point dc is the proportion of the prey in the predator s diet at the starting point bpred t and bprey t are the biomasses of the predator and prey at time t b pred and b prey are the predator and prey biomasses at the starting point and x predprey is the vulnerability parameter which describes the rate of prey movement between vulnerable and invulnerable states low prey vulnerabilities are associated with bottom up effects where increasing the predator population does not necessarily have measurable impact on the prey population high vulnerabilities are consistent with top down effects where vulnerable prey populations are more severely impacted by fluctuations in predator abundance in theory the vulnerability parameter ranges from one to and is centered on two the effective range of x predprey is from 1 01 to 91 gaichas et al 2012 and the default value in ewe is two 2 2 the food web models and system descriptions 2 2 1 eastern chukchi sea the eastern chukchi sea is a broad and shallow continental shelf ecosystem off the coast of northwest alaska figure 1 with most depths less than 60 m jakobsson 2002 the chukchi sea is connected to the pacific ocean through the bering strait at its southern edge there is a net northward flow of water through bering strait and across the continental shelf although seasonal and episodic variation can affect the direction and magnitude of flow coachman and aagaard 1981 woodgate et al 2012 danielson et al 2014 the chukchi sea is subject to polar night and is seasonally covered by sea ice primary production in the spring begins with production from ice algae within and along the underside of sea ice cota and smith 1991 horner et al 1992 and large pelagic blooms have recently been observed in the water column beneath the ice arrigo et al 2014 waters flowing into the chukchi sea through bering strait during the ice free season can be rich with nutrients and fuels areas of intense productivity in the southern chukchi sea sambrotto et al 1984 springer and mcroy 1993 only a limited portion of the annual primary production is consumed by zooplankton cooney and coyle 1982 coyle and cooney 1988 campbell et al 2009 and much of it sinks to the seafloor and supports an abundant benthic community grebmeier et al 2015 currently there are no industrial scale commercial fisheries in the us territorial waters of the eastern chukchi sea npfmc 2009 however there are subsistence fisheries and harvests of marine mammals craig 1987 hovelsrud et al 2008 fall et al 2011 the eastern chukchi sea food web model covers an area of 192 000 km2 in the eastern portion of the chukchi sea within us territorial waters there was no ecosystem basis for modeling only the eastern half of the chukchi sea this decision was based on the availability of data whitehouse et al 2014 2 2 2 eastern bering sea the eastern bering sea is a broad continental shelf ecosystem encompassing an area of 495 000 km2 the modelled area extends from unimak pass and bristol bay northwestward to about 61 n aydin et al 2007 figure 1 the major inputs of water to the continental shelf are through unimak pass in the south advection through canyons along the continental slope to the west and seasonal freshwater input from river drainage stabeno et al 2016b portions of the southeastern bering sea continental shelf are seasonally covered by sea ice which moves in from the northern bering sea in late winter a cold pool of water 2 c remains over the shelf following the retreat of sea ice in the spring the extent of which varies from year to year with the extent of sea ice coverage sullivan et al 2014 the size and location of the cold pool has important implications for species distribution and community composition at multiple trophic levels mueter and litzow 2008 stevenson and lauth 2012 eisner et al 2018 and for recruitment of commercially important fishes hunt et al 2011 duffy anderson et al 2016 the eastern bering sea has several productive commercial fisheries including fisheries for species of gadids flatfishes and crabs npfmc 2011 2017a fisheries are executed with multiple gear types including trawls longlines and pots the walleye pollock gadus chalcogrammus hereafter referred to as pollock fishery is one of the largest single species fisheries in the world with average catches of 1 2 million t per year since the 1970s ianelli et al 2017 2 2 3 gulf of alaska the gulf of alaska is located in the northeast pacific and has a continental shelf of varying width that stretches along the alaska coast from the us canada border then north and west around the margin of the gulf to the aleutian islands at its western end figure 1 the gulf of alaska model encompasses the continental shelf waters of the gulf of alaska from 140 w to 170 w a total area of 291 840 km2 aydin et al 2007 gaichas et al 2010 the continental shelf is detailed with islands and bays and the continental slope has many gullies carved into its margins the net circulation in the gulf is in the counterclockwise direction productivity in the gulf is influenced by the development of eddies gap winds between mountains along the coast upwelling and freshwater runoff from the coast ladd and cheng 2016 ladd et al 2016 stabeno et al 2016a the community composition and relative species abundance on a multi year timescale is influenced by large scale climate drivers such as the el niño southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 hollowed et al 2001 a regime shift in community organization was observed in the mid 1970s and coincided with a shift in the pdo from a negative phase cooler sst to a positive phase warmer sst mantua et al 1997 prior to the regime shift the community composition was dominated by shrimp and capelin afterwards groundfish including gadids and flatfish became increasingly abundant while the relative abundance of shrimp and capelin decreased anderson and piatt 1999 historically the gulf of alaska hosted several commercially valuable crab fisheries that peaked in ex vessel value in the early 1980s then catch for crabs declined rapidly to less than 20 of their maximum with most crab fisheries closed by the mid 1980s orensanz et al 1998 currently the gulf of alaska has several productive finfish fisheries including pollock pacific cod gadus macrocephalus sablefish anoplopoma fimbria flatfish pleuronectidae and rockfish sebastidae npfmc 2017b 2 2 4 functional groups the three ewe models used in this analysis originally had different numbers of functional groups with 149 in the eastern bering sea 138 in the gulf of alaska and 67 in the eastern chukchi sea differences in the level of trophic aggregation can make comparisons between models difficult to interpret pinnegar et al 2005 to make the models more comparable a minimum amount of aggregation prior to conducting simulations was necessary however we also need to balance this with maintaining some of the functional groups or species of heightened interest in each food web e g commercially important species protected species keystone species the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models had finer levels of taxonomic resolution among several categories including fishes zooplankton and marine mammals to make these groups more comparable across all three models species specific groups were consolidated to a common functional group for example capelin mallotus villosus pacific herring clupea pallasi and other functional groups of primarily pelagic forage fish were combined into a single pelagic forage fish group in each model the biomasses and fisheries catch of functional groups aggregated into a single group were summed together the p b q b and dc for the aggregated groups were weighted by the biomass of the constituent groups the total number of functional groups in the aggregated models are 54 in the eastern bering sea 50 in the gulf of alaska and 53 in the eastern chukchi sea table 1 forty six of the groups are common to all three models the polar bear ursus maritimus arctic cod and basket star gorgonocephalus sp groups are unique to the eastern chukchi sea model the bowhead whale pacific walrus bearded seal wintering seals and snow crab groups are only present in the eastern bering sea and eastern chukchi sea models other baleen whales other pinnipeds sharks and the squids group are only present in the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models because the use of functional group names in the text can be confusing from here on when referring to a functional group from one of the models the name will be italicized the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models included more fishing groups detrital compartments and sources of primary production than the eastern chukchi sea model the primary production and detritus groups in the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models were aggregated to match the number of respective groups in the eastern chukchi sea model one primary production and two detrital compartments because we are not exploring fishery policy options in this study we have aggregated all fisheries subsistence harvests to a single compartment in each model 2 3 incorporating parameter uncertainty the precision of parameter estimates across functional groups is usually uneven and in many cases the uncertainty is high we incorporate parameter uncertainty into our simulations with a monte carlo routine used to generate entire sets of food web model ewe parameters based on the ecosense routine of aydin et al 2005 the ecosense routine generates entire sets of ecosim food web parameters randomly drawn from prior distributions based on a data pedigree all model parameters and or data were graded for quality using a data pedigree described by christensen et al 2005 with specific definitions from aydin et al 2007 model parameters and data were assigned a data pedigree based upon the data source collection methodology temporal and spatial coverage of the dataset and taxonomic relevance table 2 complete explanations of data pedigree values for the base ecopath models used in this study can be found in the model s source documentation aydin et al 2007 whitehouse and aydin 2016 each data pedigree corresponds to a prescribed range as a proportion of the point estimate coefficient of variation cv intended to characterize parameter uncertainty ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 table 3 parameters for b p b and q b were drawn from uniform distributions centered on the base ecopath model parameter estimates with the specified cvs m0 is selected from a uniform distribution centered on the base ecopath value using the respective species p b cv m0 is normally set by ecopath during initial model balancing as 1 minus ee by selecting m0 independently the ecosystem begins away from equilibrium the dc of a predator consists of proportions for each prey type and must sum to one therefore the drawing of random diet proportions was treated differently than the other base parameters diet composition in terms of the presence or absence of a trophic link does not vary in the ecosense routine diet proportions for each prey item in a predator s diet were drawn from a dirichlet distribution and not allowed to be equal to zero while fishery catch c is not directly drawn in the ecosense routine the observed catch will vary between drawn ecosystems due to differences in the drawn starting biomass values and the subsequent effect on catch in rpath the catch of a group can be regulated by effort e fishing mortality f or by manually entering catch cinput the catch of a functional group i is calculated as 4 c t i g q i g e t g f t i b i c t i i n p u t where cti is the catch of group i at time t g is gear type qi is a catchability coefficient of group i with gear g and is equal to the ratio of the ecopath base catch for group i with gear g to the starting biomass of group i etg is the effort at time t for gear g and is either zero or one ftibi is the f at time t multiplied by biomass b for group i and cinput is catch that is manually entered by default rpath calculates the catch of functional groups by effort e 1 with q equal to the quotient of the ecopath catch and the starting biomass the f and cinput terms are set to zero by default to instead fish by f rate e can be set equal to zero and a value entered for f that can vary by time step if desired similarly specific catch values can be entered for cinput if desired and e and f set to zero below in section 2 4 we utilize the f term in this equation to increase mortality during simulations the results of ecosim simulations have been shown to be sensitive to predator prey functional responses and use of the ecosim default vulnerability x predprey 2 for all trophic links is not recommended plagányi and butterworth 2004 gaichas et al 2011 gaichas et al 2012 following the methods of gaichas et al 2012 we vary vulnerability for each trophic link with random draws over the effective range of vulnerability 1 01 to 91 centered on the default value of two 4 x p r e d p r e y 1 e x p 9 u n i f o r m 0 1 0 5 there are additional functional response parameters in ecosim including prey handling time foraging time and prey switching rate we held these additional functional response parameters at their default values the generated ecosim parameter sets are not necessarily starting from a stable or equilibrium like state we ran the generated ecosystems forward for a 50 year burn in period during which any numerically unstable configurations were eliminated according to pre specified criteria if during this initial 50 year run a functional group dies out bi decreases to 1 1000 of starting bi or grows without limit bi increases to 1000 times starting bi that entire ecosystem is considered to have failed and that ecosim parameter set is not retained for further analysis aydin et al 2005 gaichas et al 2015 this typically happens because of thermodynamically inconsistent parameter draws for example parameter draws with exceptionally high predator biomass and high consumption rates in an ecosystem with low prey biomass and low prey production incapable of supporting the randomly drawn predator parameters such failed ecosystems tend to crash during the first few years of the burn in period and 50 years is generally sufficient to eliminate all such thermodynamically inconsistent systems ecosystem parameter sets that do not crash during burn in are retained for further analyses the uncertainty in the model parameters combined with the thermodynamic constraints of the mass balance framework and the burn in period of the ecosense routine is sufficiently restrictive to eliminate more than 90 of the generated food web parameter sets gaichas et al 2015 used ecosense and the same rejection criteria and rejected 98 of generated ecosystems using the same criteria rejection rates will vary across studies due to inherent differences in the ecosystems modeled the data pedigree and other study specific differences in model design for this study we retained a minimum of 500 plausible ecosystem parameter sets for each of the three modeled ecosystems in the eastern chukchi sea we generated 5 000 ecosystem parameter sets and retained 511 ecosystems for the eastern bering sea 9 500 parameter sets were generated and 505 survived the burn in period with no crashes in the gulf of alaska we generated 12 000 food web parameter sets in order to find 553 that were numerically stable enough to survive burn in the csv files required to operate rpath with all three aggregated ecosystem models used in this study are available in the supplementary material additionally an r file with the ecosense parameter generation function is included in the supplementary material the rpath package can be downloaded from https github com noaa edab rpath this version of ecosense presented here was developed to work with a prototype version of the rpath package lucey et al 2020 ecosense will be included in a future release of rpath and we anticipate refinements to the ecosense code will be necessary in order for it to be formally included within the rpath package 2 4 mortality based perturbations to examine the sensitivity of upper trophic level groups to mortality based perturbations we first ran each retained model forward for a 50 year run in ecosim without any perturbation this created a 50 year simulated baseline from which we would be able to compare the perturbation results against for each unique ecosystem configuration we conducted mortality based perturbations by increasing the total mortality 50 for each living functional group in the food web excluding primary production and microbes one at a time and holding that increased mortality rate in place for the first 10 years of a 50 year simulation under equilibrium conditions p b is assumed to be equal to the instantaneous mortality rate z allen 1971 total mortality was increased in our simulations by setting the f rate in equation four equal to half of the respective group s p b when the adjusted f is multiplied by the respective group s biomass the product is added to the existing catch by effort e already included in equation four and the functional group s biomass is reduced accordingly following year 10 the perturbed mortality rate was returned to the baseline level and the simulation allowed to run without any other perturbations for the remaining 40 years this meant that for the three ecosystems included in this analysis the number of simulations was equal to the number of living groups times the number of retained food web parameter sets this was equal to more than 24 000 simulations for each of the three ecosystems included in this analysis to identify and follow any disturbance to the food web that resulted from a perturbation we tracked the aggregated biomass of upper trophic level groups this is the sum of biomass for all groups with a trophic level tl of 2 6 or higher excluding fisheries the eastern chukchi sea eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska had 36 35 and 31 functional groups with tl of 2 6 or higher respectively this division at trophic level 2 6 effectively separated predators from those that primarily preyed directly on basal resources the diet compositions of groups with tl 2 6 all consist of at least 50 from detritus and or primary production these lower trophic level consumers were mostly benthic invertebrate groups also zooplankton and microbes if the upper tl biomass deviated more than 10 from the baseline trajectory during a simulation that ecosystem was considered to have been disrupted by the perturbation for each perturbation we kept track of the number of ecosystems that were disrupted by that perturbation when an ecosystem was disrupted we measured the recovery time of the food web as the time it took for upper tl biomass to return to within 10 of its baseline trajectory we additionally kept track of and enumerated instances where ecosystems did not return to their baseline trajectory for upper tl biomass we also looked for underlying patterns in the simulation results and checked for correlations pearson product moment correlation ρ α 0 05 between the number of ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation and the trophic level log biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed group 3 results 3 1 eastern chukchi sea upper trophic levels in the eastern chukchi sea were most sensitive to mortality based perturbations of benthic invertebrate groups in general upper trophic level biomass was disrupted in more of the generated ecosystems by perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups than perturbations to other functional groups figure 2 a in particular the food webs were most sensitive to perturbations of the brittle stars bivalves shrimps and polychaete worm functional groups each of these four groups disrupted approximately 20 of the generated ecosystems perturbations to fish groups generally disrupted upper trophic level biomass in less systems than the benthic invertebrate groups the miscellaneous shallow fish eelpouts large mouth flatfish and other sculpins were the most disruptive fish groups each disrupting between 5 and 7 of the generated ecosystems pelagic invertebrate groups when perturbed were less disruptive each affecting less than 2 3 of ecosystems perturbations to marine mammal and seabird groups did not disrupt any of the ecosystems the median recovery times of the generated eastern chukchi sea food webs to all of the perturbations were less than 10 years and most less than five figure 2b the highest median recovery times were for perturbations to small mouth flatfish 9 9 the urchins dollars and cucumbers group 8 9 and large mouth flatfish 5 7 the range of recovery times for benthic invertebrate perturbations were generally narrow exceptions were for the urchins dollars cucumbers group and brittle stars the range of recovery times for the fish groups were generally wider than the benthic invertebrate groups the median recovery times for perturbations of pelagic invertebrate groups were all less than 1 5 years in all of the simulations n 24 017 with the eastern chukchi sea food web there were two instances where upper trophic level biomass was disrupted by a perturbation and it did not return to within 10 of its baseline trajectory there was no indication from the relative biomass trajectories of functional groups that either ecosystem had shifted to an alternative stable state following the perturbation in one instance the perturbed group itself accounted for a disproportionate share of upper trophic level biomass and in combination with a p b that was much lower than the base ecopath p b for that group led to a slow recovery following the perturbation figures s1 and s2 in the second instance some strong predator prey functional responses i e high vulnerabilities produced an unrealistic high amplitude rapid oscillation of upper trophic level biomass that rendered this system impossible further details on these outliers are available in the supplementary material 3 2 eastern bering sea the perturbation that was most disruptive to upper trophic level biomass in the eastern bering sea was shrimps when shrimps were perturbed 23 4 of the generated ecosystems were disrupted figure 2c the next most disruptive group was pollock which disrupted 11 3 of the systems other disruptive groups included pelagic forage fish 9 9 small mouth flatfish 9 3 and bivalves 8 7 perturbations to copepods and other zooplankton were also disruptive to upper trophic level biomass in 8 1 and 7 7 of systems respectively with the exception of other baleen whales the generated ecosystems were insensitive to perturbations of marine mammal and seabird groups one generated ecosystem was disrupted by the perturbation to other baleen whales the median recovery time of the generated ecosystems to perturbations were all less than seven years and most less than four with the exception of the perturbation to other baleen whales figure 2d the single ecosystem where upper trophic level biomass was disrupted by the perturbation to other baleen whales took 34 3 years to recover from the perturbation the next highest median recovery time was for miscellaneous shallow fish 6 6 years large mouth flatfish 5 3 years and miscellaneous crustaceans 4 3 years in general the range of recovery times for all the perturbations were relatively narrow in all the simulations n 24 240 with the eastern bering sea food web there were four occasions where upper trophic level biomass did not return to within 10 of the baseline trajectory following a perturbation in the first instance the perturbed group represented the majority of upper trophic level biomass and in combination with a p b that is much lower than the base ecopath p b for this group prevented a recovery by the simulation s end in the second food web most groups were already experiencing a gradual monotonic decline in biomass the perturbed group expedited this decline in biomass reducing upper trophic level biomass well below the 10 threshold and preventing a return to within the 10 threshold by the end of the simulation figure s5 in a third case high vulnerabilities led to high amplitude low frequency oscillations that prevented upper trophic level biomass from stabilizing within the 10 threshold by the end of the simulation figures s6 and s7 in the fourth instance high vulnerabilities led to high amplitude high frequency oscillations that were completely unrealistic further details on these outliers are available in the supplementary material 3 3 gulf of alaska similar to the eastern bering sea perturbations to shrimps were the most disruptive to upper trophic level biomass in the gulf of alaska food webs affecting 30 6 of the generated ecosystems figure 2e the gulf of alaska food webs were also sensitive to perturbations of pelagic oriented groups including pelagic forage fish 14 8 other zooplankton 14 3 and copepods 7 2 perturbations to most of the remaining fish groups produced some level of disruption in upper trophic level biomass ranging from 0 2 to 8 of the generated ecosystems among benthic invertebrates perturbations to bivalves 8 7 and snails 7 1 were most disruptive to upper trophic level biomass perturbations to marine mammals and seabirds did not disrupt upper trophic level biomass in any of the generated ecosystems among the functional groups whose perturbations disrupted upper trophic level biomass the median recovery time of the food web once the perturbation ended was less than 5 years for all groups except miscellaneous shallow fish which had a median return time of 9 5 years figure 2f perturbations to shrimps pelagic forage fish and other zooplankton disrupted the most generated ecosystems but all three have median return times of less than 2 years eight of the 10 longest median return times belong to fish groups of the simulations with the gulf of alaska food web n 24 332 there were two instances where upper trophic level biomass did not return to within 10 of the baseline trajectory and in both cases the perturbed group was miscellaneous shallow fish in both of these generated ecosystems miscellaneous shallow fish accounted for sizeable portions of upper trophic level biomass at 64 and 16 it is their loss in biomass that explains the overall loss in upper trophic level biomass in both systems upper trophic level biomass slowly increases in both systems following the end of the perturbation but does not increase fast enough to return to the baseline trajectory by the end of the simulation upper trophic level biomass was 17 and 16 below the baseline value at the conclusion of the two simulations 3 4 correlation with disrupted ecosystems we tested for correlations between the percentage of ecosystems where upper trophic level biomass was disrupted and properties of the functional groups being perturbed including log biomass trophic level and the number of trophic links log biomass was positively correlated with the percentage of disrupted food webs and was the most strongly correlated of the three variables in all three ecosystems p 0 05 table 4 trophic level of the perturbed group was negatively correlated with the percentage of disrupted food webs in all three study systems but not significant in the gulf of alaska p 0 101 the total number of trophic links for a perturbed group had a significant p 0 05 positive correlation with the percentage of disrupted ecosystems for the eastern chukchi sea and eastern bering sea simulations but was not significant for the gulf of alaska simulations 4 discussion our analysis identified a number of key sensitivities of upper trophic level groups from a selection of marine ecosystems in alaska we found upper trophic levels in the eastern chukchi sea food web to be most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrates in the eastern bering sea upper trophic level groups were sensitive to perturbations of shrimp and pollock and in the gulf of alaska they were sensitive to perturbations of shrimp pelagic forage fish and zooplankton across ecosystems the median recovery times of upper trophic level biomass to most perturbations were less than 5 years and there were no indications of ecosystems flipping to alternate stable states in response to perturbations this indicates these modeled food webs were robust to the parameter uncertainty present and the simple first order perturbations conducted here the ecosense routine permitted a wide exploration of the parameter space around the vulnerability parameter of the functional response and the base model parameters this provided us with a range of outcomes to the specific perturbations and indicated the median recovery time and how robust the outcomes were to different parameter combinations these analyses also shed light on instances where combinations of parameter draws led to unsustainable biomass dynamics or systems that were unable to recover from perturbations however given the total number of simulations across all three ecosystems 72 000 such circumstances were extremely rare the mortality based perturbations of the eastern chukchi sea food web revealed that upper trophic levels in this ecosystem were generally more sensitive to perturbations of benthic invertebrate functional groups than to fishes pelagic invertebrates seabirds or marine mammals we found that the percentage of generated ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation was positively correlated with the perturbed group s biomass the number of trophic links and negatively correlated with their tl in general benthic invertebrate functional groups in the eastern chukchi sea model closely align with this profile as they are high biomass lower trophic level and have many trophic links in contrast the percentage of ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation in the gulf of alaska had a significant positive correlation with the perturbed group s biomass but did not have a significant correlation with the perturbed groups trophic level or the number of trophic links α 0 05 smith et al 2011 simulated fishing on lower trophic level groups with an ensemble of ecosystem models including ewe models and found that the relative abundance of the perturbed group and their level of connectance to the rest of the food web helped explain the response of other groups in the food web this is consistent with the positive correlations we observed between the number of food webs with disrupted upper trophic levels and the biomass and number of trophic links of the perturbed group system recovery times to perturbations were interpreted in this study as a measure of the stability of the model ecosystems that is their ability to endure a perturbation and to return to their baseline configuration following a perturbation holling 1973 pimm 1984 previous studies with ewe have also considered system recovery time in response to a perturbation as a measure of food web stability vasconcellos et al 1997 examined the stability of ewe models for 18 different ecosystems when key mid trophic level groups were perturbed they found that system recovery time was negatively correlated with finn s cycling index which provides a measure of energy flow that is recycled within the ecosystem finn 1976 they concluded that ecosystems with higher recycling had a greater capacity to return to starting conditions a study using ewe models to examine the trophic role of snappers lutjanidae in the gulf of mexico found that system recovery time was positively correlated with the maximum observed proportional change in biomass from a group during a simulation arreguin sanchez and manickchand heileman 1998 when the impact of a perturbation was the greatest in terms of biomass they observed longer system recovery times this is consistent with our observation that the number of disrupted food webs was positively related to the perturbed group s biomass other studies with ewe models have examined system recovery time under different global vulnerability settings where all vulnerabilities were set to low intermediate default or high values across multiple ecosystems and a range of perturbations system recovery time was lowest with low vulnerability settings higher at the intermediate default value and highest at high vulnerabilities ortiz and wolff 2002 ortiz 2010 rodriguez zaragoza et al 2016 hermosillo nunez et al 2018 although system recovery time could often not be evaluated at high vulnerabilities due to the emergence of chaotic oscillations ortiz et al 2009 ortiz et al 2013 caceres et al 2016 similarly we observed a few instances where high vulnerabilities resulted in oscillations preventing an estimation of recovery time the oscillations we observed may in part be due to the choice of using adams bashforth numerical integration for our simulations rpath also offers fourth order runge kutta numerical integration that integrates over finer time steps and may have better resolved rapid biomass dynamics reducing the appearance of oscillations recovery times to perturbations in all disrupted food webs in all three ecosystems were generally less than 5 years however the eastern chukchi sea had the slowest mean recovery time across all disrupted food webs at 4 7 years the mean recovery times in the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska were 3 1 and 3 4 years respectively this indicates that the eastern chukchi sea may be more vulnerable to mortality events or extractive activities than the other two ecosystems included in this study the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska are currently subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors including commercial fisheries shipping and tourism the eastern chukchi sea is not presently subject to commercial fisheries npfmc 2009 but improved access due to sea ice reduction has led to increasing ship traffic smith and stephenson 2013 huntington et al 2015 additionally recent observations of commercial species from the southeastern bering sea in the northern bering sea has prompted questions about what the potential ecosystem impacts could be for the northern bering sea and chukchi sea if sub arctic species from the southeastern bering sea expand their range northward and what the implications of such stock movement would be for fisheries and fisheries management stevenson and lauth 2019 modeling tools that incorporate uncertainty such as ecosense could be useful in the exploration of potential ecosystem impacts due to immigration of new species changing community composition and the exploration of fishery management strategies as an alternative to recovery time smith et al 2011 examined the impact of simulated fishing on lower trophic level groups by tracking the number of functional groups whose biomass deviated beyond a threshold in response to the intensity of fishing on the target species in contrast to recovery time this allowed them to quantify the level of disruption the fishing strategy caused in terms of how many groups in the food web experienced an adverse effect we did not take this approach in our current analysis but the approach of smith et al 2011 could be utilized with ecosense to examine which functional groups show consistent responses to perturbations or experimental fishing strategies this could be a particularly useful strategy if there are particular commercial or protected species that are believed to be especially vulnerable ecosense in its original c format has previously been used in a comparative framework to contrast the response of multiple ecosystems to the same set of pressures aydin et al 2003 examined the response of the eastern and western basins of the subarctic pacific to increasing primary production and the removal of selected prey and predator groups the removal of mid trophic level groups had direct effects on prey who often increased in abundance under the predatory release and select predators decreased who were particularly dependent on the removed group other groups who shared prey resources with the removed group often benefited from the removal of competitors and increased in abundance the direct effects observed by aydin et al 2003 are consistent with our observation that the number of ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation was positively correlated with the number of trophic links of the perturbed group and negatively correlated with trophic level aydin et al 2007 used ecosense to examine variation in predation mortality for important prey groups and the consequences of changing predator production across the eastern bering sea gulf of alaska and aleutian islands ecosystems although many taxa are shared across these ecosystems the uncertainty captured by the ecosense routine helped to identify key forage species that each food web was uniquely sensitive to these sensitivities were often the result of little data or structural differences in the food webs similarly in our study key sensitivities in our perturbation analysis generally reflected structural differences between the food webs examined and poor data pedigree scores the sensitivity of upper trophic levels in the eastern chukchi sea to benthic invertebrates reflects their structural dominance in this food web and in part uncertainties about their productivity and trophic relationships hunt et al 2013 whitehouse et al 2014 the sensitivity of the eastern bering sea to pollock reflects their structural dominance in the food web and their importance as both a predator and prey aydin and mueter 2007 the sensitivity of the gulf of alaska model to the pelagic forage fish and zooplankton groups reflects the greater balance between the pelagic and benthic energy pathways in this ecosystem and the prevalence of high trophic level predators such as arrowtooth flounder atheresthes stomias and pacific halibut hippoglossus stenolepis gaichas et al 2015 ruzicka et al 2013b used ecosense to investigate the food web impacts of doubling forage fish abundance in four large coastal marine ecosystems including the northern california current central gulf of alaska georges bank and the southwestern antarctic peninsula an important finding of their study was that the immediate short term response of selected seabird whales and pinnipeds to the perturbations was often dramatically different from their long term response in our study we did not directly contrast short term and long term response of individual groups but indirectly we looked at this in terms of the recovery time of disrupted food webs a key distinction between our study and that of ruzicka et al 2013b is that our perturbations ended after 10 years and theirs were maintained over their entire simulations we were concerned with the sensitivity of upper trophic levels and their recovery time while they examined short term and long term impacts from sustained pressures using the same four study ecosystems ruzicka et al 2013a examined the ecosystems response to increasing the abundance of selected marine mammal groups to their pre exploitation levels they found these perturbations to be of minimal impact which is consistent with our findings while our perturbations decreased marine mammal abundance rather than an increase the results were similar perturbing marine mammals produced only minor responses in the rest of the food web this is largely due to the relatively low biomass and low total consumption of these groups in the three models used in our study there is a greater level of disaggregation at higher trophic levels as opposed to lower trophic levels a consequence of this for upper trophic levels is that the individual groups have lower biomass and thus lower total consumption if higher trophic level groups were more aggregated they may have stronger top down effects on the food web additionally a study examining the sensitivity ewe food webs to varying levels of aggregation found that models that were highly aggregated at lower trophic levels were inherently more resistant to perturbations pinnegar et al 2005 gaichas et al 2015 used ecosense to compare the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska food webs and to examine how climate and fisheries interact with food web structure to produce different outcomes for the food webs in particular they examined the role of pollock and the combined effects of climate and pollock fisheries in these ecosystems a key feature of their ecosense simulation results is the higher level of variability in the gulf of alaska response to the same perturbations applied to the eastern bering sea this result has important implications to fisheries management as it suggests we may be less able to predict likely outcomes to anticipated stressors in the gulf of alaska as compared to the eastern bering sea gaichas et al 2015 in our study while we found both of these ecosystems to be sensitive to perturbations to pollock we found the range of recovery times to be much narrower and shorter in the eastern bering sea figure 2d than in the gulf of alaska figure 2f and consistent with the findings of gaichas et al 2015 we found the range of recovery times to perturbations in the gulf of alaska ensemble to be more than twice as wide as in the eastern bering sea ranging up to 10 years figure 2f however it should also be noted that while recovery times to pollock perturbations in the eastern bering sea were consistently shorter than in the gulf of alaska the percentage of ensemble ecosystems disrupted was nearly three times as high in the eastern bering sea 11 1 than in the gulf of alaska 3 8 this result highlights the structural importance of pollock to both ecosystems but emphasizes a greater level of stability in the eastern bering sea food web regarding the perturbations we applied to pollock other studies utilizing ecosense have focused on a single species or food web in a study investigating the production and growth of salmon in the northeast pacific aydin et al 2005 conducted a perturbation analysis with ecosense similar to what we did in the present study however instead of increasing mortality of each species in turn and examining the effect on upper trophic levels they increased the biomass of each species one at a time and looked at the effect this had on pink salmon oncorhynchus gorbuscha similar to our results they found bottom up effects from perturbing mid and lower trophic level species to be strongest while top down effects from perturbing higher trophic levels were difficult to detect aydin and mueter 2007 also conducted a perturbation analysis using ecosense during their examination of the dynamics of the eastern bering sea food web they decreased production of selected prey groups one at a time and examined their effect on the food web and in particular the effect on pollock they found pollock to be sensitive to reduced prey production they also observed that when pollock recruitment was reduced competitors of juvenile pollock benefitted from the competitive release and increased in their abundance this finding suggests that as long as there are other species filling a similar ecological role a significant loss in one species might not have much effect on the broader food web previous studies that used ecosense have taken different approaches to addressing uncertainty in the predator prey functional response aydin et al 2003 ran their simulations with global vulnerability settings where all links were set to the same high low or intermediate values in general they found the direction of biological response to perturbations to be consistent but the magnitude of response was higher under the high vulnerability settings i e top down control although we did not use a global vulnerability setting for all groups we did observe instances where relatively high vulnerabilities led to rapid high amplitude oscillations for some linked groups this indicates that links characterized by top down control may be more sensitive to perturbations or additional stressors and their response to stressors may be more pronounced gaichas et al 2012 used ecosense to evaluate the robustness of their ewe model of the gulf of alaska to uncertainty in the functional response under scenarios of varying fishing pressure they found the outcomes of their simulations to be robust to functional response uncertainty at low to moderate levels of fishing pressure however scenarios with high levels of fishing pressure resulted in more frequent species extinctions and there were less successful parameter sets their results highlight the need to explore a wide range of functional response parameter space as there is not likely to be a single best combination and those combinations that are successful may vary subject to the additional pressures experienced by the ecosystem ruzicka et al 2013a and ruzicka et al 2013b also drew vulnerability parameters for each individual trophic link from the full range of parameter space drawing the functional response from the full effective range acknowledges the high level of uncertainty in these interactions and the importance of these interactions to population dynamics this is comparable to the approach we used in this study where we varied vulnerability over the full effective range for each trophic link individually in each generated ecosystem such wide explorations of parameter space for the functional response in combination with the draws of base model parameters addresses a key source of uncertainty in multispecies modelling as identified in the literature plagányi and butterworth 2004 fao 2008 gaichas et al 2012 link et al 2012 including that uncertainty in model results by providing a distribution of simulation outcomes provides an indication of how robust the results are to uncertainty in the functional response a key limitation of our study is the simplicity of the perturbations we employed increasing the mortality on one group at a time is a useful approach as a first step toward identifying key sensitivities in the food web but it is not representative of any realistic scenario likely to occur in nature or induced by anthropogenic activity additionally all our perturbations involved increasing mortality and we did not explore the potential impacts of increasing production or changes in primary production the metric of aggregated upper trophic level biomass which we used to track any ecosystem disruption is an admittedly simple and coarse metric which alone does not carry a clear ecological interpretation we used this metric here only as a means to detect a relatively large scale food web response to the prescribed perturbations and it is not used to provide a theoretical interpretation of any unique food web response to perturbations we sought only to identify functional groups to which the food web models demonstrated sensitivity it is not likely that any disturbance to an ecosystem will only affect a single species in isolation there will likely be synergistic effects from multiple stressors acting on an ecosystem at any given point in time for example in the pacific arctic sea ice coverage and the duration of the ice covered season is expected to continue to be reduced in the future wang and overland 2015 changes to sea ice phenology can have bottom up effects on the food web by affecting the timing magnitude and nature of primary production ji et al 2013 changes to primary production will also effect the synchronized life history events of pelagic secondary producers edwards and richardson 2004 søreide et al 2010 leu et al 2011 daase et al 2013 and the delivery of organic matter to support the benthic food web north et al 2014 grebmeier et al 2015 lovvorn et al 2015 climate change and increasing water temperatures can effect species growth bioenergetics and impact the spatial distribution of predators and prey changing species composition and altering trophic dynamics convening subject matter experts in a workshop setting to outline detailed scenarios for predicted or potential disturbances could produce the detailed framework necessary for simulations with ecosense that would provide valuable guidance for resource managers in the face of simultaneous stressors to ecosystem structure and function and competing societal goals we used a data pedigree with corresponding confidence intervals to describe uncertainty in model parameters by drawing parameters from uniform distributions except diet composition dirichlet distribution centered on initial parameter estimates this simplified approach standardized the generation of parameters across all functional groups for simulations and analyses however this approach can potentially increase uncertainty in parameter estimates and even model outputs by not utilizing all available information on a parameters statistical properties such as distribution shape and standard deviation regan et al 2002 if a particular probability distribution is desired for one of the ewe parameters generated in the ecosense routine it can be specified by the user in the ecosense code additionally some life history parameters are thought to be correlated charnov et al 1991 and specific knowledge of some life history parameters may be used to predict other less known parameters thorson et al 2017 a next step for parameter generation will be to investigate how known life history parameters can be used to inform parameter draws for unknown parameters and how this may influence uncertainty and simulation results the three ewe models compared in this study exist across a near continuous latitudinal gradient in the northeast pacific ocean and as adjacent systems they share many taxa and are connected via oceanographic linkages while it is preferable for all parameters in a food web model to be system specific it is not practical as the data and rates required to support those parameters do not often exist particularly for non commercial and other less studied species when direct parameter estimates are unavailable they can be obtained from the literature including other food web models and preference is often given to parameter estimates for species with a close taxonomic relationship and or parameter estimates derived from studies in nearby ecosystems such is the case with the three food web models used in this study while parameters estimated specifically for each ecosystem would be ideal as a practical matter this is not possible and there are a number of functional groups who share parameters that are common to all three of the ecosystems in this study or are shared between two of the systems there are nine functional groups that have the same base p b and q b across all three food web models including gray whales shrimps and copepods additionally there are another 18 functional groups that have the same base p b and q b between the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska these common parameters could contribute to similar dynamics between the compared systems or potentially obscure differences that may be apparent with ecosystem specific parameters should those true parameters ultimately have different values despite the common parameters there are a large number of structural and functional differences between these food webs and we have observed a number of distinctions between the simulation results across the three systems we have demonstrated here how uncertainty in ecopath model parameters and the predator prey functional response can be incorporated into scenario based simulations with ecosim using the rpath package the inclusion of parameter uncertainty in the simulation framework helps to convey the range of possible outcomes from the modeled perturbations and can help prevent overconfidence in simulation results with a single model the ecosense routine allows for the inclusion of uncertainty and can help to identify key sensitivities in food webs and highlight direct and indirect effects of disturbances mediated by trophic interactions adequate characterization of uncertainty in model results improves communication of the strength and direction of modelled results and will help models to support marine ebm although the simulations presented here are simple examples rpath with ecosense could be used by fisheries scientists and resource managers to explore a range of possible outcomes to simulations of detailed policy options or for

24845,ecosystem modelling is a useful tool for exploring the potential outcomes of policy options and conducting experiments that would otherwise be impractical in the real world however ecosystem models have been limited in their ability to engage in the management of living marine resources due in part to high levels of uncertainty in model parameters and model outputs additionally for multispecies or food web models there is uncertainty about the predator prey functional response which can have implications for population dynamics in this study we evaluate the sensitivity of large marine food webs in alaska to parameter uncertainty including parameters that govern the predator prey functional response we use rpath an r implementation of the food web modeling program ecopath with ecosim ewe to conduct a series of mortality based perturbations to examine the sensitivity and recovery time of higher trophic level groups in the eastern chukchi sea eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska we use a monte carlo approach to generate thousands of plausible ecosystems by drawing parameter sets from the range of uncertainty around the base model parameters we subjected the ecosystem ensembles to a series of mortality based perturbations to identify which functional groups the higher trophic level groups are most sensitive to when their mortality was increased whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation and how long it took to return to that state in all three ecosystems we found that the number of disrupted ensemble food webs was positively related to the biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed functional group and negatively related to trophic level the eastern chukchi sea was most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups the eastern bering sea was most sensitive to shrimp and walleye pollock and the gulf of alaska was most sensitive to shrimps pelagic forage fish and zooplankton recovery time to perturbations were generally less than 5 years in all three ecosystems the recovery times when fish groups were perturbed were generally longer than when benthic invertebrates were perturbed and recovery times were shortest when it was pelagic invertebrates the single model ensemble approach produced simulation results that described a range of possible outcomes to the prescribed perturbations and provided a sense for how robust the results are to parameter uncertainty keywords rpath ecosim food web chukchi sea bering sea gulf of alaska 1 introduction in recent decades the incorporation of ecosystem considerations into the management of living marine resources has been undertaken to varying degrees in several jurisdictions and large marine ecosystems fao 2003 pitcher et al 2009 national ocean council 2013 to consider the broader ecosystem effects of marine resource management actions it is necessary to make decisions between policy options based on predicted or expected outcomes and to consider tradeoffs among competing interests walters and martell 2004 link 2010 thus ecosystem modelling of possible outcomes to policy actions or inaction are required to explore potential future ecosystem states that may result from management decisions walters and martell 2004 hollowed et al 2011 lehuta et al 2016 modelling in its many forms is integral to the management of living marine resources and to the implementation of an ecosystem based approach to management plagányi 2007 coll and libralato 2012 fogarty 2014 busch et al 2016 national marine fisheries service 2016 models can be qualitative or quantitative and can be used to enhance general ecosystem understanding or to inform strategic guidance and tactical management decisions hollowed et al 2000 plagányi 2007 harvey et al 2016 additionally experiments can be conducted with models that would otherwise be impractical in the real world permitting the exploration of policy options climate effects or other anticipated stressors and help to discern important ecological thresholds and tradeoffs a major impediment to the adoption and use of ecosystem models in ecosystem based management ebm is addressing uncertainty in models and their outputs in a satisfactory manner murawski 2007 link et al 2012 patrick and link 2015 there are a wide range of ecosystem models with differing levels of complexity from multispecies and models of intermediate complexity mice plaganyi et al 2014 to models of whole food webs bio economic models and end to end bio physical models there is a tradeoff between increasing the realism and complexity of a model and a commensurate increase in the overall uncertainty associated with the model collie et al 2016 this has led to a concern among some scientists and stakeholders that some ecosystem models are too complex and too ambitious in the scope and scale of the processes they are attempting to represent that these models require more data and information than we possess or could ever attain and therefore their outputs are of little value beckage et al 2011 ruiz and kuikka 2012 planque 2016 thus it is critically important for models intended to support ebm to be candid about uncertainty and to provide accurate accounts of the sources and degree of uncertainty in a model and its parameters and to characterize that uncertainty in model results link et al 2012 several modeling studies and workshops have attempted to address concerns about uncertainty and have assembled lists of best practices for modelling in support of marine ebm e g fao 2008 townsend et al 2008 link et al 2010 kaplan and marshall 2016 these comprehensive lists of best practices are often applicable to a broad range of ecosystem models and do not necessarily target one model type or specific model framework a common entry to these best practices is a call for explicit characterization of uncertainty in model inputs and parameters and to carry this uncertainty through the modelling or simulation process to indicate the uncertainty in model outputs including the uncertainty in simulation results helps to avoid a false sense of certainty in model outcomes and can help to communicate the strength of results to managers and stakeholders another recommended best practice for multispecies ecological models is to consider the importance of the predator prey functional response to biomass dynamics and to evaluate the robustness of model results to alternative forms of this response fao 2008 the specific form of the predator prey functional response is generally not well known for any particular trophic relationship however it can have a profound impact on biomass dynamics mackinson et al 2003 gaichas et al 2011 gaichas et al 2012 in this study we focus our attention on the treatment of parameter uncertainty in the widely used marine food web modelling framework ecopath with ecosim ewe ecopath org christensen and walters 2004 we employ a simplified bayesian synthesis routine givens et al 1993 for ewe that addresses the aforementioned best practices by including uncertainty in the predator prey functional response for each trophic interaction incorporating uncertainty into model simulations for all of the base model parameters and capturing the effect of that parameter uncertainty in model outputs we use a single model ensemble approach gal et al 2014 to generate multiple versions of the same ewe model by allowing the base model parameters and the predator prey functional response to vary within a prescribed range based on a data pedigree we then perform simulations on the ensemble of generated models to produce a range of outcomes to the simulated scenarios and examine the robustness of model outcomes to parameter uncertainty the static mass balance model ecopath was originally developed by polovina 1984 to produce estimates of biomass and production for species and functional groups in a coral reef ecosystem in the french frigate shoals the program has since had the time dynamic modeling framework ecosim walters et al 1997 added which allows for simulations hypothesis testing and policy exploration since its introduction more than 400 unique ewe models have been developed describing freshwater and marine ecosystems from the tropics to polar regions colléter et al 2015 there have been several efforts to address input parameter sensitivity and uncertainty in ewe models previous versions of ewe contained a monte carlo routine called ecoranger which used a data pedigree and corresponding confidence intervals to generate an ensemble of static ecopath models to explore model sensitivity to uncertain parameter estimates recently steenbeek et al 2018 has developed the ecosampler module for the ewe program which also uses a monte carlo routine and data pedigree to generate ensembles of balanced ecopath models which can be passed to ecosim ecospace or other ewe plug ins for further analysis other routines for generating ecopath model ensembles have been developed independent of ewe and implemented in matlab kearney 2017 and r koehn et al 2016 aydin et al 2005 developed a similar routine called ecosense for generating ensembles of ecosim parameters from a single ecopath model in the c environment enabling dynamic simulations with all ensemble members aydin et al 2003 gaichas et al 2015 with ecosense the user can vary the base model parameters diet compositions non predation natural mortality and the parameters governing the predator prey functional response gaichas et al 2012 for this study we use the ecosense routine to generate ewe model ensembles but have adapted the routine to work with a prototype of an independent version of ewe called rpath lucey et al 2020 which was developed to work with the open source statistical program r r core team 2015 rpath uses the same equations and algorithms of ewe but has the advantages of improved access to the model code and the flexibility to modify the code for user defined analyses and simulations in this study we execute a series of time dynamic simulations with ewe model ensembles of three distinct marine ecosystems in alaska the eastern chukchi sea the eastern bering sea and the gulf of alaska to investigate the sensitivity of higher trophic level groups to mortality based perturbations a perturbation analysis is a useful way to gain insight into population dynamics and how species interact with each other in a food web mediated by their trophic interactions bender et al 1984 schmitz 1997 using a comparative approach can help highlight results that distinguish one ecosystem from the others features that might otherwise go unnoticed megrey et al 2009 we attempt to identify which functional groups the higher trophic levels are most sensitive to when their mortality is increased whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation and how long it took to return to that state by incorporating the uncertainty in the base ecopath model parameters the predator prey functional response and using an ensemble approach we are able to characterize uncertainty in ecosim results by describing the range of possible outcomes among ensemble members additionally we look for correlations between the number of disrupted ensemble food webs and the trophic level biomass and number of trophic links of the perturbed group 2 methods 2 1 modeling framework we use existing trophic mass balance food web models of the eastern chukchi sea whitehouse and aydin 2016 eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska aydin et al 2007 that were developed using the ewe framework ecopath is a biomass compartment model where each compartment represents a species or functional group of multiple species and describes the network of energy flows between groups in a food web ecopath is a static mass balanced model and it provides a spatially homogeneous snapshot of the trophic structure and function of an ecosystem the mass balance requirement ensures there is sufficient production in any compartment to meet the modeled demand from predators or any fishery removals the interactions between species in a food web are described by ecopath with a set of linear equations for each group i with predator j as 1 b i p b i e e i c i b a i j b j q b j d c i j where b is biomass t km 2 p b yr 1 is the production to biomass ratio q b yr 1 is the consumption to biomass ratio dcij is the proportion of prey i in the diet of predator j ba is a biomass accumulation term c is subsistence harvest or fisheries catch t km 2 and ee is ecotrophic efficiency which is the proportion of production bi p b i that is consumed by predators and removed by harvests fisheries included in the model mass balance is achieved when the system of linear equations is solved for one missing parameter for each functional group a diet matrix dci and bai term if bai 0 must be entered by the user and typically estimates for b p b q b are c are also provided by the user and the equation s solved for ee values of ee range from 0 to 1 and are close to one for groups subject to heavy predation and or fishing pressure and it is close to zero for groups that experience little predation and or fishing pressure christensen et al 2005 often initial attempts to balance a model are unsuccessful and several functional groups may be out of balance ee 1 indicating they are being consumed and or removed at a rate greater than their production this is often the result of an incompatible set of model inputs e g predator consumption in excess of prey production or due to an error in the model e g misplaced decimal when parameters are determined to be incompatible they will need to be reconciled to bring the model into balance this can involve recalculating or manually adjusting a parameter based on new information selecting an alternative parameter from the literature or using ecopath to solve for the parameter in question by fixing ee and solving for the suspect parameter a data pedigree see section 2 3 incorporating parameter uncertainty can be used to determine which parameters have the greatest uncertainty and should be considered first for adjustment the models used in the current study are already balanced and no additional modifications were required ecosim is the time dynamic counterpart of ecopath and provides the user with the ability to conduct simulations and to test hypotheses on the entire food web walters et al 1997 in ecosim the system of ecopath mass balance equations are converted to a set of differential equations describing the biomass dynamics of functional groups linked together through their trophic interactions and predator prey functional responses the biomass dynamics of each functional group is modeled as 2 d b i d t g e i p r e y q b i b p r e y f i b i m 0 i b i p r e d q b p r e d b i where ge is the growth efficiency and is equal to the production rate p b divided by the consumption rate q b q is consumption t km 1 yr 1 f is the fishing exploitation rate yr 1 and m0 is other mortality yr 1 not explicitly represented in the model m0i is equal to 1 eei and includes mortality sources such as disease senescence starvation or outmigration the terms q bi bj represent the functional response equations the strength of predator prey interactions can have a strong impact on biomass dynamics and the shape of the functional response can be different for each trophic link in the food web ecosim employs a foraging arena model to represent the functional response of groups to changing biomass and consumption walters et al 1997 ahrens et al 2012 the foraging arena model assumes that at any given time only a proportion of the prey population is vulnerable to a predator following aydin 2004 the predator prey functional response is expressed as 3 q b p r e d p r e d p r e y t q b p r e d x p r e d p r e y d c p r e d p r e y b p r e y t b p r e y x p r e d p r e y 1 b p r e d t b p r e d where q b is the predator q b from the base ecopath starting point dc is the proportion of the prey in the predator s diet at the starting point bpred t and bprey t are the biomasses of the predator and prey at time t b pred and b prey are the predator and prey biomasses at the starting point and x predprey is the vulnerability parameter which describes the rate of prey movement between vulnerable and invulnerable states low prey vulnerabilities are associated with bottom up effects where increasing the predator population does not necessarily have measurable impact on the prey population high vulnerabilities are consistent with top down effects where vulnerable prey populations are more severely impacted by fluctuations in predator abundance in theory the vulnerability parameter ranges from one to and is centered on two the effective range of x predprey is from 1 01 to 91 gaichas et al 2012 and the default value in ewe is two 2 2 the food web models and system descriptions 2 2 1 eastern chukchi sea the eastern chukchi sea is a broad and shallow continental shelf ecosystem off the coast of northwest alaska figure 1 with most depths less than 60 m jakobsson 2002 the chukchi sea is connected to the pacific ocean through the bering strait at its southern edge there is a net northward flow of water through bering strait and across the continental shelf although seasonal and episodic variation can affect the direction and magnitude of flow coachman and aagaard 1981 woodgate et al 2012 danielson et al 2014 the chukchi sea is subject to polar night and is seasonally covered by sea ice primary production in the spring begins with production from ice algae within and along the underside of sea ice cota and smith 1991 horner et al 1992 and large pelagic blooms have recently been observed in the water column beneath the ice arrigo et al 2014 waters flowing into the chukchi sea through bering strait during the ice free season can be rich with nutrients and fuels areas of intense productivity in the southern chukchi sea sambrotto et al 1984 springer and mcroy 1993 only a limited portion of the annual primary production is consumed by zooplankton cooney and coyle 1982 coyle and cooney 1988 campbell et al 2009 and much of it sinks to the seafloor and supports an abundant benthic community grebmeier et al 2015 currently there are no industrial scale commercial fisheries in the us territorial waters of the eastern chukchi sea npfmc 2009 however there are subsistence fisheries and harvests of marine mammals craig 1987 hovelsrud et al 2008 fall et al 2011 the eastern chukchi sea food web model covers an area of 192 000 km2 in the eastern portion of the chukchi sea within us territorial waters there was no ecosystem basis for modeling only the eastern half of the chukchi sea this decision was based on the availability of data whitehouse et al 2014 2 2 2 eastern bering sea the eastern bering sea is a broad continental shelf ecosystem encompassing an area of 495 000 km2 the modelled area extends from unimak pass and bristol bay northwestward to about 61 n aydin et al 2007 figure 1 the major inputs of water to the continental shelf are through unimak pass in the south advection through canyons along the continental slope to the west and seasonal freshwater input from river drainage stabeno et al 2016b portions of the southeastern bering sea continental shelf are seasonally covered by sea ice which moves in from the northern bering sea in late winter a cold pool of water 2 c remains over the shelf following the retreat of sea ice in the spring the extent of which varies from year to year with the extent of sea ice coverage sullivan et al 2014 the size and location of the cold pool has important implications for species distribution and community composition at multiple trophic levels mueter and litzow 2008 stevenson and lauth 2012 eisner et al 2018 and for recruitment of commercially important fishes hunt et al 2011 duffy anderson et al 2016 the eastern bering sea has several productive commercial fisheries including fisheries for species of gadids flatfishes and crabs npfmc 2011 2017a fisheries are executed with multiple gear types including trawls longlines and pots the walleye pollock gadus chalcogrammus hereafter referred to as pollock fishery is one of the largest single species fisheries in the world with average catches of 1 2 million t per year since the 1970s ianelli et al 2017 2 2 3 gulf of alaska the gulf of alaska is located in the northeast pacific and has a continental shelf of varying width that stretches along the alaska coast from the us canada border then north and west around the margin of the gulf to the aleutian islands at its western end figure 1 the gulf of alaska model encompasses the continental shelf waters of the gulf of alaska from 140 w to 170 w a total area of 291 840 km2 aydin et al 2007 gaichas et al 2010 the continental shelf is detailed with islands and bays and the continental slope has many gullies carved into its margins the net circulation in the gulf is in the counterclockwise direction productivity in the gulf is influenced by the development of eddies gap winds between mountains along the coast upwelling and freshwater runoff from the coast ladd and cheng 2016 ladd et al 2016 stabeno et al 2016a the community composition and relative species abundance on a multi year timescale is influenced by large scale climate drivers such as the el niño southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 hollowed et al 2001 a regime shift in community organization was observed in the mid 1970s and coincided with a shift in the pdo from a negative phase cooler sst to a positive phase warmer sst mantua et al 1997 prior to the regime shift the community composition was dominated by shrimp and capelin afterwards groundfish including gadids and flatfish became increasingly abundant while the relative abundance of shrimp and capelin decreased anderson and piatt 1999 historically the gulf of alaska hosted several commercially valuable crab fisheries that peaked in ex vessel value in the early 1980s then catch for crabs declined rapidly to less than 20 of their maximum with most crab fisheries closed by the mid 1980s orensanz et al 1998 currently the gulf of alaska has several productive finfish fisheries including pollock pacific cod gadus macrocephalus sablefish anoplopoma fimbria flatfish pleuronectidae and rockfish sebastidae npfmc 2017b 2 2 4 functional groups the three ewe models used in this analysis originally had different numbers of functional groups with 149 in the eastern bering sea 138 in the gulf of alaska and 67 in the eastern chukchi sea differences in the level of trophic aggregation can make comparisons between models difficult to interpret pinnegar et al 2005 to make the models more comparable a minimum amount of aggregation prior to conducting simulations was necessary however we also need to balance this with maintaining some of the functional groups or species of heightened interest in each food web e g commercially important species protected species keystone species the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models had finer levels of taxonomic resolution among several categories including fishes zooplankton and marine mammals to make these groups more comparable across all three models species specific groups were consolidated to a common functional group for example capelin mallotus villosus pacific herring clupea pallasi and other functional groups of primarily pelagic forage fish were combined into a single pelagic forage fish group in each model the biomasses and fisheries catch of functional groups aggregated into a single group were summed together the p b q b and dc for the aggregated groups were weighted by the biomass of the constituent groups the total number of functional groups in the aggregated models are 54 in the eastern bering sea 50 in the gulf of alaska and 53 in the eastern chukchi sea table 1 forty six of the groups are common to all three models the polar bear ursus maritimus arctic cod and basket star gorgonocephalus sp groups are unique to the eastern chukchi sea model the bowhead whale pacific walrus bearded seal wintering seals and snow crab groups are only present in the eastern bering sea and eastern chukchi sea models other baleen whales other pinnipeds sharks and the squids group are only present in the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models because the use of functional group names in the text can be confusing from here on when referring to a functional group from one of the models the name will be italicized the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models included more fishing groups detrital compartments and sources of primary production than the eastern chukchi sea model the primary production and detritus groups in the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska models were aggregated to match the number of respective groups in the eastern chukchi sea model one primary production and two detrital compartments because we are not exploring fishery policy options in this study we have aggregated all fisheries subsistence harvests to a single compartment in each model 2 3 incorporating parameter uncertainty the precision of parameter estimates across functional groups is usually uneven and in many cases the uncertainty is high we incorporate parameter uncertainty into our simulations with a monte carlo routine used to generate entire sets of food web model ewe parameters based on the ecosense routine of aydin et al 2005 the ecosense routine generates entire sets of ecosim food web parameters randomly drawn from prior distributions based on a data pedigree all model parameters and or data were graded for quality using a data pedigree described by christensen et al 2005 with specific definitions from aydin et al 2007 model parameters and data were assigned a data pedigree based upon the data source collection methodology temporal and spatial coverage of the dataset and taxonomic relevance table 2 complete explanations of data pedigree values for the base ecopath models used in this study can be found in the model s source documentation aydin et al 2007 whitehouse and aydin 2016 each data pedigree corresponds to a prescribed range as a proportion of the point estimate coefficient of variation cv intended to characterize parameter uncertainty ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 table 3 parameters for b p b and q b were drawn from uniform distributions centered on the base ecopath model parameter estimates with the specified cvs m0 is selected from a uniform distribution centered on the base ecopath value using the respective species p b cv m0 is normally set by ecopath during initial model balancing as 1 minus ee by selecting m0 independently the ecosystem begins away from equilibrium the dc of a predator consists of proportions for each prey type and must sum to one therefore the drawing of random diet proportions was treated differently than the other base parameters diet composition in terms of the presence or absence of a trophic link does not vary in the ecosense routine diet proportions for each prey item in a predator s diet were drawn from a dirichlet distribution and not allowed to be equal to zero while fishery catch c is not directly drawn in the ecosense routine the observed catch will vary between drawn ecosystems due to differences in the drawn starting biomass values and the subsequent effect on catch in rpath the catch of a group can be regulated by effort e fishing mortality f or by manually entering catch cinput the catch of a functional group i is calculated as 4 c t i g q i g e t g f t i b i c t i i n p u t where cti is the catch of group i at time t g is gear type qi is a catchability coefficient of group i with gear g and is equal to the ratio of the ecopath base catch for group i with gear g to the starting biomass of group i etg is the effort at time t for gear g and is either zero or one ftibi is the f at time t multiplied by biomass b for group i and cinput is catch that is manually entered by default rpath calculates the catch of functional groups by effort e 1 with q equal to the quotient of the ecopath catch and the starting biomass the f and cinput terms are set to zero by default to instead fish by f rate e can be set equal to zero and a value entered for f that can vary by time step if desired similarly specific catch values can be entered for cinput if desired and e and f set to zero below in section 2 4 we utilize the f term in this equation to increase mortality during simulations the results of ecosim simulations have been shown to be sensitive to predator prey functional responses and use of the ecosim default vulnerability x predprey 2 for all trophic links is not recommended plagányi and butterworth 2004 gaichas et al 2011 gaichas et al 2012 following the methods of gaichas et al 2012 we vary vulnerability for each trophic link with random draws over the effective range of vulnerability 1 01 to 91 centered on the default value of two 4 x p r e d p r e y 1 e x p 9 u n i f o r m 0 1 0 5 there are additional functional response parameters in ecosim including prey handling time foraging time and prey switching rate we held these additional functional response parameters at their default values the generated ecosim parameter sets are not necessarily starting from a stable or equilibrium like state we ran the generated ecosystems forward for a 50 year burn in period during which any numerically unstable configurations were eliminated according to pre specified criteria if during this initial 50 year run a functional group dies out bi decreases to 1 1000 of starting bi or grows without limit bi increases to 1000 times starting bi that entire ecosystem is considered to have failed and that ecosim parameter set is not retained for further analysis aydin et al 2005 gaichas et al 2015 this typically happens because of thermodynamically inconsistent parameter draws for example parameter draws with exceptionally high predator biomass and high consumption rates in an ecosystem with low prey biomass and low prey production incapable of supporting the randomly drawn predator parameters such failed ecosystems tend to crash during the first few years of the burn in period and 50 years is generally sufficient to eliminate all such thermodynamically inconsistent systems ecosystem parameter sets that do not crash during burn in are retained for further analyses the uncertainty in the model parameters combined with the thermodynamic constraints of the mass balance framework and the burn in period of the ecosense routine is sufficiently restrictive to eliminate more than 90 of the generated food web parameter sets gaichas et al 2015 used ecosense and the same rejection criteria and rejected 98 of generated ecosystems using the same criteria rejection rates will vary across studies due to inherent differences in the ecosystems modeled the data pedigree and other study specific differences in model design for this study we retained a minimum of 500 plausible ecosystem parameter sets for each of the three modeled ecosystems in the eastern chukchi sea we generated 5 000 ecosystem parameter sets and retained 511 ecosystems for the eastern bering sea 9 500 parameter sets were generated and 505 survived the burn in period with no crashes in the gulf of alaska we generated 12 000 food web parameter sets in order to find 553 that were numerically stable enough to survive burn in the csv files required to operate rpath with all three aggregated ecosystem models used in this study are available in the supplementary material additionally an r file with the ecosense parameter generation function is included in the supplementary material the rpath package can be downloaded from https github com noaa edab rpath this version of ecosense presented here was developed to work with a prototype version of the rpath package lucey et al 2020 ecosense will be included in a future release of rpath and we anticipate refinements to the ecosense code will be necessary in order for it to be formally included within the rpath package 2 4 mortality based perturbations to examine the sensitivity of upper trophic level groups to mortality based perturbations we first ran each retained model forward for a 50 year run in ecosim without any perturbation this created a 50 year simulated baseline from which we would be able to compare the perturbation results against for each unique ecosystem configuration we conducted mortality based perturbations by increasing the total mortality 50 for each living functional group in the food web excluding primary production and microbes one at a time and holding that increased mortality rate in place for the first 10 years of a 50 year simulation under equilibrium conditions p b is assumed to be equal to the instantaneous mortality rate z allen 1971 total mortality was increased in our simulations by setting the f rate in equation four equal to half of the respective group s p b when the adjusted f is multiplied by the respective group s biomass the product is added to the existing catch by effort e already included in equation four and the functional group s biomass is reduced accordingly following year 10 the perturbed mortality rate was returned to the baseline level and the simulation allowed to run without any other perturbations for the remaining 40 years this meant that for the three ecosystems included in this analysis the number of simulations was equal to the number of living groups times the number of retained food web parameter sets this was equal to more than 24 000 simulations for each of the three ecosystems included in this analysis to identify and follow any disturbance to the food web that resulted from a perturbation we tracked the aggregated biomass of upper trophic level groups this is the sum of biomass for all groups with a trophic level tl of 2 6 or higher excluding fisheries the eastern chukchi sea eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska had 36 35 and 31 functional groups with tl of 2 6 or higher respectively this division at trophic level 2 6 effectively separated predators from those that primarily preyed directly on basal resources the diet compositions of groups with tl 2 6 all consist of at least 50 from detritus and or primary production these lower trophic level consumers were mostly benthic invertebrate groups also zooplankton and microbes if the upper tl biomass deviated more than 10 from the baseline trajectory during a simulation that ecosystem was considered to have been disrupted by the perturbation for each perturbation we kept track of the number of ecosystems that were disrupted by that perturbation when an ecosystem was disrupted we measured the recovery time of the food web as the time it took for upper tl biomass to return to within 10 of its baseline trajectory we additionally kept track of and enumerated instances where ecosystems did not return to their baseline trajectory for upper tl biomass we also looked for underlying patterns in the simulation results and checked for correlations pearson product moment correlation ρ α 0 05 between the number of ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation and the trophic level log biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed group 3 results 3 1 eastern chukchi sea upper trophic levels in the eastern chukchi sea were most sensitive to mortality based perturbations of benthic invertebrate groups in general upper trophic level biomass was disrupted in more of the generated ecosystems by perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups than perturbations to other functional groups figure 2 a in particular the food webs were most sensitive to perturbations of the brittle stars bivalves shrimps and polychaete worm functional groups each of these four groups disrupted approximately 20 of the generated ecosystems perturbations to fish groups generally disrupted upper trophic level biomass in less systems than the benthic invertebrate groups the miscellaneous shallow fish eelpouts large mouth flatfish and other sculpins were the most disruptive fish groups each disrupting between 5 and 7 of the generated ecosystems pelagic invertebrate groups when perturbed were less disruptive each affecting less than 2 3 of ecosystems perturbations to marine mammal and seabird groups did not disrupt any of the ecosystems the median recovery times of the generated eastern chukchi sea food webs to all of the perturbations were less than 10 years and most less than five figure 2b the highest median recovery times were for perturbations to small mouth flatfish 9 9 the urchins dollars and cucumbers group 8 9 and large mouth flatfish 5 7 the range of recovery times for benthic invertebrate perturbations were generally narrow exceptions were for the urchins dollars cucumbers group and brittle stars the range of recovery times for the fish groups were generally wider than the benthic invertebrate groups the median recovery times for perturbations of pelagic invertebrate groups were all less than 1 5 years in all of the simulations n 24 017 with the eastern chukchi sea food web there were two instances where upper trophic level biomass was disrupted by a perturbation and it did not return to within 10 of its baseline trajectory there was no indication from the relative biomass trajectories of functional groups that either ecosystem had shifted to an alternative stable state following the perturbation in one instance the perturbed group itself accounted for a disproportionate share of upper trophic level biomass and in combination with a p b that was much lower than the base ecopath p b for that group led to a slow recovery following the perturbation figures s1 and s2 in the second instance some strong predator prey functional responses i e high vulnerabilities produced an unrealistic high amplitude rapid oscillation of upper trophic level biomass that rendered this system impossible further details on these outliers are available in the supplementary material 3 2 eastern bering sea the perturbation that was most disruptive to upper trophic level biomass in the eastern bering sea was shrimps when shrimps were perturbed 23 4 of the generated ecosystems were disrupted figure 2c the next most disruptive group was pollock which disrupted 11 3 of the systems other disruptive groups included pelagic forage fish 9 9 small mouth flatfish 9 3 and bivalves 8 7 perturbations to copepods and other zooplankton were also disruptive to upper trophic level biomass in 8 1 and 7 7 of systems respectively with the exception of other baleen whales the generated ecosystems were insensitive to perturbations of marine mammal and seabird groups one generated ecosystem was disrupted by the perturbation to other baleen whales the median recovery time of the generated ecosystems to perturbations were all less than seven years and most less than four with the exception of the perturbation to other baleen whales figure 2d the single ecosystem where upper trophic level biomass was disrupted by the perturbation to other baleen whales took 34 3 years to recover from the perturbation the next highest median recovery time was for miscellaneous shallow fish 6 6 years large mouth flatfish 5 3 years and miscellaneous crustaceans 4 3 years in general the range of recovery times for all the perturbations were relatively narrow in all the simulations n 24 240 with the eastern bering sea food web there were four occasions where upper trophic level biomass did not return to within 10 of the baseline trajectory following a perturbation in the first instance the perturbed group represented the majority of upper trophic level biomass and in combination with a p b that is much lower than the base ecopath p b for this group prevented a recovery by the simulation s end in the second food web most groups were already experiencing a gradual monotonic decline in biomass the perturbed group expedited this decline in biomass reducing upper trophic level biomass well below the 10 threshold and preventing a return to within the 10 threshold by the end of the simulation figure s5 in a third case high vulnerabilities led to high amplitude low frequency oscillations that prevented upper trophic level biomass from stabilizing within the 10 threshold by the end of the simulation figures s6 and s7 in the fourth instance high vulnerabilities led to high amplitude high frequency oscillations that were completely unrealistic further details on these outliers are available in the supplementary material 3 3 gulf of alaska similar to the eastern bering sea perturbations to shrimps were the most disruptive to upper trophic level biomass in the gulf of alaska food webs affecting 30 6 of the generated ecosystems figure 2e the gulf of alaska food webs were also sensitive to perturbations of pelagic oriented groups including pelagic forage fish 14 8 other zooplankton 14 3 and copepods 7 2 perturbations to most of the remaining fish groups produced some level of disruption in upper trophic level biomass ranging from 0 2 to 8 of the generated ecosystems among benthic invertebrates perturbations to bivalves 8 7 and snails 7 1 were most disruptive to upper trophic level biomass perturbations to marine mammals and seabirds did not disrupt upper trophic level biomass in any of the generated ecosystems among the functional groups whose perturbations disrupted upper trophic level biomass the median recovery time of the food web once the perturbation ended was less than 5 years for all groups except miscellaneous shallow fish which had a median return time of 9 5 years figure 2f perturbations to shrimps pelagic forage fish and other zooplankton disrupted the most generated ecosystems but all three have median return times of less than 2 years eight of the 10 longest median return times belong to fish groups of the simulations with the gulf of alaska food web n 24 332 there were two instances where upper trophic level biomass did not return to within 10 of the baseline trajectory and in both cases the perturbed group was miscellaneous shallow fish in both of these generated ecosystems miscellaneous shallow fish accounted for sizeable portions of upper trophic level biomass at 64 and 16 it is their loss in biomass that explains the overall loss in upper trophic level biomass in both systems upper trophic level biomass slowly increases in both systems following the end of the perturbation but does not increase fast enough to return to the baseline trajectory by the end of the simulation upper trophic level biomass was 17 and 16 below the baseline value at the conclusion of the two simulations 3 4 correlation with disrupted ecosystems we tested for correlations between the percentage of ecosystems where upper trophic level biomass was disrupted and properties of the functional groups being perturbed including log biomass trophic level and the number of trophic links log biomass was positively correlated with the percentage of disrupted food webs and was the most strongly correlated of the three variables in all three ecosystems p 0 05 table 4 trophic level of the perturbed group was negatively correlated with the percentage of disrupted food webs in all three study systems but not significant in the gulf of alaska p 0 101 the total number of trophic links for a perturbed group had a significant p 0 05 positive correlation with the percentage of disrupted ecosystems for the eastern chukchi sea and eastern bering sea simulations but was not significant for the gulf of alaska simulations 4 discussion our analysis identified a number of key sensitivities of upper trophic level groups from a selection of marine ecosystems in alaska we found upper trophic levels in the eastern chukchi sea food web to be most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrates in the eastern bering sea upper trophic level groups were sensitive to perturbations of shrimp and pollock and in the gulf of alaska they were sensitive to perturbations of shrimp pelagic forage fish and zooplankton across ecosystems the median recovery times of upper trophic level biomass to most perturbations were less than 5 years and there were no indications of ecosystems flipping to alternate stable states in response to perturbations this indicates these modeled food webs were robust to the parameter uncertainty present and the simple first order perturbations conducted here the ecosense routine permitted a wide exploration of the parameter space around the vulnerability parameter of the functional response and the base model parameters this provided us with a range of outcomes to the specific perturbations and indicated the median recovery time and how robust the outcomes were to different parameter combinations these analyses also shed light on instances where combinations of parameter draws led to unsustainable biomass dynamics or systems that were unable to recover from perturbations however given the total number of simulations across all three ecosystems 72 000 such circumstances were extremely rare the mortality based perturbations of the eastern chukchi sea food web revealed that upper trophic levels in this ecosystem were generally more sensitive to perturbations of benthic invertebrate functional groups than to fishes pelagic invertebrates seabirds or marine mammals we found that the percentage of generated ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation was positively correlated with the perturbed group s biomass the number of trophic links and negatively correlated with their tl in general benthic invertebrate functional groups in the eastern chukchi sea model closely align with this profile as they are high biomass lower trophic level and have many trophic links in contrast the percentage of ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation in the gulf of alaska had a significant positive correlation with the perturbed group s biomass but did not have a significant correlation with the perturbed groups trophic level or the number of trophic links α 0 05 smith et al 2011 simulated fishing on lower trophic level groups with an ensemble of ecosystem models including ewe models and found that the relative abundance of the perturbed group and their level of connectance to the rest of the food web helped explain the response of other groups in the food web this is consistent with the positive correlations we observed between the number of food webs with disrupted upper trophic levels and the biomass and number of trophic links of the perturbed group system recovery times to perturbations were interpreted in this study as a measure of the stability of the model ecosystems that is their ability to endure a perturbation and to return to their baseline configuration following a perturbation holling 1973 pimm 1984 previous studies with ewe have also considered system recovery time in response to a perturbation as a measure of food web stability vasconcellos et al 1997 examined the stability of ewe models for 18 different ecosystems when key mid trophic level groups were perturbed they found that system recovery time was negatively correlated with finn s cycling index which provides a measure of energy flow that is recycled within the ecosystem finn 1976 they concluded that ecosystems with higher recycling had a greater capacity to return to starting conditions a study using ewe models to examine the trophic role of snappers lutjanidae in the gulf of mexico found that system recovery time was positively correlated with the maximum observed proportional change in biomass from a group during a simulation arreguin sanchez and manickchand heileman 1998 when the impact of a perturbation was the greatest in terms of biomass they observed longer system recovery times this is consistent with our observation that the number of disrupted food webs was positively related to the perturbed group s biomass other studies with ewe models have examined system recovery time under different global vulnerability settings where all vulnerabilities were set to low intermediate default or high values across multiple ecosystems and a range of perturbations system recovery time was lowest with low vulnerability settings higher at the intermediate default value and highest at high vulnerabilities ortiz and wolff 2002 ortiz 2010 rodriguez zaragoza et al 2016 hermosillo nunez et al 2018 although system recovery time could often not be evaluated at high vulnerabilities due to the emergence of chaotic oscillations ortiz et al 2009 ortiz et al 2013 caceres et al 2016 similarly we observed a few instances where high vulnerabilities resulted in oscillations preventing an estimation of recovery time the oscillations we observed may in part be due to the choice of using adams bashforth numerical integration for our simulations rpath also offers fourth order runge kutta numerical integration that integrates over finer time steps and may have better resolved rapid biomass dynamics reducing the appearance of oscillations recovery times to perturbations in all disrupted food webs in all three ecosystems were generally less than 5 years however the eastern chukchi sea had the slowest mean recovery time across all disrupted food webs at 4 7 years the mean recovery times in the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska were 3 1 and 3 4 years respectively this indicates that the eastern chukchi sea may be more vulnerable to mortality events or extractive activities than the other two ecosystems included in this study the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska are currently subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors including commercial fisheries shipping and tourism the eastern chukchi sea is not presently subject to commercial fisheries npfmc 2009 but improved access due to sea ice reduction has led to increasing ship traffic smith and stephenson 2013 huntington et al 2015 additionally recent observations of commercial species from the southeastern bering sea in the northern bering sea has prompted questions about what the potential ecosystem impacts could be for the northern bering sea and chukchi sea if sub arctic species from the southeastern bering sea expand their range northward and what the implications of such stock movement would be for fisheries and fisheries management stevenson and lauth 2019 modeling tools that incorporate uncertainty such as ecosense could be useful in the exploration of potential ecosystem impacts due to immigration of new species changing community composition and the exploration of fishery management strategies as an alternative to recovery time smith et al 2011 examined the impact of simulated fishing on lower trophic level groups by tracking the number of functional groups whose biomass deviated beyond a threshold in response to the intensity of fishing on the target species in contrast to recovery time this allowed them to quantify the level of disruption the fishing strategy caused in terms of how many groups in the food web experienced an adverse effect we did not take this approach in our current analysis but the approach of smith et al 2011 could be utilized with ecosense to examine which functional groups show consistent responses to perturbations or experimental fishing strategies this could be a particularly useful strategy if there are particular commercial or protected species that are believed to be especially vulnerable ecosense in its original c format has previously been used in a comparative framework to contrast the response of multiple ecosystems to the same set of pressures aydin et al 2003 examined the response of the eastern and western basins of the subarctic pacific to increasing primary production and the removal of selected prey and predator groups the removal of mid trophic level groups had direct effects on prey who often increased in abundance under the predatory release and select predators decreased who were particularly dependent on the removed group other groups who shared prey resources with the removed group often benefited from the removal of competitors and increased in abundance the direct effects observed by aydin et al 2003 are consistent with our observation that the number of ecosystems disrupted by a perturbation was positively correlated with the number of trophic links of the perturbed group and negatively correlated with trophic level aydin et al 2007 used ecosense to examine variation in predation mortality for important prey groups and the consequences of changing predator production across the eastern bering sea gulf of alaska and aleutian islands ecosystems although many taxa are shared across these ecosystems the uncertainty captured by the ecosense routine helped to identify key forage species that each food web was uniquely sensitive to these sensitivities were often the result of little data or structural differences in the food webs similarly in our study key sensitivities in our perturbation analysis generally reflected structural differences between the food webs examined and poor data pedigree scores the sensitivity of upper trophic levels in the eastern chukchi sea to benthic invertebrates reflects their structural dominance in this food web and in part uncertainties about their productivity and trophic relationships hunt et al 2013 whitehouse et al 2014 the sensitivity of the eastern bering sea to pollock reflects their structural dominance in the food web and their importance as both a predator and prey aydin and mueter 2007 the sensitivity of the gulf of alaska model to the pelagic forage fish and zooplankton groups reflects the greater balance between the pelagic and benthic energy pathways in this ecosystem and the prevalence of high trophic level predators such as arrowtooth flounder atheresthes stomias and pacific halibut hippoglossus stenolepis gaichas et al 2015 ruzicka et al 2013b used ecosense to investigate the food web impacts of doubling forage fish abundance in four large coastal marine ecosystems including the northern california current central gulf of alaska georges bank and the southwestern antarctic peninsula an important finding of their study was that the immediate short term response of selected seabird whales and pinnipeds to the perturbations was often dramatically different from their long term response in our study we did not directly contrast short term and long term response of individual groups but indirectly we looked at this in terms of the recovery time of disrupted food webs a key distinction between our study and that of ruzicka et al 2013b is that our perturbations ended after 10 years and theirs were maintained over their entire simulations we were concerned with the sensitivity of upper trophic levels and their recovery time while they examined short term and long term impacts from sustained pressures using the same four study ecosystems ruzicka et al 2013a examined the ecosystems response to increasing the abundance of selected marine mammal groups to their pre exploitation levels they found these perturbations to be of minimal impact which is consistent with our findings while our perturbations decreased marine mammal abundance rather than an increase the results were similar perturbing marine mammals produced only minor responses in the rest of the food web this is largely due to the relatively low biomass and low total consumption of these groups in the three models used in our study there is a greater level of disaggregation at higher trophic levels as opposed to lower trophic levels a consequence of this for upper trophic levels is that the individual groups have lower biomass and thus lower total consumption if higher trophic level groups were more aggregated they may have stronger top down effects on the food web additionally a study examining the sensitivity ewe food webs to varying levels of aggregation found that models that were highly aggregated at lower trophic levels were inherently more resistant to perturbations pinnegar et al 2005 gaichas et al 2015 used ecosense to compare the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska food webs and to examine how climate and fisheries interact with food web structure to produce different outcomes for the food webs in particular they examined the role of pollock and the combined effects of climate and pollock fisheries in these ecosystems a key feature of their ecosense simulation results is the higher level of variability in the gulf of alaska response to the same perturbations applied to the eastern bering sea this result has important implications to fisheries management as it suggests we may be less able to predict likely outcomes to anticipated stressors in the gulf of alaska as compared to the eastern bering sea gaichas et al 2015 in our study while we found both of these ecosystems to be sensitive to perturbations to pollock we found the range of recovery times to be much narrower and shorter in the eastern bering sea figure 2d than in the gulf of alaska figure 2f and consistent with the findings of gaichas et al 2015 we found the range of recovery times to perturbations in the gulf of alaska ensemble to be more than twice as wide as in the eastern bering sea ranging up to 10 years figure 2f however it should also be noted that while recovery times to pollock perturbations in the eastern bering sea were consistently shorter than in the gulf of alaska the percentage of ensemble ecosystems disrupted was nearly three times as high in the eastern bering sea 11 1 than in the gulf of alaska 3 8 this result highlights the structural importance of pollock to both ecosystems but emphasizes a greater level of stability in the eastern bering sea food web regarding the perturbations we applied to pollock other studies utilizing ecosense have focused on a single species or food web in a study investigating the production and growth of salmon in the northeast pacific aydin et al 2005 conducted a perturbation analysis with ecosense similar to what we did in the present study however instead of increasing mortality of each species in turn and examining the effect on upper trophic levels they increased the biomass of each species one at a time and looked at the effect this had on pink salmon oncorhynchus gorbuscha similar to our results they found bottom up effects from perturbing mid and lower trophic level species to be strongest while top down effects from perturbing higher trophic levels were difficult to detect aydin and mueter 2007 also conducted a perturbation analysis using ecosense during their examination of the dynamics of the eastern bering sea food web they decreased production of selected prey groups one at a time and examined their effect on the food web and in particular the effect on pollock they found pollock to be sensitive to reduced prey production they also observed that when pollock recruitment was reduced competitors of juvenile pollock benefitted from the competitive release and increased in their abundance this finding suggests that as long as there are other species filling a similar ecological role a significant loss in one species might not have much effect on the broader food web previous studies that used ecosense have taken different approaches to addressing uncertainty in the predator prey functional response aydin et al 2003 ran their simulations with global vulnerability settings where all links were set to the same high low or intermediate values in general they found the direction of biological response to perturbations to be consistent but the magnitude of response was higher under the high vulnerability settings i e top down control although we did not use a global vulnerability setting for all groups we did observe instances where relatively high vulnerabilities led to rapid high amplitude oscillations for some linked groups this indicates that links characterized by top down control may be more sensitive to perturbations or additional stressors and their response to stressors may be more pronounced gaichas et al 2012 used ecosense to evaluate the robustness of their ewe model of the gulf of alaska to uncertainty in the functional response under scenarios of varying fishing pressure they found the outcomes of their simulations to be robust to functional response uncertainty at low to moderate levels of fishing pressure however scenarios with high levels of fishing pressure resulted in more frequent species extinctions and there were less successful parameter sets their results highlight the need to explore a wide range of functional response parameter space as there is not likely to be a single best combination and those combinations that are successful may vary subject to the additional pressures experienced by the ecosystem ruzicka et al 2013a and ruzicka et al 2013b also drew vulnerability parameters for each individual trophic link from the full range of parameter space drawing the functional response from the full effective range acknowledges the high level of uncertainty in these interactions and the importance of these interactions to population dynamics this is comparable to the approach we used in this study where we varied vulnerability over the full effective range for each trophic link individually in each generated ecosystem such wide explorations of parameter space for the functional response in combination with the draws of base model parameters addresses a key source of uncertainty in multispecies modelling as identified in the literature plagányi and butterworth 2004 fao 2008 gaichas et al 2012 link et al 2012 including that uncertainty in model results by providing a distribution of simulation outcomes provides an indication of how robust the results are to uncertainty in the functional response a key limitation of our study is the simplicity of the perturbations we employed increasing the mortality on one group at a time is a useful approach as a first step toward identifying key sensitivities in the food web but it is not representative of any realistic scenario likely to occur in nature or induced by anthropogenic activity additionally all our perturbations involved increasing mortality and we did not explore the potential impacts of increasing production or changes in primary production the metric of aggregated upper trophic level biomass which we used to track any ecosystem disruption is an admittedly simple and coarse metric which alone does not carry a clear ecological interpretation we used this metric here only as a means to detect a relatively large scale food web response to the prescribed perturbations and it is not used to provide a theoretical interpretation of any unique food web response to perturbations we sought only to identify functional groups to which the food web models demonstrated sensitivity it is not likely that any disturbance to an ecosystem will only affect a single species in isolation there will likely be synergistic effects from multiple stressors acting on an ecosystem at any given point in time for example in the pacific arctic sea ice coverage and the duration of the ice covered season is expected to continue to be reduced in the future wang and overland 2015 changes to sea ice phenology can have bottom up effects on the food web by affecting the timing magnitude and nature of primary production ji et al 2013 changes to primary production will also effect the synchronized life history events of pelagic secondary producers edwards and richardson 2004 søreide et al 2010 leu et al 2011 daase et al 2013 and the delivery of organic matter to support the benthic food web north et al 2014 grebmeier et al 2015 lovvorn et al 2015 climate change and increasing water temperatures can effect species growth bioenergetics and impact the spatial distribution of predators and prey changing species composition and altering trophic dynamics convening subject matter experts in a workshop setting to outline detailed scenarios for predicted or potential disturbances could produce the detailed framework necessary for simulations with ecosense that would provide valuable guidance for resource managers in the face of simultaneous stressors to ecosystem structure and function and competing societal goals we used a data pedigree with corresponding confidence intervals to describe uncertainty in model parameters by drawing parameters from uniform distributions except diet composition dirichlet distribution centered on initial parameter estimates this simplified approach standardized the generation of parameters across all functional groups for simulations and analyses however this approach can potentially increase uncertainty in parameter estimates and even model outputs by not utilizing all available information on a parameters statistical properties such as distribution shape and standard deviation regan et al 2002 if a particular probability distribution is desired for one of the ewe parameters generated in the ecosense routine it can be specified by the user in the ecosense code additionally some life history parameters are thought to be correlated charnov et al 1991 and specific knowledge of some life history parameters may be used to predict other less known parameters thorson et al 2017 a next step for parameter generation will be to investigate how known life history parameters can be used to inform parameter draws for unknown parameters and how this may influence uncertainty and simulation results the three ewe models compared in this study exist across a near continuous latitudinal gradient in the northeast pacific ocean and as adjacent systems they share many taxa and are connected via oceanographic linkages while it is preferable for all parameters in a food web model to be system specific it is not practical as the data and rates required to support those parameters do not often exist particularly for non commercial and other less studied species when direct parameter estimates are unavailable they can be obtained from the literature including other food web models and preference is often given to parameter estimates for species with a close taxonomic relationship and or parameter estimates derived from studies in nearby ecosystems such is the case with the three food web models used in this study while parameters estimated specifically for each ecosystem would be ideal as a practical matter this is not possible and there are a number of functional groups who share parameters that are common to all three of the ecosystems in this study or are shared between two of the systems there are nine functional groups that have the same base p b and q b across all three food web models including gray whales shrimps and copepods additionally there are another 18 functional groups that have the same base p b and q b between the eastern bering sea and gulf of alaska these common parameters could contribute to similar dynamics between the compared systems or potentially obscure differences that may be apparent with ecosystem specific parameters should those true parameters ultimately have different values despite the common parameters there are a large number of structural and functional differences between these food webs and we have observed a number of distinctions between the simulation results across the three systems we have demonstrated here how uncertainty in ecopath model parameters and the predator prey functional response can be incorporated into scenario based simulations with ecosim using the rpath package the inclusion of parameter uncertainty in the simulation framework helps to convey the range of possible outcomes from the modeled perturbations and can help prevent overconfidence in simulation results with a single model the ecosense routine allows for the inclusion of uncertainty and can help to identify key sensitivities in food webs and highlight direct and indirect effects of disturbances mediated by trophic interactions adequate characterization of uncertainty in model results improves communication of the strength and direction of modelled results and will help models to support marine ebm although the simulations presented here are simple examples rpath with ecosense could be used by fisheries scientists and resource managers to explore a range of possible outcomes to simulations of detailed policy options or for

24846,population growth and other population characteristics have been computed and made available online for over 2000 animal species in the add my pet amp collection assuming constant food and temperature environments the amp collection online database of dynamic energy budget model parameters implied properties and referenced underlying data provides an unique opportunity to study how energetics of individuals relates to population growth for the comparisons of traits we assume that the background hazard rate is zero but aging applies to all species and thinning to species with high reproduction rates the new concept thinning is a state dependent hazard rate such that the feeding rate of a cohort does not change in time the increase of individual feeding rates due to growth is exactly compensated by a reduction in numbers thinning affects population growth rate but the impact differs substantially between species some 11 of species do not survive thinning even at abundant food the population growth rate relates to the underlying energetics we discuss and suggest explanations for how population growth rates fit into all known patterns in the co variation of parameter values body size scaling metabolic acceleration waste to hurry supply demand spectrum and altricial precocial spectrum we show that after reproduction age at puberty dominates population growth the specific population growth rate scales with maximum body weight in the same way as the weight specific respiration scales with body weight deb theory which explains both shows however that no direct relationship exists between the population growth rate and respiration we suggest that the similarity in scaling results from the equality between specific population growth and specific growth rate at maximum growth of structure and might be an evolutionary relict from times that life consisted of dividing unicellulars population and body growth are directly connected for unicellulars we show that the specific growth rate at maximum growth equals 1 5 times the von bertalanffy growth rate in a deb context which is a new interpretation of the latter growth rate we expected the population growth rate to co vary with specific somatic maintenance rate based on a previously discovered pattern called the waste to hurry strategy where growth and reproduction are increased by simultaneously increasing assimilation and somatic maintenance in species that live off temporarily abundant food supplies we did find this effect in ecdysozoa and spiralia which comprise roughly 95 of animal species but hardly so in tetrapods the reason might be that specific somatic maintenance also co varies with specific maturity levels at puberty for tetrapods the scaled functional response at which the population growth rate is zero is very close to that at which puberty can just be reached in absence of thinning and somewhat higher in presence of thinning the specific population growth rate at abundant food correlates negatively with the functional response for which population growth rate is zero it also correlates negatively with the precociality index i e the ratio of maturity levels at puberty and birth the more precocial the larger neonate size the smaller reproduction rate especially in restricted taxa such as mammals and cartilaginous fish like other traits the population growth rate shows considerable segregation among taxa where mammals have a relatively low rate glires a relatively high rate among mammals followed by marsupials

introduction physiologists focus on properties of individuals whereas ecologists try to link those properties to population and ecosystem dynamics actual population dynamics suffers however from quite a list of complicating factors the environment is changing in space and time many factors affect survival e g predators pathogens starvation multiple types of resources exist involving food selection individuals interact e g competition flocking territorial behaviour migration and other forms of transport dynamic weather conditions daily and seasonal cycling of temperature rainfall drought inducing torpor and migration and even the boundaries of populations and ecosystem are typically poorly defined hampering mass and energy balancing while predator dynamics depend on prey availability the latter depends on its resource dynamics as well and in no time we have to deal with a huge number of variables involving nutrient recycling at ecosystem level to disentangle this gordian knot in a structured way we here focus on what can be called potential population growth for animals for the potential population growth we assume homogeneous space and time avoid defining population boundaries by working in densities of individuals i e number of individuals per environmental surface area or volume exclude feed backs from the environment and focus on steady state situations known as balanced growth despite its rather academic nature potential population growth is an important ecological trait of a species and still depends on environmental factors temperature and substrate availability as well as physiological and life history traits of species our position is that knowledge of the energetic basis of population growth is by no means sufficient for predictions of actual population dynamics but such predictions do need this knowledge for being reliable the purpose of this paper is rather specialised to study patterns in population growth potential among animal species in constant environments where populations have a stable age and size distribution among its individuals and to find links with the underlying energetics we do this in the context of dynamic energy budget deb theory which has been set up for this purpose kooijman 1986b kooijman and metz 1984 deb theory specifies how feeding growth reproduction and aging are inter connected during the life cycle of an individual in a dynamically changing environment jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2001 2012 ledder 2014 van der meer 2006 muller et al 2019 sara et al 2014 sousa et al 2008 2010 during its 40 years of development this theory has been applied to many species which invites to compare them on the basis of population performance a second purpose of this paper is to give background to the recently added population traits pages of the add my pet amp collection marques et al 2018 2019 this collection of over 2000 animal species from all large phyla and all chordate orders anonymous 2019a concerns referenced data on energetics and life history in combination with deb parameters and implied properties that have been extracted from the empirical data this is the first paper that evaluates population traits based on energy parameters for many species that have been estimated from referenced data on energetics and life history at individual level where the whole chain from empirical data to population traits can be checked in detail for all species including code that has been used this cannot be done with other models for individuals since alternatives that specify individual dynamics thermodynamically will be too complex kooijman 2020b biodiversity presents a challenge in the context of population modeling most tetrapods produce a small number of relatively large offspring but most ray finned fish and invertebrates produce an enormous number of tiny eggs if aging would be the only cause of death the implied population growth rate of most ray finned fish and invertebrates would be enormous as well e g the ocean sunfish produces 3 1010 eggs per year schmidt 1921 practice is obviously that only few of the many neonates make it to puberty the ocean sunfish is actually not abundant at all tiny eggs in the aquatic environment are possibly an adaptation for dispersal or risk minimisation if you wish but the remarkable implication for fish is that the prey of the fish feeds on the early stages of the fish kooijman and lika 2014a which comes with a high intrinsic hazard rate uncertainty about the dynamics of survival of fry motivated many fish biologists to bypass the problem and use demographic population models where the smallest individuals have year class one assuming a recruitment rate that is independent of the standing crop treating early life stage dynamics as black box assuming some constant i e age and size independent hazard to reduce numbers does not solve the problem since this results in unrealistically few adults what is needed here is a hazard rate that is high for young small individuals and much lower for older larger ones an element of the individual environment interaction that became built into life histories during evolution specifying such a hazard rate can be done in many ways but in the context of deb theory a single parameter free way stands out what is here called thinning the hazard rate is chosen such that the feeding rate of a cohort of neonates does not change in time which fully determines the hazard rate meaning that no extra parameters are involved when individuals grow they eat more but this effect is exactly balanced by a reduction in numbers the discussion section presents a further motivation for this choice this paper first presents an extended methods section which serves as background information of the data presented on the population traits pages of the amp collection anonymous 2019a on which the analysis in this paper is based this section describes how properties of individual contribute to population growth the first preliminary results of the analysis are reported in the results section which starts with a discussion of the frequency distribution of population growth rates illustrating the role of reproduction rate puberty and thinning then we explore how population growth rate depends on patterns in the co variation of parameter values that have been identified so far body size scaling metabolic acceleration waste to hurry supply demand spectrum and altricial precocial spectrum the discussion section places our findings in a wider context the notation in this paper follows the deb notation rules kooijman 2020a 2 methods 2 1 data all data of all the 2027 species in the amp collection at sampling date 2019 11 05 that has been analysed in this paper can be found on the amp website anonymous 2019a including the references for the data the code that has been used for the parameter estimation anonymous 2019b 2019c all parameters and many implied properties of the parameters all entries in the amp collection have been curated by a team of curators the mean relative error of predictions for 3 104 data sets is just 0 07 which supports the realism of deb models and parameter values as well as the generality and applicability of deb theory all code is documented and manuals are made available this paper is a study of patterns in parameter values the data in each entry has a wide diversity among entries basic life history data such as age and size at life history events birth puberty death food intake growth reproduction respiration this diversity hampers direct comparison of species on the basis of data while most entries have ultimate weight as data relatively few entries have respiration but all entries have predicted ultimate weight and predicted respiration moreover data requires interpretation which is done by deb parameters which all have clear connections with a single underlying physiological process the newly added population traits on the amp website include graphs of the survivor functions of the survival probabilities and the stable age distribution at maximum and minimum food levels population doubling times and a list of statistics relating to the age and size structure of the population such as the mean values of powers of lengths li i 1 2 3 the yield coefficients of the macro chemical reaction equation for food to living and dead biomass at population level are also given which can be useful in the study of mass turnover at ecosystem level we here focus on first conclusions from this information provided in the amp collection 2 2 model for individuals population growth in terms of densities of individuals in a constant homogeneous environment depends on survival and reproduction while these processes depend on body size making body growth relevant for finite populations in a dynamic heterogeneous environment a lot more becomes relevant as well as indicated in the introduction the ten deb models that are used in the amp collection marques et al 2018 are all simple extensions of the standard deb model to account for extra life stages metabolic acceleration egg or foetal development detailed model specifications can be found in appendix c age zero corresponds with the start of embryo development not with birth since the models include embryo development we describe aging below since it is part of the model for individuals and thinning in the subsection on population growth since it reflects predation 2 2 1 aging the aging module of deb theory kooijman 2010b van leeuwen et al 2002 is based on the ideas that 1 damage inducing compounds e g mitochrondrial dna are formed at a rate that is proportional to the use of dioxygen which induce reactive oxygen species ros 2 damage inducing compounds form damage compounds e g modified proteins at a constant rate 3 the hazard rate is proportional to the concentration of damage compounds and 4 damage inducing compounds can produce more damage inducing compounds at a constant rate the latter rate is typically low in ectotherms but can be higher in endotherms birds mammals with the effect that the survival probability due to aging remains high for a long period relative to the life span but then suddenly collapses an implication of this two parameter deb module for aging is that the popular empirical models by weibull 1951 and gompertz 1825 are both special cases at constant food and on top of that it links to energetics via respiration it turned out to be difficult to decide which of these two empirical models fit survival data best ricklefs and scheuerlein 2002 but with the deb aging module there is no need for a choice while this does not translate to more parameters dilution by growth keeps the hazard rate low and effects of caloric restriction are found to be well captured by this module van leeuwen et al 2002 since larvae of holometabolic insects typically grow fast and reset structure during pupation only imagos suffer from aging taxa like cephalopods sport programmed death rather than aging this process is modelled by the same equations to facilitate comparison 2 2 2 reproduction the reproduction module of deb theory is based on the ideas that 1 allocation to maturation i e increase in maturity plus maturation maintenance is proportional to the mobilization of reserve 2 maturation maintenance is proportional to maturity 3 investment into maturation is redirected to filling of a reproduction buffer of reserve as soon as maturity reaches the puberty threshold level and 4 the reproduction buffer is converted to eggs or fetuses at reproduction events based on species specific buffer handling rules which can depend on physiological and or environmental cues the maximum reproduction rate r m is the mean number of offspring eggs foetuses per time averaged over many reproduction event intervals for an individual of maximum size at abundant food reproduction is here taken to be continuous which is obviously an approximation the fact that the reproduction buffer first needs to accumulate enough to produce an offspring egg or foetus reduces the specific population growth rate because of the involved waiting time but its impact rapidly decreases for increasing age at puberty kooijman 2010b fig 9 8 since this error is small relative to that induced by another more complex fact it is ignored this fact is that eggs foetuses are frequently produced in clutches litters of several to many offspring frequently in synchronisation with the seasons involving much longer waiting times even this fact is ignored since it is species specific and frequently depends on the location in the geographic area of the species and on local climate in gonochoric heterogamous species males are taken into account by halving the reproduction efficiency κr on the assumptions that the sex ratio is 1 1 and male and female eggs foetuses are equally costly only females directly contribute to the production of offspring reproduction efficiency only affects the conversion of the contents of the reproduction buffer to offspring so the idea is that half of it is lost for the production of males this is not done for hermaphroditic species nor for parthenogenic species simultaneous hermaphrodites have already a reduced κr to account for sperm production sequential hermaphrodites have no reduced κr but the age at first egg production does not coincide with puberty for protandric hermaphrodites i e first male then female 2 2 3 body growth the growth module of deb theory is based on the assumptions that 1 allocation to growth i e increase of structure plus somatic maintenance is proportional to the mobilization of reserve and 2 somatic maintenance is proportional to structure the relevance of body growth for population growth is that feeding in deb theory is linked to surface area and reproduction is linked to feeding we discuss the effect of body size on population growth in the section on body size scaling 2 3 population growth as known since malthus 1798 any population will eventually grow exponentially in a constant environment due to the fact that offspring follow the same reproduction and survival pattern as the parents the specific population growth rate r n also called the intrinsic rate of increase or the per capita growth rate or malthusian parameter can be computed by solving the characteristic also called the euler lotka or renewal equation kot 2001 pielou 1969 de roos 1997 for individuals of age a survival probability s and reproduction rate r the characteristic equation is 1 1 0 s a r a exp r n a d a we also used eq 1 to obtain the scaled functional response f 0 at which r n 0 by solving it in scaled function response f while fixing r n 0 where s as well as r depend on f this statistic quantifies the minimum environmental quality for long term survival relative to the food searching abilities of the species for f f 0 the population grows to infinity for f f 0 the population goes extinct while thinning does not affect growth or reproduction rate given food availability via f it does affect f 0 since the effect of thinning has to be compensated by reproduction given r n 0 for the standard deb model the thinning hazard amounts to h a r a 2 3 where r a d d a ln l a 3 is the specific growth rate of structure of an individual of age a and structural length l this can be seen from the feeding rate of a cohort of n 0 neonates j x n a n 0 s a j x l 2 a where j x is the surface area specific feeding rate of an individual and l its structural length by our definition of thinning this cohort feeding rate should not change in time so d d a j x n 0 while d d a l 3 l 3 r a by definition of the specific growth rate of structure and d d a s s h a by definition of the hazard rate the factor 2 3 in the expression for the thinning hazard originates from surface area being proportional to l 2 and volume to l 3 for isomorphs for v1 morphs i e individuals whose surface area increases proportional to volume which is a temporary stage in the family of a and h models marques et al 2018 j x is not a constant but is proportional to l kooijman 2014 the hazard rate for thinning amounts to h a r a species that sport metabolic acceleration temporarily behave as v1 morphs this occurs only in particular taxa typically with larval stages in this paper thinning was applied to entries for which ultimate reproduction of a fully grown adult r i 1 d 1 because absence of thinning lacks realism for these species as the population would grow theoretically at enormous rates with only aging as cause of death see introduction we found that our results are not sensitive to the value of this threshold for r i the underlying idea is that species with many tiny eggs are adapted to intense predation during the early stages they typically do not allocate more mobilised reserve to reproduction compared to species with large eggs which links egg size directly to reproduction rate 2 3 1 numerical methods and implementation the computations of the population

enables the setting of temperature scaled function response stage specific background hazard rates on top of the optional thinning hazard and the obligatory aging hazard this function can be used for species that are not yet added to the amp collection but also for existing ones in the latter case the function detects if males and females differ in parameter settings and the population characteristics take this into account we found a few cases where the scaled functional response that results in r n 0 for females is too low for males to reach puberty the specific population growth rate r n is calculated by solving the characteristic eq 1 integration of the characteristic equation has been continued till the survival probability becomes less than 10 6 using an event handler in combination with a runge kutta 4 5 method with relative and absolute tolerance of 10 9 these small tolerances turned out to be necessary for numerical stability we are looking for a non negative solution for r n since shrinking of the population cannot be a steady state if the solution exists it is unique the solution has been found with a bisection method for each of the amp entries using the upper boundary r n m that is specified by exp r n m a p r n m r m where ap is the time since birth at puberty r a 0 for a ap and r m the maximum reproduction rate at abundant food with eternal survival kooijman 2010b eq 9 21 this follows directly from the characteristic equation 1 r m a p exp r n m a d a the solution for r n m was again found with a bisection method now using r m as upper boundary but this is fast because no integration is involved 2 3 2 stable age distribution the population traits pages of the amp collection show the stable age distribution that underlie the specific population growth rate the survivor function of the stable age distribution is given by 2 s a a a exp r n t s t d t 0 exp r n t s t d t it only applies when the population grows exponentially i e balanced growth an implication of the stable age distribution is that the relative frequency decreases as function of age this rarely occurs in reality since balanced growth rarely occurs in nature yet it controls mass turnover at population level graphs of the survival probability s a and the survivor function of the stable age distribution sa a can be found in the amp website anonymous 2019a for all species with and without thinning 2 4 macro chemical reaction equation the conversion of food to living and dead biomass and faeces at the population level can be summarized by the macro chemical reaction equation x y o x o y v x v y v x v y e x e y e x e y p x p y h x h y n x n μ t x for food x living structure v dead structure v living reserve e dead reserve e faeces p dioxygen o water h and nitrogen waste n which can be ammonia urea or uric acid depending on the taxon at phylum or class level notice that these symbols stand for types not for quantities the yield coefficients y depend on the population growth rate r n that for food has been chosen equal to one as reference yields are ratios of fluxes yox is taken negative since dioxygen disappears rather than appears these mass fluxes are expressed in c mole per time one mole of glucose corresponds with 6 c moles of glucose and can like energy fluxes all be written as cubic polynomials in structural length in deb models kooijman 2010b section 4 3 1 the yield of heat on food μtx is here expressed as joules per consumed c mole of food time dropping out in the ratio the reaction equation only involves the 4 most abundant chemical elements in biomass extension to include additional elements is straight forward as long as we also include one mineral for each extra element that contains that element we exclude water loss that results from evaporation which involves a drinking rate to compensate since this involves environmental details the water balance is discussed in kooijman 2010b section 4 6 the yield of water in the macro chemical reaction equation only concerns metabolic water the reaction equation does not specify fermentation products kooijman 2010b section 4 9 1 assuming that dioxygen is not rate limiting and food is the only component that is possibly limiting situations where more than one resource is potentially limiting are discussed in kooijman 2010b chapter 5 appendix a shows how the yield coefficients depend on the population growth rate values for the yield coefficients and heat can be found on the amp website anonymous 2019a for all species the parameter values of males can differ from that of females in which case the web page reports the coefficients of two macro chemical reaction equations the package amptool anonymous 2019b in combination with debtool anonymous 2019c can generate similar local html pages where the user can set the background hazard which was set to zero for the web pages and modify the setting of other parameters to study the effects on population traits anonymous 2019a dropdown applications 3 results the script files for all figures are available in the supporting information the amp data i e all parameters individual and population traits for all species can be downloaded from the amp website anonymous 2019a dropdown collection and the required amptool anonymous 2019b and debtool anonymous 2019c from github the choice of taxa and markers can be modified in the script files the scripts produce matlab figures and clicking on a marker in these figures shows the corresponding species name the amp website can be used to check traits for that species and the empirical data from which these traits were derived 3 1 effects of reproduction puberty and thinning fig 1 left shows 4 curves that will be discussed from right to left step wise involving more traits red curve right curve if survival would be eternal s a 1 and reproduction at maximum for all ages including embryos r a r m the specific population growth rate equals maximum reproduction rate r n r m this can be seen from eq 1 under these conditions the red curve not only represents the maximum reproduction rate but also the maximum population growth rate the magenta curve in fig 1 shows that the ceiling for the maximum population growth rate r n m is quite a bit smaller while the only difference with the red curve is that reproduction is zero till puberty so survival is still eternal blue curve the maximum population growth rate itself without thinning is slightly smaller than its ceiling while the difference with the magenta curve is that reproduction just after puberty is less than maximum due to growth during the adult phase and survival is subjected to aging this means that the effect of age at puberty is much more important than the effect of aging or the fact that most species still grow and increase their reproduction rate after puberty fig 1 shows that the magenta curve for the ceiling r n m and the blue one for the population growth rate itself r n are almost identical for rates smaller than the median rates the 450 species of birds in the amp collection at 2019 11 05 play a relatively large role in this similarity they have few big offspring so small r n hardly grow as adults and have a long life span so birds actually approximate the assumptions behind the ceiling r n m for rates larger than the median rates the curves for r n m and r n deviate somewhat the 502 species of ray finned fish play a relatively large role in the explanation they produce many tiny eggs so have a large r n without thinning and grow substantially during reproduction i e slowly increasing their reproduction rate with age the effect that reproduction rate increases with age is thus somewhat more relevant for population growth for this taxon the black curve left curve in fig 1 shows that the mean effect of thinning is substantial since the black curve with thinning is almost parallel to the blue one without thinning while the rates are log transformed the effect of thinning in practice means a reduction by an almost constant factor on average not all species survive thinning i e the characteristic equation does not have a solution even for f 1 for 228 of the 2027 species these species tend to have a juvenile period that is a substantial fraction of the life span but we failed to detect simple causes fig 1 shows in the right panel that the effect of thinning is rather species specific varying from strong to almost no effect thinning has relatively little effect on large bodied species because they have a small specific growth rate of structure so a small thinning hazard 3 2 body size scaling the data covers the full range of body sizes among extant animals from the hairy back with a maximum body weight of 8 10 8 g to the blue whale of 1 6 108 g this range of a factor 2 1015 coincides with predictable shifts in parameter values that depend on the physical interpretation of parameters contrary to the other co variation rules discussed in the next subsections which involve physiological ecological and evolutionary adaptations the a priory rules for the co variation of deb parameters are based on the ideas that 1 parameters are either intensive or extensive given their physical interpretation 2 appropriate ratios of extensive parameters are intensive and 3 maximum structural length depends on three parameters one of which is extensive namely the specific maximum assimilation the co variation rules imply that the latter is proportional to maximum structural length and that all parameters can be linked to each other including traits that can be written as functions of deb parameters kooijman 1986a 2010b these rules predict that maximum population growth rate decreases with maximum structural length to the power somewhat larger than 1 kooijman 1986a 2010b our present finding of a scaling exponent of 1 09 for length or 0 23 for body weight among animal species is consistent with the expectations see fig 2 maximum size is an implied trait of energetics lika et al 2019 and large bodied species tend to have relatively more reserve which is why body weight is more than proportional to cubed structural length a scaling power with body weight of 0 20 has been found brown et al 2007 savage et al 2004 for a small set of species algae zooplankton and fish which is numerically close to our results but they explained it as a result of respiration we now discuss why our explanation differs fig 3 shows the predicted weight specific respiration as function of the predicted ultimate wet weight at 20 c and f 1 so the scaling is the same as for the specific population growth rate of the data in the amp collection see the discussion section absolute growth of structure typically increases after birth and then decreases becoming zero when an individual is fully grown fig 3 shows that the maximum population growth rate roughly equals the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth see the appendix b for its relationship with maximum specific growth of structure this appendix also shows that the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth is 1 5 times the von bertalanffy growth rate after metamorphosis the finding of the equality of rates is remarkable because population growth relates to survival and reproduction not to growth of structure directly we come back to this in the discussion endotherms tend to have a lower population growth rate compared to ectotherms despite the fact that thinning has been applied to fast reproducing species so most ectotherms 3 3 metabolic acceleration about a third of the amp species sport metabolic acceleration a temporary deviation from isomorphy where surface area is proportional to volume rather then volume2 3 kooijman 2014 kooijman et al 2011 it is quantified by the ratio of structural length at the end and the start of acceleration called the acceleration factor sm both start and end are triggered by exceeding maturity levels as result the specific maximum assimilation and energy conductance which control the mobilisation rate of reserve increase proportional to length during acceleration period this means that both parameters are multiplied by the acceleration factor to convert the situation before to after acceleration the ability to accelerate is the backbone of the family structure of deb models that are used in the amp collection marques et al 2018 we found no clear link between the population growth rate and the acceleration factor this is not shown to reduce the number of figures 3 4 waste to hurry the waste to hurry pattern in co variation of parameter values states that specific assimilation increases with specific maintenance in small bodied species that are adapted to short lasting peaks in food abundance coupled to torpor and substantial death during low food intervals this comes with a high maximum growth and reproduction kooijman 2013 not only in theory but also in data it is an implication of the κ rule of deb theory which states that a fixed fraction of mobilised reserve is allocated to soma growth of structure plus somatic maintenance it therefore seems natural to expect that waste to hurry also comes with a high specific population growth rate r n fig 3 shows however that this holds for spiralia and ecdysozoa i e 95 of all animal species but not so clearly for tetrapods the reason for this possibly relates to the fact that specific somatic maintenance p m also appears to co vary with the specific maturity at puberty e h p as shown in fig 4 an increase of maturity at puberty typically increases age at puberty and so decreases population growth while tetrapods tend to have high maturity levels at birth and puberty combined with a large ultimate body mass invertebrates have the opposite quite a few parameters are involved however which complicates the analysis why waste to hurry is impossible for large bodied species is explained in augustine et al 2019b so the waste to hurry strategy more frequently occurs among small bodied species 3 5 supply demand spectrum demand species have pre programmed growth and reproduction trajectories and eat what they need while supply species are much more flexible lika et al 2014 demand species evolved from supply species the supply stress ss quantifies the position of species in the supply demand spectrum and is defined as the maturity maintenance p j times the squared somatic one p m divided by cubed assimilation p a so s s p j p m 2 p a 3 it is body size independent and can take values between 0 and 22 33 in the context of deb theory endotherms i e birds and mammals turn out to have a high supply stress which makes them demand species reptiles amphibians and cartilaginous fish have intermediate values ray finned fish have lower values while insects are extreme supply species demand species differ in quite a few properties from supply species lika et al 2014 and tend to have a high scaled functional response to reach puberty the scaled functional response that is required to reach puberty f min has a direct relationship with the supply stress ss and the allocation fraction κ of mobilised reserve to soma which can be predicted on a priori grounds lika et al 2014 species parameter sets reveal only tiny deviations from the surface ss f min κ specified by supply stress s s f min 3 κ 2 1 κ these deviations are caused by the amount of metabolic acceleration being somewhat dependent on the scaled functional response the scaled functional response f 0 at which specific population growth rate equals zero r n 0 is very close to one required to reach puberty f min fig 5 shows that r n at abundant food is decreasing for increasing f 0 this might not come as a complete surprise since a high f 0 f min means a high supply stress ss or a low demand stress s d 4 27 s s while birds and mammals dominate demand species and have a relatively large body size so a low population growth rate the observation is ecologically important and directly relates to the supply demand spectrum the specific growth rate tends to decrease somewhat for increasing allocation fraction κ to soma see fig 6 a high value of κ means a low fraction of mobilised reserve invested in maturation so high age at puberty and reproduction so low reproduction rate which leads to a low population growth rate we did not find clear relationships between r n and ss which is surprising given the relationship between ss and f min being close to f 0 we can think of f 0 as a requirement for environmental quality but one that is strongly modified by the small half saturation constant for demand species on top of that endotherms sport another adaptation up regulation of assimilation associated to reproduction events to escape the environmental quality restrictions to some extent this is not part of the standard deb model but included in more advanced deb models the segregation of taxon specific properties can also be seen in fig 5 showing that mammals have a relatively low population growth rate the gliriformes rodents and hares have the highest population growth rate among mammals followed by the marsupials while afrotheria have the lowest but the blue whale has the lowest population growth rate of all 3 6 altricial precocial spectrum the precociality index s h b p quantifies the position of species in the altricial precocial spectrum and is defined as the ratio of the maturity at birth e h b and puberty e h p so s h b p e h b e h p this index takes values between 0 extreme altricial and 1 extreme precocial since a priory co variation rules predict that both maturities scale with cubed maximum structural length this index is expected to be independent of body size augustine et al 2019a confirmed this expectation for mammals but s h b p tends to decrease with maximum body weight for other animal taxa fig 5 shows that r n for mammals and cartilaginous fish tend to decrease somewhat with s h b p but for invertebrates and ray finned fish this is even much less clear a possible explanation for the complex relationship is that an increase in s h b p so in size at birth relative to puberty maturity co varies with size augustine et al 2011 reduces reproduction rate but also shortens waiting time till puberty which increases r n 4 discussion and conclusions a natural question that one might have is to what extent the reported population growth rates are reliable we stated in the introduction that homogeneous space constant food density and temperature absence of causes of death apart from aging and thinning do not occur in nature moreover feed backs from the environment prevent continued population growth so we cannot test reliability with empirical data potential population growth rates depend on a number of parameters at the individual level and their accuracy depends on the data that was used for estimation we do not see possibilities to test reliability but can point to another implied property that has been measured in a minority of the amp entries respiration which also depends on several parameters in the cases were it was measured the fit is good while the parameters are consistent with related species for which respiration was not measured thinning may partly solve a problem for theoretical population dynamics which is implied by deb theory van der meer 2016 in homogeneous space and time individuals in an individual based model ibm tend to synchronise their life cycles where the young generation out competes the adults kooijman 2010b upon reaching puberty synchronously the newly produced offspring again out competes the existing generation the fact that food shortage impacts growth more the larger the individual induces synchronisation this is a structural property of deb models for isomorphs i e organisms that do not change shape during ontogeny the reason is that the scaled functional response needs to exceed structural length as fraction of the maximum to grow so the larger the individual the higher the minimum food level must be this behaviour poses problems for the theoretical study of population properties as implied by deb theory we need to understand model implications in simple situations before we can interpret their implications on more realistic situations the reduction of the synchronisation effect motivated us to link thinning to food consumption we know that synchronisation can also be reduced by allowing for scatter in parameter values among individuals kooijman 2010b and spatial or temporal heterogeneity but these routes complicate the mathematical analysis we see the progress reported in this paper as a first step in a long series with use of the reported yield coefficients we will eventually be able to test popular assumptions such as the maximisation of entropy dissipation at the population level sousa et al 2006 the amp collection was already instrumental to test another popular assumption that of the maximization of reproductive output which was found to be strongly at odds with evidence kooijman and lika 2014b meanwhile the amp collection grew from 276 in that paper to 2027 species at present only further supporting its conclusions we now also better understand why the allocation fraction to soma and so to reproduction follows a beta distribution among species lika et al 2019 we found that the specific population growth rate r n and the weight specific respiration scale with maximum body weight to the power 0 23 and 0 24 respectively these values are very close to kleiber s empirical value 0 25 for weight specific respiration kleiber 1932 and in view of the scatter in data these values can considered to be the same deb theory explains both types of scaling kooijman 1986a 2010b but also shows that the relationship between population growth and respiration is only incidental population growth depends on reproduction and survival reproduction treated as export of wrapped reserve in deb theory hardly contributes to respiration since the chemical composition of freshly laid eggs and reserve are the same whereas the contribution of feeding for fuelling egg production to respiration was experimentally excluded in kleiber s data we showed that the second most important determinant of population growth is age at puberty it also does not have a straightforward relationship with respiration we believe that the similarity of these and other scaling powers hampered the evolution of ecological thinking substantially since the popularity of linking a wide variety of quantities directly to metabolic rate with allometric functions huxley 1932 we see metabolism as a network of interrelated processes and the quantification of fluxes through this network by a single number has strong limitations is the similarity in scaling of specific population growth and respiration with maximum body mass then purely coincidental we suggest that it might be caused by the equality of specific population growth with the specific growth of structure at maximum growth as reported in the results section the latter has a much more direct relationship with respiration via growth overheads what then causes the equality of these growth rates if we look at a population of unicellulars which multiply by division then growth of individuals can be accurately approximated by that of v1 morphs this is because the detailed morphology of the growth curve does not matter much if cell structural volume maximally doubles since birth for a population of unicellular v1 morphs the specific population growth rate actually equals the specific growth rate of structure conceptually kooi and kooijman 1994 since for v1 morphs the difference between populations and individuals disappears since animals evolved from unicellulars the equality of both specific growth rates might be an evolutionary relict while body growth controls population growth in unicellulars with a limited role of survival reproduction including age at puberty and a more complex role of survival controls population growth in animals but it seems that the average population growth rate among species remained unaffected in the transition notice that maximum specific growth rate equals the specific growth rate at maximum growth in dividing unicellulars but not so in animals where the latter rate took control if our interpretation holds while conversion efficiency from food to biomass at the individual level is controlled by physiological factors as quantified by deb theory that at population level is controlled by ecological factors where the role of physiology is reduced to setting boundary conditions kooijman 1992 the yield coefficients of the macro chemical reaction equation are sensitive to the background hazard as can be explored using the debtool anonymous 2019c and amptool anonymous 2019b packages conclusions of this research are as follows some 11 of the species do not survive thinning the maximum population growth rate about equals the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth for most taxa if thinning applies for fast reproducing species but the scatter is substantial the match is exact for organisms that divide rather than reproduce and we suggest the equality for animals to be an evolutionary relict the maximum population growth rate decreases approximately with maximum weight to the power 0 25 among species as predicted a priori this is the same as for weight specific respiration which is also predicted a priori but these predictions show that there is no direct link between population growth and respiration the scatter in population growth rates at the reference temperature for a given specific growth rate of structure amounts to a factor 100 and is higher for invertebrates compared to vertebrates even if thinning applies for fast reproducing species the waste to hurry strategy of increasing growth and reproduction by increasing assimilation and somatic maintenance simultaneously translates in a clear positive relationship between somatic maintenance and population growth for ecdysozoa and spiralia but not for tetrapods we present the explanation the maturity level at puberty depends on maintenance for tetrapods the scaled functional response at which the population growth rate is zero is very close to that at which puberty can just be reached in absence of thinning and somewhat increased in presence of thinning the specific population growth rate decreases for increasing for minimum functional response we present an explanation specific population growth rate decreases for increasing precociality index for mammals and cartilaginous fish but not so for invertebrates and ray finned fish we suggest an explantation like other traits the population growth rate shows considerable segregation among taxa where mammals have a relatively low rate glires a relatively high rate among mammals followed by marsupials and afrotherians the lowest ones we found a new interpretation for the von bertalanffy growth rate 1 5 times this rate equals the specific growth rate at maximum growth acknowledgements sa was supported by the norwegian science council nfr 255295 nm was supported by

population level living structure production is j v m v s b δ a n r l b 3 a b r a l a 3 exp r n a s a d a a b exp r n a s a d a where r is the specific growth rate of structure so the yield of

b specific growth at maximum growth vs maximum specific growth of structure the paper talks about the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth we here work out its relationship with a related quantity the postnatal maximum specific growth of structure for the standard deb model with zero surface area related somatic maintenance and abundant food f 1 postnatal growth i e change in

312 and the specific growth rate at this length is r m k m 2 1 1 g the implication is that the specific growth at maximum growth relates in a simple way to the von bertalanffy growth rate r m 3 2 r b as far as we know this is a new interpretation of the von bertalanffy growth rate the specific growth rate of structure only decreases after birth making it maximum at birth so at l l b and has the value k m l m l b 1 1 1 g so if l m 3 2 l b the maximum specific growth of structure exceeds the specific growth at maximum growth of structure which is typically the case the specific growth rate of structure at the start of embryo development is infinitely large so we excluded the embryo stage here appendix c amp model specification the notation follows the rules described in kooijman 2020a add

development that first starts with a preparation stage and then sparks off at a time t 0 that is an extra parameter a baby stage for mammals just after birth ended by weaning where the juvenile switches from feeding on milk to solid food at maturity level e h x weaning is between birth and puberty so e h b e h x e h p in its simplest form it is a two parameter extension of std model at

24846,population growth and other population characteristics have been computed and made available online for over 2000 animal species in the add my pet amp collection assuming constant food and temperature environments the amp collection online database of dynamic energy budget model parameters implied properties and referenced underlying data provides an unique opportunity to study how energetics of individuals relates to population growth for the comparisons of traits we assume that the background hazard rate is zero but aging applies to all species and thinning to species with high reproduction rates the new concept thinning is a state dependent hazard rate such that the feeding rate of a cohort does not change in time the increase of individual feeding rates due to growth is exactly compensated by a reduction in numbers thinning affects population growth rate but the impact differs substantially between species some 11 of species do not survive thinning even at abundant food the population growth rate relates to the underlying energetics we discuss and suggest explanations for how population growth rates fit into all known patterns in the co variation of parameter values body size scaling metabolic acceleration waste to hurry supply demand spectrum and altricial precocial spectrum we show that after reproduction age at puberty dominates population growth the specific population growth rate scales with maximum body weight in the same way as the weight specific respiration scales with body weight deb theory which explains both shows however that no direct relationship exists between the population growth rate and respiration we suggest that the similarity in scaling results from the equality between specific population growth and specific growth rate at maximum growth of structure and might be an evolutionary relict from times that life consisted of dividing unicellulars population and body growth are directly connected for unicellulars we show that the specific growth rate at maximum growth equals 1 5 times the von bertalanffy growth rate in a deb context which is a new interpretation of the latter growth rate we expected the population growth rate to co vary with specific somatic maintenance rate based on a previously discovered pattern called the waste to hurry strategy where growth and reproduction are increased by simultaneously increasing assimilation and somatic maintenance in species that live off temporarily abundant food supplies we did find this effect in ecdysozoa and spiralia which comprise roughly 95 of animal species but hardly so in tetrapods the reason might be that specific somatic maintenance also co varies with specific maturity levels at puberty for tetrapods the scaled functional response at which the population growth rate is zero is very close to that at which puberty can just be reached in absence of thinning and somewhat higher in presence of thinning the specific population growth rate at abundant food correlates negatively with the functional response for which population growth rate is zero it also correlates negatively with the precociality index i e the ratio of maturity levels at puberty and birth the more precocial the larger neonate size the smaller reproduction rate especially in restricted taxa such as mammals and cartilaginous fish like other traits the population growth rate shows considerable segregation among taxa where mammals have a relatively low rate glires a relatively high rate among mammals followed by marsupials

introduction physiologists focus on properties of individuals whereas ecologists try to link those properties to population and ecosystem dynamics actual population dynamics suffers however from quite a list of complicating factors the environment is changing in space and time many factors affect survival e g predators pathogens starvation multiple types of resources exist involving food selection individuals interact e g competition flocking territorial behaviour migration and other forms of transport dynamic weather conditions daily and seasonal cycling of temperature rainfall drought inducing torpor and migration and even the boundaries of populations and ecosystem are typically poorly defined hampering mass and energy balancing while predator dynamics depend on prey availability the latter depends on its resource dynamics as well and in no time we have to deal with a huge number of variables involving nutrient recycling at ecosystem level to disentangle this gordian knot in a structured way we here focus on what can be called potential population growth for animals for the potential population growth we assume homogeneous space and time avoid defining population boundaries by working in densities of individuals i e number of individuals per environmental surface area or volume exclude feed backs from the environment and focus on steady state situations known as balanced growth despite its rather academic nature potential population growth is an important ecological trait of a species and still depends on environmental factors temperature and substrate availability as well as physiological and life history traits of species our position is that knowledge of the energetic basis of population growth is by no means sufficient for predictions of actual population dynamics but such predictions do need this knowledge for being reliable the purpose of this paper is rather specialised to study patterns in population growth potential among animal species in constant environments where populations have a stable age and size distribution among its individuals and to find links with the underlying energetics we do this in the context of dynamic energy budget deb theory which has been set up for this purpose kooijman 1986b kooijman and metz 1984 deb theory specifies how feeding growth reproduction and aging are inter connected during the life cycle of an individual in a dynamically changing environment jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2001 2012 ledder 2014 van der meer 2006 muller et al 2019 sara et al 2014 sousa et al 2008 2010 during its 40 years of development this theory has been applied to many species which invites to compare them on the basis of population performance a second purpose of this paper is to give background to the recently added population traits pages of the add my pet amp collection marques et al 2018 2019 this collection of over 2000 animal species from all large phyla and all chordate orders anonymous 2019a concerns referenced data on energetics and life history in combination with deb parameters and implied properties that have been extracted from the empirical data this is the first paper that evaluates population traits based on energy parameters for many species that have been estimated from referenced data on energetics and life history at individual level where the whole chain from empirical data to population traits can be checked in detail for all species including code that has been used this cannot be done with other models for individuals since alternatives that specify individual dynamics thermodynamically will be too complex kooijman 2020b biodiversity presents a challenge in the context of population modeling most tetrapods produce a small number of relatively large offspring but most ray finned fish and invertebrates produce an enormous number of tiny eggs if aging would be the only cause of death the implied population growth rate of most ray finned fish and invertebrates would be enormous as well e g the ocean sunfish produces 3 1010 eggs per year schmidt 1921 practice is obviously that only few of the many neonates make it to puberty the ocean sunfish is actually not abundant at all tiny eggs in the aquatic environment are possibly an adaptation for dispersal or risk minimisation if you wish but the remarkable implication for fish is that the prey of the fish feeds on the early stages of the fish kooijman and lika 2014a which comes with a high intrinsic hazard rate uncertainty about the dynamics of survival of fry motivated many fish biologists to bypass the problem and use demographic population models where the smallest individuals have year class one assuming a recruitment rate that is independent of the standing crop treating early life stage dynamics as black box assuming some constant i e age and size independent hazard to reduce numbers does not solve the problem since this results in unrealistically few adults what is needed here is a hazard rate that is high for young small individuals and much lower for older larger ones an element of the individual environment interaction that became built into life histories during evolution specifying such a hazard rate can be done in many ways but in the context of deb theory a single parameter free way stands out what is here called thinning the hazard rate is chosen such that the feeding rate of a cohort of neonates does not change in time which fully determines the hazard rate meaning that no extra parameters are involved when individuals grow they eat more but this effect is exactly balanced by a reduction in numbers the discussion section presents a further motivation for this choice this paper first presents an extended methods section which serves as background information of the data presented on the population traits pages of the amp collection anonymous 2019a on which the analysis in this paper is based this section describes how properties of individual contribute to population growth the first preliminary results of the analysis are reported in the results section which starts with a discussion of the frequency distribution of population growth rates illustrating the role of reproduction rate puberty and thinning then we explore how population growth rate depends on patterns in the co variation of parameter values that have been identified so far body size scaling metabolic acceleration waste to hurry supply demand spectrum and altricial precocial spectrum the discussion section places our findings in a wider context the notation in this paper follows the deb notation rules kooijman 2020a 2 methods 2 1 data all data of all the 2027 species in the amp collection at sampling date 2019 11 05 that has been analysed in this paper can be found on the amp website anonymous 2019a including the references for the data the code that has been used for the parameter estimation anonymous 2019b 2019c all parameters and many implied properties of the parameters all entries in the amp collection have been curated by a team of curators the mean relative error of predictions for 3 104 data sets is just 0 07 which supports the realism of deb models and parameter values as well as the generality and applicability of deb theory all code is documented and manuals are made available this paper is a study of patterns in parameter values the data in each entry has a wide diversity among entries basic life history data such as age and size at life history events birth puberty death food intake growth reproduction respiration this diversity hampers direct comparison of species on the basis of data while most entries have ultimate weight as data relatively few entries have respiration but all entries have predicted ultimate weight and predicted respiration moreover data requires interpretation which is done by deb parameters which all have clear connections with a single underlying physiological process the newly added population traits on the amp website include graphs of the survivor functions of the survival probabilities and the stable age distribution at maximum and minimum food levels population doubling times and a list of statistics relating to the age and size structure of the population such as the mean values of powers of lengths li i 1 2 3 the yield coefficients of the macro chemical reaction equation for food to living and dead biomass at population level are also given which can be useful in the study of mass turnover at ecosystem level we here focus on first conclusions from this information provided in the amp collection 2 2 model for individuals population growth in terms of densities of individuals in a constant homogeneous environment depends on survival and reproduction while these processes depend on body size making body growth relevant for finite populations in a dynamic heterogeneous environment a lot more becomes relevant as well as indicated in the introduction the ten deb models that are used in the amp collection marques et al 2018 are all simple extensions of the standard deb model to account for extra life stages metabolic acceleration egg or foetal development detailed model specifications can be found in appendix c age zero corresponds with the start of embryo development not with birth since the models include embryo development we describe aging below since it is part of the model for individuals and thinning in the subsection on population growth since it reflects predation 2 2 1 aging the aging module of deb theory kooijman 2010b van leeuwen et al 2002 is based on the ideas that 1 damage inducing compounds e g mitochrondrial dna are formed at a rate that is proportional to the use of dioxygen which induce reactive oxygen species ros 2 damage inducing compounds form damage compounds e g modified proteins at a constant rate 3 the hazard rate is proportional to the concentration of damage compounds and 4 damage inducing compounds can produce more damage inducing compounds at a constant rate the latter rate is typically low in ectotherms but can be higher in endotherms birds mammals with the effect that the survival probability due to aging remains high for a long period relative to the life span but then suddenly collapses an implication of this two parameter deb module for aging is that the popular empirical models by weibull 1951 and gompertz 1825 are both special cases at constant food and on top of that it links to energetics via respiration it turned out to be difficult to decide which of these two empirical models fit survival data best ricklefs and scheuerlein 2002 but with the deb aging module there is no need for a choice while this does not translate to more parameters dilution by growth keeps the hazard rate low and effects of caloric restriction are found to be well captured by this module van leeuwen et al 2002 since larvae of holometabolic insects typically grow fast and reset structure during pupation only imagos suffer from aging taxa like cephalopods sport programmed death rather than aging this process is modelled by the same equations to facilitate comparison 2 2 2 reproduction the reproduction module of deb theory is based on the ideas that 1 allocation to maturation i e increase in maturity plus maturation maintenance is proportional to the mobilization of reserve 2 maturation maintenance is proportional to maturity 3 investment into maturation is redirected to filling of a reproduction buffer of reserve as soon as maturity reaches the puberty threshold level and 4 the reproduction buffer is converted to eggs or fetuses at reproduction events based on species specific buffer handling rules which can depend on physiological and or environmental cues the maximum reproduction rate r m is the mean number of offspring eggs foetuses per time averaged over many reproduction event intervals for an individual of maximum size at abundant food reproduction is here taken to be continuous which is obviously an approximation the fact that the reproduction buffer first needs to accumulate enough to produce an offspring egg or foetus reduces the specific population growth rate because of the involved waiting time but its impact rapidly decreases for increasing age at puberty kooijman 2010b fig 9 8 since this error is small relative to that induced by another more complex fact it is ignored this fact is that eggs foetuses are frequently produced in clutches litters of several to many offspring frequently in synchronisation with the seasons involving much longer waiting times even this fact is ignored since it is species specific and frequently depends on the location in the geographic area of the species and on local climate in gonochoric heterogamous species males are taken into account by halving the reproduction efficiency κr on the assumptions that the sex ratio is 1 1 and male and female eggs foetuses are equally costly only females directly contribute to the production of offspring reproduction efficiency only affects the conversion of the contents of the reproduction buffer to offspring so the idea is that half of it is lost for the production of males this is not done for hermaphroditic species nor for parthenogenic species simultaneous hermaphrodites have already a reduced κr to account for sperm production sequential hermaphrodites have no reduced κr but the age at first egg production does not coincide with puberty for protandric hermaphrodites i e first male then female 2 2 3 body growth the growth module of deb theory is based on the assumptions that 1 allocation to growth i e increase of structure plus somatic maintenance is proportional to the mobilization of reserve and 2 somatic maintenance is proportional to structure the relevance of body growth for population growth is that feeding in deb theory is linked to surface area and reproduction is linked to feeding we discuss the effect of body size on population growth in the section on body size scaling 2 3 population growth as known since malthus 1798 any population will eventually grow exponentially in a constant environment due to the fact that offspring follow the same reproduction and survival pattern as the parents the specific population growth rate r n also called the intrinsic rate of increase or the per capita growth rate or malthusian parameter can be computed by solving the characteristic also called the euler lotka or renewal equation kot 2001 pielou 1969 de roos 1997 for individuals of age a survival probability s and reproduction rate r the characteristic equation is 1 1 0 s a r a exp r n a d a we also used eq 1 to obtain the scaled functional response f 0 at which r n 0 by solving it in scaled function response f while fixing r n 0 where s as well as r depend on f this statistic quantifies the minimum environmental quality for long term survival relative to the food searching abilities of the species for f f 0 the population grows to infinity for f f 0 the population goes extinct while thinning does not affect growth or reproduction rate given food availability via f it does affect f 0 since the effect of thinning has to be compensated by reproduction given r n 0 for the standard deb model the thinning hazard amounts to h a r a 2 3 where r a d d a ln l a 3 is the specific growth rate of structure of an individual of age a and structural length l this can be seen from the feeding rate of a cohort of n 0 neonates j x n a n 0 s a j x l 2 a where j x is the surface area specific feeding rate of an individual and l its structural length by our definition of thinning this cohort feeding rate should not change in time so d d a j x n 0 while d d a l 3 l 3 r a by definition of the specific growth rate of structure and d d a s s h a by definition of the hazard rate the factor 2 3 in the expression for the thinning hazard originates from surface area being proportional to l 2 and volume to l 3 for isomorphs for v1 morphs i e individuals whose surface area increases proportional to volume which is a temporary stage in the family of a and h models marques et al 2018 j x is not a constant but is proportional to l kooijman 2014 the hazard rate for thinning amounts to h a r a species that sport metabolic acceleration temporarily behave as v1 morphs this occurs only in particular taxa typically with larval stages in this paper thinning was applied to entries for which ultimate reproduction of a fully grown adult r i 1 d 1 because absence of thinning lacks realism for these species as the population would grow theoretically at enormous rates with only aging as cause of death see introduction we found that our results are not sensitive to the value of this threshold for r i the underlying idea is that species with many tiny eggs are adapted to intense predation during the early stages they typically do not allocate more mobilised reserve to reproduction compared to species with large eggs which links egg size directly to reproduction rate 2 3 1 numerical methods and implementation the computations of the population characteristics have been done for all 2000 species of the amp collection with function amptool curation prt my pet pop of amptool anonymous 2019b which uses debtool anonymous 2019c intensively both freely downloadable software packages are written in matlab and the results are made available under population traits for each species on the amp website anonymous 2019a function prt my pet pop enables the setting of temperature scaled function response stage specific background hazard rates on top of the optional thinning hazard and the obligatory aging hazard this function can be used for species that are not yet added to the amp collection but also for existing ones in the latter case the function detects if males and females differ in parameter settings and the population characteristics take this into account we found a few cases where the scaled functional response that results in r n 0 for females is too low for males to reach puberty the specific population growth rate r n is calculated by solving the characteristic eq 1 integration of the characteristic equation has been continued till the survival probability becomes less than 10 6 using an event handler in combination with a runge kutta 4 5 method with relative and absolute tolerance of 10 9 these small tolerances turned out to be necessary for numerical stability we are looking for a non negative solution for r n since shrinking of the population cannot be a steady state if the solution exists it is unique the solution has been found with a bisection method for each of the amp entries using the upper boundary r n m that is specified by exp r n m a p r n m r m where ap is the time since birth at puberty r a 0 for a ap and r m the maximum reproduction rate at abundant food with eternal survival kooijman 2010b eq 9 21 this follows directly from the characteristic equation 1 r m a p exp r n m a d a the solution for r n m was again found with a bisection method now using r m as upper boundary but this is fast because no integration is involved 2 3 2 stable age distribution the population traits pages of the amp collection show the stable age distribution that underlie the specific population growth rate the survivor function of the stable age distribution is given by 2 s a a a exp r n t s t d t 0 exp r n t s t d t it only applies when the population grows exponentially i e balanced growth an implication of the stable age distribution is that the relative frequency decreases as function of age this rarely occurs in reality since balanced growth rarely occurs in nature yet it controls mass turnover at population level graphs of the survival probability s a and the survivor function of the stable age distribution sa a can be found in the amp website anonymous 2019a for all species with and without thinning 2 4 macro chemical reaction equation the conversion of food to living and dead biomass and faeces at the population level can be summarized by the macro chemical reaction equation x y o x o y v x v y v x v y e x e y e x e y p x p y h x h y n x n μ t x for food x living structure v dead structure v living reserve e dead reserve e faeces p dioxygen o water h and nitrogen waste n which can be ammonia urea or uric acid depending on the taxon at phylum or class level notice that these symbols stand for types not for quantities the yield coefficients y depend on the population growth rate r n that for food has been chosen equal to one as reference yields are ratios of fluxes yox is taken negative since dioxygen disappears rather than appears these mass fluxes are expressed in c mole per time one mole of glucose corresponds with 6 c moles of glucose and can like energy fluxes all be written as cubic polynomials in structural length in deb models kooijman 2010b section 4 3 1 the yield of heat on food μtx is here expressed as joules per consumed c mole of food time dropping out in the ratio the reaction equation only involves the 4 most abundant chemical elements in biomass extension to include additional elements is straight forward as long as we also include one mineral for each extra element that contains that element we exclude water loss that results from evaporation which involves a drinking rate to compensate since this involves environmental details the water balance is discussed in kooijman 2010b section 4 6 the yield of water in the macro chemical reaction equation only concerns metabolic water the reaction equation does not specify fermentation products kooijman 2010b section 4 9 1 assuming that dioxygen is not rate limiting and food is the only component that is possibly limiting situations where more than one resource is potentially limiting are discussed in kooijman 2010b chapter 5 appendix a shows how the yield coefficients depend on the population growth rate values for the yield coefficients and heat can be found on the amp website anonymous 2019a for all species the parameter values of males can differ from that of females in which case the web page reports the coefficients of two macro chemical reaction equations the package amptool anonymous 2019b in combination with debtool anonymous 2019c can generate similar local html pages where the user can set the background hazard which was set to zero for the web pages and modify the setting of other parameters to study the effects on population traits anonymous 2019a dropdown applications 3 results the script files for all figures are available in the supporting information the amp data i e all parameters individual and population traits for all species can be downloaded from the amp website anonymous 2019a dropdown collection and the required amptool anonymous 2019b and debtool anonymous 2019c from github the choice of taxa and markers can be modified in the script files the scripts produce matlab figures and clicking on a marker in these figures shows the corresponding species name the amp website can be used to check traits for that species and the empirical data from which these traits were derived 3 1 effects of reproduction puberty and thinning fig 1 left shows 4 curves that will be discussed from right to left step wise involving more traits red curve right curve if survival would be eternal s a 1 and reproduction at maximum for all ages including embryos r a r m the specific population growth rate equals maximum reproduction rate r n r m this can be seen from eq 1 under these conditions the red curve not only represents the maximum reproduction rate but also the maximum population growth rate the magenta curve in fig 1 shows that the ceiling for the maximum population growth rate r n m is quite a bit smaller while the only difference with the red curve is that reproduction is zero till puberty so survival is still eternal blue curve the maximum population growth rate itself without thinning is slightly smaller than its ceiling while the difference with the magenta curve is that reproduction just after puberty is less than maximum due to growth during the adult phase and survival is subjected to aging this means that the effect of age at puberty is much more important than the effect of aging or the fact that most species still grow and increase their reproduction rate after puberty fig 1 shows that the magenta curve for the ceiling r n m and the blue one for the population growth rate itself r n are almost identical for rates smaller than the median rates the 450 species of birds in the amp collection at 2019 11 05 play a relatively large role in this similarity they have few big offspring so small r n hardly grow as adults and have a long life span so birds actually approximate the assumptions behind the ceiling r n m for rates larger than the median rates the curves for r n m and r n deviate somewhat the 502 species of ray finned fish play a relatively large role in the explanation they produce many tiny eggs so have a large r n without thinning and grow substantially during reproduction i e slowly increasing their reproduction rate with age the effect that reproduction rate increases with age is thus somewhat more relevant for population growth for this taxon the black curve left curve in fig 1 shows that the mean effect of thinning is substantial since the black curve with thinning is almost parallel to the blue one without thinning while the rates are log transformed the effect of thinning in practice means a reduction by an almost constant factor on average not all species survive thinning i e the characteristic equation does not have a solution even for f 1 for 228 of the 2027 species these species tend to have a juvenile period that is a substantial fraction of the life span but we failed to detect simple causes fig 1 shows in the right panel that the effect of thinning is rather species specific varying from strong to almost no effect thinning has relatively little effect on large bodied species because they have a small specific growth rate of structure so a small thinning hazard 3 2 body size scaling the data covers the full range of body sizes among extant animals from the hairy back with a maximum body weight of 8 10 8 g to the blue whale of 1 6 108 g this range of a factor 2 1015 coincides with predictable shifts in parameter values that depend on the physical interpretation of parameters contrary to the other co variation rules discussed in the next subsections which involve physiological ecological and evolutionary adaptations the a priory rules for the co variation of deb parameters are based on the ideas that 1 parameters are either intensive or extensive given their physical interpretation 2 appropriate ratios of extensive parameters are intensive and 3 maximum structural length depends on three parameters one of which is extensive namely the specific maximum assimilation the co variation rules imply that the latter is proportional to maximum structural length and that all parameters can be linked to each other including traits that can be written as functions of deb parameters kooijman 1986a 2010b these rules predict that maximum population growth rate decreases with maximum structural length to the power somewhat larger than 1 kooijman 1986a 2010b our present finding of a scaling exponent of 1 09 for length or 0 23 for body weight among animal species is consistent with the expectations see fig 2 maximum size is an implied trait of energetics lika et al 2019 and large bodied species tend to have relatively more reserve which is why body weight is more than proportional to cubed structural length a scaling power with body weight of 0 20 has been found brown et al 2007 savage et al 2004 for a small set of species algae zooplankton and fish which is numerically close to our results but they explained it as a result of respiration we now discuss why our explanation differs fig 3 shows the predicted weight specific respiration as function of the predicted ultimate wet weight at 20 c and f 1 so the scaling is the same as for the specific population growth rate of the data in the amp collection see the discussion section absolute growth of structure typically increases after birth and then decreases becoming zero when an individual is fully grown fig 3 shows that the maximum population growth rate roughly equals the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth see the appendix b for its relationship with maximum specific growth of structure this appendix also shows that the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth is 1 5 times the von bertalanffy growth rate after metamorphosis the finding of the equality of rates is remarkable because population growth relates to survival and reproduction not to growth of structure directly we come back to this in the discussion endotherms tend to have a lower population growth rate compared to ectotherms despite the fact that thinning has been applied to fast reproducing species so most ectotherms 3 3 metabolic acceleration about a third of the amp species sport metabolic acceleration a temporary deviation from isomorphy where surface area is proportional to volume rather then volume2 3 kooijman 2014 kooijman et al 2011 it is quantified by the ratio of structural length at the end and the start of acceleration called the acceleration factor sm both start and end are triggered by exceeding maturity levels as result the specific maximum assimilation and energy conductance which control the mobilisation rate of reserve increase proportional to length during acceleration period this means that both parameters are multiplied by the acceleration factor to convert the situation before to after acceleration the ability to accelerate is the backbone of the family structure of deb models that are used in the amp collection marques et al 2018 we found no clear link between the population growth rate and the acceleration factor this is not shown to reduce the number of figures 3 4 waste to hurry the waste to hurry pattern in co variation of parameter values states that specific assimilation increases with specific maintenance in small bodied species that are adapted to short lasting peaks in food abundance coupled to torpor and substantial death during low food intervals this comes with a high maximum growth and reproduction kooijman 2013 not only in theory but also in data it is an implication of the κ rule of deb theory which states that a fixed fraction of mobilised reserve is allocated to soma growth of structure plus somatic maintenance it therefore seems natural to expect that waste to hurry also comes with a high specific population growth rate r n fig 3 shows however that this holds for spiralia and ecdysozoa i e 95 of all animal species but not so clearly for tetrapods the reason for this possibly relates to the fact that specific somatic maintenance p m also appears to co vary with the specific maturity at puberty e h p as shown in fig 4 an increase of maturity at puberty typically increases age at puberty and so decreases population growth while tetrapods tend to have high maturity levels at birth and puberty combined with a large ultimate body mass invertebrates have the opposite quite a few parameters are involved however which complicates the analysis why waste to hurry is impossible for large bodied species is explained in augustine et al 2019b so the waste to hurry strategy more frequently occurs among small bodied species 3 5 supply demand spectrum demand species have pre programmed growth and reproduction trajectories and eat what they need while supply species are much more flexible lika et al 2014 demand species evolved from supply species the supply stress ss quantifies the position of species in the supply demand spectrum and is defined as the maturity maintenance p j times the squared somatic one p m divided by cubed assimilation p a so s s p j p m 2 p a 3 it is body size independent and can take values between 0 and 22 33 in the context of deb theory endotherms i e birds and mammals turn out to have a high supply stress which makes them demand species reptiles amphibians and cartilaginous fish have intermediate values ray finned fish have lower values while insects are extreme supply species demand species differ in quite a few properties from supply species lika et al 2014 and tend to have a high scaled functional response to reach puberty the scaled functional response that is required to reach puberty f min has a direct relationship with the supply stress ss and the allocation fraction κ of mobilised reserve to soma which can be predicted on a priori grounds lika et al 2014 species parameter sets reveal only tiny deviations from the surface ss f min κ specified by supply stress s s f min 3 κ 2 1 κ these deviations are caused by the amount of metabolic acceleration being somewhat dependent on the scaled functional response the scaled functional response f 0 at which specific population growth rate equals zero r n 0 is very close to one required to reach puberty f min fig 5 shows that r n at abundant food is decreasing for increasing f 0 this might not come as a complete surprise since a high f 0 f min means a high supply stress ss or a low demand stress s d 4 27 s s while birds and mammals dominate demand species and have a relatively large body size so a low population growth rate the observation is ecologically important and directly relates to the supply demand spectrum the specific growth rate tends to decrease somewhat for increasing allocation fraction κ to soma see fig 6 a high value of κ means a low fraction of mobilised reserve invested in maturation so high age at puberty and reproduction so low reproduction rate which leads to a low population growth rate we did not find clear relationships between r n and ss which is surprising given the relationship between ss and f min being close to f 0 we can think of f 0 as a requirement for environmental quality but one that is strongly modified by the small half saturation constant for demand species on top of that endotherms sport another adaptation up regulation of assimilation associated to reproduction events to escape the environmental quality restrictions to some extent this is not part of the standard deb model but included in more advanced deb models the segregation of taxon specific properties can also be seen in fig 5 showing that mammals have a relatively low population growth rate the gliriformes rodents and hares have the highest population growth rate among mammals followed by the marsupials while afrotheria have the lowest but the blue whale has the lowest population growth rate of all 3 6 altricial precocial spectrum the precociality index s h b p quantifies the position of species in the altricial precocial spectrum and is defined as the ratio of the maturity at birth e h b and puberty e h p so s h b p e h b e h p this index takes values between 0 extreme altricial and 1 extreme precocial since a priory co variation rules predict that both maturities scale with cubed maximum structural length this index is expected to be independent of body size augustine et al 2019a confirmed this expectation for mammals but s h b p tends to decrease with maximum body weight for other animal taxa fig 5 shows that r n for mammals and cartilaginous fish tend to decrease somewhat with s h b p but for invertebrates and ray finned fish this is even much less clear a possible explanation for the complex relationship is that an increase in s h b p so in size at birth relative to puberty maturity co varies with size augustine et al 2011 reduces reproduction rate but also shortens waiting time till puberty which increases r n 4 discussion and conclusions a natural question that one might have is to what extent the reported population growth rates are reliable we stated in the introduction that homogeneous space constant food density and temperature absence of causes of death apart from aging and thinning do not occur in nature moreover feed backs from the environment prevent continued population growth so we cannot test reliability with empirical data potential population growth rates depend on a number of parameters at the individual level and their accuracy depends on the data that was used for estimation we do not see possibilities to test reliability but can point to another implied property that has been measured in a minority of the amp entries respiration which also depends on several parameters in the cases were it was measured the fit is good while the parameters are consistent with related species for which respiration was not measured thinning may partly solve a problem for theoretical population dynamics which is implied by deb theory van der meer 2016 in homogeneous space and time individuals in an individual based model ibm tend to synchronise their life cycles where the young generation out competes the adults kooijman 2010b upon reaching puberty synchronously the newly produced offspring again out competes the existing generation the fact that food shortage impacts growth more the larger the individual induces synchronisation this is a structural property of deb models for isomorphs i e organisms that do not change shape during ontogeny the reason is that the scaled functional response needs to exceed structural length as fraction of the maximum to grow so the larger the individual the higher the minimum food level must be this behaviour poses problems for the theoretical study of population properties as implied by deb theory we need to understand model implications in simple situations before we can interpret their implications on more realistic situations the reduction of the synchronisation effect motivated us to link thinning to food consumption we know that synchronisation can also be reduced by allowing for scatter in parameter values among individuals kooijman 2010b and spatial or temporal heterogeneity but these routes complicate the mathematical analysis we see the progress reported in this paper as a first step in a long series with use of the reported yield coefficients we will eventually be able to test popular assumptions such as the maximisation of entropy dissipation at the population level sousa et al 2006 the amp collection was already instrumental to test another popular assumption that of the maximization of reproductive output which was found to be strongly at odds with evidence kooijman and lika 2014b meanwhile the amp collection grew from 276 in that paper to 2027 species at present only further supporting its conclusions we now also better understand why the allocation fraction to soma and so to reproduction follows a beta distribution among species lika et al 2019 we found that the specific population growth rate r n and the weight specific respiration scale with maximum body weight to the power 0 23 and 0 24 respectively these values are very close to kleiber s empirical value 0 25 for weight specific respiration kleiber 1932 and in view of the scatter in data these values can considered to be the same deb theory explains both types of scaling kooijman 1986a 2010b but also shows that the relationship between population growth and respiration is only incidental population growth depends on reproduction and survival reproduction treated as export of wrapped reserve in deb theory hardly contributes to respiration since the chemical composition of freshly laid eggs and reserve are the same whereas the contribution of feeding for fuelling egg production to respiration was experimentally excluded in kleiber s data we showed that the second most important determinant of population growth is age at puberty it also does not have a straightforward relationship with respiration we believe that the similarity of these and other scaling powers hampered the evolution of ecological thinking substantially since the popularity of linking a wide variety of quantities directly to metabolic rate with allometric functions huxley 1932 we see metabolism as a network of interrelated processes and the quantification of fluxes through this network by a single number has strong limitations is the similarity in scaling of specific population growth and respiration with maximum body mass then purely coincidental we suggest that it might be caused by the equality of specific population growth with the specific growth of structure at maximum growth as reported in the results section the latter has a much more direct relationship with respiration via growth overheads what then causes the equality of these growth rates if we look at a population of unicellulars which multiply by division then growth of individuals can be accurately approximated by that of v1 morphs this is because the detailed morphology of the growth curve does not matter much if cell structural volume maximally doubles since birth for a population of unicellular v1 morphs the specific population growth rate actually equals the specific growth rate of structure conceptually kooi and kooijman 1994 since for v1 morphs the difference between populations and individuals disappears since animals evolved from unicellulars the equality of both specific growth rates might be an evolutionary relict while body growth controls population growth in unicellulars with a limited role of survival reproduction including age at puberty and a more complex role of survival controls population growth in animals but it seems that the average population growth rate among species remained unaffected in the transition notice that maximum specific growth rate equals the specific growth rate at maximum growth in dividing unicellulars but not so in animals where the latter rate took control if our interpretation holds while conversion efficiency from food to biomass at the individual level is controlled by physiological factors as quantified by deb theory that at population level is controlled by ecological factors where the role of physiology is reduced to setting boundary conditions kooijman 1992 the yield coefficients of the macro chemical reaction equation are sensitive to the background hazard as can be explored using the debtool anonymous 2019c and amptool anonymous 2019b packages conclusions of this research are as follows some 11 of the species do not survive thinning the maximum population growth rate about equals the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth for most taxa if thinning applies for fast reproducing species but the scatter is substantial the match is exact for organisms that divide rather than reproduce and we suggest the equality for animals to be an evolutionary relict the maximum population growth rate decreases approximately with maximum weight to the power 0 25 among species as predicted a priori this is the same as for weight specific respiration which is also predicted a priori but these predictions show that there is no direct link between population growth and respiration the scatter in population growth rates at the reference temperature for a given specific growth rate of structure amounts to a factor 100 and is higher for invertebrates compared to vertebrates even if thinning applies for fast reproducing species the waste to hurry strategy of increasing growth and reproduction by increasing assimilation and somatic maintenance simultaneously translates in a clear positive relationship between somatic maintenance and population growth for ecdysozoa and spiralia but not for tetrapods we present the explanation the maturity level at puberty depends on maintenance for tetrapods the scaled functional response at which the population growth rate is zero is very close to that at which puberty can just be reached in absence of thinning and somewhat increased in presence of thinning the specific population growth rate decreases for increasing for minimum functional response we present an explanation specific population growth rate decreases for increasing precociality index for mammals and cartilaginous fish but not so for invertebrates and ray finned fish we suggest an explantation like other traits the population growth rate shows considerable segregation among taxa where mammals have a relatively low rate glires a relatively high rate among mammals followed by marsupials and afrotherians the lowest ones we found a new interpretation for the von bertalanffy growth rate 1 5 times this rate equals the specific growth rate at maximum growth acknowledgements sa was supported by the norwegian science council nfr 255295 nm was supported by

b specific growth at maximum growth vs maximum specific growth of structure the paper talks about the specific growth rate of structure at maximum growth we here work out its relationship with a related quantity the postnatal maximum specific growth of structure for the standard deb model with zero surface area related somatic maintenance and abundant food f 1 postnatal growth i e change in

312 and the specific growth rate at this length is r m k m 2 1 1 g the implication is that the specific growth at maximum growth relates in a simple way to the von bertalanffy growth rate r m 3 2 r b as far as we know this is a new interpretation of the von bertalanffy growth rate the specific growth rate of structure only decreases after birth making it maximum at birth so at l l b and has the value k m l m l b 1 1 1 g so if l m 3 2 l b the maximum specific growth of structure exceeds the specific growth at maximum growth of structure which is typically the case the specific growth rate of structure at the start of embryo development is infinitely large so we excluded the embryo stage here appendix c amp model specification the notation follows the rules described in kooijman 2020a add

24847,the leaf area index lai is one of the most important structural and functional attributes of forests this is determined by indirect methods such as digital hemispheric photography dhp because is simple to use at the field level but it does not reflect the spatial variability of forest stands at a larger scale therefore there is increasing interest for using satellite images to estimate lai this study aims to calibrate and validate models for lai in populus canadensis moench p deltoides p nigra stands based on two spectral indices the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi obtained from sentinel 2 the experiment was carried out in poplar stands established in the maule region chile the reference lai was obtained using dhp and was regressed against the spectral index through a linear quadratic and sum of sine models within the study the linear models for both indices presented the lowest adjustment parameters with a root mean square error rmse close to 0 3 and r2 less than 0 5 on the other hand the quadratic models and sum of sine for the savi were higher than ndvi with r2 of 0 57 mean absolute error mae of 0 22 rmse of 0 25 and for the 1 1 ratio the slope of the curve is 0 99 despite the homogeneity observed at the field level and the sources of error this study showed a good degree of adjustment for the quadratic and sum of sine models for determining lai these models are presented as an excellent tool to estimate lai large area of poplar keywords leaf area index lai sentinel 2 hemispherical photographs savi ndvi

red band l soil gloss component rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error ef model efficiency ef 5 s slope 1 background the leaf area index lai is one of the main variables to understand many of the physiological processes that occur in many forest species it is defined as the leaf surface per ground surface that to say lai leaf area ground area m2 m2 chen et al 2002 asner et al 2003 le marie et al 2012 jiapaer et al 2017 fang et al 2019 lai is directly related to light interception canopy photosynthesis evapotranspiration and energy balance asner et al 2003 zhang et al 2005 le marie et al 2012 on the other hand it is quickly affected by biotic or abiotic factors such as disease damage nutritional or water stress which reduce the mass of leaves in the tree deng et al 2006 darvishzadeh et al 2008 zheng and moskal 2009 the lai can be measured through direct and indirect methods in the direct methods destructive it is necessary to collect leaves from the tree and in the indirect methods non destructive calibrated instruments are used to measure this variable asner et al 2003 ryu et al 2010 jiapaer et al 2017 fang et al 2019 the destructive methods are much more precise since the amount of leaves in the tree per m2 of soil is determined in a real way but they are very slow and costly to do jonckheere et al 2004 while the non destructive methods focus on the distribution and arrangement of leaves in the tree by estimating the number of leaves and branches present breda 2003 this method is not as accurate but much simpler to carry and less invasive jonckheere et al 2004 both methods are difficult to implement in large forested areas since they require many measurements which are costly and impossible to perform in a short period of time ryu et al 2010 because direct measurements of lai are typically time consuming and expensive macfarlane et al 2007 chianucci and cutini 2013 some indirect methods are preferred in forest areas using a lai 2000 device li cor incorporated lincoln nebraska usa and digital hemispherical photographs dhp from fisheye cameras bréda 2003 orlando et al 2015 jiapaer et al 2017 these indirect methods are based on the analysis of the gap fraction and gap size which allow estimating the plant area index pai however it is not able to distinguish between leaves branches or trunk jiapaer et al 2017 then for lai determination the portion corresponding to wood biomass must be discounted from pai bréda 2003 fang et al 2019 in this respect it has been shown that dhp measurements correlate better with lai than lai 2000 measurements zhang et al 2005 orlando et al 2015 however the use of dhp might work better on trees with low canopy display and underestimate lai in other cases asner et al 2003 zhang et al 2005 for example chianucci and cutini 2013 found underestimation of 11 7 3 0 when comparing destructive methods with dhp corrected by the clumping index ci in a deciduous forest in central italy on the other hand gardingen et al 1999 found that using an analysis of ring segmentation with the dhp method improved the estimation of lai from 50 to 15 for a canopy of quercus pubescens in scotland in turn khabba et al 2009 when comparing the vegetation area index vai only green leaves of orange trees obtained by dhp and lai 2000 methods with direct destructive measurements observed an underestimation error of 11 and 14 respectively therefore when the dhp are taken under optimal conditions without direct light exposure and are analyzed using a ring segmentation the estimation of lai is acceptable and close to reality gardingen et al 1999 bréda 2003 zhang et al 2005 macfarlane et al 2007 although it still has a 10 20 error in forested areas species fang et al 2019 although instruments such as fisheye cameras allow a good estimate of lai and are simple to use they do not allow obtaining information in a large forest exploitation or natural areas colombo et al 2003 zhang and kovacs 2012 santos et al 2016 on the other hand using remote sensing methods from satellite imagery s through the energy reflected from the plant cover allow extracting relevant information from large productive areas that can be used to estimate physiological and productive behavior of plants in a simple way and in short periods of time asner et al 2003 deng et al 2006 zhang and kovacs 2012 this relevant information corresponds to spectral bands which represent a specific point of the electromagnetic spectrum such as for example green 560 nm red 650 nm near infrared 842 nm etc from these it is possible to general different vegetative index which are calculated from these bands and allow better characterization of the plant cover of the plant according to different points of interest under this concept lai has a good relationship with different widely used spectral indices including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and soil adjusted vegetation index savi darvishzadeh et al 2008 zhao and popescu 2009 le marie et al 2012 zhang and kovacs 2012 in any case the use of the indices should be calibrated for different forest species such as populus canadensis moench since it is possible to observe a saturation in the estimate for some specimens that have very high values of lai zhao and popescu 2009 zhang and kovacs 2012 in the forestry sector models have been used to determine lai from satellite images such as l a i ln 0 69 s a v i 0 59 0 91 used by santos et al 2016 to calculate lai in the amazon forest of brazil other more complex studies carried out from machine learning have sought to determine which spectral bands are the most relevant for different variables under study verrelst et al 2013 poplar is a species that increases in importance in the mediterranean area of central chile due to its high growth rate and the possibility of use for different manufactured products besides having great potential as biomass marron et al 2003 lei et al 2006 cañete salinas et al 2019 unfortunately in most of the mediterranean areas of the world as in the case of chile the periods of drought or lack of rainfall are increasing ipcc 2014 cañete salinas et al 2019 for this reason knowing the behavior of lai is of utmost importance for companies producing poplar due to its relationship with physiological variables such as hydric response and photosynthetic capacity or the presence of plagues and diseases marron et al 2003 eitel et al 2006 lei et al 2006 however this information must be obtained in large productive areas in order to provide an effective management tool in the field which can be achieved with the use of spectral indices calculated from satellite images eitel et al 2006 although models used by authors like santos et al 2016 have shown good results in areas of natural forests their use in commercial plantations is not clear because it is not known if free satellite images have sufficient resolution to are capable of detecting the spatial variability of biophysical parameters in homogeneous forest stands achieved by forest management practices colombo et al 2003 the ci is very different in poplars growing in natural conditions compared to commercially controlled poplars with a defined spatial structure plantation spacing ryu et al 2010 for these reasons it is essential to study the interaction between different spectral indices and specific vegetation conditions by means of models that allow estimating lai chen et al 2002 colombo et al 2003 the present research aims to development and validate models to estimate lai on commercial poplar stands based on two spectral indices related to vegetation the ndvi and savi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was carried out in commercial poplar stands of two populus canadensis moench p deltoides p nigra i 214 and i 488 of 6 5 hectares in total planted at a spacing of 6 6 m low density of 277 trees hectare 1 by the compañía agrícola y forestal el álamo near the town retiro maule region chile 36 05 ls 71 45 lw 470 m a s l the trees studied were 8 and 9 years old respectively so their cups were at the highest point of development as they were adult trees this area has a mediterranean climate with a prolonged dry season occurring between november and march the mean temperature for winter june september and summer december march are 8 c and 22 2 c respectively whereas annual precipitation is 1 150 mm and concentrated almost entirely in winter soils at the study site are derived from recent volcanic ash with a high concentration of organic matter 10 to 15 and over one meter depth to date the stands have been managed intensively site preparation consisted of plowing at a depth of 40 cm and disking weed control was done mechanically by disking twice per growing season pruning was applied every year due to the high fertility of the soils no fertilizer was applied to the trees stands are irrigated with approximately 8 000 m3 per hectare of water cañete salinas et al 2019 2 2 leaf area measurement in the field six plots were randomly distributed in the stand and their coordinates recorded using a global positioning system laptop etrex 20x garmin kansas united states to account for the temporal variation at each point each plot was measured at the beginning november middle january and end march of the growing season 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 at each sampling date seven digital hemispheric photographs dhp were taken at each of the sampling points which is represented by 6 trees 12 12 m using a nikon coolpix 4300 digital camera with a nikon fc e8 hemispherical converter lens figure 1 macfarlane et al 2007 the camera was configured to use the fisheye lens to work without direct sunlight for each photograph the lens was carefully levelled and pointing toward the top of the canopy in ideal conditions of luminosity sunrise according to zhang et al 2005 afterward photographs were processed in the laboratory using the software hemisfer 2 2 swiss federal institute for forests snow and landscape research all of the canopy parameters were calculated following the methodology described by ridler and calvard 1978 to improve the contrast between the sky and the canopy only the blue channel of dhp was used because it decreases the scattering of the sky and increases the leaf absorption jonckheere et al 2005 each dhp was divided into 5 rings of 15 width but only the first three rings were used because they represent the space used by the canopy fig 2 from the image analysis lai was estimated from pai and woody component was excluded or removed from the leaf estimate stem and branches breda 2003 for this pictures were taken in the winters of each season july obtaining the woody area index wai to then exclude this value from the pai broeckx et al 2015 fang et al 2019 finally the value of lai per plot was estimated then averaged totaling 36 measurements 6 sampling points 3 dates per growing season 2 growing seasons 2 3 satellite image a satellite image from the sentinel 2 msi sensor drusch et al 2012 was obtained for the same day or close to it of each leaf area measurement this satellite was used because it is the one with the highest spatial resolution within the free options and easy access for any user images were downloaded using the usgs global visualization viewer https earthexplorer usgs gov and were carefully selected from clear days no clouds and geometrically and radiometrically corrected moreover the images were atmospherically corrected using the sen2cor algorithm louis et al 2016 to obtain surface reflectance finally a total of 13 spectral bands were extracted using the software qgis version 2 18 las palmas g c fig 3 team qd 2018 each satellite image used has a spatial resolution of 10 m while each measurement point had a dimension of 12 m so one pixel represents the value of each measurement point 2 4 model construction and evaluation of lai models a total of 36 points six per date were collected in the experiment and 24 points were used to construct the lai models and 12 points were used to evaluate the models a random selection of the points was carried out at each season that is from the eighty points evaluated per season twelve were left for model construction and six for model evaluation for the construction of the model two spectral indices were used ndvi 1 and savi 2 which were considered as independent variables huete 1988 fig 3 1 ndvi n i r r n i r r 2 savi 1 l n i r r n i r r l l 0 5

each of the ndvi and savi spectral indices three models were created one linear one quadratic and one with the sum of the sine function the final models are as follows ndvi models 3 y 3 6969 ndvi 1

model evaluation the statistical analysis used for comparison between the simulated and observed lai values was adapted from mayer and butler 1993 and included the following statistical criteria root mean square error rmse 3 mean absolute error mae 4 and model efficiency ef 5 on the other hand as an adjustment parameter of the models the slope linear relation 1 1 s and determination coefficient r2 were included 9 rmse i 1 n y o b s y e s t 2 n 10 m a e i 1 n y o b s y e s t n 11 e f 1 i 1 n y o b s y e s t 2 i 1 n y o b s y o b s 2 where yobs is the value of lai determined by the dhp yest is the value estimated by the different models tested y o b s is the average of the values of lai determined by the dhp and n is the number of observations 3 results 3 1 seasonal changes in lai measurement a broad range of lai values were recorded during the study 0 84 to 2 25 table 1 interestingly lai peaked in the spring november and decreased slightly toward the middle of the growing season january the lai values recorded in autumn end of march was approximately half of those values recorded in spring in general at each measurement date low variation in lai was observed between sampling plots coefficient of variation 0 05 to 0 25 conversely in average between date 1 november and date 2 january there was a greater decrease in the lai for season 2 from 2 09 to 1 77 than in season 1 from 2 04 to 1 97 that is to say during season 1 the leaves stayed longer on the tree 3 2 model development and evaluation for both cases ndvi and savi the linear models proved to be inferior when representing the behavior of the data reaching values of r2 close to 0 5 fig 4 this is because linear models do not represent lai dynamics during a growing season for example in mediterranean climates where lack of water is important at the end of february there is a rapid decrease in lai which would not be represented by this type of model however the quadratic and sum of sine models are able to better estimate lai showing a downward curve for values higher than 1 5 and having r2 values between 0 68 and 0 7 respectively in the construction of the model the best fit was achieved by the model s quadratic and sum of sine in both spectral indices reaching r2 value above 0 68 fig 4 therefore the relationship between the spectral indices and the lai measured with dhp does not have a linear relationship hence the relationship is best represented by alternative models during the evaluation the linear models poorly predicted the lai behavior reaching the lowest adjustment parameters r2 was less than 0 4 and rmse was over 3 fig 5 table 2 this is consistent with what was observed during the development of the model making it clear that for both spectral indices a linear curve is not capable of representing the development of this variable in any of the two seasons for both the ndvi and savi the quadratic and the sum of sine models had similar behavior with both models being surpassed by the savi fig 5 table 2 for the ndvi the quadratic and the sum of sine models had a rmse of 0 26 mae of 0 22 ef of 0 67 and an r2 that varied between 0 41 and 0 43 on the contrary both models for the savi had a higher r2 close to 0 56 and a slightly higher ef 0 7 but similar rmse and mae with the ndvi table 2 4 discussion in the literature it is not possible to find lai values for commercial low density plantations 6 6 nor during the second growth period after 5 years of age regardless of this according to the lai values available in the literature for other types of plantations the values found in this experiment would be quite homogeneous for example pellis et al 2004 who in a study of 17 different poplar clones found differences in lai between 2 1 and 5 8 in short rotation coppice on the other hand broeckx et al 2015 in high density poplars 8000 trees ha 1 in a study carried out during 4 seasons found lai values between 0 97 to 5 49 in a way this behavior in our experiment of the lai was expected since the trial was carried out on a relatively small area 6 5 hectares where clones of the same parental origin were evaluated in turn all of the trees were managed with the same planting spacing 6 6 they were also handled in the same way and the same pruning treatments were carried out during the growth cycle which favored the homogeneity of the trees this becomes extremely important since it directly affects the vegetation cover and the practical implementation of the lai models proposed in this research as discussed previously the influence of forest management carried out by the company cause a high homogeneity in the tree studied this condition of homogeneity decreases the adjustment of the model because there is little variability the model is not able to capture all possible cases as it could be in other conditions in this sense it would be desirable to have more sample in a database as broad and variable as possible to be able to interpret a wide variability of different lai values although a greater variability would give robustness to the model verrelst et al 2013 it would not necessarily be an improvement in the accuracy which will depend on the relationship of the lai with the evaluated indices therefore expecting r2 values greater than 0 8 errors less than 0 2 or a high ef over 0 85 would be unlikely for the high homogeneity conditions observed in this experiment regarding the construction of the model independent of the correct adjustment obtained by both models quadratic and sum of sine in the evaluated indices in all cases lai is underestimated by the model this behavior was expected since references were made to how indirect methods determining lai tend to underestimate it gardingen et al 1999 khabba et al 2009 chianucci and cutini 2013 fang et al 2019 as previously discussed the savi proved to have better adjustment parameters when compared to the ndvi in this sense the savi being an index that allows eliminating the reflectivity of the soil works better in conditions where vegetation coverage is low or null huete 1988 on the contrary the ndvi works better in areas where vegetation coverage is higher and the canopy does not give space to the soil due to forest management practices carried out in the forest stand plantation spacing of 6 6 it is easy to find areas sectors within the forest where the trees do not cover the area assigned to each plant thus the use of indices that eliminate soil influence could be presented as a better alternative to use in these conditions independent of the fact that the ndvi works worse than the savi in conditions of low growth it has also been observed that this index could present problems to clearly discriminate the soil of the vegetation these limitations were described by chen et al 2004 who used ikonos satellite images and observed that for the ndvi it is not possible to separate the proportions among the vegetation coverings for coniferous forests which generates errors that prevent the correct performance of this type of application in this condition without total coverage on the other hand according to huete 1988 the value l 0 5 used in the equation for the savi calculation is optimal for these conditions since it considers an intermediate vegetation density between the space used by the soil and leaves this cannot be corroborated by this study since we do not have the necessary information for the calculation of this index which could be between 0 5 to 1 considering the space used by the vegetation leaves is greater than the space used by the soil on the other hand blinn et al 2019 proposes other spectral indexes such as the normalized difference moisture index ndmi to estimate the lai in loblolly pine plantation according to its results this index obtains the highest linear relationship with lai measurements made in the ground even above the ndvi and savi the ndmi is an index related to the moisture content in plant tissues which when worked in pine forests with a higher percentage of vegetation cover and therefore greater tendency to humid areas a high is expected correlation on the contrary in this study the vegetative cover is low due to the plantation spacing 6 6 and that the poplars still did not reach their maximum foliar expansion and in turn they are dry environments since it is a mediterranean climate with a dry season of 6 months growing season in the southern hemisphere on the other hand blinn et al 2019 states that for high lai values saturation is generated this phenomenon is also observed in this study but to a lesser extent since the lai values presented by poplars are well below those seen in pines in the mentioned study over to 5 as previously mentioned for the spectral index savi the quadratic model and the sum of sine model were those that obtained the best results highest adjustment parameters being quite similar among them table 2 this happens since for high lai values both models are not able to keep growing and therefore underestimate the real lai values therefore both models explain the relationship between both variables much better than a linear model for the conditions of this study it is difficult to decide which of the two models is better since both get similar results and were capable of modeling lai behavior according to studies such as that carried out by colombo et al 2003 it would have been interesting to have more information that is greater variability in the data which would have allowed us to determine which of the two models worked best under this scope for future studies it is essential to consider a larger area different age ranges and different soil conditions among others for example trees from 1 to 5 years have a lower lai than trees at their peak of growth 7 to 10 years having had this information the variability in the information would have increased in order to have all the possible lais to be observed in large forest areas although both models based on the savi showed good modeling of lai behavior the adjustment parameters are not the best for example the rmse and mae were higher than 0 2 which is a high value considering that the lai varied between 0 84 and 2 25 table 2 this could be due to several reasons the size used for this test was 6 5 hectares which is small considering that the spatial resolution pixel of the sentinel 2 used in this test is 10 m drusch et al 2012 instead it would have been interesting to have more dhp measurement points inside the orchard in order to correspond with a higher number of pixels within the satellite image chen et al 2004 using different vegetational indices from the ikonos satellite to measure vegetation cover obtained r2 of 0 55 in natural forests when comparing it with the effective lai of the canopy this result is similar to this study but it is not comparable since one was carried out in conditions of high variability natural forest heterogenous and another in conditions of low variability commercial stand with a defined planting spacing homogenous unfortunately it is difficult to find similar models under commercial conditions like the ones in this study therefore their comparison is complicate another factor that is significant in the study is the underestimation or overestimation of the lai for each of the methodologies in general according to the bibliography the lai obtained through dhp is underestimated gardingen et al 1999 khabba et al 2009 chianucci and cutini 2013 but it is not clear how the relationship with the lai obtained remotely by satellite imagery would be that is if one of the methodologies underestimates while the other overestimates it could generate overlap that would improve the results of this trial finally it would have been interesting to use analytical tools such as artificial neural networks since they allow to look for all possible combinations between the spectral bands and their relationship with forest management variables such as lai at the same time some programs currently allow controlled management of neural networks where not only mathematical algorithms are used but also the investigator s expert criteria have weight unfortunately this type of analysis requires a more extensive database which was not possible to perform in this study darvishzadeh et al 2008 5 conclusion the models that that had the best result was the quadratic and sum of sine models of the savi spectral index these models obtained an r2 of 0 57 had low errors close to 0 2 and a high ef 0 7 although these models represent a good first approximation to obtain lai in a field of commercial poplars it is necessary to implement some improvements to expand the variability of the information collected among these we must consider a larger study area a greater number of hybrids different ages different planting frames and a larger production area for the trial this in order to increase the heterogeneity of the information having low lai for example of young trees and high lai of trees at their peak of growth in turn it would be important to consider the spatial variability of the plantation which may have important differences in lai in one stand or another due to microclimatic differences of soil among others it would have been interesting to incorporate the use of neural networks which would allow exploring other model options for the spectral bands used and through a correct analysis improve the results obtained in this publication

24847,the leaf area index lai is one of the most important structural and functional attributes of forests this is determined by indirect methods such as digital hemispheric photography dhp because is simple to use at the field level but it does not reflect the spatial variability of forest stands at a larger scale therefore there is increasing interest for using satellite images to estimate lai this study aims to calibrate and validate models for lai in populus canadensis moench p deltoides p nigra stands based on two spectral indices the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi obtained from sentinel 2 the experiment was carried out in poplar stands established in the maule region chile the reference lai was obtained using dhp and was regressed against the spectral index through a linear quadratic and sum of sine models within the study the linear models for both indices presented the lowest adjustment parameters with a root mean square error rmse close to 0 3 and r2 less than 0 5 on the other hand the quadratic models and sum of sine for the savi were higher than ndvi with r2 of 0 57 mean absolute error mae of 0 22 rmse of 0 25 and for the 1 1 ratio the slope of the curve is 0 99 despite the homogeneity observed at the field level and the sources of error this study showed a good degree of adjustment for the quadratic and sum of sine models for determining lai these models are presented as an excellent tool to estimate lai large area of poplar keywords leaf area index lai sentinel 2 hemispherical photographs savi ndvi

many of the physiological processes that occur in many forest species it is defined as the leaf surface per ground surface that to say lai leaf area ground area m2 m2 chen et al 2002 asner et al 2003 le marie et al 2012 jiapaer et al 2017 fang et al 2019 lai is directly related to light interception canopy photosynthesis evapotranspiration and energy balance asner et al 2003 zhang et al 2005 le marie et al 2012 on the other hand it is quickly affected by biotic or abiotic factors such as disease damage nutritional or water stress which reduce the mass of leaves in the tree deng et al 2006 darvishzadeh et al 2008 zheng and moskal 2009 the lai can be measured through direct and indirect methods in the direct methods destructive it is necessary to collect leaves from the tree and in the indirect methods non destructive calibrated instruments are used to measure this variable asner et al 2003 ryu et al 2010 jiapaer et al 2017 fang et al 2019 the destructive methods are much more precise since the amount of leaves in the tree per m2 of soil is determined in a real way but they are very slow and costly to do jonckheere et al 2004 while the non destructive methods focus on the distribution and arrangement of leaves in the tree by estimating the number of leaves and branches present breda 2003 this method is not as accurate but much simpler to carry and less invasive jonckheere et al 2004 both methods are difficult to implement in large forested areas since they require many measurements which are costly and impossible to perform in a short period of time ryu et al 2010 because direct measurements of lai are typically time consuming and expensive macfarlane et al 2007 chianucci and cutini 2013 some indirect methods are preferred in forest areas using a lai 2000 device li cor incorporated lincoln nebraska usa and digital hemispherical photographs dhp from fisheye cameras bréda 2003 orlando et al 2015 jiapaer et al 2017 these indirect methods are based on the analysis of the gap fraction and gap size which allow estimating the plant area index pai however it is not able to distinguish between leaves branches or trunk jiapaer et al 2017 then for lai determination the portion corresponding to wood biomass must be discounted from pai bréda 2003 fang et al 2019 in this respect it has been shown that dhp measurements correlate better with lai than lai 2000 measurements zhang et al 2005 orlando et al 2015 however the use of dhp might work better on trees with low canopy display and underestimate lai in other cases asner et al 2003 zhang et al 2005 for example chianucci and cutini 2013 found underestimation of 11 7 3 0 when comparing destructive methods with dhp corrected by the clumping index ci in a deciduous forest in central italy on the other hand gardingen et al 1999 found that using an analysis of ring segmentation with the dhp method improved the estimation of lai from 50 to 15 for a canopy of quercus pubescens in scotland in turn khabba et al 2009 when comparing the vegetation area index vai only green leaves of orange trees obtained by dhp and lai 2000 methods with direct destructive measurements observed an underestimation error of 11 and 14 respectively therefore when the dhp are taken under optimal conditions without direct light exposure and are analyzed using a ring segmentation the estimation of lai is acceptable and close to reality gardingen et al 1999 bréda 2003 zhang et al 2005 macfarlane et al 2007 although it still has a 10 20 error in forested areas species fang et al 2019 although instruments such as fisheye cameras allow a good estimate of lai and are simple to use they do not allow obtaining information in a large forest exploitation or natural areas colombo et al 2003 zhang and kovacs 2012 santos et al 2016 on the other hand using remote sensing methods from satellite imagery s through the energy reflected from the plant cover allow extracting relevant information from large productive areas that can be used to estimate physiological and productive behavior of plants in a simple way and in short periods of time asner et al 2003 deng et al 2006 zhang and kovacs 2012 this relevant information corresponds to spectral bands which represent a specific point of the electromagnetic spectrum such as for example green 560 nm red 650 nm near infrared 842 nm etc from these it is possible to general different vegetative index which are calculated from these bands and allow better characterization of the plant cover of the plant according to different points of interest under this concept lai has a good relationship with different widely used spectral indices including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and soil adjusted vegetation index savi darvishzadeh et al 2008 zhao and popescu 2009 le marie et al 2012 zhang and kovacs 2012 in any case the use of the indices should be calibrated for different forest species such as populus canadensis moench since it is possible to observe a saturation in the estimate for some specimens that have very high values of lai zhao and popescu 2009 zhang and kovacs 2012 in the forestry sector models have been used to determine lai from satellite images such as l a i ln 0 69 s a v i 0 59 0 91 used by santos et al 2016 to calculate lai in the amazon forest of brazil other more complex studies carried out from machine learning have sought to determine which spectral bands are the most relevant for different variables under study verrelst et al 2013 poplar is a species that increases in importance in the mediterranean area of central chile due to its high growth rate and the possibility of use for different manufactured products besides having great potential as biomass marron et al 2003 lei et al 2006 cañete salinas et al 2019 unfortunately in most of the mediterranean areas of the world as in the case of chile the periods of drought or lack of rainfall are increasing ipcc 2014 cañete salinas et al 2019 for this reason knowing the behavior of lai is of utmost importance for companies producing poplar due to its relationship with physiological variables such as hydric response and photosynthetic capacity or the presence of plagues and diseases marron et al 2003 eitel et al 2006 lei et al 2006 however this information must be obtained in large productive areas in order to provide an effective management tool in the field which can be achieved with the use of spectral indices calculated from satellite images eitel et al 2006 although models used by authors like santos et al 2016 have shown good results in areas of natural forests their use in commercial plantations is not clear because it is not known if free satellite images have sufficient resolution to are capable of detecting the spatial variability of biophysical parameters in homogeneous forest stands achieved by forest management practices colombo et al 2003 the ci is very different in poplars growing in natural conditions compared to commercially controlled poplars with a defined spatial structure plantation spacing ryu et al 2010 for these reasons it is essential to study the interaction between different spectral indices and specific vegetation conditions by means of models that allow estimating lai chen et al 2002 colombo et al 2003 the present research aims to development and validate models to estimate lai on commercial poplar stands based on two spectral indices related to vegetation the ndvi and savi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was carried out in commercial poplar stands of two populus canadensis moench p deltoides p nigra i 214 and i 488 of 6 5 hectares in total planted at a spacing of 6 6 m low density of 277 trees hectare 1 by the compañía agrícola y forestal el álamo near the town retiro maule region chile 36 05 ls 71 45 lw 470 m a s l the trees studied were 8 and 9 years old respectively so their cups were at the highest point of development as they were adult trees this area has a mediterranean climate with a prolonged dry season occurring between november and march the mean temperature for winter june september and summer december march are 8 c and 22 2 c respectively whereas annual precipitation is 1 150 mm and concentrated almost entirely in winter soils at the study site are derived from recent volcanic ash with a high concentration of organic matter 10 to 15 and over one meter depth to date the stands have been managed intensively site preparation consisted of plowing at a depth of 40 cm and disking weed control was done mechanically by disking twice per growing season pruning was applied every year due to the high fertility of the soils no fertilizer was applied to the trees stands are irrigated with approximately 8 000 m3 per hectare of water cañete salinas et al 2019 2 2 leaf area measurement in the field six plots were randomly distributed in the stand and their coordinates recorded using a global positioning system laptop etrex 20x garmin kansas united states to account for the temporal variation at each point each plot was measured at the beginning november middle january and end march of the growing season 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 at each sampling date seven digital hemispheric photographs dhp were taken at each of the sampling points which is represented by 6 trees 12 12 m using a nikon coolpix 4300 digital camera with a nikon fc e8 hemispherical converter lens figure 1 macfarlane et al 2007 the camera was configured to use the fisheye lens to work without direct sunlight for each photograph the lens was carefully levelled and pointing toward the top of the canopy in ideal conditions of luminosity sunrise according to zhang et al 2005 afterward photographs were processed in the laboratory using the software hemisfer 2 2 swiss federal institute for forests snow and landscape research all of the canopy parameters were calculated following the methodology described by ridler and calvard 1978 to improve the contrast between the sky and the canopy only the blue channel of dhp was used because it decreases the scattering of the sky and increases the leaf absorption jonckheere et al 2005 each dhp was divided into 5 rings of 15 width but only the first three rings were used because they represent the space used by the canopy fig 2 from the image analysis lai was estimated from pai and woody component was excluded or removed from the leaf estimate stem and branches breda 2003 for this pictures were taken in the winters of each season july obtaining the woody area index wai to then exclude this value from the pai broeckx et al 2015 fang et al 2019 finally the value of lai per plot was estimated then averaged totaling 36 measurements 6 sampling points 3 dates per growing season 2 growing seasons 2 3 satellite image a satellite image from the sentinel 2 msi sensor drusch et al 2012 was obtained for the same day or close to it of each leaf area measurement this satellite was used because it is the one with the highest spatial resolution within the free options and easy access for any user images were downloaded using the usgs global visualization viewer https earthexplorer usgs gov and were carefully selected from clear days no clouds and geometrically and radiometrically corrected moreover the images were atmospherically corrected using the sen2cor algorithm louis et al 2016 to obtain surface reflectance finally a total of 13 spectral bands were extracted using the software qgis version 2 18 las palmas g c fig 3 team qd 2018 each satellite image used has a spatial resolution of 10 m while each measurement point had a dimension of 12 m so one pixel represents the value of each measurement point 2 4 model construction and evaluation of lai models a total of 36 points six per date were collected in the experiment and 24 points were used to construct the lai models and 12 points were used to evaluate the models a random selection of the points was carried out at each season that is from the eighty points evaluated per season twelve were left for model construction and six for model evaluation for the construction of the model two spectral indices were used ndvi 1 and savi 2 which were considered as independent variables huete 1988 fig 3 1 ndvi n i r r n i r r 2 savi 1 l n i r r n i r r l l 0 5 where nir near infrared band channel 8 spectral resolution 842 nm spatial resolution 10 m r red band channel 4 spectral resolution 665 nm spatial resolution 10 m and l soil gloss component 0 5 for each of the ndvi and savi spectral indices three models were created one linear one quadratic and one with the sum of the sine function the final models are as follows ndvi models 3 y 3 6969 ndvi 1 1343 4 y 36 889 ndvi 21 799 ndv i 2 13 596 5 y 2 018 s i n e 4 997 n d v i 3 651 savi models 6 y 4 6899 s a v i 0 2444 7 y 37 337 savi 39 075 sav i 2 6 873 8 y 2 051 s i n e 6 466 s a v i 4 772 for model evaluation the statistical analysis used for comparison between the simulated and observed lai values was adapted from mayer and butler 1993 and included the following statistical criteria root mean square error rmse 3 mean absolute error mae 4 and model efficiency ef 5 on the other hand as an adjustment parameter of the models the slope linear relation 1 1 s and determination coefficient r2 were included 9 rmse i 1 n y o b s y e s t 2 n 10 m a e i 1 n y o b s y e s t n 11 e f 1 i 1 n y o b s y e s t 2 i 1 n y o b s y o b s 2 where yobs is the value of lai determined by the dhp yest is the value estimated by the different models tested y o b s is the average of the values of lai determined by the dhp and n is the number of observations 3 results 3 1 seasonal changes in lai measurement a broad range of lai values were recorded during the study 0 84 to 2 25 table 1 interestingly lai peaked in the spring november and decreased slightly toward the middle of the growing season january the lai values recorded in autumn end of march was approximately half of those values recorded in spring in general at each measurement date low variation in lai was observed between sampling plots coefficient of variation 0 05 to 0 25 conversely in average between date 1 november and date 2 january there was a greater decrease in the lai for season 2 from 2 09 to 1 77 than in season 1 from 2 04 to 1 97 that is to say during season 1 the leaves stayed longer on the tree 3 2 model development and evaluation for both cases ndvi and savi the linear models proved to be inferior when representing the behavior of the data reaching values of r2 close to 0 5 fig 4 this is because linear models do not represent lai dynamics during a growing season for example in mediterranean climates where lack of water is important at the end of february there is a rapid decrease in lai which would not be represented by this type of model however the quadratic and sum of sine models are able to better estimate lai showing a downward curve for values higher than 1 5 and having r2 values between 0 68 and 0 7 respectively in the construction of the model the best fit was achieved by the model s quadratic and sum of sine in both spectral indices reaching r2 value above 0 68 fig 4 therefore the relationship between the spectral indices and the lai measured with dhp does not have a linear relationship hence the relationship is best represented by alternative models during the evaluation the linear models poorly predicted the lai behavior reaching the lowest adjustment parameters r2 was less than 0 4 and rmse was over 3 fig 5 table 2 this is consistent with what was observed during the development of the model making it clear that for both spectral indices a linear curve is not capable of representing the development of this variable in any of the two seasons for both the ndvi and savi the quadratic and the sum of sine models had similar behavior with both models being surpassed by the savi fig 5 table 2 for the ndvi the quadratic and the sum of sine models had a rmse of 0 26 mae of 0 22 ef of 0 67 and an r2 that varied between 0 41 and 0 43 on the contrary both models for the savi had a higher r2 close to 0 56 and a slightly higher ef 0 7 but similar rmse and mae with the ndvi table 2 4 discussion in the literature it is not possible to find lai values for commercial low density plantations 6 6 nor during the second growth period after 5 years of age regardless of this according to the lai values available in the literature for other types of plantations the values found in this experiment would be quite homogeneous for example pellis et al 2004 who in a study of 17 different poplar clones found differences in lai between 2 1 and 5 8 in short rotation coppice on the other hand broeckx et al 2015 in high density poplars 8000 trees ha 1 in a study carried out during 4 seasons found lai values between 0 97 to 5 49 in a way this behavior in our experiment of the lai was expected since the trial was carried out on a relatively small area 6 5 hectares where clones of the same parental origin were evaluated in turn all of the trees were managed with the same planting spacing 6 6 they were also handled in the same way and the same pruning treatments were carried out during the growth cycle which favored the homogeneity of the trees this becomes extremely important since it directly affects the vegetation cover and the practical implementation of the lai models proposed in this research as discussed previously the influence of forest management carried out by the company cause a high homogeneity in the tree studied this condition of homogeneity decreases the adjustment of the model because there is little variability the model is not able to capture all possible cases as it could be in other conditions in this sense it would be desirable to have more sample in a database as broad and variable as possible to be able to interpret a wide variability of different lai values although a greater variability would give robustness to the model verrelst et al 2013 it would not necessarily be an improvement in the accuracy which will depend on the relationship of the lai with the evaluated indices therefore expecting r2 values greater than 0 8 errors less than 0 2 or a high ef over 0 85 would be unlikely for the high homogeneity conditions observed in this experiment regarding the construction of the model independent of the correct adjustment obtained by both models quadratic and sum of sine in the evaluated indices in all cases lai is underestimated by the model this behavior was expected since references were made to how indirect methods determining lai tend to underestimate it gardingen et al 1999 khabba et al 2009 chianucci and cutini 2013 fang et al 2019 as previously discussed the savi proved to have better adjustment parameters when compared to the ndvi in this sense the savi being an index that allows eliminating the reflectivity of the soil works better in conditions where vegetation coverage is low or null huete 1988 on the contrary the ndvi works better in areas where vegetation coverage is higher and the canopy does not give space to the soil due to forest management practices carried out in the forest stand plantation spacing of 6 6 it is easy to find areas sectors within the forest where the trees do not cover the area assigned to each plant thus the use of indices that eliminate soil influence could be presented as a better alternative to use in these conditions independent of the fact that the ndvi works worse than the savi in conditions of low growth it has also been observed that this index could present problems to clearly discriminate the soil of the vegetation these limitations were described by chen et al 2004 who used ikonos satellite images and observed that for the ndvi it is not possible to separate the proportions among the vegetation coverings for coniferous forests which generates errors that prevent the correct performance of this type of application in this condition without total coverage on the other hand according to huete 1988 the value l 0 5 used in the equation for the savi calculation is optimal for these conditions since it considers an intermediate vegetation density between the space used by the soil and leaves this cannot be corroborated by this study since we do not have the necessary information for the calculation of this index which could be between 0 5 to 1 considering the space used by the vegetation leaves is greater than the space used by the soil on the other hand blinn et al 2019 proposes other spectral indexes such as the normalized difference moisture index ndmi to estimate the lai in loblolly pine plantation according to its results this index obtains the highest linear relationship with lai measurements made in the ground even above the ndvi and savi the ndmi is an index related to the moisture content in plant tissues which when worked in pine forests with a higher percentage of vegetation cover and therefore greater tendency to humid areas a high is expected correlation on the contrary in this study the vegetative cover is low due to the plantation spacing 6 6 and that the poplars still did not reach their maximum foliar expansion and in turn they are dry environments since it is a mediterranean climate with a dry season of 6 months growing season in the southern hemisphere on the other hand blinn et al 2019 states that for high lai values saturation is generated this phenomenon is also observed in this study but to a lesser extent since the lai values presented by poplars are well below those seen in pines in the mentioned study over to 5 as previously mentioned for the spectral index savi the quadratic model and the sum of sine model were those that obtained the best results highest adjustment parameters being quite similar among them table 2 this happens since for high lai values both models are not able to keep growing and therefore underestimate the real lai values therefore both models explain the relationship between both variables much better than a linear model for the conditions of this study it is difficult to decide which of the two models is better since both get similar results and were capable of modeling lai behavior according to studies such as that carried out by colombo et al 2003 it would have been interesting to have more information that is greater variability in the data which would have allowed us to determine which of the two models worked best under this scope for future studies it is essential to consider a larger area different age ranges and different soil conditions among others for example trees from 1 to 5 years have a lower lai than trees at their peak of growth 7 to 10 years having had this information the variability in the information would have increased in order to have all the possible lais to be observed in large forest areas although both models based on the savi showed good modeling of lai behavior the adjustment parameters are not the best for example the rmse and mae were higher than 0 2 which is a high value considering that the lai varied between 0 84 and 2 25 table 2 this could be due to several reasons the size used for this test was 6 5 hectares which is small considering that the spatial resolution pixel of the sentinel 2 used in this test is 10 m drusch et al 2012 instead it would have been interesting to have more dhp measurement points inside the orchard in order to correspond with a higher number of pixels within the satellite image chen et al 2004 using different vegetational indices from the ikonos satellite to measure vegetation cover obtained r2 of 0 55 in natural forests when comparing it with the effective lai of the canopy this result is similar to this study but it is not comparable since one was carried out in conditions of high variability natural forest heterogenous and another in conditions of low variability commercial stand with a defined planting spacing homogenous unfortunately it is difficult to find similar models under commercial conditions like the ones in this study therefore their comparison is complicate another factor that is significant in the study is the underestimation or overestimation of the lai for each of the methodologies in general according to the bibliography the lai obtained through dhp is underestimated gardingen et al 1999 khabba et al 2009 chianucci and cutini 2013 but it is not clear how the relationship with the lai obtained remotely by satellite imagery would be that is if one of the methodologies underestimates while the other overestimates it could generate overlap that would improve the results of this trial finally it would have been interesting to use analytical tools such as artificial neural networks since they allow to look for all possible combinations between the spectral bands and their relationship with forest management variables such as lai at the same time some programs currently allow controlled management of neural networks where not only mathematical algorithms are used but also the investigator s expert criteria have weight unfortunately this type of analysis requires a more extensive database which was not possible to perform in this study darvishzadeh et al 2008 5 conclusion the models that that had the best result was the quadratic and sum of sine models of the savi spectral index these models obtained an r2 of 0 57 had low errors close to 0 2 and a high ef 0 7 although these models represent a good first approximation to obtain lai in a field of commercial poplars it is necessary to implement some improvements to expand the variability of the information collected among these we must consider a larger study area a greater number of hybrids different ages different planting frames and a larger production area for the trial this in order to increase the heterogeneity of the information having low lai for example of young trees and high lai of trees at their peak of growth in turn it would be important to consider the spatial variability of the plantation which may have important differences in lai in one stand or another due to microclimatic differences of soil among others it would have been interesting to incorporate the use of neural networks which would allow exploring other model options for the spectral bands used and through a correct analysis improve the results obtained in this publication

ecotracer routine were used to simulate the concentrations of 137cs in the ocean and the biota in order to serve as baseline and to estimate the initial conditions for impact scenarios results of the ecopath model were checked against pre balance prebal diagnostics for integrity 137cs was shown to bioaccumulate with increases in trophic level and has a tendency to biomagnify generally for fish species the dominant pathway of contaminant accumulation was through diet whereas for invertebrates it was through respiration ecotracer was able to accurately model the expected concentrations in organisms that had existing concentration ratio data from field measurements and also make predictions on biota lacking concentration data in 2010 using national fishery landing statistics for the four prefectures and predicted whole body concentrations of 137cs it is estimated that the apparent direct and indirect human food supply of 137cs from fisheries to the market was 46 1 mbq keywords marine ecosystem modelling ecopath with ecosim ecotracer fukushima 137cesium 1 introduction the great east earthquake the subsequent tsunami and nuclear power accident in japan on 11 march 2011 caused a significant loss of life and also eroded a way of life for the people who inhabited the coastal villages that were involved in fishing activities komatsu 2017 the earthquake and tsunami caused significant damage to fishing infrastructure vessels gear and fishing grounds japan fishery agency 2012 while the nuclear power accident caused the release of large amounts of 137cs into the ocean affecting the marine life after the tsunami caused meltdowns at the fukushima dai ichi nuclear plant aoyama et al 2016 kaeriyama 2017 wada et al 2016 although other radionuclides were released in the ocean such as 131i and 134cs it is 137cs that is of concern because of its relatively long half life of around 30 years international atomic energy agency 2007 and the potential radiation doses and associated risk to marine biota and humans from the consumption of seafood fisher et al 2013 in order to understand the direct ecological effects it is necessary to examine the state of the marine environment prior to the accident and the role fishing activities had on the marine environment before 2011 presented here is an ecopath with ecosim ewe ecosystem model for the marine waters of the four prefectures of iwate miyagi fukushima and ibaraki that were most affected by the tsunami and subsequent nuclear accident our study area of approximately 220 000 km 2 focuses on the marine ecosystem for the year 2010 from the shoreline to the 200 nautical mile boundary of the exclusive economic zone eez the region where both the coastal and offshore fisheries occur and which is under the influence of both the kuroshio and oyashio currents these two currents affect the ecosystem and the fisheries in the area when the cooler oyashio current expands southward into the area there is an increase in biomass of most notably sardines and alaska pollock when the warmer waters of the kuroshio current dominate there is an increase in zooplankton biomass and a shift towards higher biomasses of japanese common squid and anchovy yatsu et al 2013 the southward extension of the oyashio current would also result in waters of a lower 137cs concentration being brought into the area whereas the northern movement of the kuroshio would bring in water with higher concentrations of 137cs into the region hirose and aoyama 2003 the modelled area generally has a narrow coastal shelf extending out to 40 km although around sendai bay it extends to 70 km the continental slope is also narrow and depths at the japanese trench can reach 9000 m but shallows to 5000 m at the extent of the exclusive economic zone where there is an abyssal plain international atomic energy agency 2015 iaea 2015 however in our study we limit the zone to an average of 1000 m to reflect the taxonomic composition of sampled species that form the basis of the functional groups in the ecopath model coastal fisheries occur within 5 km from the shore and offshore fisheries occur from 5 km of the shore to the boundary of the eez yamamoto 1985 fisheries landings from japan s ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries maff 2014 and monitoring data of cesium concentrations data in the ocean water nozaki et al 1998 hirose and aoyama 2003 povinec et al 2004 and in marine organisms kasamatsu and ishikawa 1997 yamada et al 1999 were available for the study area although the earthquake caused the release of large amounts of cesium into the ocean from direct and atmospheric releases there had been previous impacts from 137cs on the marine environment from nuclear testing during the 1960s and to a lesser extent from the chernobyl event in 1986 duran et al 2004 smith et al 2017 in order to describe the state of the marine environment and the amounts of 137cs present prior to its release from the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant accident the ewe modelling software was used ewe has largely been used for describing marine ecosystems e g polovina 1984 assessing the state of marine ecosystems in comparison to earlier states e g cox et al 2002 providing information on emergent properties e g libralato et al 2006 and being used as a fishery management tool to look at effects of changing biomasses linked to policy changes or climate change niiranen et al 2013 however here we also deployed the ecotracer contaminant module to describe the flow of 137cs in the organisms and environment ecotracer has been used to trace the flow of several pollutants in the marine environment including mercury booth and zeller 2005 radionuclides in the baltic sea sandberg et al 2007 and in the irish sea tierney et al 2017 the aim of our study was to have a description of the biomass flows including the biomasses at each trophic level and the marine trophic index mti pauly and watson 2005 to be able to reflect the state of the marine ecosystem prior to the closure of the fishery after the accident to serve as a baseline prior to the nuclear accident the concentration of 137cs in the environment and biota are estimated as well we examine the bioaccumulation of 137cs in the marine ecosystem and estimate the apparent human food supply of 137cs to the market in 2010 from fishery landings despite recent corrections to the underlying computer code to the ecotracer routine walters and christensen 2018 several suggestions are also made to improve the routine to enhance its capabilities 2 methods we describe the marine food web through an ecopath with ecosim food web model consisting of 55 biological groups and one detritus group included are the removal of 24 aquatic organisms reported in the 2010 capture fishery statistics maff 2014 functional groups were considered to be coastal e g shallow flounders offshore e g bathydemersals or occurring throughout the entire area e g mackerels the ecopath model was validated using pre balance prebal diagnostics link 2010 and was constructed adhering to best practices guidelines heymans et al 2016 we estimated starting 137cs concentrations for water and biota in 2010 using data from the 1990s water column concentrations which resulted from nuclear bomb testing in the 1960s and to a lesser extent from the chernobyl accident in 1986 aoyama and hirose 1995 were decay corrected to 2010 additional marine inputs from low level radioactive effluents from the nuclear plants in fukushima are ignored as they were assumed to be negligible duran et al 2004 similarly scavenging of 137cs by particulate matter was ignored because it is considered to be limited to less than 1 t in the open ocean aoyama and hirose 1995 and even after the fukushima accident sediment trap data revealed that the removal rate of 137cs on sinking particles was 1 2 per year buesseler et al 2017 for organisms reported concentrations ratios from the 1990s were used along with the decay corrected water concentration to estimate concentrations in biota physical decay rates based on the half life of 137cs were applied to both the water and functional groups the model was run forward in time using the ecosim component to estimate potential concentrations in functional groups and species that lacked such data under environmental steady state conditions given that 137cs concentrations are considered to be well mixed and spatially homogenous we did not undertake a spatial temporal assessment it is outside the scope of this work to describe in detail all the specific numerical methods contained within the ewe modeling framework however a brief description of the master equation used in the ecopath component is given as well as for ecotracer the two main components used within this study 2 1 ecopath ecopath with ecosim uses a trophic mass balance approach for the ecopath component which in its simplest formulation ensures that the amount of consumption and the fisheries yield on a group species does not exceed its production polovina 1984 to account for biomass changes such as those from regime shifts a biomass accumulation term can be used as well if necessary immigration and emigration can be dealt with using net migration consumption rates of predators are used along with diet compositions of prey items to estimate the amount of consumption of prey items and mortality rates from non predation events such as old age and disease are incorporated as other mortality christensen and walters 2004 thus the production of a group species p i can be defined as 1 p i y i b i m 2 i e i b a i b i m o i where y i is the fisheries catch rate t km 2 year 1 of i b i is the biomass t km 2 for group i m2 i is the total predation rate year 1 for group i e i represents the net migration rate emigration immigration t km 2 year 1 ba i is the biomass accumulation rate for group i mo i is the other mortality rate year 1 for group i another form of the equation christensen et al 2005 which is useful in terms of the input requirements for the ewe modeling interface is to re express eq 1 in terms of the input parameters required for ewe as 2 b i p b i e e i j 1 n b j q b j d c j i y i e i b a i where p b i is the production to biomass ratio for group i ee i represents the ecotrophic efficiency or the amount of production used within the system and is a value between 0 and 1 b j is the biomass of each predator group feeding on group i q b j is the consumption to biomass ratio of each predator group feeding on group i and dc ji is the fraction of prey group i in the diet of each predator group j in this form if the emigration and accumulation terms are ignored then it is conveniently seen that in essence the production of a group is equal to the consumption plus fisheries of that group for each group in ecopath the diet composition and any fishery catches must be entered and depending on the state of the ecosystem or type of organisms estimates of biomass accumulation and emigration can be entered also all but one of the remaining parameters i e b p b ee and q b must be entered for each group as the mass balance routine can estimate the missing term christensen et al 2005 the mti reflecting the state of the fishery landings of high trophic level fishes in 2010 is given for the cut off point at tl 3 25 3 25mti as suggested in pauly and watson 2005 the mti was calculated using the weighted mean catch by trophic level i e mti tl i y i y i where tl i is the trophic level of a group and y i is the reported landings 2 1 1 groups the species and groups represented in the model are formed from the types of information available from a database created from the monitoring on radioactivity level in fisheries products which covers the years 2011 2016 and provides information on 137cs levels in marine aquatic organisms after the fukushima accident japan fisheries agency 2017 the 263 species sampled in the four prefectures were retained as individual groups or were placed in functional groups for modeling purposes contaminant dietary landings and habitat data were used for this purpose we combined species of similar ecological roles into functional groups using a scoring system based on the number of 137cs samples taken per year an index of 1 was given to those species which were sampled more than twice in each year in a prefecture and a score of 4 was given to species not sampled in a prefecture a score of 2 was given to those species that were sampled once each year in each prefecture and a 3 for being sampled at least once over the sampling period species that scored a value between 1 and 2 25 were considered to be candidates as individual species in the model after appraising fisheries statistics and the dietary data available japanese fisheries statistics are mostly reported at group level e g flatfishes however several species relevant in the model area are reported individually including tunas thunnus orientalis t alalunga t obesus and t albacares skipjack katsuwonus pelamis round herring etrumeus teres anchovy engraulis japonicus saury cololabis saira cod gadus macrocephalus alaska pollock gadus chalcogramma atka mackerel pleurogrammus monopterygius yellowtails seriola quinqeradiata and the common scallop patinopectin yessoensis of these independently reported species in the fishery statistics only cod scored an index of 1 however olive flounder which is not reported independently in the fisheries statistics also scored an index of 1 had good data concerning biomass shibata et al 2017 and thus was represented individually in the model landings reported at the group level were disaggregated assuming the catches in the group were of high medium or low levels other individual fish species in the model were marbled flounder pleuronectes yokohamae flathead flounder hippoglossoides dubius japanese jack mackerel trachurus japonicus and fat greenling hexagrammos otakii these species had a score of 1 5 2 0 2 0 and 2 25 respectively marbled and flathead flounder were split from the group flatfishes as reported in the japanese fishery statistics and both had seasonal diet data japanese jack mackerel is reported separately in the fisheries statistics and diet data were available from japan tanaka et al 2006 fat greenling had both dietary data and a detailed study of 137cs present in the muscle tissues near the accident site shigenobu et al 2014 alaska pollock was also chosen because of it being reported separately in official statistics and it had a detailed diet study by depth in japan yamamura et al 2002 the remaining species data from the database were grouped to form functional groups taxonomy diet depth of occurrence and size all played a role in forming the groups primary producers are represented by phytoplankton and algae and zooplankton consist of three types based on diet herbivorous copepods omnivorous mysids ostracods and some non gammarid amphipods and carnivorous chaetognaths hyperiidea and coelenterates a group of detritivores are also included that consist of isopods gammarids cumaceans and cladocerans the krill species euphausia pacifica is allocated to its own group and includes a fishery of approximately 5 600 tonnes a simple representation of the macrobenthic compartment comprises nine functional groups and includes bivalves gastropods annelids sea urchins sea cucumbers shrimp omnivores and predators seastars and the group crabs and lobsters 2 1 2 diet matrix several factors are important in the trophic modelling of marine organisms including seasonal spatial and foraging depth variations when possible we used local dietary data that was collected seasonally and by depth as different prey items can be associated by both factors seasonality can affect prey species availability and for non pelagic species depth can be an important factor in determining diet due to it affecting age stratification for most functional groups quantitative data concerning the wet weight were used but for some groups diets were only qualitatively described supplementary data 1 unassimilated consumption the portion of a prey item not assimilated was assumed to be 0 2 for all groups excluding herbivorous zooplankton and omnivorous zooplankton which were set to 0 4 and 0 3 respectively this was done to reflect the lower food quality i e phytoplankton in the diet 2 1 3 ecopath parameters b p b q b and ee biomass estimates were made for 19 groups based on stock assessments used for a model of the northwestern pacific e g pacific cod watari et al 2018 scaled to the local area or for zooplankton groups on previously published estimates on production liu et al 2005 combined with species composition data ikeda et al 2008 for groups without biomass data it was assumed that the ecotrophic efficiencies ee were 0 95 which enabled the mass balance routine to estimate the biomass the ecotrophic efficiency of a group describes the amount of production used within the modeled ecosystem for groups with b p b and q b data the ee is estimated by the mass balancing routine the production to biomass ratio for fish groups can be considered to be the natural mortality rate plus the fishing mortality rate i e p b f m allen 1971 values for fish groups were taken or calculated from a variety of sources including watari et al 2018 from stock assessments using estimates of natural and fishing mortality or by assuming a production to consumption ratio p q ranging between 0 1 and 0 3 which is consistent with bioenergetics theory in cases where the natural mortality was used in conjunction with fishing mortality the estimate of m was based on an empirical estimate pauly 1980 values for invertebrates were either taken from an ecopath model for the bering sea aydin et al 2002 assuming a p q value of 0 2 or from local japanese data ikeda et al 2008 mori et al 2009 taki 2006 phytoplankton values were based on liu et al 2004 and algae based on the range reported by mann 1973 and schwinghamer et al 1989 detritus was based on an empirical formula pauly et al 1993 assuming a euphotic depth of 30 meters the consumption to biomass ratio q b defines the amount of food consumed by a group empirical estimates of q b for fish groups rely on using estimates of weight w the tail s aspect ratio and temperature heymans et al 2016 the aspect ratios for tails were found for the groups mackerels westneat and wainwright 2001 medium pelagics collette 1978 westneat and wainwright 2001 and small pelagics palomares and pauly 1998 westneat and wainwright 2001 and these were used to estimate the q b on the empirical relationship for the remaining fish groups the life history tool and the average depth of occurrence in fishbase froese and pauly 2018 were used along with a temperature profile fujii and kamachi 2003 to estimate q b for zooplankton and krill it was assumed that the p q was between 0 2 and 0 3 estimates for shrimp were taken from coll et al 2007 and the rest were taken from a model for the bering sea aydin et al 2002 the widespread use of ecological network models such as ewe of variable quality has led to the call for a measure of quality control link 2010 in order to improve model parameters and for aiding management bodies in the evaluation of model integrity several indicators of the prebal diagnostics are used to check for model integrity heymans et al 2016 link 2010 several of these diagnostics are presented including those for p b the gross food conversion efficiency p q biomass and q b across trophic levels and ratios of biomass all parameter estimates for b p b and prebal diagnostics are found in the supplementary material supplementary data 1 2 2 ecotracer the ecotracer sub routine can be used once an ecopath model is in mass balance ecotracer is adaptable to using different units depending on the contaminant and the concentrations found in the natural environment and the type of data available thus the sub routine can use different measurements including mass e g grams and radioactivity bq but considers the environment as a spatial area i e km2 to match the underlying ecopath model inputs an important consequence of this capability is the necessity to maintain consistency in units in the environmental and biological compartments in this model the contaminant measure in the environment occurs in a spatial area i e bq km 2 whereas the radioactivity in biological groups are entered as amounts bq and can be transformed into group biomass concentrations i e bq t 1 by the program ecotracer tracks the flow of a contaminant in the environment and the biological groups represented in a model through time christensen et al 2005 walters and christensen 2018 the amount of a contaminant in a group in this case 137cs is dependent on the intakes and losses intake amounts come from direct uptake rates i e respiration the fraction retained from trophic interactions and immigration losses arise from natural decay processes metabolic losses and emigration ecotracer is based on a standard dynamic transfer model e g landrum et al 1992 thomann 1981 i e 3 d c i t d t α i β i c i t where α i represents the gains from direct uptake from the environment plus the gains from diet and β i represents the losses due to physical decay and elimination rates which are dependent upon the group s concentration c i however ecotracer expands upon the standard dynamic transfer model by including several other terms important in an ecosystem context including migration predatory losses other mortality and fisheries another important difference is that for biological compartments the contaminant level is based on the amount of contaminant in a dietary item i e bq rather than the concentration bq t 1 and the uptake rate from food is dependent upon the parameters used in the ecopath model to describe the amount taken in from all dietary sources thus the gains bq year 1 to a group are dependent upon a direct uptake rate its diet and immigration i e 4 α i μ i b i c o a e i j p r e y q j i a j b j c i i i where c o represents the environmental concentration bq km 2 b i is the biomass t of group i μ i is the direct absorption rate proportionality co efficient linking the direct uptake rate bq km 2 yr 1 to the parameters of biomass t km 2 and environmental concentration bq km 2 ae i is the assimilation efficiency and is the fraction of 137cs within food items that is assimilated q ji is the consumption rate t year 1 of group j by group i a j is the amount bq of the contaminant present in group j and b j is the biomass of prey group j t c i is the group biomass concentration bq t 1 and i is the immigrating biomass t year 1 the losses from a group β i a i are attributed to predation fisheries other mortality excretion and decay i e 5 β i a i j p r e d q i j b i f i m o i e i m i d i a i where q ij is the rate of consumption t year 1 of group i due to predation by j f i is the fishing mortality rate year 1 mo i year 1 is the other mortality rate i e non predation mortality e i is the emigrating biomass rate year 1 m i year 1 is the excretion and or metabolic rate and d i year 1 is the physical decay rate these rates are multiplied by a i the amount of contaminant bq in each group i excretory products that are released from tissues to the environment are added to the environmental concentration the ecotracer approach is dynamic and extends the basic concentration ratio cr approach but the cr approach is contained within it as 6 c r i a i b i c o μ i a e i q j i b i c r j z i m i the environment is also dependent on gains and losses taking place in the environment gains originate from the release of contaminants into the environment as a base inflow rate and from the excretion from organisms losses originate from the direct uptake by organisms from the environment physical decay rates and base volume exchange thus the environmental compartment can be modeled as 7 d c o t d t α i β i c o t where α i represents the gains in the environment and β i represents the losses to the environment in ecospace the gains are from both additional inputs into the environment and from biota such that 8 α i b i i n m i a i where bi is the base inflow rate bq km 2 year 1 to the environment and m i a i are the excretory products from all organisms within the environment losses from the environment are due to biological physical and environmental volume changes such that 9 β i c o d i v i c o i n μ i b i c o where d i represents the decay rate year 1 and v i represents the base volume exchange loss year 1 temporal changes through the environmental concentration co can be made by applying a forcing function to the base inflow rate or through a contaminant concentration driver file the amount of contaminant in the detritus compartment originates from the unassimilated consumption resulting from predation as well as non predation mortality thus groups feeding on detritus will have exposure levels associated with the contributions from the fraction of unassimilated consumption from all groups initial concentrations in the biota and environment are also input parameters to be used if data is available 2 2 1 ecotracer input the initial environmental concentration was based on a dataset covering the north pacific ocean the 137cs surface water concentration of 2 1 bq m 3 for 1998 which represents the mid latitude areas of the western pacific ocean including the southern half of the sea of japan was used after it was decay corrected to the year 2010 box 2 hirose and aoyama 2003 a depth profile of 137cs for the japanes trench nozaki et al 1998 formed the basis for the starting concentrations the depth profile curve was decay corrected to the 2010 surface water concentration value and then an average value was calculated from 0 to 1000 m since below this depth 137cs concentrations approached zero for functional groups with reported crs initial amounts at the start of the simulation i e bq were based on the cr estimated water concentrations and the estimated biomass of the various functional groups for fish groups concentration ratios crs for taxa in japan were used kasamatsu and ishikawa 1997 yamada et al 1999 with the estimated water concentration from surface waters to 246 m since the reported crs were all for coastal species and this depth is a typical water depth boundary between coastal waters and the continental slope for macroalgae cr data were available for the study area tateda and koyanagi 1996 and for phytoplankton the iaea weighted arithmetic mean was used iaea 2014 for herbivorous zooplankton an average cr 8 0 was used from data collected in the western north pacific ocean from samples containing greater than 89 of their biomass as copepods kaeriyama et al 2008 for omnivorous zooplankton the iaea recommended value of 40 was used iaea 2004 and for carnivorous zooplankton a cr was estimated so that the average value for all zooplankton groups was the iaea recommended value functional groups without reported crs had an initial amount of zero with the resulting concentration being estimated by the ecotracer routine groups in the model with and without a reported cr were checked to see if they had a normal distribution using the shapiro wilk s test and the two medians were compared using a welch s t test using rstudio v 3 5 1 to evaluate ecotracer the observed activity values of groups with reported cr values were plotted against the predicted values for the same groups and the root mean square error is given piñeiro et al 2008 the direct absorption rate for the two primary producers were based on their cr i p i b i ratio excretion rate m i and the physical decay rate d i of 137cs assuming equilibrium conditions walters and christensen 2018 such that 10 μ i c r i p i b i m i d i where the p b ratio for algae includes the harvest rate of seaweeds this equation can be derived by setting the derivative of eq 3 to zero substituting the definition of cr i and solving for μi for consumers the direct absorption rate must also account for predation losses and under equilibrium conditions it can be calculated as walters and christensen 2018 11 μ i c i e q j p r e d q i j b i p i b i m i d i a e i j p r e y q j i a j b j b i c o where the first term in the numerator represents the losses due to predation q ij b i total mortality p i b i excretion m i and decay d i and the second term represents the gains from consumption of prey items the proportion of contaminant excreted i e 1 ae i is the amount of 137cs that does not enter tissues after ingestion fish species were assumed to have an ae of 0 8 which is slightly higher than that corresponding to laboratory experiments undertaken with juvenile fishes but within the ranges reported 0 54 0 88 in these studies mathews and fisher 2008 mathews et al 2008 pan and wang 2016 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2001 as data for adult fishes from laboratoty experiments are lacking for 6 groups mackerels piscivorous reef fish pelagic neritic piscivores squid small and medium pelagics the direct absorption rate i e μi was set to zero and eq 11 was solved for the ae as the losses were less than the gains from dietary items for invertebrates the reported ae of 0 16 were used for annelids wang et al 2016 and bivalves pan et al 2016 and 0 5 for gastropods wang et al 2000 crabs and lobsters wang et al 2016 it was assumed that sea urchins sea stars and octopus had an ae of 0 5 herbivorous and omnivorous zooplankton have an ae 0 65 mathews and fisher 2008 and omnivorous shrimp krill detritivores and sea cucumbers were assumed to have the same value for carnivorous zooplankton and predatory shrimp an ae of 0 7 was used under the assumption that their prey were of higher food quality primary producers were assigned a value of 1 the physical decay rate is based on the radioactive half life of 137cs of 30 09 years iaea 2007 excretion rates from a variety of lab studies were transformed from daily rates to yearly rates and for primary producers an excretion rate from a model for the same area was used belharet et al 2016 the reported lab data was used to perform a regression analysis using trophic level tl as the predictor variable to estimate the excretion rates for all groups supplementary data 2 2 3 contaminant risk for all groups in the model ecotracer is able to estimate concentrations or burdens leading to the ability to estimate risk through time through such metrics as biomagnification factors and to also make comparisons to regulatory limits prior to the accident the regulatory limit for 137cs in seafood products in japan was 500 bq kg 1 but was lowered to 100 bq kg 1 one year after the accident povinec et al 2013 we estimate the apparent human food supply of 137cs from fishery landings and the measured or estimated concentrations of 137cs in the group from fisheries landings yi and the 137cs concentration in group i cs i as y i cs i in order to assess the behavior of 137cs in the ecosystem we examine its ability to bioaccumulate using a biomagnification factor bmf i e a predator s concentration of 137cs relative to its prey as defined by mackay et al 2018 for each group we calculate the bmf as pred i dc ji prey j where pred i is the concentration of 137cs in predator i dc ji is the diet fraction of prey item j in the diet of predator i and the concentration of 137cs in each prey item j prey j 3 results 3 1 ecopath the calculated biomass from the model representing the eez of all four prefectures in eastern japan iwate miyagi fukushima and ibaraki from the coast to the exclusive economic zone comprising 55 biological groups plus detritus suggests that the combined biomass was 391 7 t km 2 of the 55 biological groups large sharks and large pelagics occupied the highest trophic level at 4 8 fig 1 biomass totals are 12 8 t km 2 for primary producers macroalgae and phytoplankton 181 8 t km 2 for groups at the second trophic level 2 00 2 86 while those at trophic level 3 trophic levels 3 00 to 3 87 and 4 trophic levels 4 00 to 4 78 have 48 3 t km 2 and 2 8 t km 2 respectively detritus has a mass of 146 0 t km 2 the lower biomass of primary producers compared to the biomass at the second trophic level is possible because of the much higher production rate of phytoplankton table 1 total biomass production is estimated to be 3 160 t km 2 year 1 with primary producers accounting for 72 6 groups in trophic level 2 account for 24 6 of the yearly production those at tl 3 account for 2 7 while groups at tl 4 account for less than 0 05 per cent of the production the total capture fishery landings within the model area are 594 000 tonnes 2 70 t km 2 and were dominated by three species with the largest reported landings being mackerels 146 000 t saury 64 000 t and anchovy 54 000 t which together provide 50 of the landings the 3 25mtifor fisheries landings of 496 508 t is 3 81 the thermodynamic constraints heymans et al 2016 for ecotrophic efficiency ee 1 0 and gross food efficiencies 0 1 p q 0 3 are both met table 1 net efficiencies ne p q respiration to assimilated biomass ratio ra rb 1 0 respiration to biomass ratio ra b and the production to respiration ratio p ra 1 0 are also within the range of expected values supplementary data 1 the respiration to biomass ratio is expected to be highly variable and generally they range from 1 100 year 1 depending upon the group and here they fall between 0 89 for large sharks and 24 48 for krill ees for groups without biomass estimates were set to 0 95 and for groups that had their ee estimated the values ranged from 0 59 to 0 96 table 1 prebal diagnostics supplementary data 1 indicate that the rate of decline in biomass from the highest tl to the lowest tl declines at 9 8 percent and the biomass amounts across all tls spans 6 orders of magnitude both of which are in agreement with prebal criteria link 2010 however in terms of the actual biomass levels for individual groups there is considerable deviation from the trend line pelagic neritic piscivores deep water soles halibut and flathead flounder are well below the trend line whereas groups such as herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton squids medium pelagics and pacific cod are some of the groups that are above the trend line supplementary data 1 the p b and the q b follow a decreasing trend from low to high trophic levels indicating that these vital rates of the predators are generally lower than their prey deviations from the p b and q b trend line do not correspond to vital rates being higher than those of their prey but rather involve specific trophic interactions 3 2 ecotracer in 2010 the concentration of 137cs in surface waters to 246 m depth is estimated to be 1 5 bq m 3 while the average concentration from surface waters to the 1000 m depth is estimated to be 0 5 bq m 3 since ewe uses a 2 dimensional spatial representation this average amount was expressed on an area basis i e 0 5 bq m 2 and scaled up to bqkm 2 thus the initial environmental concentrations was set to 504 mbq km 2 to maintain environmental equilibrium and in order to estimate the potential concentrations in biota in 2010 a base inflow rate of 11 mbq km 2 was used to offset the physical decay rate of 0 023 year 1 i e a half life of 30 09 years this spin up to equilibrium was required in order to allow the model to estimate 137cs concentrations for all groups further as reflected by the p b groups in this model have a high turnover rate with no long lived species such as whales being represented thus historical exposures to the small changes in water concentrations due to physical decay process would have little effect on the resulting concentrations in biota direct absorption rates μ i ranged between 6 38 10 5 and 1 27 10 2 km2 t 1 year 1 lower direct absorption rates were generally associated with high tl organisms and low tl organisms had higher values table 2 for groups with direct absorption rates μ i of zero aes were 10 2 squids to 78 1 mackerels it was chosen to alter the aes rather than the excretion rates mi as regression analysis of aes presented in the literature did not show a clear trend results not shown whereas a decreasing trend of excretion rates was found with trophic level supplementary data 2 the importance of the direct absorption rates can also be interpreted by the reflection of their contribution to a group s uptake of 137cs from diet and respiration respiration contributes on average 89 3 percent to the uptake of 137cs for invertebrates excluding the groups octopus 19 8 crabs and lobsters 46 9 and squids 0 for fish groups diet is more important with 57 1 percent of the uptake of 137cs originating from dietary sources range 13 9 100 table 2 concentration ratios based on the surface water concentration of 1 5 bq m 3 for phytoplankton and algae are 8 4 and 18 2 respectively the average cr for successive tls is 25 4 range 7 0 39 7 for tl 2 46 6 range 8 8 94 3 for tl 3 and for tl 4 the average cr is 64 8 range 33 9 130 6 groups with a reported cr had a median value of 44 9 when the outlier is excluded and those groups without crs had a median value of 43 6 fig 2 both groups were normally distributed using the shapiro wilk s test reported w 0 956 p 0 299 unreported w 0 945 p 0 133 and there was no difference between the means p 0 55 when the outlier is included for those groups with a reported cr ecotracer estimated the observed versus predicted amounts bq having a root mean squared deviation rmsd of 23 09 fig 3 implying that ecotracer has the ability to reproduce the observed values well biomass concentrations range from 10 5 bq t 1 in seastars to 195 9 bq t 1 in the functional group skates and rays while detritus is estimated to have a concentration of 6 2 bq t 1 there is a general increasing trend in the biomass concentrations of 137cs with trophic level fig 4 with tl explaining 52 per cent of the variation of 137cs concentrations r2 0 5171 p 0 001 functional groups of tl 1 including detritus have an average concentration of 15 4 bq t 1 tl 2 have an average concentration of 38 0 bq t 1 tl 3 have an average concentration of 69 9 bq t 1 and organisms at tl 4 have an average concentration of 97 2 bq t 1 representing a 6 fold increase from tl 1 to tl 4 3 3 contaminant risk in 2010 prior to the accident all seafood products were well below the regulatory limit for 137cs of 500 bq kg 1 table 2 the apparent supply to the market destined for human consumption on a whole wet weight basis of 137cs is 46 1 mbq based on the reported landings and concentrations of 137cs estimated to be in the seafood products 137cs in the ecosystem bioaccumulated and had a tendency to biomagnify but not for all groups table 2 the average biomagnification factor for all groups was 1 92 however 8 groups did not have a biomagnification factor above 1 indicating that in these groups biomagnification did not occur the lowest values for invertebrate were for squid 0 18 crabs and lobsters 0 40 seastars 0 47 and herbivorous zooplankton 0 99 the four fish groups were generally closer to a value of 1 with forage fish feeding primarily on copepods have a value of 0 7 and the remaining groups being above 0 90 mackerels omnivorous bathydemersals and pelagic neritic planktivores feeding on plankton 4 discussion it was the intent here to model the marine ecosystem of eastern japan surrounding the fukushima nuclear power plant prior to the nuclear accident to serve as a baseline to do this an ecopath model was constructed with the information that was publically available although sparse data was available for the same year for the same species it is encouraging that most of the prebal diagnostics and indices of best practices fall within expected values data concerning biomass diets and fishing effort for stocks within the area would be valuable for improving the model and if made available it would be worthwhile to do a model pedigree and time series fitting the purpose of the ecopath model was to trace the concentration of 137cs in the marine ecosystem in the water and the organisms using the newly modified ecotracer routine the model results showed that there was a general increase in the concentration of organisms with increasing tl however in some cases a group at a higher trophic level does not have higher concentrations than a group at a lower trophic level for example alaska pollock tl 3 75 has a predicted concentration of 141 5 bq t 1 whereas pacific cod tl 4 25 has a predicted concentration of 114 3 bq t 1 in the comparison between these two species the biggest differences are between the q b and the p b ratio the q b rate is 65 percent higher for alaska pollock and the p b ratio is 21 percent lower indicating a lower turnover rate implying that this group has a longer time to accumulate 137cs in their tissues the 137cs concentration generally biomagnifies throughout the ecosystem with a mean value of 1 92 this is in agreement with laboratory feeding experiments wang et al 2000 zhao et al 2001 matthews and fisher 2008 field measurements kasamatsu and ishikawa 1997 harmelin vivien et al 2012 and in a food web model alava and gobas 2016 however 4 invertebrate groups were well below a bmf of 1 indicating that in these groups 137cs did not biomagnify of these herbivorous zooplankton were basically equal to their main diet item of copepods but the other three groups squid crabs lobsters and seastars were below 0 5 for the forage fish that primarily eat copepods physiological processes may limit the accumulation of 137cs since this groups had the highest predicted elimination rate constant ke of all fish groups supplementary data 2 for the 3 other fish groups with bmf values greater than 0 9 uncertainty surrounding the diet matrix or physiological processes could explain why 137cs does not biomagnify for the groups in the area with reported concentrations of 137cs the model did well in replicating the measured values the model was also able to make predictions for groups without initial concentrations that based on the comparison of crs for groups with starting concentration data and those without starting concentrations fig 2 would seem to be within expected ranges the importance of setting a baseline in this model is for future scenarios that do not rely on the cr approach where the resulting concentrations are driven by changes in the environmental concentrations only in these scenarios the use of a hydrodynamic model would be useful to explain the 137cs water concentrations and the resulting 137cs concentrations in biota the groups below or above the trend line for biomass in the prebal diagnostic represent a trade off between the ecopath model structure and the ecotracer function of tracing 137cs through the ecosystem here it was decided to define groups on the basis of the information available regarding 137cs concentrations keeping groups with relatively good data regarding 137cs concentrations separate rather than placing them within larger functional groups allows the concentration data to be retained and to be used for performance tests recommendations for the improvement of the ecotracer routine within the ewe ecological modelling framework include 1 separating the environment into depth zones 2 implementing the separation between metabolic and excretory pathways and 3 including a routine for dose assessment many pollutants have a vertical profile of concentration that either increases or decreases with depth dividing the environment into depth zones would make the ecotracer routine adaptable to a specific contaminant s water column profile depth zones could include coastal mid water and deep water zones and could be linked to the habitat capacity model within ecospace that already includes the ability to assign functional groups to depth zones in the latest version of ecotracer it is not possible to differentiate between metabolic losses and excretory losses as described in walters and christensen 2018 metabolic losses occur when the contaminant undergoes a transformation and thus is lost from the system whereas when it is excreted from the organism s body it remains as part of the environmental pool currently the best option is to include both as metabolic losses but an error is introduced as the portion included from excretory losses are removed from the environment rather than being in the environment and being available for direct uptake estimated concentrations in seafood were all well below the japanese pre accident regulatory limit of 500 bq kg 1 the apparent supply of 137cs represents the amount in the fishery products before processing and includes portions that may not be eaten however it can help to determine the health effects on the human body from the consumption of contaminated seafood in this respect ecotracer could also be improved to allow dose assessment for both marine organisms and humans and made valuable to health agencies and risk assessors for marine organisms a special routine for assessing organism dose rates arising both from internal and external exposures would need to be developed in terms of protecting human health effective dose from ingestion can be

24848,a mass balance model of the marine ecosystems is presented for the four prefectures of japan prior to the great east japan earthquake the ecopath with ecosim food web modelling approach and its ecotracer routine were used to simulate the concentrations of 137cs in the ocean and the biota in order to serve as baseline and to estimate the initial conditions for impact scenarios results of the ecopath model were checked against pre balance prebal diagnostics for integrity 137cs was shown to bioaccumulate with increases in trophic level and has a tendency to biomagnify generally for fish species the dominant pathway of contaminant accumulation was through diet whereas for invertebrates it was through respiration ecotracer was able to accurately model the expected concentrations in organisms that had existing concentration ratio data from field measurements and also make predictions on biota lacking concentration data in 2010 using national fishery landing statistics for the four prefectures and predicted whole body concentrations of 137cs it is estimated that the apparent direct and indirect human food supply of 137cs from fisheries to the market was 46 1 mbq keywords marine ecosystem modelling ecopath with ecosim ecotracer fukushima 137cesium 1 introduction the great east earthquake the subsequent tsunami and nuclear power accident in japan on 11 march 2011 caused a significant loss of life and also eroded a way of life for the people who inhabited the coastal villages that were involved in fishing activities komatsu 2017 the earthquake and tsunami caused significant damage to fishing infrastructure vessels gear and fishing grounds japan fishery agency 2012 while the nuclear power accident caused the release of large amounts of 137cs into the ocean affecting the marine life after the tsunami caused meltdowns at the fukushima dai ichi nuclear plant aoyama et al 2016 kaeriyama 2017 wada et al 2016 although other radionuclides were released in the ocean such as 131i and 134cs it is 137cs that is of concern because of its relatively long half life of around 30 years international atomic energy agency 2007 and the potential radiation doses and associated risk to marine biota and humans from the consumption of seafood fisher et al 2013 in order to understand the direct ecological effects it is necessary to examine the state of the marine environment prior to the accident and the role fishing activities had on the marine environment before 2011 presented here is an ecopath with ecosim ewe ecosystem model for the marine waters of the four prefectures of iwate miyagi fukushima and ibaraki that were most affected by the tsunami and subsequent nuclear accident our study area of approximately 220 000 km 2 focuses on the marine ecosystem for the year 2010 from the shoreline to the 200 nautical mile boundary of the exclusive economic zone eez the region where both the coastal and offshore fisheries occur and which is under the influence of both the kuroshio and oyashio currents these two currents affect the ecosystem and the fisheries in the area when the cooler oyashio current expands southward into the area there is an increase in biomass of most notably sardines and alaska pollock when the warmer waters of the kuroshio current dominate there is an increase in zooplankton biomass and a shift towards higher biomasses of japanese common squid and anchovy yatsu et al 2013 the southward extension of the oyashio current would also result in waters of a lower 137cs concentration being brought into the area whereas the northern movement of the kuroshio would bring in water with higher concentrations of 137cs into the region hirose and aoyama 2003 the modelled area generally has a narrow coastal shelf extending out to 40 km although around sendai bay it extends to 70 km the continental slope is also narrow and depths at the japanese trench can reach 9000 m but shallows to 5000 m at the extent of the exclusive economic zone where there is an abyssal plain international atomic energy agency 2015 iaea 2015 however in our study we limit the zone to an average of 1000 m to reflect the taxonomic composition of sampled species that form the basis of the functional groups in the ecopath model coastal fisheries occur within 5 km from the shore and offshore fisheries occur from 5 km of the shore to the boundary of the eez yamamoto 1985 fisheries landings from japan s ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries maff 2014 and monitoring data of cesium concentrations data in the ocean water nozaki et al 1998 hirose and aoyama 2003 povinec et al 2004 and in marine organisms kasamatsu and ishikawa 1997 yamada et al 1999 were available for the study area although the earthquake caused the release of large amounts of cesium into the ocean from direct and atmospheric releases there had been previous impacts from 137cs on the marine environment from nuclear testing during the 1960s and to a lesser extent from the chernobyl event in 1986 duran et al 2004 smith et al 2017 in order to describe the state of the marine environment and the amounts of 137cs present prior to its release from the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant accident the ewe modelling software was used ewe has largely been used for describing marine ecosystems e g polovina 1984 assessing the state of marine ecosystems in comparison to earlier states e g cox et al 2002 providing information on emergent properties e g libralato et al 2006 and being used as a fishery management tool to look at effects of changing biomasses linked to policy changes or climate change niiranen et al 2013 however here we also deployed the ecotracer contaminant module to describe the flow of 137cs in the organisms and environment ecotracer has been used to trace the flow of several pollutants in the marine environment including mercury booth and zeller 2005 radionuclides in the baltic sea sandberg et al 2007 and in the irish sea tierney et al 2017 the aim of our study was to have a description of the biomass flows including the biomasses at each trophic level and the marine trophic index mti pauly and watson 2005 to be able to reflect the state of the marine ecosystem prior to the closure of the fishery after the accident to serve as a baseline prior to the nuclear accident the concentration of 137cs in the environment and biota are estimated as well we examine the bioaccumulation of 137cs in the marine ecosystem and estimate the apparent human food supply of 137cs to the market in 2010 from fishery landings despite recent corrections to the underlying computer code to the ecotracer routine walters and christensen 2018 several suggestions are also made to improve the routine to enhance its capabilities 2 methods we describe the marine food web through an ecopath with ecosim food web model consisting of 55 biological groups and one detritus group included are the removal of 24 aquatic organisms reported in the 2010 capture fishery statistics maff 2014 functional groups were considered to be coastal e g shallow flounders offshore e g bathydemersals or occurring throughout the entire area e g mackerels the ecopath model was validated using pre balance prebal diagnostics link 2010 and was constructed adhering to best practices guidelines heymans et al 2016 we estimated starting 137cs concentrations for water and biota in 2010 using data from the 1990s water column concentrations which resulted from nuclear bomb testing in the 1960s and to a lesser extent from the chernobyl accident in 1986 aoyama and hirose 1995 were decay corrected to 2010 additional marine inputs from low level radioactive effluents from the nuclear plants in fukushima are ignored as they were assumed to be negligible duran et al 2004 similarly scavenging of 137cs by particulate matter was ignored because it is considered to be limited to less than 1 t in the open ocean aoyama and hirose 1995 and even after the fukushima accident sediment trap data revealed that the removal rate of 137cs on sinking particles was 1 2 per year buesseler et al 2017 for organisms reported concentrations ratios from the 1990s were used along with the decay corrected water concentration to estimate concentrations in biota physical decay rates based on the half life of 137cs were applied to both the water and functional groups the model was run forward in time using the ecosim component to estimate potential concentrations in functional groups and species that lacked such data under environmental steady state conditions given that 137cs concentrations are considered to be well mixed and spatially homogenous we did not undertake a spatial temporal assessment it is outside the scope of this work to describe in detail all the specific numerical methods contained within the ewe modeling framework however a brief description of the master equation used in the ecopath component is given as well as for ecotracer the two main components used within this study 2 1 ecopath ecopath with ecosim uses a trophic mass balance approach for the ecopath component which in its simplest formulation ensures that the amount of consumption and the fisheries yield on a group species does not exceed its production polovina 1984 to account for biomass changes such as those from regime shifts a biomass accumulation term can be used as well if necessary immigration and emigration can be dealt with using net migration consumption rates of predators are used along with diet compositions of prey items to estimate the amount of consumption of prey items and mortality rates from non predation events such as old age and disease are incorporated as other mortality christensen and walters 2004 thus the production of a group species p i can be defined as 1 p i y i b i m 2 i e i b a i b i m o i where y i is the fisheries catch rate t km 2 year 1 of i b i is the biomass t km 2 for group i m2 i is the total predation rate year 1 for group i e i represents the net migration rate emigration immigration t km 2 year 1 ba i is the biomass accumulation rate for group i mo i is the other mortality rate year 1 for group i another form of the equation christensen et al 2005 which is useful in terms of the input requirements for the ewe modeling interface is to re express eq 1 in terms of the input parameters required for ewe as 2 b i p b i e e i j 1 n b j q b j d c j i y i e i b a i where p b i is the production to biomass ratio for group i ee i represents the ecotrophic efficiency or the amount of production used within the system and is a value between 0 and 1 b j is the biomass of each predator group feeding on group i q b j is the consumption to biomass ratio of each predator group feeding on group i and dc ji is the fraction of prey group i in the diet of each predator group j in this form if the emigration and accumulation terms are ignored then it is conveniently seen that in essence the production of a group is equal to the consumption plus fisheries of that group for each group in ecopath the diet composition and any fishery catches must be entered and depending on the state of the ecosystem or type of organisms estimates of biomass accumulation and emigration can be entered also all but one of the remaining parameters i e b p b ee and q b must be entered for each group as the mass balance routine can estimate the missing term christensen et al 2005 the mti reflecting the state of the fishery landings of high trophic level fishes in 2010 is given for the cut off point at tl 3 25 3 25mti as suggested in pauly and watson 2005 the mti was calculated using the weighted mean catch by trophic level i e mti tl i y i y i where tl i is the trophic level of a group and y i is the reported landings 2 1 1 groups the species and groups represented in the model are formed from the types of information available from a database created from the monitoring on radioactivity level in fisheries products which covers the years 2011 2016 and provides information on 137cs levels in marine aquatic organisms after the fukushima accident japan fisheries agency 2017 the 263 species sampled in the four prefectures were retained as individual groups or were placed in functional groups for modeling purposes contaminant dietary landings and habitat data were used for this purpose we combined species of similar ecological roles into functional groups using a scoring system based on the number of 137cs samples taken per year an index of 1 was given to those species which were sampled more than twice in each year in a prefecture and a score of 4 was given to species not sampled in a prefecture a score of 2 was given to those species that were sampled once each year in each prefecture and a 3 for being sampled at least once over the sampling period species that scored a value between 1 and 2 25 were considered to be candidates as individual species in the model after appraising fisheries statistics and the dietary data available japanese fisheries statistics are mostly reported at group level e g flatfishes however several species relevant in the model area are reported individually including tunas thunnus orientalis t alalunga t obesus and t albacares skipjack katsuwonus pelamis round herring etrumeus teres anchovy engraulis japonicus saury cololabis saira cod gadus macrocephalus alaska pollock gadus chalcogramma atka mackerel pleurogrammus monopterygius yellowtails seriola quinqeradiata and the common scallop patinopectin yessoensis of these independently reported species in the fishery statistics only cod scored an index of 1 however olive flounder which is not reported independently in the fisheries statistics also scored an index of 1 had good data concerning biomass shibata et al 2017 and thus was represented individually in the model landings reported at the group level were disaggregated assuming the catches in the group were of high medium or low levels other individual fish species in the model were marbled flounder pleuronectes yokohamae flathead flounder hippoglossoides dubius japanese jack mackerel trachurus japonicus and fat greenling hexagrammos otakii these species had a score of 1 5 2 0 2 0 and 2 25 respectively marbled and flathead flounder were split from the group flatfishes as reported in the japanese fishery statistics and both had seasonal diet data japanese jack mackerel is reported separately in the fisheries statistics and diet data were available from japan tanaka et al 2006 fat greenling had both dietary data and a detailed study of 137cs present in the muscle tissues near the accident site shigenobu et al 2014 alaska pollock was also chosen because of it being reported separately in official statistics and it had a detailed diet study by depth in japan yamamura et al 2002 the remaining species data from the database were grouped to form functional groups taxonomy diet depth of occurrence and size all played a role in forming the groups primary producers are represented by phytoplankton and algae and zooplankton consist of three types based on diet herbivorous copepods omnivorous mysids ostracods and some non gammarid amphipods and carnivorous chaetognaths hyperiidea and coelenterates a group of detritivores are also included that consist of isopods gammarids cumaceans and cladocerans the krill species euphausia pacifica is allocated to its own group and includes a fishery of approximately 5 600 tonnes a simple representation of the macrobenthic compartment comprises nine functional groups and includes bivalves gastropods annelids sea urchins sea cucumbers shrimp omnivores and predators seastars and the group crabs and lobsters 2 1 2 diet matrix several factors are important in the trophic modelling of marine organisms including seasonal spatial and foraging depth variations when possible we used local dietary data that was collected seasonally and by depth as different prey items can be associated by both factors seasonality can affect prey species availability and for non pelagic species depth can be an important factor in determining diet due to it affecting age stratification for most functional groups quantitative data concerning the wet weight were used but for some groups diets were only qualitatively described supplementary data 1 unassimilated consumption the portion of a prey item not assimilated was assumed to be 0 2 for all groups excluding herbivorous zooplankton and omnivorous zooplankton which were set to 0 4 and 0 3 respectively this was done to reflect the lower food quality i e phytoplankton in the diet 2 1 3 ecopath parameters b p b q b and ee biomass estimates were made for 19 groups based on stock assessments used for a model of the northwestern pacific e g pacific cod watari et al 2018 scaled to the local area or for zooplankton groups on previously published estimates on production liu et al 2005 combined with species composition data ikeda et al 2008 for groups without biomass data it was assumed that the ecotrophic efficiencies ee were 0 95 which enabled the mass balance routine to estimate the biomass the ecotrophic efficiency of a group describes the amount of production used within the modeled ecosystem for groups with b p b and q b data the ee is estimated by the mass balancing routine the production to biomass ratio for fish groups can be considered to be the natural mortality rate plus the fishing mortality rate i e p b f m allen 1971 values for fish groups were taken or calculated from a variety of sources including watari et al 2018 from stock assessments using estimates of natural and fishing mortality or by assuming a production to consumption ratio p q ranging between 0 1 and 0 3 which is consistent with bioenergetics theory in cases where the natural mortality was used in conjunction with fishing mortality the estimate of m was based on an empirical estimate pauly 1980 values for invertebrates were either taken from an ecopath model for the bering sea aydin et al 2002 assuming a p q value of 0 2 or from local japanese data ikeda et al 2008 mori et al 2009 taki 2006 phytoplankton values were based on liu et al 2004 and algae based on the range reported by mann 1973 and schwinghamer et al 1989 detritus was based on an empirical formula pauly et al 1993 assuming a euphotic depth of 30 meters the consumption to biomass ratio q b defines the amount of food consumed by a group empirical estimates of q b for fish groups rely on using estimates of weight w the tail s aspect ratio and temperature heymans et al 2016 the aspect ratios for tails were found for the groups mackerels westneat and wainwright 2001 medium pelagics collette 1978 westneat and wainwright 2001 and small pelagics palomares and pauly 1998 westneat and wainwright 2001 and these were used to estimate the q b on the empirical relationship for the remaining fish groups the life history tool and the average depth of occurrence in fishbase froese and pauly 2018 were used along with a temperature profile fujii and kamachi 2003 to estimate q b for zooplankton and krill it was assumed that the p q was between 0 2 and 0 3 estimates for shrimp were taken from coll et al 2007 and the rest were taken from a model for the bering sea aydin et al 2002 the widespread use of ecological network models such as ewe of variable quality has led to the call for a measure of quality control link 2010 in order to improve model parameters and for aiding management bodies in the evaluation of model integrity several indicators of the prebal diagnostics are used to check for model integrity heymans et al 2016 link 2010 several of these diagnostics are presented including those for p b the gross food conversion efficiency p q biomass and q b across trophic levels and ratios of biomass all parameter estimates for b p b and prebal diagnostics are found in the supplementary material supplementary data 1 2 2 ecotracer the ecotracer sub routine can be used once an ecopath model is in mass balance ecotracer is adaptable to using different units depending on the contaminant and the concentrations found in the natural environment and the type of data available thus the sub routine can use different measurements including mass e g grams and radioactivity bq but considers the environment as a spatial area i e km2 to match the underlying ecopath model inputs an important consequence of this capability is the necessity to maintain consistency in units in the environmental and biological compartments in this model the contaminant measure in the environment occurs in a spatial area i e bq km 2 whereas the radioactivity in biological groups are entered as amounts bq and can be transformed into group biomass concentrations i e bq t 1 by the program ecotracer tracks the flow of a contaminant in the environment and the biological groups represented in a model through time christensen et al 2005 walters and christensen 2018 the amount of a contaminant in a group in this case 137cs is dependent on the intakes and losses intake amounts come from direct uptake rates i e respiration the fraction retained from trophic interactions and immigration losses arise from natural decay processes metabolic losses and emigration ecotracer is based on a standard dynamic transfer model e g landrum et al 1992 thomann 1981 i e 3 d c i t d t α i β i c i t where α i represents the gains from direct uptake from the environment plus the gains from diet and β i represents the losses due to physical decay and elimination rates which are dependent upon the group s concentration c i however ecotracer expands upon the standard dynamic transfer model by including several other terms important in an ecosystem context including migration predatory losses other mortality and fisheries another important difference is that for biological compartments the contaminant level is based on the amount of contaminant in a dietary item i e bq rather than the concentration bq t 1 and the uptake rate from food is dependent upon the parameters used in the ecopath model to describe the amount taken in from all dietary sources thus the gains bq year 1 to a group are dependent upon a direct uptake rate its diet and immigration i e 4 α i μ i b i c o a e i j p r e y q j i a j b j c i i i where c o represents the environmental concentration bq km 2 b i is the biomass t of group i μ i is the direct absorption rate proportionality co efficient linking the direct uptake rate bq km 2 yr 1 to the parameters of biomass t km 2 and environmental concentration bq km 2 ae i is the assimilation efficiency and is the fraction of 137cs within food items that is assimilated q ji is the consumption rate t year 1 of group j by group i a j is the amount bq of the contaminant present in group j and b j is the biomass of prey group j t c i is the group biomass concentration bq t 1 and i is the immigrating biomass t year 1 the losses from a group β i a i are attributed to predation fisheries other mortality excretion and decay i e 5 β i a i j p r e d q i j b i f i m o i e i m i d i a i where q ij is the rate of consumption t year 1 of group i due to predation by j f i is the fishing mortality rate year 1 mo i year 1 is the other mortality rate i e non predation mortality e i is the emigrating biomass rate year 1 m i year 1 is the excretion and or metabolic rate and d i year 1 is the physical decay rate these rates are multiplied by a i the amount of contaminant bq in each group i excretory products that are released from tissues to the environment are added to the environmental concentration the ecotracer approach is dynamic and extends the basic concentration ratio cr approach but the cr approach is contained within it as 6 c r i a i b i c o μ i a e i q j i b i c r j z i m i the environment is also dependent on gains and losses taking place in the environment gains originate from the release of contaminants into the environment as a base inflow rate and from the excretion from organisms losses originate from the direct uptake by organisms from the environment physical decay rates and base volume exchange thus the environmental compartment can be modeled as 7 d c o t d t α i β i c o t where α i represents the gains in the environment and β i represents the losses to the environment in ecospace the gains are from both additional inputs into the environment and from biota such that 8 α i b i i n m i a i where bi is the base inflow rate bq km 2 year 1 to the environment and m i a i are the excretory products from all organisms within the environment losses from the environment are due to biological physical and environmental volume changes such that 9 β i c o d i v i c o i n μ i b i c o where d i represents the decay rate year 1 and v i represents the base volume exchange loss year 1 temporal changes through the environmental concentration co can be made by applying a forcing function to the base inflow rate or through a contaminant concentration driver file the amount of contaminant in the detritus compartment originates from the unassimilated consumption resulting from predation as well as non predation mortality thus groups feeding on detritus will have exposure levels associated with the contributions from the fraction of unassimilated consumption from all groups initial concentrations in the biota and environment are also input parameters to be used if data is available 2 2 1 ecotracer input the initial environmental concentration was based on a dataset covering the north pacific ocean the 137cs surface water concentration of 2 1 bq m 3 for 1998 which represents the mid latitude areas of the western pacific ocean including the southern half of the sea of japan was used after it was decay corrected to the year 2010 box 2 hirose and aoyama 2003 a depth profile of 137cs for the japanes trench nozaki et al 1998 formed the basis for the starting concentrations the depth profile curve was decay corrected to the 2010 surface water concentration value and then an average value was calculated from 0 to 1000 m since below this depth 137cs concentrations approached zero for functional groups with reported crs initial amounts at the start of the simulation i e bq were based on the cr estimated water concentrations and the estimated biomass of the various functional groups for fish groups concentration ratios crs for taxa in japan were used kasamatsu and ishikawa 1997 yamada et al 1999 with the estimated water concentration from surface waters to 246 m since the reported crs were all for coastal species and this depth is a typical water depth boundary between coastal waters and the continental slope for macroalgae cr data were available for the study area tateda and koyanagi 1996 and for phytoplankton the iaea weighted arithmetic mean was used iaea 2014 for herbivorous zooplankton an average cr 8 0 was used from data collected in the western north pacific ocean from samples containing greater than 89 of their biomass as copepods kaeriyama et al 2008 for omnivorous zooplankton the iaea recommended value of 40 was used iaea 2004 and for carnivorous zooplankton a cr was estimated so that the average value for all zooplankton groups was the iaea recommended value functional groups without reported crs had an initial amount of zero with the resulting concentration being estimated by the ecotracer routine groups in the model with and without a reported cr were checked to see if they had a normal distribution using the shapiro wilk s test and the two medians were compared using a welch s t test using rstudio v 3 5 1 to evaluate ecotracer the observed activity values of groups with reported cr values were plotted against the predicted values for the same groups and the root mean square error is given piñeiro et al 2008 the direct absorption rate for the two primary producers were based on their cr i p i b i ratio excretion rate m i and the physical decay rate d i of 137cs assuming equilibrium conditions walters and christensen 2018 such that 10 μ i c r i p i b i m i d i where the p b ratio for algae includes the harvest rate of seaweeds this equation can be derived by setting the derivative of eq 3 to zero substituting the definition of cr i and solving for μi for consumers the direct absorption rate must also account for predation losses and under equilibrium conditions it can be calculated as

that does not enter tissues after ingestion fish species were assumed to have an ae of 0 8 which is slightly higher than that corresponding to laboratory experiments undertaken with juvenile fishes but within the ranges reported 0 54 0 88 in these studies mathews and fisher 2008 mathews et al 2008 pan and wang 2016 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2001 as data for adult fishes from laboratoty experiments are lacking for 6 groups mackerels piscivorous reef fish pelagic neritic piscivores squid small and medium pelagics the direct absorption rate i e μi was set to zero and eq 11 was solved for the ae as the losses were less than the gains from dietary items for invertebrates the reported ae of 0 16 were used for annelids wang et al 2016 and bivalves pan et al 2016 and 0 5 for gastropods wang et al 2000 crabs and lobsters wang et al 2016 it was assumed that sea urchins sea stars and octopus had an ae of 0 5 herbivorous and omnivorous zooplankton have an ae 0 65 mathews and fisher 2008 and omnivorous shrimp krill detritivores and sea cucumbers were assumed to have the same value for carnivorous zooplankton and predatory shrimp an ae of 0 7 was used under the assumption that their prey were of higher food quality primary producers were assigned a value of 1 the physical decay rate is based on the radioactive half life of 137cs of 30 09 years iaea 2007 excretion rates from a variety of lab studies were transformed from daily rates to yearly rates and for primary producers an excretion rate from a model for the same area was used belharet et al 2016 the reported lab data was used to perform a regression analysis using trophic level tl as the predictor variable to estimate the excretion rates for all groups supplementary data 2 2 3 contaminant risk for all groups in the model ecotracer is able to estimate concentrations or burdens leading to the ability to estimate risk through time through such metrics as biomagnification factors and to also make comparisons to regulatory limits prior to the accident the regulatory limit for 137cs in seafood products in japan was 500 bq kg 1 but was lowered to 100 bq kg 1 one year after the accident povinec et al 2013 we estimate the apparent human food supply of 137cs from fishery landings and the measured or estimated concentrations of 137cs in the group from fisheries landings yi and the 137cs concentration in group i cs i as y i cs i in order to assess the behavior of 137cs in the ecosystem we examine its ability to bioaccumulate using a biomagnification factor bmf i e a predator s concentration of 137cs relative to its prey as defined by mackay et al 2018 for each group we calculate the bmf as pred i dc ji prey j where pred i is the concentration of 137cs in predator i dc ji is the diet fraction of prey item j in the diet of predator i and the concentration of 137cs in each prey item j prey j 3 results 3 1 ecopath the calculated biomass from the model representing the eez of all four prefectures in eastern japan iwate miyagi fukushima and ibaraki from the coast to the exclusive economic zone comprising 55 biological groups plus detritus suggests that the combined biomass was 391 7 t km 2 of the 55 biological groups large sharks and large pelagics occupied the highest trophic level at 4 8 fig 1 biomass totals are 12 8 t km 2 for primary producers macroalgae and phytoplankton 181 8 t km 2 for groups at the second trophic level 2 00 2 86 while those at trophic level 3 trophic levels 3 00 to 3 87 and 4 trophic levels 4 00 to 4 78 have 48 3 t km 2 and 2 8 t km 2 respectively detritus has a mass of 146 0 t km 2 the lower biomass of primary producers compared to the biomass at the second trophic level is possible because of the much higher production rate of phytoplankton table 1 total biomass production is estimated to be 3 160 t km 2 year 1 with primary producers accounting for 72 6 groups in trophic level 2 account for 24 6 of the yearly production those at tl 3 account for 2 7 while groups at tl 4 account for less than 0 05 per cent of the production the total capture fishery landings within the model area are 594 000 tonnes 2 70 t km 2 and were dominated by three species with the largest reported landings being mackerels 146 000 t saury 64 000 t and anchovy 54 000 t which together provide 50 of the landings the 3 25mtifor fisheries landings of 496 508 t is 3 81 the thermodynamic constraints heymans et al 2016 for ecotrophic efficiency ee 1 0 and gross food efficiencies 0 1 p q 0 3 are both met table 1 net efficiencies ne p q respiration to assimilated biomass ratio ra rb 1 0 respiration to biomass ratio ra b and the production to respiration ratio p ra 1 0 are also within the range of expected values supplementary data 1 the respiration to biomass ratio is expected to be highly variable and generally they range from 1 100 year 1 depending upon the group and here they fall between 0 89 for large sharks and 24 48 for krill ees for groups without biomass estimates were set to 0 95 and for groups that had their ee estimated the values ranged from 0 59 to 0 96 table 1 prebal diagnostics supplementary data 1 indicate that the rate of decline in biomass from the highest tl to the lowest tl declines at 9 8 percent and the biomass amounts across all tls spans 6 orders of magnitude both of which are in agreement with prebal criteria link 2010 however in terms of the actual biomass levels for individual groups there is considerable deviation from the trend line pelagic neritic piscivores deep water soles halibut and flathead flounder are well below the trend line whereas groups such as herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton squids medium pelagics and pacific cod are some of the groups that are above the trend line supplementary data 1 the p b and the q b follow a decreasing trend from low to high trophic levels indicating that these vital rates of the predators are generally lower than their prey deviations from the p b and q b trend line do not correspond to vital rates being higher than those of their prey but rather involve specific trophic interactions 3 2 ecotracer in 2010 the concentration of 137cs in surface waters to 246 m depth is estimated to be 1 5 bq m 3 while the average concentration from surface waters to the 1000 m depth is estimated to be 0 5 bq m 3 since ewe uses a 2 dimensional spatial representation this average amount was expressed on an area basis i e 0 5 bq m 2 and scaled up to bqkm 2 thus the initial environmental concentrations was set to 504 mbq km 2 to maintain environmental equilibrium and in order to estimate the potential concentrations in biota in 2010 a base inflow rate of 11 mbq km 2 was used to offset the physical decay rate of 0 023 year 1 i e a half life of 30 09 years this spin up to equilibrium was required in order to allow the model to estimate 137cs concentrations for all groups further as reflected by the p b groups in this model have a high turnover rate with no long lived species such as whales being represented thus historical exposures to the small changes in water concentrations due to physical decay process would have little effect on the resulting concentrations in biota direct absorption rates μ i ranged between 6 38 10 5 and 1 27 10 2 km2 t 1 year 1 lower direct absorption rates were generally associated with high tl organisms and low tl organisms had higher values table 2 for groups with direct absorption rates μ i of zero aes were 10 2 squids to 78 1 mackerels it was chosen to alter the aes rather than the excretion rates mi as regression analysis of aes presented in the literature did not show a clear trend results not shown whereas a decreasing trend of excretion rates was found with trophic level supplementary data 2 the importance of the direct absorption rates can also be interpreted by the reflection of their contribution to a group s uptake of 137cs from diet and respiration respiration contributes on average 89 3 percent to the uptake of 137cs for invertebrates excluding the groups octopus 19 8 crabs and lobsters 46 9 and squids 0 for fish groups diet is more important with 57 1 percent of the uptake of 137cs originating from dietary sources range 13 9 100 table 2 concentration ratios based on the surface water concentration of 1 5 bq m 3 for phytoplankton and algae are 8 4 and 18 2 respectively the average cr for successive tls is 25 4 range 7 0 39 7 for tl 2 46 6 range 8 8 94 3 for tl 3 and for tl 4 the average cr is 64 8 range 33 9 130 6 groups with a reported cr had a median value of 44 9 when the outlier is excluded and those groups without crs had a median value of 43 6 fig 2 both groups were normally distributed using the shapiro wilk s test reported w 0 956 p 0 299 unreported w 0 945 p 0 133 and there was no difference between the means p 0 55 when the outlier is included for those groups with a reported cr ecotracer estimated the observed versus predicted amounts bq having a root mean squared deviation rmsd of 23 09 fig 3 implying that ecotracer has the ability to reproduce the observed values well biomass concentrations range from 10 5 bq t 1 in seastars to 195 9 bq t 1 in the functional group skates and rays while detritus is estimated to have a concentration of 6 2 bq t 1 there is a general increasing trend in the biomass concentrations of 137cs with trophic level fig 4 with tl explaining 52 per cent of the variation of 137cs concentrations r2 0 5171 p 0 001 functional groups of tl 1 including detritus have an average concentration of 15 4 bq t 1 tl 2 have an average concentration of 38 0 bq t 1 tl 3 have an average concentration of 69 9 bq t 1 and organisms at tl 4 have an average concentration of 97 2 bq t 1 representing a 6 fold increase from tl 1 to tl 4 3 3 contaminant risk in 2010 prior to the accident all seafood products were well below the regulatory limit for 137cs of 500 bq kg 1 table 2 the apparent supply to the market destined for human consumption on a whole wet weight basis of 137cs is 46 1 mbq based on the reported landings and concentrations of 137cs estimated to be in the seafood products 137cs in the ecosystem bioaccumulated and had a tendency to biomagnify but not for all groups table 2 the average biomagnification factor for all groups was 1 92 however 8 groups did not have a biomagnification factor above 1 indicating that in these groups biomagnification did not occur the lowest values for invertebrate were for squid 0 18 crabs and lobsters 0 40 seastars 0 47 and herbivorous zooplankton 0 99 the four fish groups were generally closer to a value of 1 with forage fish feeding primarily on copepods have a value of 0 7 and the remaining groups being above 0 90 mackerels omnivorous bathydemersals and pelagic neritic planktivores feeding on plankton 4 discussion it was the intent here to model the marine ecosystem of eastern japan surrounding the fukushima nuclear power plant prior to the nuclear accident to serve as a baseline to do this an ecopath model was constructed with the information that was publically available although sparse data was available for the same year for the same species it is encouraging that most of the prebal diagnostics and indices of best practices fall within expected values data concerning biomass diets and fishing effort for stocks within the area would be valuable for improving the model and if made available it would be worthwhile to do a model pedigree and time series fitting the purpose of the ecopath model was to trace the concentration of 137cs in the marine ecosystem in the water and the organisms using the newly modified ecotracer routine the model results showed that there was a general increase in the concentration of organisms with increasing tl however in some cases a group at a higher trophic level does not have higher concentrations than a group at a lower trophic level for example alaska pollock tl 3 75 has a predicted concentration of 141 5 bq t 1 whereas pacific cod tl 4 25 has a predicted concentration of 114 3 bq t 1 in the comparison between these two species the biggest differences are between the q b and the p b ratio the q b rate is 65 percent higher for alaska pollock and the p b ratio is 21 percent lower indicating a lower turnover rate implying that this group has a longer time to accumulate 137cs in their tissues the 137cs concentration generally biomagnifies throughout the ecosystem with a mean value of 1 92 this is in agreement with laboratory feeding experiments wang et al 2000 zhao et al 2001 matthews and fisher 2008 field measurements kasamatsu and ishikawa 1997 harmelin vivien et al 2012 and in a food web model alava and gobas 2016 however 4 invertebrate groups were well below a bmf of 1 indicating that in these groups 137cs did not biomagnify of these herbivorous zooplankton were basically equal to their main diet item of copepods but the other three groups squid crabs lobsters and seastars were below 0 5 for the forage fish that primarily eat copepods physiological processes may limit the accumulation of 137cs since this groups had the highest predicted elimination rate constant ke of all fish groups supplementary data 2 for the 3 other fish groups with bmf values greater than 0 9 uncertainty surrounding the diet matrix or physiological processes could explain why 137cs does not biomagnify for the groups in the area with reported concentrations of 137cs the model did well in replicating the measured values the model was also able to make predictions for groups without initial concentrations that based on the comparison of crs for groups with starting concentration data and those without starting concentrations fig 2 would seem to be within expected ranges the importance of setting a baseline in this model is for future scenarios that do not rely on the cr approach where the resulting concentrations are driven by changes in the environmental concentrations only in these scenarios the use of a hydrodynamic model would be useful to explain the 137cs water concentrations and the resulting 137cs concentrations in biota the groups below or above the trend line for biomass in the prebal diagnostic represent a trade off between the ecopath model structure and the ecotracer function of tracing 137cs through the ecosystem here it was decided to define groups on the basis of the information available regarding 137cs concentrations keeping groups with relatively good data regarding 137cs concentrations separate rather than placing them within larger functional groups allows the concentration data to be retained and to be used for performance tests recommendations for the improvement of the ecotracer routine within the ewe ecological modelling framework include 1 separating the environment into depth zones 2 implementing the separation between metabolic and excretory pathways and 3 including a routine for dose assessment many pollutants have a vertical profile of concentration that either increases or decreases with depth dividing the environment into depth zones would make the ecotracer routine adaptable to a specific contaminant s water column profile depth zones could include coastal mid water and deep water zones and could be linked to the habitat capacity model within ecospace that already includes the ability to assign functional groups to depth zones in the latest version of ecotracer it is not possible to differentiate between metabolic losses and excretory losses as described in walters and christensen 2018 metabolic losses occur when the contaminant undergoes a transformation and thus is lost from the system whereas when it is excreted from the organism s body it remains as part of the environmental pool currently the best option is to include both as metabolic losses but an error is introduced as the portion included from excretory losses are removed from the environment rather than being in the environment and being available for direct uptake estimated concentrations in seafood were all well below the japanese pre accident regulatory limit of 500 bq kg 1 the apparent supply of 137cs represents the amount in the fishery products before processing and includes portions that may not be eaten however it can help to determine the health effects on the human body from the consumption of contaminated seafood in this respect ecotracer could also be improved to allow dose assessment for both marine organisms and humans and made valuable to health agencies and risk assessors for marine organisms a special routine for assessing organism dose rates arising both from internal and external exposures would need to be developed in terms of protecting human health effective dose from ingestion can be

24849,mixotrophic nanoflagellates mnf play a key role in the carbon flux within aquatic ecosystems they contribute significantly to primary production while at the same time they are important consumers of bacteria mnf comprise a diverse assemblage with a whole range of photosynthetic and feeding potential and with various metabolic responses to environmental drivers such as light nutrients and prey availability however in most cases mnf are modelled as a single functional group with no reference to the distinct nutritional strategies and constraints of the different types of mnf here we develop a mathematical framework for the distinct functional responses of four types of mnf our approach is based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory and the concept of synthesing unit su which is used to merge phototrophic and phagotrophic nutrition into mixotrophic growth the resulting models describe explicitly the functional diversity of the mnf group taking into account the dynamic interaction of phototrophy and phagotrophy within the four types of mnf our results are in agreement with theoretical expectations and a wide range of experimental observations for the different types of mnf our simulations suggest that the growth dynamics of the four types of mnf are affected differently by the availability of resources moreover using our models to compare the rates of organic carbon production and prey consumption by the various mnf types we show that their net ecosystem role as producers or consumers depends on the mixotrophic strategy and it can vary as a function of the prevailing environmental conditions overall our study highlights the importance of mechanistically modelling the distinct metabolic responses of the different types of mnf to environmental drivers in order to better understand their role in the carbon cycle in anticipation of global environmental changes keywords mixotrophy nanoflagellates functional response synthesizing unit deb theory 1 introduction mixotrophic nanoflagellates mnf that are able to combine phototrophy and phagotrophy in a single cell sanders 1991 are important consumers of bacteria often accounting for more than 50 of total bacterivory in both freshwater gerea et al 2018 and marine ecosystems livanou et al 2019b unrein et al 2007 zubkov and tarran 2008 moreover they are responsible for a significant fraction of marine primary production jardillier et al 2010 therefore these protists have a dual role functioning both as primary producers and as consumers mitra et al 2014 affecting the flow of carbon and nutrients through the aquatic food web ward and follows 2016 mnf comprise a diverse group including various phylogenetic lineages such as chrysophytes haptophytes cryptophytes silicoflagellates dictyophytes and chlorophytes stoecker et al 2017 however mnf are collectively termed as constitutive mixotrophs cm sensu mitra et al 2016 due to their inherent ability to photosynthesize as they carry chloroplasts which are well integrated both physiologically and evolutionarily stoecker et al 2017 the vast phylogenetic variability of mnf results in a large functional diversity and a range of photosynthetic and feeding capabilities that do not always vary systematically with phylogeny jones 1997 mitra et al 2016 stoecker 1998 laboratory studies with mnf have shown that environmental cues such as light and macro or micro nutrient limitation and prey availability regulate the rate of feeding or photosynthesis of mnf while they display variable dependence and preference to each of the trophic modes i e phototrophy and phagotrophy for growth and energy derivation liu et al 2016 mckie krisberg et al 2015 different functional roles of mnf are implied as a result of the relative importance of phototrophy and phagotrophy in their growth which may have profound effects on carbon and nutrient cycling in the ecosystem wilken et al 2018 worden et al 2015 stoecker 1998 proposed conceptual models for the different physiological types of mixotrophic flagellates in an attempt to categorize them and understand their role in ecosystem dynamics thus stoecker 1998 identified three physiological types of phagotrophic algae which are primarily phototrophic and can assimilate dissolved inorganic nutrients while i feeding is initiated in response to nutrient limitation e g n p or fe type iia ii feeding is a strategy to obtain organic compounds necessary for growth type iib and iii feeding is a response to low light in order to obtain energy and carbon type iic furthermore mixotrophic nanoflagellates that are primarily phagotrophic are termed as type iiia in stoecker 1998 and they are characterized by the ability to engage in phototrophy through carbon fixation and inorganic nutrients assimilation when prey are scarce to date diverse approaches in modelling the mixotrophic nutrition of constitutive mixotrophs have been developed with a varying level of complexity simpler approaches use additive descriptions of phototrophy and phagotrophy with no reference to the dynamic interchange of the two modes of nutrition hammer and pitchford 2005 stickney et al 2000 thingstad et al 1996 kooijman and colleagues kooijman et al 2002 troost et al 2005b were the first that attempted to model mixotrophic organisms with reference to the physiological mechanisms of energy assimilation and usage by the individuals in their work however they did not resolve the dynamic interaction between the phototrophic and phagotrophic nutritional strategy on the other hand flynn and colleagues flynn and mitra 2009 ghyoot et al 2017 leles et al 2018 mitra et al 2014 incorporated the interactions between the alternating energy and nutrient acquisition pathways using regulatory functions that modulate the rates of phototrophy and phagotrophy under certain physiological conditions nevertheless the functional diversity within the mnf group as was conceptualised by stoecker 1998 with reference to the dynamic interaction of the two modes of nutrition has not been mathematically described to date however a mechanistic modelling framework for the different functional types of mixotrophic nanoflagellates is necessary if we are to understand how their role in biogeochemical processes depends on the prevailing environmental factors and therefore to predict how carbon and nutrients cycles will be affected by the global climate change the aim of this study is to develop mathematical models that describe the functional responses for the four groups of mnf proposed by stoecker 1998 types iia iib iic iiia this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we first present the general modelling framework for describing the dynamic combination of the two resource acquisition strategies namely phototrophy and phagotrophy by the different types of mnf we then incorporate these mathematical expressions in a dynamic energy budget deb model for photosynthetic cells to describe the growth kinetics of the four mnf types in section 3 we present the resulting functional responses as well as the growth kinetics for the different mnf types under varying availability of the three regulating resources namely irradiance dissolved inorganic nutrients and prey availability finally in section 4 we discuss our modelling approach and we compare the model output against qualitative observations compiled from experiments performed with organisms representative of each one of the four groups of mnf 2 methods 2 1 modelling framework in this study we model the metabolic processes taking place within the different types of mnf during the uptake and transformation of substrates using the concept of the synthesizing unit which has been developed within the framework of the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 synthesizing units sus can be described as generalized enzymes that bind arriving molecules of one or more substrates to form a product brandt et al 2003 kooijman 1998 one of the main advantages of the su is that it operates at multiple levels of biological organization from the molecular to the ecosystem level therefore sus handle a variety of substrates such as food items macromolecules or simple molecules and they may produce other macromolecules or biomass kooijman 1998 muller et al 2019 a su at its simplest form is a one substrate one product enzyme with steady state kinetics similar to those originating from the michaelis menten formulation the main difference between su and michaelis menten kinetics is that in the former the substrate arrival fluxes are used as input variables whereas in the latter the concentration or densities of substrates are used as input variables in homogenous environments this difference is not important as arrival rates of substrate molecules to the enzymes are proportional to the concentration of substrate on the basis of diffusive transport however in spatially structured environments such as the cells it is difficult to determine concentrations of substrates and so is linking transformations to concentrations in this case in deb theory growth dynamics are modelled based on mobilised reserve fluxes and therefore the mobilised reserve flux rather than diffusive transport determines the arrival rate moreover using fluxes instead of concentrations allows the perception of light availability in a similar way to substrates by using the light flux quantified in mole photons per second along with stoichiometric coupling coefficients in the light reactions of photosynthesis kooijman 2010 muller et al 2019 su mediated transformations can be classified on the basis of presence or absence of interaction between the substrates and according to their relative role in the formation of the product thus a parallel transformation occurs when there is no interaction between the two substrates whereas a sequential transformation occurs when the binding of one substrate either promotes or disables the binding of the other moreover two substrates can be complementary when both are needed at fixed stoichiometric proportions for the formation of the product and the absence of one substrate prevents the uptake of the other whereas they are called substitutable when they can be separately transformed into product the potential combinations of these four classes give rise to the four basic schemes for su mediated transformations namely sequential substitutable sequential complementary parallel substitutable and parallel complementary brandt et al 2003 kooijman 2010 the equations that describe the su kinetics on the basis of these four rules of transformation offer a general mathematical framework that can be used to study many biological processes involving two or more substrates such as photosynthesis and photoinhbition muller 2011 papadakis et al 2012 multiple nutrient limitation of photosynthetic cells grossowicz et al 2017 multiple substrate assimilation by bacteria brandt et al 2003 as well as mixotrophy kooijman et al 2002 2 2 formulation of processes mnf combine light inorganic nutrients and microbial prey to form new biomass in deb theory context biomass is partitioned into reserves and structural mass the assimilated substrates are first transformed into generalized reserves e which are described as mixtures of soluble structural biomass precursors with a fixed stoichiometry generalized reserves are then catabolized to cover maintenance and to increase the structure v of the cells kooijman et al 2002 livanou et al 2019a a schematic presentation of the processes taking place within the four different types of mnf during the assimilation a of resources into e reserves is shown in fig 1 inorganic carbon ic inorganic nutrients n and bacterial prey f are taken up from the environment by a simple one substrate su eq a 1 photosynthetic units psu harvest light l and produce reductant eq a 2 which is combined with inorganic carbon in a complementary and parallel transformation to form photosynthetically produced organic carbon c in the next step generalized reserves are formed from the combination of carbon and nutrients obtained via the two pathways of phototrophy and phagotrophy phototrophy is defined as the process of assimilating organic carbon from photosynthesis and nutrients into reserves while phagotrophy is defined as the process of prey consumption fig 2 shows schematically the merging of the assimilates from the phototrophic and phagotrophic pathways into e reserves for the four types of mnf in the following subsections the different types of mnf are presented table 1 introduces the symbols of variables and parameters used in the models equations while their derivations are given in appendix a 2 2 1 type iia in type iia mnf such as prymnesium parvum carvalho and granéli 2010 and isochrysis galbana anderson et al 2018 phototrophy is the dominant mode of nutrition whereas phagotrophy is initiated in response to inorganic nutrient e g nitrogen phosphorus limitation stoecker 1998 in this mode of mixotrophy inorganic nutrients and nutrients obtained via phagotrophy are considered substitutable substrates and interact at the level of e reserves synthesis after the formation of photosynthetically derived organic carbon by the su c eq a 3 fig 1 a it is assumed that only the nutrients from prey are used for e reserve formation whereas the organic carbon from prey is excreted to the environment these model assumptions are supported by observations showing that in prymnesium parvum chlorophyll α content in feeding and non feeding cells is constant which suggests that carbon fixation rate is not downregulated as a result of prey consumption carvalho and granéli 2010 and that cellular carbon is mostly derived from photosynthesis whereas the carbon from prey is not assimilated at any substantial level carpenter et al 2018 liu et al 2015 in addition inorganic nutrients are preferred over nutrients obtained from prey thus a free su can bind the arriving organic carbon molecules c in parallel with arriving inorganic nutrients n and proceed to e reserve formation moreover a su that has already bound a c molecule may bind the arriving nutrient molecules f from the phagotrophic pathway and then proceed to e reserve formation or reject it if a n molecule arrives fig 2 a the dynamics of the fractions of sus at the five different states θ θ n θ c θcn θcf in fig 2 a are described in detail in appendix a eq a 4 according to the

compounds necessary for growth such as various forms of organic carbon e g phospholipids or essential micronutrients e g vitamins fig 1 b stoecker 1998 an example of type iib mixotroph is some chrysophytes of the genus dinobryon caron et al 1993 liu et al 2016 in this mode of mixotrophy during photosynthesis the two complementary substrates light and inorganic carbon form an intermediate product cs at a rate j c s which is given by eq a 3 with k c 0 since the two substrates are bound to the su c but not processed yet then a free su binds first the arriving product of photosynthesis cs fig 2 b left and subsequently binds the complementary substrate from phagotrophy f to form organic carbon c at rate jc eq a 9 in a complementary sequential transformation apart from organic carbon type iib mnf can also assimilate nutrients contained in prey these assumptions are based on experiments with dinobryon cylindricum showing that this species can obtain up to 50 of their cellular carbon through prey ingestion bird and kalff 1987 and up to 100 of its cellular nitrogen and phosphorus from bacteria caron et al 1993 consequently the organic carbon in combination with inorganic nutrients and nutrients from prey will form the generalized e reserves fig 2 b right in a complementary and parallel transformation at a rate j e a given by eq a 10 the derivation of the rates of

strategy to obtain energy and carbon fig 1 c stoecker 1998 chrysochromulina brevifilum is a species exhibiting this type of nutrition using phagotrophy as a means to obtain carbon along with nutrients when light availability limits photosynthesis jones 1997 in this type of mixotrophic strategy the substrates from phototrophy and phagotrophy are substitutable and their binding to the su is parallel

experiments with ochromonas sp have shown that this algae releases dissolved inorganic nutrients when grown heterotrophically in both light and dark conditions rothhaupt 1997 sanders et al 2001 while it consumes inorganic nutrients only when prey is unavailable rothhaupt 1997 moreover transcriptomics studies with the same organism suggest that ammonium transporters are not always expressed but their expression is upregulated only when prey is not available lie et al 2017 these evidence suggest that inorganic nutrients should be taken up based on a demand rather than a supply system and therefore the uptake rate is quantified as jn j n any unassimilated carbon and nutrients from prey or any surplus of organic carbon from photosynthesis quantified from the relationship j c j c with jc given in eq a 21 is excreted outside the cell 2 3 modelling mixotrophic growth in order to study their growth dynamics under varying availability of the regulating resources namely inorganic nutrients prey and irradiance we incorporate the models developed above for the four types of mnf into the deb model for photosynthetic cells presented in detail in livanou et al 2019a a brief description of the model is given in appendix b and model equations are presented in table b1 of appendix b algae can be considered as v1 morphs a term which is used in deb theory to describe an organism in which the surface area is proportional to volume to the power of 1 consequently the distinction between a single cell and a population is eliminated in the expressions of mass fluxes and the whole population can be described by state variables that are the sum of the state variables of each individual cell kooijman 2010 lorena et al 2010 this simplification is possible due to the narrow range of size during algal cell growth which implies that the deviations from v1 morphy are irrelevant when investigating population growth kooijman 2010 lorena et al 2010 biomass of the phototrophic cells is partitioned into structural mass mv and reserve masses mi i e generalized reserves en nutrient reserves ec carbon reserves and each mass has a constant stoichiometry however biomass stoichiometry may vary due to variations in the amount of reserves and structural masses parameteriazation of mixotrophic models requires detailed information on their physiology and although considerable effort has been placed towards this direction anderson et al 2018 carpenter et al 2018 mckie krisberg et al 2015 terrado et al 2017 complete data sets covering all physiological processes e g nutrient acquisition grazing rate photosynthesis rate growth rate that are necessary for model validation are still lacking as such here emphasis is placed on the qualitative rather than the quantitative results during model analysis and interpretation of model output thus our focus in this study is to develop the theoretical models for the functional responses and analyze the growth dynamics of the four types of mnf under varying availability of irradiance inorganic nutrients and prey using parameters given in table b2 and appendix b provides justification on parameter choices the limiting inorganic nutrient could be either nitrogen or phosphorus however for the purposes of this work the models have been parameterized for inorganic nitrogen 3 results 3 1 functional responses figs 3 6 show for the four types of mnf how the rates of phototrophy j c and phagotrophy j f are varying as functions of the three regulating substrate fluxes namely inorganic nutrients prey and photons arrival fluxes to the su in type iia mixotrophs phototrophy increases with inorganic nutrients flux fig 3 a phototrophy has also a positive relationship with prey availability fig 3 b as inorganic nutrients are substituted by nutrients contained in prey the increase in phototrophy is enhanced under inorganic nutrient limitation phagotrophy decreases when inorganic nutrients flux increases fig 3 c while it has a positive relationship with photons arrival flux fig 3 d the latter means that when photosynthetic carbon production increases and inorganic nutrients availability is low feeding is enhanced to supplement nutrients in type iib mixotrophy phototrophy increases with both inorganic nutrients and prey arrival flux fig 4 a and b on the other hand phagotrophy does not depend on inorganic nutrients availability fig 4 c but it increases with photons arrival flux fig 4 d in mixotrophs of type iic phototrophy increases with inorganic nutrients flux fig 5 a but it does not depend on prey availability fig 5 b phagotrophy decreases with photons arrival flux fig 5 d as the organism prefers phototrophy over phagotrophy when light for photosynthesis is available however phagotrophy does not depend on the inorganic nutrients arrival flux fig 5 c in type iiia mixotrophs phototrophy increases with inorganic nutrients arrival flux fig 6 a whereas it decreases with prey availability fig 6 b as the organism prefers phagotrophy over phototrophy when prey is available finally phagotrophy rate is irrelevant to inorganic nutrients as well as to photons arrival flux fig 6 c and d 3 2 growth predictions in order to examine the growth kinetics of the four types of mixotrophs we combined the models describing the four mixotrophic strategies with a deb model for algal growth livanou et al 2019a see appendix b the simulations were performed for varying concentrations of prey and varying irradiance under low and high inorganic nutrients concentration fig 7 for all simulations we assume that inorganic carbon is not limiting growth in type iia mnf when inorganic nutrients concentration is high prey availability does not affect the growth rate which only depends on irradiance fig 7 a under low inorganic nutrients availability the organisms use bacterial prey to obtain nutrients which are combined with organic carbon produced from photosynthesis to form e reserves as a result there is a positive relationship between the growth rate and both prey concentration and irradiance fig 7 b finally irrespective of inorganic nutrients availability growth in these mixotrophs is inhibited in the dark even when prey concentration is high fig 7 a and b in type iib mnf the substrates from phototrophy and phagotrophy are complementary therefore the growth rate depends on the availability of both prey and light and when either one of these resources is not available the organism does not grow fig 7 c and d under low inorganic nutrients concentration growth rate decreases however the organism can maintain positive growth by using the nutrients contained in the ingested prey fig 7 d type iic mnf can use phototrophy and phagotrophy in a substitutable way under high inorganic nutrients concentration growth rate increases with irradiance whereas for low irradiance the organisms can use prey as a source of energy and nutrients to grow fig 7 e under low inorganic nutrients concentration and for low irradiance values type iic mixotrophs use phagotrophy as the feeding strategy and therefore the growth rate increases with increasing prey concentration fig 7 f however as irradiance increases a decrease in growth rate is observed this results from the assumptions about the regulation of mixotrophy in type iic mixotrophs i e the trigger for phagotrophy is energy deprivation therefore since light for photosynthesis is available the organisms have to use phototrophy as their main feeding strategy which due to the low availability of inorganic nutrients results in lower growth rate than the one achieved when using phagotrophy as their main feeding strategy fig 7 f type iiia mnf are primarily phagotrophic therefore when prey is available irrespective of inorganic nutrients availability phagotrophy is the main feeding mode and growth rate increases mostly with prey concentration fig 7 g and h on the other hand for low concentrations of prey when inorganic nutrients concentration is high type iiia mixotrophs use phototrophy as their main feeding strategy and their growth rate increases with irradiance fig 7 g however under low inorganic nutrients availability this type of mixotrophs cannot use efficiently phototrophy and therefore an increase in irradiance does not have any significant effect on their growth rate fig 7 h fig 8 presents the relationship between structural mass specific rates of organic carbon production via photosynthesis jc and organic carbon consumption via phagotrophy j f for the four different types of mnf the simulations for each type were performed for various levels of the regulating environmental factor type iia varying nutrients type iib varying prey type iic varying irradiance type iiia varying prey and by keeping all other resources constant points above the line y x indicate that c consumption is higher than c production according to the model in type iia mixotrophs as inorganic nutrient concentration decreases the rate of phagotrophy increases relative to the rate of photosynthesis however even at very low inorganic nutrients concentrations these organisms continue to photosynthesize at relatively high rates as there is an obligatory need for photosynthetically derived carbon in type iib organisms phagotrophy and photosynthesis covary in response to increasing prey concentration and irradiance results not shown as both physiological processes are necessary for the growth of these organisms type iic mixotrophs under high irradiance may consume prey at low rates but the rate of carbon production is much higher than the rate of prey consumption however when light is limiting the rate of organic carbon consumption through phagotrophy can be significantly higher than the rate of organic carbon production from photosynthesis finally in type iiia mixotrophs only at low concentrations of prey organic carbon production through photosynthesis may exceed organic carbon consumption 4 discussion in this work we present a modelling framework able to capture the diverse nutritional strategies of mixotrophic nanoflagellates the models developed here are based on the deb theory and the concept of the synthesizing unit that has been previously used to describe the mixotrophic nutrition kooijman et al 2002 troost et al 2005b here we take a step forward by accounting for the dynamic interaction of the two energy and nutrient assimilation pathways i e phototrophy and phagotrophy within the different types of mnf this new approach allowed us to describe explicitly the functional diversity within the group of mnf and to explore the contributions of phagotrophy and phototrophy to the metabolism and growth of mixotrophs under varying availability of resources overall the functional responses of the different types of mnf are in agreement with the conceptual models for mnf developed by stoecker 1998 the advantages of using su mediated transformations to describe mixotrophic growth are two fold firstly they offer a common modelling framework with enough flexibility to describe mechanistically the various nutritional strategies of mnf in this study we chose to incorporate the mathematical formulations describing mixotrophy into a deb model for algal growth in order to study the dynamic response of the four types of mnf under varying availability of light inorganic nutrients and prey however the mathematical formulations described here can be embedded within any model of algal growth as long as it accounts for the inorganic nutrient uptake and photosynthetic carbon production pathways secondly the rate of phototrophy and phagotrophy can be described with a single function with no need to formulate extra assumptions such as threshold values in order to describe the regulation of photorophy and phagotrophy thresholds are generally difficult to evaluate and metabolically not very realistic for example experiments with prymnesium parvum a type iia mixotroph show that when both prey and nutrients are available the organism continues to feed in order to obtain nutrients from prey but the frequency of feeding cells in the population decreases which suggests a preference for phototrophy carvalho and granéli 2010 moreover in chrysochromulina ericina a prymnesiophyte with typical type iic behaviour phagotrophy continued when prey concentration was high even though light was readily available hansen and hjorth 2002 these findings indicate that there is a continuum rather than abrupt switches between phagotrophy and phototrophy in mixotrophic organisms in our models by using the su concept to merge the substrates from phagotrophy and phototrophy we avoid the need to define switches in the model structure this means that there are no either or situations where the organisms can use only one mode of nutrition in a given moment but both pathways can operate simultaneously however the relative importance of each of the two pathways will depend on the type of mixotrophy the organism specific parameters and the availability of the regulating resources thus su mediated transformations provide a parameter sparse approach kooijman 1998 that allows for smooth transitions from one nutritional mode to the other when resources availability in the environment is changing light dependency of both growth and prey ingestion has been observed in several constitutive mixotrophs such as the chlorophytes of the genus nephroselmis the haptophytes isochrysis galbana anderson et al 2018 and prymnesium parvum brutemark and granéli 2011 and the chrysophyte dinobryon cylindricum caron et al 1993 it seems that in these organisms there is an obligatory demand for photosyntehtically derived carbon that cannot be substituted from carbon obtained via phagotrophy in reflection of these observations a common approach when modelling the growth dynamics of these organisms is to impose a minimum level of phototrophy berge et al 2016 flynn and mitra 2009 ghyoot et al 2017 the models for types iia and iib developed in the present study are able to adequately reproduce the observed patterns of covariation of phagotrophy rate and light availability and of the light depended growth even when prey is available at high concentrations at the same time in our modelling formulation for types iia and iib the observation of low growth and low phagotrophy rate when photosynthesis is inhibited emerges from su kinetics and the rules of the sequential complementary transformation without the need to formulate extra assumptions despite the similarity regarding the light dependent growth for types iia and iib there is an important difference between the two mixotrophic strategies our simulations show that in type iia mixotrophs under high inorganic nutrients concentration phagotrophy rate decreases while the growth rate does not depend on prey concentration suggesting that these organisms can fully substitute phagotrophy with phototrophy when inorganic nutrients are not limiting thus model behaviour is consistent with patterns observed in experimental cultures of nephroselemis sp and isochrysis galbana anderson et al 2018 showing that the percentage of feeding cells and the ingestion rates drastically decreased when nutrient limitation was alleviated on the other hand type iib mixotrophs require both light and prey in order to grow in our model formulation they consume prey to obtain a portion of their organic carbon probably an organic compound necessary for growth that they cannot synthesize while they can also assimilate the nutrients that are contained in prey this allows them to grow when both prey and light are available even when inorganic nutrients are limiting the covariation of c consumption and c production in response to both irradianace and prey availability in type iib mixotrophs shown by our model is a consequence of the complementary role of the two pathways for the growth of this type of mnf carbon fixation and ingestion rates have been shown to covary in response to light availability for ochromonas ccmp1393 wilken et al 2019a and this is also reflected in the transcriptomic response of the strain in varying availability of light and bacterial prey lie et al 2018 it is important to note that such a response could not have been modelled if a trait based approach using differential investment in the two nutritional pathways i e phototrophy and phagotrophy would be used berge et al 2016 wilken et al 2019a overall these findings indicate that type iib mixotrophs are obligate mixotrophs as opposed to type iia mixotrophs which are obligate phototrophs but facultative mixotrophs type iic mixotrophs use phagotrophy as an alternative strategy to obtain energy when growing under sub optimum irradiance the inverse relationship between c production via photosynthesis and c consumption via phagotrophy in response to irradiance shown by our simulations corroborate well with observations in ochromonas ccmp2951 isolate wilken et al 2019a these patterns derive from the substitutable nature of the substrates from phototrophy and phagotrophy and highlight the facultative mixotrophic potential of type iic mnf it is worth mentioning that despite the inverse relationship between light availability and phagotrophy in our model phagotrophy rate will never become zero when prey is available eq a 14 in that way model behaviour is in agreement with experiments showing that phagotrophy rate decreases with increasing irradiance in chrysochromulina ericina and ochromonas ccmp2951 yet remaining above zero as long as prey is available hansen and hjorth 2002 wilken et al 2019a in our model the ratio between phototrophy and phagotrophy when both light and prey are available will depend on parameter values that are specific to the organism of interest moreover according to our model output these organisms benefit from phagotrophy only at low irradiances that do not allow maximum photosynthetic rates to be reached as irradiance increases the positive effect of phagotrophy on the growth rate is less significant as the organism relies more on phototrophy for energy derivation and growth these results are consistent with experimental studies with chrysochromulina ericina hansen and hjorth 2002 and chrysochromulina brevifilum jones 1997 showing that the growth rate increased in response to prey addition for algae grown at low irradiances whereas at high irradiances prey availability did not affect the growth rate in chrysochromulina ericina hansen and hjorth 2002 nevertheless exceptions from this behaviour have been reported as for example with ochromonas ccmp2951 that always exhibited higher growth rates when prey was available irrespective of light availability wilken et al 2019a although in type iic mixotrophs energy deprivation is the stimulus that enhances phagotrophy the organism may also benefit from the nutrients contained in their prey in our approach we assumed that when type iic mixotrophs ingest prey they can directly form reserves as they can use both carbon and nutrients contained in prey thus our simulations show that under nutrient limiting conditions growth rate increases as a function of prey concentration however this increase is more pronounced at low irradiances when the flux of organic carbon to the su c is diminished allowing the substrates from phagotrophy to bind to the free su observations of increasing abundance of chrysochromulina brevifilum with increasing availability of prey under nutrient and light limiting conditions are in agreement with our model output jones 1997 conversely the model shows that under nutrient limiting conditions when irradiance levels are high type iic mixotrophs are obliged to use phototrophy which results in lower growth rate than the one achieved when using phagotrophy as their main feeding strategy this prediction may appear strange since one can hypothesize that an organism that has the ability to feed would do so when it is nutrient limited in support of our model predictions come the experimental observations on the species mantoniella antarctica and geminigera cryophila showing that ingestion rates were increased in response to light limitation but not in response to nutrient limitation mckie krisberg et al 2015 on the other hand the flagellate pyramimonas tychotreta consumed bacteria only when inorganic nutrient concentration was low irrespective of light availability yet under nutrient limitation ingestion rates were also inversely related to light availability mckie krisberg et al 2015 these findings suggest that a combination of inorganic nutrients concentration primarily and light availability secondarily stimulates phagotrophy in this species since the development of formulations for the four types of mnf as were defined by stoecker 1998 was the aim of the present study the current version of the model cannot resolve situations where combinations of resources are involved in the regulation of assimilation pathways in mnf nevertheless on the strength of the su approach such a response could easily be resolved by assuming a similar transformation as in type iic but with three interacting substrates and with the point of merging of phototrophy and phagotrophy positioned after the assimilation of both organic carbon from photosynthesis and nutrients into e reserves precursor molecules for type iiia mnf our results show that phototrophy is beneficial to these organisms only for low concentrations of available prey while there is an inverse relationship between c production and c consumption in response to prey availability ochromonas sp strain bg 1 is an example of type iiia mixotrophs in this organism phagotrophy is the dominant mode of nutrition while chla synthesis and therefore photosynthesis as well as ammonium uptake is upregulated once prey is depleted lie et al 2017 our model adequately reproduces the experimental observations highlighting the substitutable role of phototrophy and phagotrophy and thus the facultative mixotrophic potential in type iiia mixotrophs for these mnf phototrophy is a survival strategy to cope with prey concentrations lower than those that allow efficient heterotrophic growth lie et al 2017 rothhaupt 0000 the capability for phototrophy may allow these mixotrophs to coexist with pure heterotrophs for example ochromonas sp coexisted with the pure heterotroph bodo sp when light was available however it was excluded by bodo sp when photosynthesis was disabled rothhaupt 1996 mixotrophic organisms have to invest in the synthesis and maintenance of both a phototrophic and a phagotorophic apparatus which can lead to an increased metabolic cost raven 1997 the costs of maintaining a photosynthetic apparatus has been estimated to be up to 50 of the total energy carbon and nutrients of the cell whereas the costs of synthesis and maintenance of the phagotrophic machinery has been estimated to be 10 of the cells total energy carbon and nutrients raven 1997 these combined energetic costs may result in lower growth rates compared to pure photo or phagotrophs raven 1997 rothhaupt 1996 tittel et al 2003 ward et al 2011 moreover mixotrophic organisms have to partition their finite cell surface between uptake sites for dissolved inorganic and particulate organic resources ward et al 2011 which should result in a reduced ability to take up resources in comparison to specialists pure photo and phago trophs this suggests that when resources are not limiting specialists should be able to outcompete generalists i e mixotrophs mathematical models that account for these trade offs are useful tools to perform such a costs benefit analysis to understand the ecological aspects of mixotrophy e g crane and grover 2010 thingstad et al 1996 troost et al 2005a 2005b våge et al 2013 ward et al 2011 although the aim of this study was not to conduct such a cost benefit analysis on the trade offs of mixotrophy the modelling framework presented here allows to account for the costs of mixotrophy these costs can be incorporated in the stoichiometric coefficients y 1 2 in line with previous models of mixotrophy in the context of deb theory troost et al 2005a 2005b these coefficients quantify the amount of substrate either photosynthetically produced carbon or prey required to form one mol of e reserve the value of y 1 2 depends on the operating assimilation pathway and it may be higher for the phototrophic than for the phagotrophic pathway on the basis of raven 1997 moreover the trade offs of mixotrophy can be incorporated in the values of maximum assimilation rates and half saturation constants ward et al 2011 or in mixotrophs stoichiometric requirements which should be higher than specialists crane and grover 2010 ward et al 2011 finally the maintenance rate of constitutive mixotrophs may also be higher than pure phototrophs or pure phagotrophs as constitutive mixotrophs have to maintain both assimilation machineries it should be noted however that these theoretical assumptions remain hypothetical and cannot be adequately constraint by the available experimental data våge et al 2013 ward et al 2011 moreover the ability of the different types of mixotrophic nanoflagellates to control to a certain extent the relative investment on each of the two pathways on the basis of the prevailing environmental conditions may be also a cost effective way to reduce the costs of maintaining the apparatus for both trophic pathways simultaneously stoecker 1998 using our models to compare the rates of organic carbon production and prey consumption we show that the different nutritional strategies result in different functional roles of mnf within the planktonic food webs moreover these functional roles are not fixed but they can change in response to varying resources availability for example our model shows that type iia mixotrophs increase their prey consumption as inorganic nutrient availability decreases however type iia mnf continue to produce organic carbon as photosynthesis is the only way for these organisms to cover their energy and carbon requirements this strategy has important implications in terms of primary production especially for oligotrophic systems as this type of mixotrophs can maintain high rates of carbon fixation and new biomass production even when inorganic nutrients are limiting indeed field studies conducted in the oligotrophic p depleted mediterranean sea have revealed a negative correlation between ingestion rates of mnf and phosphorus livanou et al 2019a unrein et al 2007 suggesting that type iia mixotrophs may dominate the mnf community in this and possibly other oligotrophic environments interestingly the competitive advantage of type iia mnf over the strict phototrophs and heterotrophs under oligotropihc conditions is regulated by light availability ptacnik et al 2016 moreover our simulations show that in type iib mixotrophs prey consumption increases proportionally to carbon fixation in response to both prey availability and photons arrival flux but in all cases these mixotrophs are functioning as net primary producers as the rate of organic carbon production is always higher than the rate of prey consumption in agreement with our findings in ochromonas strain ccmp1393 a type iib mnf it has been shown that phagotrophy enhances photosynthesis and therefore organic carbon production suggesting a role of net producer for this strain lie et al 2018 wilken et al 2019a of course the net effect of type iib mnf will depend on the relative magnitude of the rate of phagotrophy as compared to the rate of carbon fixation that may vary in different species on the other hand our model shows that the ecological role of type iic mixotrophs depends on light availability and suggests a role of net consumers under light limiting conditions indeed increased grazing activity in the dark comparable to purely phagotrophic nanoflagellates has been observed in the antarctic mnf geminigera cryophila and mantoniella antarctica mckie krisberg et al 2015 thus type iic mixotrophy may have important implications for the carbon fluxes in polar seas where photosynthetic organisms have to deal with the long periods of darkness during the austral winter finally type iiia mixotrophs have the role of net producers only for low concentrations of prey however as prey availability increases type iiia mnf switch from being net producers to being net consumers such pattern of increased phagotrophy rate and decreased photosynthesis when prey is readily available has been observed in ochromonas strain bg 1 suggesting a role of net consumer for this mnf of type iiia lie et al 2017 in conclusion this modelling study is among the few that take into account the variety of nutritional strategies within mnf the mathematical framework developed here allows to model the functional roles of mnf within the microbial community and to study how these roles are affected by resources availability our study shows that the range of energy and nutrient acquisition strategies in combination with the variety of metabolic responses of the different types of mnf to environmental drivers determine the net ecosystem impact of mnf in terms of carbon fluxes from our simulations it is obvious that the response of food web dynamics and flow of elements to changing environmental conditions will depend among others on the mixotrophic assemblage that is present however the spatiotemporal distributions of mixotrophic strategies remain largely unresolved to date leles et al 2019 wilken et al 2019b thus our work highlights the importance of differentiating among the four nutritional strategies observed in mnf in both field and modelling studies in order to adequately describe the carbon and nutrient fluxes in aquatic systems and predict their response to future climate change scenarios at the same time our study offers a suitable mathematical framework that can be used in order to integrate the functional diversity of mnf in aquatic ecosystems models credit authorship contribution statement eleni

appendix a this appendix provides the derivation of the mathematical models for the four different types of mixotrophic nutrition of mnf the uptake rates of inorganic carbon inorganic nutrients n and prey f follow classic michaelis menten kinetics given by a 1 j i j i a m x i x i k i i i c n f where j i a m is the maximum uptake rate of substrate i xi denotes the concentration of substrate i and ki is the half saturation constant mnf have a photosynthetic system with which they stepwise convert light l and inorganic carbon ic into organic carbon c photons arrive at photosynthetic units psus at a rate proportional to incident light intensity and bind to psus with a probability ρl the specific photons arrival rate is a 2 j l α l l with αl the specific photons arrival cross section all fluxes of substrates are expressed as specific fluxes i e per unit of structural mass and denoted as j next we focus on the formalism for the mechanisms of sus processing resources acquired via phototrophy and phagotrophy to simplify the notation the rate at which substrate molecules say of type a arrive and bind at the su is scaled to the number of molecules yap required to produce one molecule of product p i e j a ρ a j a y a p where ρa is the probability that molecules of substrate a bind to the su type iia type iia mnf are primary phototrophic but consume prey to obtain limiting inorganic nutrients in these mnf first light and inorganic carbon are processed by the su c fig 1 to produce organic carbon in a complementary and parallel transformation meaning that both substrates are required to form the product and that the binding of one substrate to the su is independent from the binding of the other see for example lika and papadakis 2009 livanou et al 2019a thus the specific organic carbon production rate is given by a 3 j c k c 1 j i c 1 j l 1 j i c j l 1 1 in type iia transformation fig 2 a the possible states of the sus are five θ θ c θ n θcn and θcf a free su θ may bind the organic carbon from photosynthesis c or inorganic nutrient n giving the states θ c or θ n respectively the dot means absence of substrate these sus may bind the absent substrate giving the state θcn to form reserves and then return to the state θ an su at the state θ c may also bind nutrients obtained from phagotrophy giving the state θcf which either return to the state θ by forming the product e or may reject the substrate from phagotrophy if an inorganic nutrient molecule arrives resulting to the state θcn the dynamics of the su fractions are given by the following

which is equivalent to reserve formation of a phototroph see for example livanou et al 2019a this corresponds to a complementary and parallel transformation brandt et al 2003 of the two substrates the photosynthetically produced organic carbon and the inorganic nutrient on the other extreme in the absence of inorganic nutrient i e j n 0 the rate of reserve assimilation eq a 6 reduces to j e a k c f

form organic carbon fig 2 b left the possible states of the sus are θ θ c s and θ c s f a free su θ binds arriving molecules from an intermediate product cs formed during photosynthesis combining light and inorganic carbon arriving at the state θ c s subsequently it binds the complementary growth factor from phagotrophy arriving at state θ c s f an su at the state θ c s f returns to the state

model for photosynthetic cells livanou et al 2019a the assimilation a of generalized reserves for the four types of mnf described in section 2 2 is based on su kinetics which imply rejection fluxes due to stoichiometric constraints the assimilation fluxes j e c a and j e n a quantified by eq b1 2 for types iia iib and iic are directed to the ec and en reserves respectively whereas type iiia mixotrophs being primarily heterotrophic do not have the ec and en reserves and any excess fluxes are excreted to the environment during catabolism c reserves are mobilized to allow the growth g and maintenance m of the organisms reserve densities m e m e m v m e i m e i m v with i c n where m denotes the masses of structure v and reserves e e c e n follow first order kinetics and the resulting catabolic fluxes j e c and j e i c given by eq b1 3 are used by the organism for maintenance and growth the reserve turnover rate k is constant and is taken to be the same for all reserves kooijman 2010 lorena et al 2010 the specific catabolic fluxes j e i c from ei reserves i c n are combined by a synthesizing unit to form a compound e identical to the generalized reserve e according to eq b1 4 while the catabolic fluxes from ec and en reserves that cannot be used for e production are rejected at a rate given by eq b1 5 a fraction of this flux κ e i with i c n is fed back to the respective reserves ec en and the rest 1 κ e i is excreted outside the cell the two catabolic fluxes j e c and j e c are combined together by the growth su which is assumed to be fast enough to avoid spoiling of reserves to form the flux j v g eq b1 6 which will be used for growth after covering the maintenance costs of the cell j e m in case that the catabolic fluxes are not enough to pay the maintenance costs the flux j v g is zero and the remainder is covered from structure at a rate j v m eq b1 7 the net specific growth rate r eq b1 8 is calculated numerically and it can take negative values when j v m 0 parameter values parameters that are specific to mixotrophic nanoflagellates have been poorly characterised to date which means that in most cases our parameter choices are necessarily arbitrary nevertheless this approach is reasonable since our aim in this work was to evaluate the qualitative behaviour of the models developed here for the four type of mixotrophic nanoflagellates and compare them with experimentally derived patterns and observations as such following the approach of crane and grover 2010 most of the phototrophy related parameters were assumed to be similar to those of pure phototrophs and the phagotrophy related parameters were assumed to be similar to pure phagotrophs the latter assumption finds support in some experimental evidence suggesting that the grazing rates of pure phagotrophs and phototrophs can be similar e g livanou et al 2019b porter 1988 tsai et al 2011 the binding probability of photons ρl eq a 2 is a compound parameter calculated as ρ l ρ l m a x ρ l m a x ρ l m i n e b q n 2 where q n n n e m e m e n n n v m v is the nitrogen content in the reserves relative to structure parameters ρlmin and ρlmax correspond to the minimum and maximum binding probabilities to the su respectively therefore they are constrained in the interval 0 1 ρlmin and b was taken from livanou et al 2019a whereas for ρlmax we assumed a maximum value of 1 αl was taken from lika and papadakis 2009 kic was taken from clark and flynn 2000 kn was taken from eppley et al 1969 while j n a m had to be assumed note however that key parameters of nutrient uptake such as the maximum uptake rate and the half saturation constant often depend on growth conditions and thus can vary greatly litchman et al 2007 the handling rate k c corresponds to the maximum rate of carbohydrates formation i e maximum rate of photosynthesis and it was taken from crane and grover 2010 in the absence of available data all handling rates for the rest of the substrates were assumed to be equal to k c j i c a m was taken from livanou et al 2019a the specific respiration rate maintenance rate j e m in our model was taken from geider and osborne 1989 in order to obtain a value for the half saturation constant for prey uptake kf we transformed the values reported in mohapatra and fukami 2004 for two marine heterotrophic nanoflagellates preying on bacteria from number of bacteria ml 1 to µm using a conversion factor of 20 fg c bacterial cell 1 lee and fuhrman 1987 this gave a range for kf from 2 3 15 8µm and our choice was based on this range whereas the maximum prey ingestion rate jf had to be assumed the reserve turnover rate k was adjusted from lorena et al 2010 the stoichiometric coefficient ylc was taken from livanou et al 2019a the elemental composition for nanoflagellates structure generalized reserve and prey n 1 2 was derived assuming redfield molar ratio c n 106 16 the stoichiometric coefficient yne was assumed to be the same as nne the stoichiometric coefficient yev which quantifies the cost of transformation was taken from livanou et al 2019a and we assumed the same value for yce which quantifies the cost of reserve formation the stoichiometric coefficient yicc that couples inorganic carbon to organic carbon formation results from the stoichiometry of dark reactions the stoichiometric coefficient y c s c was based on caron et al 1993 who found that in dinobryon cylindricum most of the organic carbon of the mixotroph 75 was produced via photosynthesis the phagotrophy yield coefficient had to be assumed while the stoichiometric coefficient yfc that stoichiometrically couples phagotrophy rate with the organic carbon formation rate for type iib is calculated from y and y c s c for types iia iic iia phagotrophy rate is coupled to the generalized reserves formation rate with the stoichiometric coefficient yfc which is calculated from the phagotrophy yield y 
24849,mixotrophic nanoflagellates mnf play a key role in the carbon flux within aquatic ecosystems they contribute significantly to primary production while at the same time they are important consumers of bacteria mnf comprise a diverse assemblage with a whole range of photosynthetic and feeding potential and with various metabolic responses to environmental drivers such as light nutrients and prey availability however in most cases mnf are modelled as a single functional group with no reference to the distinct nutritional strategies and constraints of the different types of mnf here we develop a mathematical framework for the distinct functional responses of four types of mnf our approach is based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory and the concept of synthesing unit su which is used to merge phototrophic and phagotrophic nutrition into mixotrophic growth the resulting models describe explicitly the functional diversity of the mnf group taking into account the dynamic interaction of phototrophy and phagotrophy within the four types of mnf our results are in agreement with theoretical expectations and a wide range of experimental observations for the different types of mnf our simulations suggest that the growth dynamics of the four types of mnf are affected differently by the availability of resources moreover using our models to compare the rates of organic carbon production and prey consumption by the various mnf types we show that their net ecosystem role as producers or consumers depends on the mixotrophic strategy and it can vary as a function of the prevailing environmental conditions overall our study highlights the importance of mechanistically modelling the distinct metabolic responses of the different types of mnf to environmental drivers in order to better understand their role in the carbon cycle in anticipation of global environmental changes keywords mixotrophy nanoflagellates functional response synthesizing unit deb theory 1 introduction mixotrophic nanoflagellates mnf that are able to combine phototrophy and phagotrophy in a single cell sanders 1991 are important consumers of bacteria often accounting for more than 50 of total bacterivory in both freshwater gerea et al 2018 and marine ecosystems livanou et al 2019b unrein et al 2007 zubkov and tarran 2008 moreover they are responsible for a significant fraction of marine primary production jardillier et al 2010 therefore these protists have a dual role functioning both as primary producers and as consumers mitra et al 2014 affecting the flow of carbon and nutrients through the aquatic food web ward and follows 2016 mnf comprise a diverse group including various phylogenetic lineages such as chrysophytes haptophytes cryptophytes silicoflagellates dictyophytes and chlorophytes stoecker et al 2017 however mnf are collectively termed as constitutive mixotrophs cm sensu mitra et al 2016 due to their inherent ability to photosynthesize as they carry chloroplasts which are well integrated both physiologically and evolutionarily stoecker et al 2017 the vast phylogenetic variability of mnf results in a large functional diversity and a range of photosynthetic and feeding capabilities that do not always vary systematically with phylogeny jones 1997 mitra et al 2016 stoecker 1998 laboratory studies with mnf have shown that environmental cues such as light and macro or micro nutrient limitation and prey availability regulate the rate of feeding or photosynthesis of mnf while they display variable dependence and preference to each of the trophic modes i e phototrophy and phagotrophy for growth and energy derivation liu et al 2016 mckie krisberg et al 2015 different functional roles of mnf are implied as a result of the relative importance of phototrophy and phagotrophy in their growth which may have profound effects on carbon and nutrient cycling in the ecosystem wilken et al 2018 worden et al 2015 stoecker 1998 proposed conceptual models for the different physiological types of mixotrophic flagellates in an attempt to categorize them and understand their role in ecosystem dynamics thus stoecker 1998 identified three physiological types of phagotrophic algae which are primarily phototrophic and can assimilate dissolved inorganic nutrients while i feeding is initiated in response to nutrient limitation e g n p or fe type iia ii feeding is a strategy to obtain organic compounds necessary for growth type iib and iii feeding is a response to low light in order to obtain energy and carbon type iic furthermore mixotrophic nanoflagellates that are primarily phagotrophic are termed as type iiia in stoecker 1998 and they are characterized by the ability to engage in phototrophy through carbon fixation and inorganic nutrients assimilation when prey are scarce to date diverse approaches in modelling the mixotrophic nutrition of constitutive mixotrophs have been developed with a varying level of complexity simpler approaches use additive descriptions of phototrophy and phagotrophy with no reference to the dynamic interchange of the two modes of nutrition hammer and pitchford 2005 stickney et al 2000 thingstad et al 1996 kooijman and colleagues kooijman et al 2002 troost et al 2005b were the first that attempted to model mixotrophic organisms with reference to the physiological mechanisms of energy assimilation and usage by the individuals in their work however they did not resolve the dynamic interaction between the phototrophic and phagotrophic nutritional strategy on the other hand flynn and colleagues flynn and mitra 2009 ghyoot et al 2017 leles et al 2018 mitra et al 2014 incorporated the interactions between the alternating energy and nutrient acquisition pathways using regulatory functions that modulate the rates of phototrophy and phagotrophy under certain physiological conditions nevertheless the functional diversity within the mnf group as was conceptualised by stoecker 1998 with reference to the dynamic interaction of the two modes of nutrition has not been mathematically described to date however a mechanistic modelling framework for the different functional types of mixotrophic nanoflagellates is necessary if we are to understand how their role in biogeochemical processes depends on the prevailing environmental factors and therefore to predict how carbon and nutrients cycles will be affected by the global climate change the aim of this study is to develop mathematical models that describe the functional responses for the four groups of mnf proposed by stoecker 1998 types iia iib iic iiia this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we first present the general modelling framework for describing the dynamic combination of the two resource acquisition strategies namely phototrophy and phagotrophy by the different types of mnf we then incorporate these mathematical expressions in a dynamic energy budget deb model for photosynthetic cells to describe the growth kinetics of the four mnf types in section 3 we present the resulting functional responses as well as the growth kinetics for the different mnf types under varying availability of the three regulating resources namely irradiance dissolved inorganic nutrients and prey availability finally in section 4 we discuss our modelling approach and we compare the model output against qualitative observations compiled from experiments performed with organisms representative of each one of the four groups of mnf 2 methods 2 1 modelling framework in this study we model the metabolic processes taking place within the different types of mnf during the uptake and transformation of substrates using the concept of the synthesizing unit which has been developed within the framework of the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 synthesizing units sus can be described as generalized enzymes that bind arriving molecules of one or more substrates to form a product brandt et al 2003 kooijman 1998 one of the main advantages of the su is that it operates at multiple levels of biological organization from the molecular to the ecosystem level therefore sus handle a variety of substrates such as food items macromolecules or simple molecules and they may produce other macromolecules or biomass kooijman 1998 muller et al 2019 a su at its simplest form is a one substrate one product enzyme with steady state kinetics similar to those originating from the michaelis menten formulation the main difference between su and michaelis menten kinetics is that in the former the substrate arrival fluxes are used as input variables whereas in the latter the concentration or densities of substrates are used as input variables in homogenous environments this difference is not important as arrival rates of substrate molecules to the enzymes are proportional to the concentration of substrate on the basis of diffusive transport however in spatially structured environments such as the cells it is difficult to determine concentrations of substrates and so is linking transformations to concentrations in this case in deb theory growth dynamics are modelled based on mobilised reserve fluxes and therefore the mobilised reserve flux rather than diffusive transport determines the arrival rate moreover using fluxes instead of concentrations allows the perception of light availability in a similar way to substrates by using the light flux quantified in mole photons per second along with stoichiometric coupling coefficients in the light reactions of photosynthesis kooijman 2010 muller et al 2019 su mediated transformations can be classified on the basis of presence or absence of interaction between the substrates and according to their relative role in the formation of the product thus a parallel transformation occurs when there is no interaction between the two substrates whereas a sequential transformation occurs when the binding of one substrate either promotes or disables the binding of the other moreover two substrates can be complementary when both are needed at fixed stoichiometric proportions for the formation of the product and the absence of one substrate prevents the uptake of the other whereas they are called substitutable when they can be separately transformed into product the potential combinations of these four classes give rise to the four basic schemes for su mediated transformations namely sequential substitutable sequential complementary parallel substitutable and parallel complementary brandt et al 2003 kooijman 2010 the equations that describe the su kinetics on the basis of these four rules of transformation offer a general mathematical framework that can be used to study many biological processes involving two or more substrates such as photosynthesis and photoinhbition muller 2011 papadakis et al 2012 multiple nutrient limitation of photosynthetic cells grossowicz et al 2017 multiple substrate assimilation by bacteria brandt et al 2003 as well as mixotrophy kooijman et al 2002 2 2 formulation of processes mnf combine light inorganic nutrients and microbial prey to form new biomass in deb theory context biomass is partitioned into reserves and structural mass the assimilated substrates are first transformed into generalized reserves e which are described as mixtures of soluble structural biomass precursors with a fixed stoichiometry generalized reserves are then catabolized to cover maintenance and to increase the structure v of the cells kooijman et al 2002 livanou et al 2019a a schematic presentation of the processes taking place within the four different types of mnf during the assimilation a of resources into e reserves is shown in fig 1 inorganic carbon ic inorganic nutrients n and bacterial prey f are taken up from the environment by a simple one substrate su eq a 1 photosynthetic units psu harvest light l and produce reductant eq a 2 which is combined with inorganic carbon in a complementary and parallel transformation to form photosynthetically produced organic carbon c in the next step generalized reserves are formed from the combination of carbon and nutrients obtained via the two pathways of phototrophy and phagotrophy phototrophy is defined as the process of assimilating organic carbon from photosynthesis and nutrients into reserves while phagotrophy is defined as the process of prey consumption fig 2 shows schematically the merging of the assimilates from the phototrophic and phagotrophic pathways into e reserves for the four types of mnf in the following subsections the different types of mnf are presented table 1 introduces the symbols of variables and parameters used in the models equations while their derivations are given in appendix a 2 2 1 type iia in type iia mnf such as prymnesium parvum carvalho and granéli 2010 and isochrysis galbana anderson et al 2018 phototrophy is the dominant mode of nutrition whereas phagotrophy is initiated in response to inorganic nutrient e g nitrogen phosphorus limitation stoecker 1998 in this mode of mixotrophy inorganic nutrients and nutrients obtained via phagotrophy are considered substitutable substrates and interact at the level of e reserves synthesis after the formation of photosynthetically derived organic carbon by the su c eq a 3 fig 1 a it is assumed that only the nutrients from prey are used for e reserve formation whereas the organic carbon from prey is excreted to the environment these model assumptions are supported by observations showing that in prymnesium parvum chlorophyll α content in feeding and non feeding cells is constant which suggests that carbon fixation rate is not downregulated as a result of prey consumption carvalho and granéli 2010 and that cellular carbon is mostly derived from photosynthesis whereas the carbon from prey is not assimilated at any substantial level carpenter et al 2018 liu et al 2015 in addition inorganic nutrients are preferred over nutrients obtained from prey thus a free su can bind the arriving organic carbon molecules c in parallel with arriving inorganic nutrients n and proceed to e reserve formation moreover a su that has already bound a c molecule may bind the arriving nutrient molecules f from the phagotrophic pathway and then proceed to e reserve formation or reject it if a n molecule arrives fig 2 a the dynamics of the fractions of sus at the five different states θ θ n θ c θcn θcf in fig 2 a are described in detail in appendix a eq a 4 according to the transformation rules of type iia mixotrophy the rate of e reserves assimilation is proportional to the fractions of sus at quasi steady state θ c n and θ c f eq a 5 thus e reserves are formed at a rate j e a k c n θ c n k c f θ c f eq a 6 the explicit solutions of θ c n and θ c f are lengthy and their substitution in eq a 6 does not result in a simpler expression for this type of nutritional strategy the rates of organic carbon j c prey j f and inorganic nutrients j n used for e reserves formation are 1 j c y c e k c n θ c n k c f θ c f j f y f e k c f θ c f j n y n e k c n θ c n where θ c n and θ c f are given by eq a 5 phototrophy rate and phagotrophy rate are quantified by j c and j f respectively all respiratory costs of the phototrophic or the phagotrophic pathways quantified by yce are paid by photosynthesis unassimilated carbon and nutrients from prey are excreted to the environment 2 2 2 type iib mnf of type iib use phagotrophy as a nutritional strategy to obtain organic compounds necessary for growth such as various forms of organic carbon e g phospholipids or essential micronutrients e g vitamins fig 1 b stoecker 1998 an example of type iib mixotroph is some chrysophytes of the genus dinobryon caron et al 1993 liu et al 2016 in this mode of mixotrophy during photosynthesis the two complementary substrates light and inorganic carbon form an intermediate product cs at a rate j c s which is given by eq a 3 with k c 0 since the two substrates are bound to the su c but not processed yet then a free su binds first the arriving product of photosynthesis cs fig 2 b left and subsequently binds the complementary substrate from phagotrophy f to form organic carbon c at rate jc eq a 9 in a complementary sequential transformation apart from organic carbon type iib mnf can also assimilate nutrients contained in prey these assumptions are based on experiments with dinobryon cylindricum showing that this species can obtain up to 50 of their cellular carbon through prey ingestion bird and kalff 1987 and up to 100 of its cellular nitrogen and phosphorus from bacteria caron et al 1993 consequently the organic carbon in combination with inorganic nutrients and nutrients from prey will form the generalized e reserves fig 2 b right in a complementary and parallel transformation at a rate j e a given by eq a 10 the derivation of the rates of product formation is described in appendix a for this type of nutritional strategy the rates of organic carbon j c prey j f and nutrients j n inorganic and from prey used for e reserves formation are 2 j c y c e j e a j f y f c j c j n y n e j e a where jc is given by eq a 9 and j e a is given by eq a 10 phototrophy rate and phagotrophy rate are quantified by j c and j f respectively the respiratory costs of assimilation are included in the stoichiometric coefficient yce while the costs of phagotrophy are included in the stoichiometric coefficient yfc unassimilated carbon and nutrients from prey are excreted to the environment 2 2 3 type iic in type iic mnf phototrophy is the dominant mode of nutrition while phagotrophy is initiated in response to light limitation as a

experiments with ochromonas sp have shown that this algae releases dissolved inorganic nutrients when grown heterotrophically in both light and dark conditions rothhaupt 1997 sanders et al 2001 while it consumes inorganic nutrients only when prey is unavailable rothhaupt 1997 moreover transcriptomics studies with the same organism suggest that ammonium transporters are not always expressed but their expression is upregulated only when prey is not available lie et al 2017 these evidence suggest that inorganic nutrients should be taken up based on a demand rather than a supply system and

given in eq a 21 is excreted outside the cell 2 3 modelling mixotrophic growth in order to study their growth dynamics under varying availability of the regulating resources namely inorganic nutrients prey and irradiance we incorporate the models developed above for the four types of mnf into the deb model for photosynthetic cells presented in detail in livanou et al 2019a a brief description of the model is given in appendix b and model equations are presented in table b1 of appendix b algae can be considered as v1 morphs a term which is used in deb theory to describe an organism in which the surface area is proportional to volume to the power of 1 consequently the distinction between a single cell and a population is eliminated in the expressions of mass fluxes and the whole population can be described by state variables that are the sum of the state variables of each individual cell kooijman 2010 lorena et al 2010 this simplification is possible due to the narrow range of size during algal cell growth which implies that the deviations from v1 morphy are irrelevant when investigating population growth kooijman 2010 lorena et al 2010 biomass of the phototrophic cells is partitioned into structural mass mv and reserve masses mi i e generalized reserves en nutrient reserves ec carbon reserves and each mass has a constant stoichiometry however biomass stoichiometry may vary due to variations in the amount of reserves and structural masses parameteriazation of mixotrophic models requires detailed information on their physiology and although considerable effort has been placed towards this direction anderson et al 2018 carpenter et al 2018 mckie krisberg et al 2015 terrado et al 2017 complete data sets covering all physiological processes e g nutrient acquisition grazing rate photosynthesis rate growth rate that are necessary for model validation are still lacking as such here emphasis is placed on the qualitative rather than the quantitative results during model analysis and interpretation of model output thus our focus in this study is to develop the theoretical models for the functional responses and analyze the growth dynamics of the four types of mnf under varying availability of irradiance inorganic nutrients and prey using parameters given in table b2 and appendix b provides justification on parameter choices the limiting inorganic nutrient could be either nitrogen or phosphorus however for the purposes of this work the models have been parameterized for inorganic nitrogen 3 results 3 1 functional responses figs 3 6 show for the four types of mnf how the rates of phototrophy j c and phagotrophy j f are varying as functions of the three regulating substrate fluxes namely inorganic nutrients prey and photons arrival fluxes to the su in type iia mixotrophs phototrophy increases with inorganic nutrients flux fig 3 a phototrophy has also a positive relationship with prey availability fig 3 b as inorganic nutrients are substituted by nutrients contained in prey the increase in phototrophy is enhanced under inorganic nutrient limitation phagotrophy decreases when inorganic nutrients flux increases fig 3 c while it has a positive relationship with photons arrival flux fig 3 d the latter means that when photosynthetic carbon production increases and inorganic nutrients availability is low feeding is enhanced to supplement nutrients in type iib mixotrophy phototrophy increases with both inorganic nutrients and prey arrival flux fig 4 a and b on the other hand phagotrophy does not depend on inorganic nutrients availability fig 4 c but it increases with photons arrival flux fig 4 d in mixotrophs of type iic phototrophy increases with inorganic nutrients flux fig 5 a but it does not depend on prey availability fig 5 b phagotrophy decreases with photons arrival flux fig 5 d as the organism prefers phototrophy over phagotrophy when light for photosynthesis is available however phagotrophy does not depend on the inorganic nutrients arrival flux fig 5 c in type iiia mixotrophs phototrophy increases with inorganic nutrients arrival flux fig 6 a whereas it decreases with prey availability fig 6 b as the organism prefers phagotrophy over phototrophy when prey is available finally phagotrophy rate is irrelevant to inorganic nutrients as well as to photons arrival flux fig 6 c and d 3 2 growth predictions in order to examine the growth kinetics of the four types of mixotrophs we combined the models describing the four mixotrophic strategies with a deb model for algal growth livanou et al 2019a see appendix b the simulations were performed for varying concentrations of prey and varying irradiance under low and high inorganic nutrients concentration fig 7 for all simulations we assume that inorganic carbon is not limiting growth in type iia mnf when inorganic nutrients concentration is high prey availability does not affect the growth rate which only depends on irradiance fig 7 a under low inorganic nutrients availability the organisms use bacterial prey to obtain nutrients which are combined with organic carbon produced from photosynthesis to form e reserves as a result there is a positive relationship between the growth rate and both prey concentration and irradiance fig 7 b finally irrespective of inorganic nutrients availability growth in these mixotrophs is inhibited in the dark even when prey concentration is high fig 7 a and b in type iib mnf the substrates from phototrophy and phagotrophy are complementary therefore the growth rate depends on the availability of both prey and light and when either one of these resources is not available the organism does not grow fig 7 c and d under low inorganic nutrients concentration growth rate decreases however the organism can maintain positive growth by using the nutrients contained in the ingested prey fig 7 d type iic mnf can use phototrophy and phagotrophy in a substitutable way under high inorganic nutrients concentration growth rate increases with irradiance whereas for low irradiance the organisms can use prey as a source of energy and nutrients to grow fig 7 e under low inorganic nutrients concentration and for low irradiance values type iic mixotrophs use phagotrophy as the feeding strategy and therefore the growth rate increases with increasing prey concentration fig 7 f however as irradiance increases a decrease in growth rate is observed this results from the assumptions about the regulation of mixotrophy in type iic mixotrophs i e the trigger for phagotrophy is energy deprivation therefore since light for photosynthesis is available the organisms have to use phototrophy as their main feeding strategy which due to the low availability of inorganic nutrients results in lower growth rate than the one achieved when using phagotrophy as their main feeding strategy fig 7 f type iiia mnf are primarily phagotrophic therefore when prey is available irrespective of inorganic nutrients availability phagotrophy is the main feeding mode and growth rate increases mostly with prey concentration fig 7 g and h on the other hand for low concentrations of prey when inorganic nutrients concentration is high type iiia mixotrophs use phototrophy as their main feeding strategy and their growth rate increases with irradiance fig 7 g however under low inorganic nutrients availability this type of mixotrophs cannot use efficiently phototrophy and therefore an increase in irradiance does not have any significant effect on their growth rate fig 7 h fig 8 presents the relationship between structural mass specific rates of organic carbon production via photosynthesis jc and organic carbon consumption via phagotrophy j f for the four different types of mnf the simulations for each type were performed for various levels of the regulating environmental factor type iia varying nutrients type iib varying prey type iic varying irradiance type iiia varying prey and by keeping all other resources constant points above the line y x indicate that c consumption is higher than c production according to the model in type iia mixotrophs as inorganic nutrient concentration decreases the rate of phagotrophy increases relative to the rate of photosynthesis however even at very low inorganic nutrients concentrations these organisms continue to photosynthesize at relatively high rates as there is an obligatory need for photosynthetically derived carbon in type iib organisms phagotrophy and photosynthesis covary in response to increasing prey concentration and irradiance results not shown as both physiological processes are necessary for the growth of these organisms type iic mixotrophs under high irradiance may consume prey at low rates but the rate of carbon production is much higher than the rate of prey consumption however when light is limiting the rate of organic carbon consumption through phagotrophy can be significantly higher than the rate of organic carbon production from photosynthesis finally in type iiia mixotrophs only at low concentrations of prey organic carbon production through photosynthesis may exceed organic carbon consumption 4 discussion in this work we present a modelling framework able to capture the diverse nutritional strategies of mixotrophic nanoflagellates the models developed here are based on the deb theory and the concept of the synthesizing unit that has been previously used to describe the mixotrophic nutrition kooijman et al 2002 troost et al 2005b here we take a step forward by accounting for the dynamic interaction of the two energy and nutrient assimilation pathways i e phototrophy and phagotrophy within the different types of mnf this new approach allowed us to describe explicitly the functional diversity within the group of mnf and to explore the contributions of phagotrophy and phototrophy to the metabolism and growth of mixotrophs under varying availability of resources overall the functional responses of the different types of mnf are in agreement with the conceptual models for mnf developed by stoecker 1998 the advantages of using su mediated transformations to describe mixotrophic growth are two fold firstly they offer a common modelling framework with enough flexibility to describe mechanistically the various nutritional strategies of mnf in this study we chose to incorporate the mathematical formulations describing mixotrophy into a deb model for algal growth in order to study the dynamic response of the four types of mnf under varying availability of light inorganic nutrients and prey however the mathematical formulations described here can be embedded within any model of algal growth as long as it accounts for the inorganic nutrient uptake and photosynthetic carbon production pathways secondly the rate of phototrophy and phagotrophy can be described with a single function with no need to formulate extra assumptions such as threshold values in order to describe the regulation of photorophy and phagotrophy thresholds are generally difficult to evaluate and metabolically not very realistic for example experiments with prymnesium parvum a type iia mixotroph show that when both prey and nutrients are available the organism continues to feed in order to obtain nutrients from prey but the frequency of feeding cells in the population decreases which suggests a preference for phototrophy carvalho and granéli 2010 moreover in chrysochromulina ericina a prymnesiophyte with typical type iic behaviour phagotrophy continued when prey concentration was high even though light was readily available hansen and hjorth 2002 these findings indicate that there is a continuum rather than abrupt switches between phagotrophy and phototrophy in mixotrophic organisms in our models by using the su concept to merge the substrates from phagotrophy and phototrophy we avoid the need to define switches in the model structure this means that there are no either or situations where the organisms can use only one mode of nutrition in a given moment but both pathways can operate simultaneously however the relative importance of each of the two pathways will depend on the type of mixotrophy the organism specific parameters and the availability of the regulating resources thus su mediated transformations provide a parameter sparse approach kooijman 1998 that allows for smooth transitions from one nutritional mode to the other when resources availability in the environment is changing light dependency of both growth and prey ingestion has been observed in several constitutive mixotrophs such as the chlorophytes of the genus nephroselmis the haptophytes isochrysis galbana anderson et al 2018 and prymnesium parvum brutemark and granéli 2011 and the chrysophyte dinobryon cylindricum caron et al 1993 it seems that in these organisms there is an obligatory demand for photosyntehtically derived carbon that cannot be substituted from carbon obtained via phagotrophy in reflection of these observations a common approach when modelling the growth dynamics of these organisms is to impose a minimum level of phototrophy berge et al 2016 flynn and mitra 2009 ghyoot et al 2017 the models for types iia and iib developed in the present study are able to adequately reproduce the observed patterns of covariation of phagotrophy rate and light availability and of the light depended growth even when prey is available at high concentrations at the same time in our modelling formulation for types iia and iib the observation of low growth and low phagotrophy rate when photosynthesis is inhibited emerges from su kinetics and the rules of the sequential complementary transformation without the need to formulate extra assumptions despite the similarity regarding the light dependent growth for types iia and iib there is an important difference between the two mixotrophic strategies our simulations show that in type iia mixotrophs under high inorganic nutrients concentration phagotrophy rate decreases while the growth rate does not depend on prey concentration suggesting that these organisms can fully substitute phagotrophy with phototrophy when inorganic nutrients are not limiting thus model behaviour is consistent with patterns observed in experimental cultures of nephroselemis sp and isochrysis galbana anderson et al 2018 showing that the percentage of feeding cells and the ingestion rates drastically decreased when nutrient limitation was alleviated on the other hand type iib mixotrophs require both light and prey in order to grow in our model formulation they consume prey to obtain a portion of their organic carbon probably an organic compound necessary for growth that they cannot synthesize while they can also assimilate the nutrients that are contained in prey this allows them to grow when both prey and light are available even when inorganic nutrients are limiting the covariation of c consumption and c production in response to both irradianace and prey availability in type iib mixotrophs shown by our model is a consequence of the complementary role of the two pathways for the growth of this type of mnf carbon fixation and ingestion rates have been shown to covary in response to light availability for ochromonas ccmp1393 wilken et al 2019a and this is also reflected in the transcriptomic response of the strain in varying availability of light and bacterial prey lie et al 2018 it is important to note that such a response could not have been modelled if a trait based approach using differential investment in the two nutritional pathways i e phototrophy and phagotrophy would be used berge et al 2016 wilken et al 2019a overall these findings indicate that type iib mixotrophs are obligate mixotrophs as opposed to type iia mixotrophs which are obligate phototrophs but facultative mixotrophs type iic mixotrophs use phagotrophy as an alternative strategy to obtain energy when growing under sub optimum irradiance the inverse relationship between c production via photosynthesis and c consumption via phagotrophy in response to irradiance shown by our simulations corroborate well with observations in ochromonas ccmp2951 isolate wilken et al 2019a these patterns derive from the substitutable nature of the substrates from phototrophy and phagotrophy and highlight the facultative mixotrophic potential of type iic mnf it is worth mentioning that despite the inverse relationship between light availability and phagotrophy in our model phagotrophy rate will never become zero when prey is available eq a 14 in that way model behaviour is in agreement with experiments showing that phagotrophy rate decreases with increasing irradiance in chrysochromulina ericina and ochromonas ccmp2951 yet remaining above zero as long as prey is available hansen and hjorth 2002 wilken et al 2019a in our model the ratio between phototrophy and phagotrophy when both light and prey are available will depend on parameter values that are specific to the organism of interest moreover according to our model output these organisms benefit from phagotrophy only at low irradiances that do not allow maximum photosynthetic rates to be reached as irradiance increases the positive effect of phagotrophy on the growth rate is less significant as the organism relies more on phototrophy for energy derivation and growth these results are consistent with experimental studies with chrysochromulina ericina hansen and hjorth 2002 and chrysochromulina brevifilum jones 1997 showing that the growth rate increased in response to prey addition for algae grown at low irradiances whereas at high irradiances prey availability did not affect the growth rate in chrysochromulina ericina hansen and hjorth 2002 nevertheless exceptions from this behaviour have been reported as for example with ochromonas ccmp2951 that always exhibited higher growth rates when prey was available irrespective of light availability wilken et al 2019a although in type iic mixotrophs energy deprivation is the stimulus that enhances phagotrophy the organism may also benefit from the nutrients contained in their prey in our approach we assumed that when type iic mixotrophs ingest prey they can directly form reserves as they can use both carbon and nutrients contained in prey thus our simulations show that under nutrient limiting conditions growth rate increases as a function of prey concentration however this increase is more pronounced at low irradiances when the flux of organic carbon to the su c is diminished allowing the substrates from phagotrophy to bind to the free su observations of increasing abundance of chrysochromulina brevifilum with increasing availability of prey under nutrient and light limiting conditions are in agreement with our model output jones 1997 conversely the model shows that under nutrient limiting conditions when irradiance levels are high type iic mixotrophs are obliged to use phototrophy which results in lower growth rate than the one achieved when using phagotrophy as their main feeding strategy this prediction may appear strange since one can hypothesize that an organism that has the ability to feed would do so when it is nutrient limited in support of our model predictions come the experimental observations on the species mantoniella antarctica and geminigera cryophila showing that ingestion rates were increased in response to light limitation but not in response to nutrient limitation mckie krisberg et al 2015 on the other hand the flagellate pyramimonas tychotreta consumed bacteria only when inorganic nutrient concentration was low irrespective of light availability yet under nutrient limitation ingestion rates were also inversely related to light availability mckie krisberg et al 2015 these findings suggest that a combination of inorganic nutrients concentration primarily and light availability secondarily stimulates phagotrophy in this species since the development of formulations for the four types of mnf as were defined by stoecker 1998 was the aim of the present study the current version of the model cannot resolve situations where combinations of resources are involved in the regulation of assimilation pathways in mnf nevertheless on the strength of the su approach such a response could easily be resolved by assuming a similar transformation as in type iic but with three interacting substrates and with the point of merging of phototrophy and phagotrophy positioned after the assimilation of both organic carbon from photosynthesis and nutrients into e reserves precursor molecules for type iiia mnf our results show that phototrophy is beneficial to these organisms only for low concentrations of available prey while there is an inverse relationship between c production and c consumption in response to prey availability ochromonas sp strain bg 1 is an example of type iiia mixotrophs in this organism phagotrophy is the dominant mode of nutrition while chla synthesis and therefore photosynthesis as well as ammonium uptake is upregulated once prey is depleted lie et al 2017 our model adequately reproduces the experimental observations highlighting the substitutable role of phototrophy and phagotrophy and thus the facultative mixotrophic potential in type iiia mixotrophs for these mnf phototrophy is a survival strategy to cope with prey concentrations lower than those that allow efficient heterotrophic growth lie et al 2017 rothhaupt 0000 the capability for phototrophy may allow these mixotrophs to coexist with pure heterotrophs for example ochromonas sp coexisted with the pure heterotroph bodo sp when light was available however it was excluded by bodo sp when photosynthesis was disabled rothhaupt 1996 mixotrophic organisms have to invest in the synthesis and maintenance of both a phototrophic and a phagotorophic apparatus which can lead to an increased metabolic cost raven 1997 the costs of maintaining a photosynthetic apparatus has been estimated to be up to 50 of the total energy carbon and nutrients of the cell whereas the costs of synthesis and maintenance of the phagotrophic machinery has been estimated to be 10 of the cells total energy carbon and nutrients raven 1997 these combined energetic costs may result in lower growth rates compared to pure photo or phagotrophs raven 1997 rothhaupt 1996 tittel et al 2003 ward et al 2011 moreover mixotrophic organisms have to partition their finite cell surface between uptake sites for dissolved inorganic and particulate organic resources ward et al 2011 which should result in a reduced ability to take up resources in comparison to specialists pure photo and phago trophs this suggests that when resources are not limiting specialists should be able to outcompete generalists i e mixotrophs mathematical models that account for these trade offs are useful tools to perform such a costs benefit analysis to understand the ecological aspects of mixotrophy e g crane and grover 2010 thingstad et al 1996 troost et al 2005a 2005b våge et al 2013 ward et al 2011 although the aim of this study was not to conduct such a cost benefit analysis on the trade offs of mixotrophy the modelling framework presented here allows to account for the costs of mixotrophy these costs can be incorporated in the stoichiometric coefficients y 1 2 in line with previous models of mixotrophy in the context of deb theory troost et al 2005a 2005b these coefficients quantify the amount of substrate either photosynthetically produced carbon or prey required to form one mol of e reserve the value of y 1 2 depends on the operating assimilation pathway and it may be higher for the phototrophic than for the phagotrophic pathway on the basis of raven 1997 moreover the trade offs of mixotrophy can be incorporated in the values of maximum assimilation rates and half saturation constants ward et al 2011 or in mixotrophs stoichiometric requirements which should be higher than specialists crane and grover 2010 ward et al 2011 finally the maintenance rate of constitutive mixotrophs may also be higher than pure phototrophs or pure phagotrophs as constitutive mixotrophs have to maintain both assimilation machineries it should be noted however that these theoretical assumptions remain hypothetical and cannot be adequately constraint by the available experimental data våge et al 2013 ward et al 2011 moreover the ability of the different types of mixotrophic nanoflagellates to control to a certain extent the relative investment on each of the two pathways on the basis of the prevailing environmental conditions may be also a cost effective way to reduce the costs of maintaining the apparatus for both trophic pathways simultaneously stoecker 1998 using our models to compare the rates of organic carbon production and prey consumption we show that the different nutritional strategies result in different functional roles of mnf within the planktonic food webs moreover these functional roles are not fixed but they can change in response to varying resources availability for example our model shows that type iia mixotrophs increase their prey consumption as inorganic nutrient availability decreases however type iia mnf continue to produce organic carbon as photosynthesis is the only way for these organisms to cover their energy and carbon requirements this strategy has important implications in terms of primary production especially for oligotrophic systems as this type of mixotrophs can maintain high rates of carbon fixation and new biomass production even when inorganic nutrients are limiting indeed field studies conducted in the oligotrophic p depleted mediterranean sea have revealed a negative correlation between ingestion rates of mnf and phosphorus livanou et al 2019a unrein et al 2007 suggesting that type iia mixotrophs may dominate the mnf community in this and possibly other oligotrophic environments interestingly the competitive advantage of type iia mnf over the strict phototrophs and heterotrophs under oligotropihc conditions is regulated by light availability ptacnik et al 2016 moreover our simulations show that in type iib mixotrophs prey consumption increases proportionally to carbon fixation in response to both prey availability and photons arrival flux but in all cases these mixotrophs are functioning as net primary producers as the rate of organic carbon production is always higher than the rate of prey consumption in agreement with our findings in ochromonas strain ccmp1393 a type iib mnf it has been shown that phagotrophy enhances photosynthesis and therefore organic carbon production suggesting a role of net producer for this strain lie et al 2018 wilken et al 2019a of course the net effect of type iib mnf will depend on the relative magnitude of the rate of phagotrophy as compared to the rate of carbon fixation that may vary in different species on the other hand our model shows that the ecological role of type iic mixotrophs depends on light availability and suggests a role of net consumers under light limiting conditions indeed increased grazing activity in the dark comparable to purely phagotrophic nanoflagellates has been observed in the antarctic mnf geminigera cryophila and mantoniella antarctica mckie krisberg et al 2015 thus type iic mixotrophy may have important implications for the carbon fluxes in polar seas where photosynthetic organisms have to deal with the long periods of darkness during the austral winter finally type iiia mixotrophs have the role of net producers only for low concentrations of prey however as prey availability increases type iiia mnf switch from being net producers to being net consumers such pattern of increased phagotrophy rate and decreased photosynthesis when prey is readily available has been observed in ochromonas strain bg 1 suggesting a role of net consumer for this mnf of type iiia lie et al 2017 in conclusion this modelling study is among the few that take into account the variety of nutritional strategies within mnf the mathematical framework developed here allows to model the functional roles of mnf within the microbial community and to study how these roles are affected by resources availability our study shows that the range of energy and nutrient acquisition strategies in combination with the variety of metabolic responses of the different types of mnf to environmental drivers determine the net ecosystem impact of mnf in terms of carbon fluxes from our simulations it is obvious that the response of food web dynamics and flow of elements to changing environmental conditions will depend among others on the mixotrophic assemblage that is present however the spatiotemporal distributions of mixotrophic strategies remain largely unresolved to date leles et al 2019 wilken et al 2019b thus our work highlights the importance of differentiating among the four nutritional strategies observed in mnf in both field and modelling studies in order to adequately describe the carbon and nutrient fluxes in aquatic systems and predict their response to future climate change scenarios at the same time our study offers a suitable mathematical framework that can be used in order to integrate the functional diversity of mnf in aquatic ecosystems models credit authorship contribution statement eleni

appendix a this appendix provides the derivation of the mathematical models for the four different types of mixotrophic nutrition of mnf the uptake rates of inorganic carbon inorganic nutrients n and prey f follow classic michaelis menten kinetics given by a 1 j i j i a m x i x i k i i i c n f where j i a m is the maximum uptake rate of substrate i xi denotes the concentration of substrate i and ki is the half saturation constant mnf have a photosynthetic system with which they stepwise convert light l and inorganic carbon ic into organic carbon c photons arrive at photosynthetic units psus at a rate proportional to incident light intensity and bind to psus with a probability ρl the specific photons arrival rate is a 2 j l α l l with αl the specific photons arrival cross section all fluxes of substrates are expressed as specific fluxes i e per unit of structural mass and denoted as j next we focus on the formalism for the mechanisms of sus processing resources acquired via phototrophy and phagotrophy to simplify the notation the rate at which substrate molecules say of type a arrive and bind at the su is scaled to the number of molecules yap required to produce one molecule of product p i e j a ρ a j a y a p where ρa is the probability that molecules of substrate a bind to the su type iia type iia mnf are primary phototrophic but consume prey to obtain limiting inorganic nutrients in these mnf first light and inorganic carbon are processed by the su c fig 1 to produce organic carbon in a complementary and parallel transformation meaning that both substrates are required to form the product and that the binding of one substrate to the su is independent from the binding of the other see for example lika and papadakis 2009 livanou et al 2019a thus the specific organic carbon production rate is given by a 3 j c k c 1 j i c 1 j l 1 j i c j l 1 1 in type iia transformation fig 2 a the possible states of the sus are five θ θ c θ n θcn and θcf a free su θ may bind the organic carbon from photosynthesis c or inorganic nutrient n giving the states θ c or θ n respectively the dot means absence of substrate these sus may bind the absent substrate giving the state θcn to form reserves and then return to the state θ an su at the state θ c may also bind nutrients obtained from phagotrophy giving the state θcf which either return to the state θ by forming the product e or may reject the substrate from phagotrophy if an inorganic nutrient molecule arrives resulting to the state θcn the dynamics of the su fractions are given by the following system of differential equations a 4 d dt θ j n j c θ k cn θ cn k cf θ cf d dt θ n j n θ j c θ n d dt θ c j c θ j n j f θ c d dt θ cn j c θ n j n θ c θ cf k cn θ cn d dt θ cf j f θ c j n k cf θ cf θ θ

nutrients and prey j ρ j y jn and jf are given by eq a 1 if we assume quasi steady state we can solve the system a 4 to obtain the quasi steady state solution of the fraction of sus at different states a 5 θ j n j c 1 j n k cn 1 j c j n j f 1 j f j n k cf 1 θ n j n j c θ θ c j c j n j f θ θ cn j n k cn 1 j c j n j f 1 j f j n k cf θ θ cf j f j n k cf j c j n j f θ the rate of reserve

light and inorganic carbon arriving at the state θ c s subsequently it binds the complementary growth factor from phagotrophy arriving at state θ c s f an su at the state θ c s f returns to the state

model for photosynthetic cells livanou et al 2019a the assimilation a of generalized reserves for the four types of mnf described in section 2 2 is based on su kinetics which imply rejection fluxes due to stoichiometric constraints the assimilation fluxes j e c a and j e n a quantified by eq b1 2 for types iia iib and iic are directed to the ec and en reserves respectively whereas type iiia mixotrophs being primarily heterotrophic do not have the ec and en reserves and any excess fluxes are excreted to the environment during catabolism c reserves are mobilized to allow the growth g and maintenance m of the organisms reserve densities m e m e m v m e i m e i m v with i c n where m denotes the masses of structure v and reserves e e c e n follow first order kinetics and the resulting catabolic fluxes j e c and j e i c given by eq b1 3 are used by the organism for maintenance and growth the reserve turnover rate k is constant and is taken to be the same for all reserves kooijman 2010 lorena et al 2010 the specific catabolic fluxes j e i c from ei reserves i c n are combined by a synthesizing unit to form a compound e identical to the generalized reserve e according to eq b1 4 while the catabolic fluxes from ec and en reserves that cannot be used for e production are rejected at a rate given by eq b1 5 a fraction of this flux κ e i with i c n is fed back to the respective reserves ec en and the rest 1 κ e i is excreted outside the cell the two catabolic fluxes j e c and j e c are combined together by the growth su which is assumed to be fast enough to avoid spoiling of reserves to form the flux j v g eq b1 6 which will be used for growth after covering the maintenance costs of the cell j e m in case that the catabolic fluxes are not enough to pay the maintenance costs the flux j v g is zero and the remainder is covered from structure at a rate j v m eq b1 7 the net specific growth rate r eq b1 8 is calculated numerically and it can take negative values when j v m 0 parameter values parameters that are specific to mixotrophic nanoflagellates have been poorly characterised to date which means that in most cases our parameter choices are necessarily arbitrary nevertheless this approach is reasonable since our aim in this work was to evaluate the qualitative behaviour of the models developed here for the four type of mixotrophic nanoflagellates and compare them with experimentally derived patterns and observations as such following the approach of crane and grover 2010 most of the phototrophy related parameters were assumed to be similar to those of pure phototrophs and the phagotrophy related parameters were assumed to be similar to pure phagotrophs the latter assumption finds support in some experimental evidence suggesting that the grazing rates of pure phagotrophs and phototrophs can be similar e g livanou et al 2019b porter 1988 tsai et al 2011 the binding probability of photons ρl eq a 2 is a compound parameter calculated as ρ l ρ l m a x ρ l m a x ρ l m i n e b q n 2 where q n n n e m e m e n n n v m v is the nitrogen content in the reserves relative to structure parameters ρlmin and ρlmax correspond to the minimum and maximum binding probabilities to the su respectively therefore they are constrained in the interval 0 1 ρlmin and b was taken from livanou et al 2019a whereas for ρlmax we assumed a maximum value of 1 αl was taken from lika and papadakis 2009 kic was taken from clark and flynn 2000 kn was taken from eppley et al 1969 while j n a m had to be assumed note however that key parameters of nutrient uptake such as the maximum uptake rate and the half saturation constant often depend on growth conditions and thus can vary greatly litchman et al 2007 the handling rate k c corresponds to the maximum rate of carbohydrates formation i e maximum rate of photosynthesis and it was taken from crane and grover 2010 in the absence of available data all handling rates for the rest of the substrates were assumed to be equal to k c j i c a m was taken from livanou et al 2019a the specific respiration rate maintenance rate j e m in our model was taken from geider and osborne 1989 in order to obtain a value for the half saturation constant for prey uptake kf we transformed the values reported in mohapatra and fukami 2004 for two marine heterotrophic nanoflagellates preying on bacteria from number of bacteria ml 1 to µm using a conversion factor of 20 fg c bacterial cell 1 lee and fuhrman 1987 this gave a range for kf from 2 3 15 8µm and our choice was based on this range whereas the maximum prey ingestion rate jf had to be assumed the reserve turnover rate k was adjusted from lorena et al 2010 the stoichiometric coefficient ylc was taken from livanou et al 2019a the elemental composition for nanoflagellates structure generalized reserve and prey n 1 2 was derived assuming redfield molar ratio c n 106 16 the stoichiometric coefficient yne was assumed to be the same as nne the stoichiometric coefficient yev which quantifies the cost of transformation was taken from livanou et al 2019a and we assumed the same value for yce which quantifies the cost of reserve formation the stoichiometric coefficient yicc that couples inorganic carbon to organic carbon formation results from the stoichiometry of dark reactions the stoichiometric coefficient y c s c was based on caron et al 1993 who found that in dinobryon cylindricum most of the organic carbon of the mixotroph 75 was produced via photosynthesis the phagotrophy yield coefficient had to be assumed while the stoichiometric coefficient yfc that stoichiometrically couples phagotrophy rate with the organic carbon formation rate for type iib is calculated from y and y c s c for types iia iic iia phagotrophy rate is coupled to the generalized reserves formation rate with the stoichiometric coefficient yfc which is calculated from the phagotrophy yield y
