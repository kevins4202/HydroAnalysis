6665,with the development and utilization of mountain rivers modelers of rivers using one dimensional 1d hydraulic models face the challenge of selecting appropriate cross section data for mountain rivers since previous studies have focused on alluvial rivers mountain rivers usually have larger bed slopes and smaller widths in comparison with alluvial rivers which results in differences in their hydrologic processes our case study analyzes these differences using 1d models through the utilization of prismatic reaches with different gradient and width sizes and the provision of various boundary conditions the influence of the size of these morphometric variables on the selection of optimal topographic data is related to the hydraulic problem at hand in addition mountain rivers tend to have more irregular cross sections and gradients than alluvial rivers because of their relatively erosion resistant riverbeds the effects of gradient deviation width deviation and channel storage volume deviation on hydrologic process due to insufficient topographic data are compared it is found that the influence of channel storage volume deviation which is negligible in alluvial rivers could be significant in mountain rivers and the impact of width deviation is minimal in mountain rivers and alluvial rivers thus in reservoir areas measured width could be adjusted based on published stage storage data to reduce channel storage volume deviation and improve flow simulation accuracy this method is verified on a 605 71 km long reach in the three gorges reservoir area keywords mountain rivers channel storage volume deviation reservoir area hydraulic models 1 introduction unsteady flows in open channels can be mathematically modelled by saint venant equations barré de saint venant 1871 which include a continuity equation and a momentum equation bathurst 1988 becker and serban 1990 liggett 1975 the construction and application of 1d flow routing models based on these equations are now relatively commonplace cunge et al 1980 ervine and maccleod 1999 french 1985 zhang and bao 2012 in an effort to accurately display flow propagation through 1d models the appropriate description of river morphology is required allouis et al 2010 heritage et al 2009 keim et al 1999 lane 1998 schwendel et al 2010 the quality of topographic data obtained from field surveys is not only affected by the accuracy of individual survey points but also related to field sampling strategies including the density and distribution of data points heritage et al 2009 lane et al 1994 lane 1998 walker and willgoose 1999 wise 2000 studies have indicated that river morphology should be considered when arranging survey points samuels 1990 suggested that larger distances between cross sections should be used for larger rivers comparison between actual topographies and digital elevation models dems obtained from measured topographic data shows a strong relationship between local surface topographic variation and dem error which means that complex morphology requires denser data points in addition model accuracy is only influenced locally by the localized misrepresentation of river morphology topographic data acquired from remote survey techniques could provide sufficient data for watershed delineation and appropriate simplified cross sections are needed to depict underwater terrain hicks et al 2001 westaway et al 2000 high quality calculation results can be obtained by using suitable simplified cross sections the simulation results obtained by using different exponential functions to describe the channel and floodplain portions of the cross sections were similar to those obtained by using detailed cross section data in the illinois river basin in oklahoma us mejia and reed 2011 and the cross section shape of the main channel was proved to have a smaller impact on the simulation of water level than the longitudinal description of bed level profile in the serein river in france saleh et al 2013 furthermore the optimal selection of channel geometry data is also related to the hydraulic problem at hand castellarin et al 2009 to obtain a reasonable representation of the flood wave 30 50 cross sections were required in one wavelength under typical values of wave propagation speed period and length for rivers of united kingdom samuels 1990 additionally optimal topographic data for flood simulations were indicated to be coarse for low flows to reflect the backwater curve the number of sections in the backwater length was recommended to be at least five based on experience samuels 1989 other studies pointed out that cross section lines were required to be approximately perpendicular to the direction of flow thus a model designed for flood flow computation might not reproduce the low flow dynamics and vice versa cunge et al 1980 samuels 1990 researchers also pointed out that the effect of rounding error should be taken into account when identifying the minimum distance between cross sections samuels 1990 previous studies have mainly focused on alluvial rivers which have small gradients and large widths but few have focused on mountain rivers which are generally narrower and steeper than alluvial rivers given this background floods in prismatic channels with different bed slope and reach width sizes are simulated in our study using a 1d hydraulic model hec ras and the appropriate cross section spacing required to describe underwater topography of mountain rivers which is influence by the size of morphometric variables is analyzed except for the size of these morphometric variables variations in cross section and bed slope as a result of both natural processes i e river discharge and sediment load variations and human influences leopold et al 2012 are also concerned mountain rivers have more complicated river morphologies than alluvial rivers since their riverbeds are relatively difficult to scour therefore non negligible channel storage volume deviation could be induced in mountain rivers when their river topographies are expressed using a limited number of cross sections in this paper the influence of channel storage volume deviation on model accuracy is investigated and compared with the influences of gradient and width deviation and it is proved to have a greater impact than them in some mountain reaches in the three gorges reservoir area a width adjusted method based on the stage storage curve which is published is proposed to reduce the channel storage deviation considering the consumption of added field surveys and the negligible impact of width deviation on hydrologic process 2 methodology and data floods in artificial reaches are simulated through 1d hydraulic models characterized by a various number of cross sections cross section scenarios are designed according to the intervals recommended by the code for waterway survey published by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china in 2000 fig 2 3 2 in this document the channel cross sections and inflow hydrograph specifications represent medium sized chinese rivers 2 1 numerical flow routing model the 1d flow routing model hec ras brunner 2008a b solves the fully dynamic formulation of the saint venant equations using implicit finite difference approximations and preissman s second order scheme barkau 1985 hec ras has been used successfully in many case studies benito et al 2003 knebl et al 2005 maingi and marsh 2002 saleh et al 2011 saleh et al 2013 2 2 boundary condition definition a normal distribution function is used to define the shape of inflow hydrograph and is scaled to the desired base flow peak discharge and wave period listed in table 1 several rating curves given by q 1 n a r 2 3 j 1 2 are adopted at the downstream end in three cases that consist of reaches of the same width where n 0 025 and j ranges from 0 00005 to 0 15 a stage hydrograph is used as the downstream boundary condition in a case that consists of reaches characterized by different widths 3 impact of morphometric variables on water stage the effect of morphometric variables on water stage is evaluated in this section by simulating floods in 100 km long artificial channels which have different bed slope s0 and width w sizes or longitudinal gradient and width variations three cross section scenarios are developed and each scenario includes 1000 50 or 20 cross sections i e cross section spacing d 100 m 2 km 5 km respectively the scenario with the maximum number of surveyed cross sections is defined as the reference simulation and the stage hydrographs obtained from these scenarios are compared at each 10 km river station named rs 11 rs 1 from upstream to downstream the details are shown in table 2 3 1 case 1 reaches with various gradient scales in this case the inflow hydrograph in fig 1 flood a is routed in 100 m wide channels which slope uniformly at different gradients under different downstream rating curves the details of the numerical tests are shown in table 3 and each numerical test is simplified as rx1jx2dx3 r reach j surface slope at downstream end d cross section spacing for the sake of convenience for example when the cross sectional topographic data with 2 km interval of reach 1a are input into hec ras the test is abbreviated as r1aj1d2 while flood a is simulated under the condition of j 0 00005 at rs 1 the calculated results of flood a routed in reaches 1a 1b 1c obtained from the models which using 50 or 20 cross sections are accurate when j equals s0 when flood a is propagated under the condition of j 0 00005 i e j is smaller than s0 the water surface slope sws is affected by j more than s0 in reach 1a and it has little longitudinal changes therefore the simulated error of reach 1a with fewer cross sections is small when describing the flood wave and backwater curve however the upstream and downstream water surface slopes of reaches 1b and 1c are more influenced by s0 and j respectively thus apparent variations in water surface slope occur in these reaches when j and s0 are different fig 2 b and d the stage error during the flood process at rs 3 or rs 2 which has the largest simulated error among 11 river stations is related to the water surface slope variation between rs 4 and rs 2 or rs 3 and rs 1 as shown in fig 2 a and c the water stage errors in reach 1c come to 0 4 m and 0 08 m when the cross section spacing equals 5 km and 2 km respectively 3 2 case 2 reaches with various width scales case 2 consists of 5 reaches that have the same gradient as reach 1b and different widths equal to 25 m 50 m 100 m 200 m or 400 m table 4 flood a is utilized as the inflow hydrograph for reach 2c i e reach 1b and it is scaled to ensure the same discharge per unit width in each of the other reaches fig 3 the stage hydrograph at rs 1 which is obtained from the test named r1bj1d2 in case 1 is used as the downstream boundary condition table 4 each numerical test is simplified as rx1dx2 due to the wall effect the water depth increases from reach 2e to reach 2a when each reach has the same downstream stage hydrograph consequently the water surface slope at rs 1 increases as the width decreases based on the fact that the upstream water surface slope is almost the same in each reach affected by the gradient the water surface slope variations between rs 3 and rs 2 and rs 3 and rs 4 where apparent variations of the sws occurs decrease as the river width narrows as show in fig 4 however the decrease in the sws is limited which means that the stage error is only reduced by half when the river width is reduced to 1 16 under the same terrain data density fig 5 3 3 case 3 reaches with variations in bed slopes the inflow hydrograph i e flood a combined with three rating curves at rs 1 is simulated in two reaches in case 3 these reaches are 100 m wide and have the same average gradient which is equal to 0 00055 however their longitudinal profiles are different fig 6 the details of the numerical tests are shown in table 5 and each numerical test is simplified as rx1jx2dx3 the interpolated bed elevations are accessible because the known planar contours of the artificial reaches could be used during the process of interpolation they are compared with the reference elevations in table 6 the gradient deviation of the interpolated topography is expressed using the root mean square error and the average elevation error implies the existence of channel storage volume deviation fig 7 shows the water level error ranges in reaches 3a and 3b simulated by different models in reach 3a the root mean square error rmse of the interpolated topography is 0 26 m and the stage error is less than 0 1 m when d 2 km when d 5 km the rmse reaches 0 36 m and the stage error is less than 0 2 m in addition the stage error induced by bed slope deviation reduces under rising limb conditions and increases under falling limb conditions fig 8 a this is consistent with the study by saleh et al 2013 in reach 3b the rmse of the interpolated topography is also 0 26 m when d 2 km but the channel storage volume deviation is apparent thus the water level error is significant and experiences minimal changes during the flood process in upper reach 3b which reaches up to 0 26 m fig 8b the computed stage error is within 0 05 m when d 5 km since the root mean square error and the channel storage volume deviation are both insignificant the results in reaches 3a and 3b demonstrate the importance of the accurate description of channel storage volume this issue will be further discussed in case 4 3 4 case 4 a reach with variations in width the reach in case 4 has a gradient equal to 0 0005 and a varying width that changes from 100 m to 120 m as shown in fig 9 flood a and the rating curve where j 0 0005 are adopted at both ends of the reach see table 7 each numerical test is simplified as rx1dx3 table 8 compares the interpolated widths obtained from fewer cross sections with the width obtained from the reference scenario the root mean square error and the average width error represent the reach width deviation and the channel storage volume deviation respectively it is shown that the rmse of the river width is 8 04 m and the channel storage volume is similar to that obtained from the reference terrain when d 5 km but the maximum water level error is only 0 15 m fig 10 a this indicates that compared to case 3 the influence of width deviation on model accuracy is much less than the influence of bed slope deviation when d 2 km the rmse of the width is 11 57 m and the channel storage volume deviation is apparent and increases under rising limb conditions thus the water level error reaches 1 1 m fig 10 a and 10 b 4 a width adjusted method based on stage storage curve to reduce channel storage volume deviation through the discussion in cases 3 and 4 in the accurate description of channel storage volume is proved to be an important factor that influences the accuracy of simulated hydrologic process in some mountain reaches and the impact of width deviation on simulated results is negligible the cuntan sandouping reach in the three gorges reservoir area is a typical channel that has complex topographic variations fig 11 in this section a method based on stage storage curve to reduce channel storage volume deviation and improve model accuracy is tested in this reach 4 1 topographic and hydrologic data this reach has a length of 605 71 km between the two hydrometric stations of cuntan and sandouping with a 16 5 km sub tributary named wu river that meets the right bank at qingxichang which is 128 79 km downstream from cuntan the control points where the calibration is held are qingxichang and wanxian 187 73 km downstream from qingxichang fig 12 the topographic data measured in 2003 has 297 cross sections in the yangtze river and 55 cross sections in the wu river hydrologic data in 2006 which include discharge and water stage hydrographs are available at these hydrometric stations 4 2 width adjustment based on stage storage curve the accurate stage storage curve which is obtained from table 2 4 in the three gorges during normal operation periods gezhouba hydro project cascade dispatching rules published by the china three gorges corporation in sep 2015 is depicted and compared with the curve obtained from the surveyed cross sections in fig 13 when the water stage in front of the dam is greater than 149 m the percentage error of the channel storage volume increases with the increase of the stage and the percentage error reaches 22 24 as the stage reaches 183 m the adjustment of the cross section width is carried out to obtain a stage storage curve which is consistent with the reference stage storage curve as shown in fig 13 4 3 calibration and verification three steady flows are selected during the hydrologic process and used in the calibration and three other steady flows are used in the verification the relationship between the stage and roughness at each hydrometric station is given in fig 14 it is shown that channel storage volume deviation may induce unreal roughness for instance the roughness values determined using the measured and adjusted topographies differ by 0 18 at cuntan 4 4 computation the selected simulation period which is from sep 16 to oct 12 belongs to the storage period of the reservoir the boundary conditions at cuntan wulong and sandouping are defined by the observed mean daily discharge hydrographs fig 15 the comparison between the simulated and observed stages at cuntan qingxichang wanxian and sandouping shows that the accuracy of the stage is apparently improved by using the adjusted topographic data fig 16 5 discussion and conclusion based on the application of the 1d hydraulic model to the artificial and realistic reaches we can draw the following conclusions regarding the appropriate topographic description of mountain rivers which are characterized by large gradients small widths and irregular topographic variations 1 the influence of bed slope size on the selection of appropriate topographic data is analyzed through the numerical tests in the prismatic reaches with different gradient sizes it is shown that the impact of bed slope size has a relationship with the hydraulic problem at hand in an effort to accurately simulate the flood wave a sufficient number of measured sections in one wavelength range is needed in our case study the models with limited cross sectional topographic data i e cross section spacing 5 km can accurately simulate the flood wave in each reach the maximum cross section spacing restricted by the wavelength is much larger than that limited by other factors mentioned below in both alluvial and mountain rivers 2 to simulate the backwater curve an adequate number of measured cross sections are required among the backwater length based on past experiences of alluvial rivers however in mountain rivers variations in water surface slope are more uneven which means that 80 of the changes occur within 20 km called the major change area of water surface slope therefore the major change length is recommended to replace the backwater length when determining the optimal measured spacing of cross sections for mountain rivers while the backwater length is larger than 20 km 3 the influence of reach width on the choice of appropriate cross section spacing is studied through the artificial channels with different width sizes in the backwater curve simulation it can be seen that as the width decreases the stage increases and the water surface slope variation decreases within the same length when each channel has similar hydraulic boundary conditions however the decrease of the water surface slope variation is limited thus suitable topographic data are insensitive to width size 4 gradient and width deviations are important factors that have been considered when the influence of morphometric variables on model accuracy is studied in alluvial rivers apart from these factors channel storage volume deviation which is small in alluvial rivers should be taken into account during the flow simulation of mountain rivers which have more complicated morphologies our study demonstrates that the accurate description of channel storage volume is more important than longitudinal gradient profile and cross section width in some mountain reaches in practical simulations inaccurate storage volume may also induce unreal roughness during the process of calibration measures to avoid large storage volume deviation are necessary 5 given the fact that width deviation has little impact on model accuracy a method that adjusts the measured width of cross sections based on the published stage storage curve of reservoir areas is proposed to eliminate channel storage volume deviation and improve model accuracy its effectiveness is demonstrated on the cuntan sandouping reach in the three gorges reservoir area this method is convenient as it avoids the consumption of added field surveys 6 suitable topographic data are closely related to terrain complexity the relationships between appropriate cross section shape and cross section complexity and between appropriate longitudinal bed level profile and terrain complexity will be discussed in future studies additionally this paper is a preliminary study that focuses on single channels and more morphometric variables such as the type of drainage network will be discussed in future studies that focus on basins acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key r d program of china 2016yfa0600901

is used as the downstream boundary condition in a case that consists of reaches characterized by different widths 3 impact of morphometric variables on water stage the effect of morphometric variables on water stage is evaluated in this section by simulating floods in 100 km long artificial channels which have different bed slope s0 and width w sizes or longitudinal gradient and width variations

downstream the details are shown in table 2 3 1 case 1 reaches with various gradient scales in this case the inflow hydrograph in fig 1 flood a is routed in 100 m wide channels which slope uniformly at different gradients under different downstream rating curves the details of the numerical tests are shown in table 3 and each numerical test is simplified as rx1jx2dx3 r reach j surface slope at downstream end d cross section spacing for the sake of convenience for example when the cross sectional topographic data with 2 km interval of reach 1a are input into hec ras the test is abbreviated as r1aj1d2 while flood a is simulated under the condition of j 0 00005 at rs 1 the calculated results of flood a routed in reaches 1a 1b 1c obtained from the models which using 50 or 20 cross sections are accurate when j equals s0 when flood a is propagated under the condition of j 0 00005 i e j is smaller than s0 the water surface slope sws is affected by j more than s0 in reach 1a and it has little longitudinal changes therefore the simulated error of reach 1a with fewer cross sections is small when describing the flood wave and backwater curve however the upstream and downstream water surface slopes of reaches 1b and 1c are more influenced by s0 and j respectively thus apparent variations in water surface slope occur in these reaches when j and s0 are different fig 2 b and d the stage error during the flood process at rs 3 or rs 2 which has the largest simulated error among 11 river stations is related to the water surface slope variation between rs 4 and rs 2 or rs 3 and rs 1 as shown in fig 2 a and c the water stage errors in reach 1c come to 0 4 m and 0 08 m when the cross section spacing equals 5 km and 2 km respectively 3 2 case 2 reaches with various width scales case 2 consists of 5 reaches that have the same gradient as reach 1b and different widths equal to 25 m 50 m 100 m 200 m or 400 m table 4 flood a is utilized as the inflow hydrograph for reach 2c i e reach 1b and it is scaled to ensure the same discharge per unit width in each of the other reaches fig 3 the stage hydrograph at rs 1 which is obtained from the test named r1bj1d2 in case 1 is used as the downstream boundary condition table 4 each numerical test is simplified as rx1dx2 due to the wall effect the water depth increases from reach 2e to reach 2a when each reach has the same downstream stage hydrograph consequently the water surface slope at rs 1 increases as the width decreases based on the fact that the upstream water surface slope is almost the same in each reach affected by the gradient the water surface slope variations between rs 3 and rs 2 and rs 3 and rs 4 where apparent variations of the sws occurs decrease as the river width narrows as show in fig 4 however the decrease in the sws is limited which means that the stage error is only reduced by half when the river width is reduced to 1 16 under the same terrain data density fig 5 3 3 case 3 reaches with variations in bed slopes the inflow hydrograph i e flood a combined with three rating curves at rs 1 is simulated in two reaches in case 3 these reaches are 100 m wide and have the same average gradient which is equal to 0 00055 however their longitudinal profiles are different fig 6 the details of the numerical tests are shown in table 5 and each numerical test is simplified as rx1jx2dx3 the interpolated bed elevations are accessible because the known planar contours of the artificial reaches could be used during the process of interpolation they are compared with the reference elevations in table 6 the gradient deviation of the interpolated topography is expressed using the root mean square error and the average elevation error implies the existence of channel storage volume deviation fig 7 shows the water level error ranges in reaches 3a and 3b simulated by different models in reach 3a the root mean square error rmse of the interpolated topography is 0 26 m and the stage error is less than 0 1 m when d 2 km when d 5 km the rmse reaches 0 36 m and the stage error is less than 0 2 m in addition the stage error induced by bed slope deviation reduces under rising limb conditions and increases under falling limb conditions fig 8 a this is consistent with the study by saleh et al 2013 in reach 3b the rmse of the interpolated topography is also 0 26 m when d 2 km but the channel storage volume deviation is apparent thus the water level error is significant and experiences minimal changes during the flood process in upper reach 3b which reaches up to 0 26 m fig 8b the computed stage error is within 0 05 m when d 5 km since the root mean square error and the channel storage volume deviation are both insignificant the results in reaches 3a and 3b demonstrate the importance of the accurate description of channel storage volume this issue will be further discussed in case 4 3 4 case 4 a reach with variations in width the reach in case 4 has a gradient equal to 0 0005 and a varying width that changes from 100 m to 120 m as shown in fig 9 flood a and the rating curve where j 0 0005 are adopted at both ends of the reach see table 7 each numerical test is simplified as rx1dx3 table 8 compares the interpolated widths obtained from fewer cross sections with the width obtained from the reference scenario the root mean square error and the average width error represent the reach width deviation and the channel storage volume deviation respectively it is shown that the rmse of the river width is 8 04 m and the channel storage volume is similar to that obtained from the reference terrain when d 5 km but the maximum water level error is only 0 15 m fig 10 a this indicates that compared to case 3 the influence of width deviation on model accuracy is much less than the influence of bed slope deviation when d 2 km the rmse of the width is 11 57 m and the channel storage volume deviation is apparent and increases under rising limb conditions thus the water level error reaches 1 1 m fig 10 a and 10 b 4 a width adjusted method based on stage storage curve to reduce channel storage volume deviation through the discussion in cases 3 and 4 in the accurate description of channel storage volume is proved to be an important factor that influences the accuracy of simulated hydrologic process in some mountain reaches and the impact

china three gorges corporation in sep 2015 is depicted and compared with the curve obtained from the surveyed cross sections in fig 13 when the water stage in front of the dam is greater than 149 m the percentage error of the channel storage volume increases with the increase of the stage and the percentage error reaches 22 24 as the stage reaches 183 m the adjustment of the cross section width is carried out to obtain a stage storage curve which is consistent with the reference stage storage curve as shown in fig 13 4 3 calibration and verification three steady flows are selected during the hydrologic process and used in the calibration and three other steady flows are used in the verification the relationship between the stage and roughness at each hydrometric station is given in fig 14 it is shown that channel storage volume deviation may induce unreal roughness for instance the roughness values determined using the measured and adjusted topographies differ by 0 18 at cuntan 4 4 computation the selected simulation period which is from sep 16 to oct 12 belongs to the storage period of the reservoir the boundary conditions at cuntan wulong and sandouping are defined by the observed mean daily discharge hydrographs fig 15 the comparison between the simulated and observed stages at cuntan qingxichang wanxian and sandouping shows that the accuracy of the stage is apparently improved by using the adjusted topographic data fig 16 5 discussion and conclusion based on the application of the 1d hydraulic model to the artificial and realistic reaches we can draw the following conclusions regarding the appropriate topographic description of mountain rivers which are characterized by large gradients small widths and irregular topographic variations 1 the influence of bed slope size on the selection of appropriate topographic data is analyzed through the numerical tests in the prismatic reaches with different gradient sizes it is shown that the impact of bed slope size has a relationship with the hydraulic problem at hand in an effort to accurately simulate the flood wave a sufficient number of measured sections in one wavelength range is needed in our case study the models with limited cross sectional topographic data i e cross section spacing 5 km can accurately simulate the flood wave in each reach the maximum cross section spacing restricted by the wavelength is much larger than that limited by other factors mentioned below in both alluvial and mountain rivers 2 to simulate the backwater curve an adequate number of measured cross sections are required among the backwater length based on past experiences of alluvial rivers however in mountain rivers variations in water surface slope are more uneven which means that 80 of the changes occur within 20 km called the major change area of water surface slope therefore the major change length is recommended to replace the backwater length when determining the optimal measured spacing of cross sections for mountain rivers while the backwater length is larger than 20 km 3 the influence of reach width on the choice of appropriate cross section spacing is studied through the artificial channels with different width sizes in the backwater curve simulation it can be seen that as the width decreases the stage increases and the water surface slope variation decreases within the same length when each channel has similar hydraulic boundary conditions however the decrease of the water surface slope variation is limited thus suitable topographic data are insensitive to width size 4 gradient and width deviations are important factors that have been considered when the influence of morphometric variables on model accuracy is studied in alluvial rivers apart from these factors channel storage volume deviation which is small in alluvial rivers should be taken into account during the flow simulation of mountain rivers which have more complicated morphologies our study demonstrates that the accurate description of channel storage volume is more important than longitudinal gradient profile and cross section width in some mountain reaches in practical simulations inaccurate storage volume may also induce unreal roughness during the process of calibration measures to avoid large storage volume deviation are necessary 5 given the fact that width deviation has little impact on model accuracy a method that adjusts the measured width of cross sections based on the published stage storage curve of reservoir areas is proposed to eliminate channel storage volume deviation and improve model accuracy its effectiveness is demonstrated on the cuntan sandouping reach in the three gorges reservoir area this method is convenient as it avoids the consumption of added field surveys 6 suitable topographic data are closely related to terrain complexity the relationships between appropriate cross section shape and cross section complexity and between appropriate longitudinal bed level profile and terrain complexity will be discussed in future studies additionally this paper is a preliminary study that focuses on single channels and more morphometric variables such as the type of drainage network will be discussed in future studies that focus on basins acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key r d program of china 2016yfa0600901 
6666,freeze thaw cycles are important processes relevant to terrestrial hydrological cycling however the representation of freeze thaw cycles has been often simplified in large scale watershed models the soil and water assessment tool swat which has been widely used to understand and assess hydrologic budgets and water resources management employs a simplified empirical approach to estimate soil temperature and determine the freezing and thawing status of soils here we compared the performance of a physically based soil temperature module and the built in empirical approach in swat against field measurements at surface and 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths at six stations of the u s climate reference network uscrn within the upper mississippi river basin umrb in general swat consistently underestimated winter soil temperatures and overestimated frozen days at all soil depths while the modified version of swat equipped with the physically based soil temperature model referred to as tswat pronouncedly reduced the bias in estimated winter soil temperatures and frozen days compared with swat model performance assessment is conducted with three statistical coefficients i e bias c the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns statistical analyses show that tswat accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures at the five depths with r2 and ns values greater than 0 82 at most sites and bias values were generally within the range of 1 to 1 c during winter and ranged between 2 09 and 2 58 c in non winter seasons the differences in freeze thaw cycle representation between swat and tswat translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables such as surface runoff percolation and baseflow compared against long term observed streamflow 1980 2015 tswat outperformed swat in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non winter seasons these results and analyses highlight the value of improving freeze thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in large watersheds that are subject to freeze thaw cycles keywords soil temperature freeze thaw cycles streamflow swat 1 introduction about 35 of the earth s surface is subject to freeze thaw cycles that have great hydrological and biogeochemical importance with respect to water security and climate change impacts li and fang 2016 solomon 2007 williams and smith 1991 the presence of frozen soil layers significantly influences surface and subsurface exchanges of water and energy in the cold regions through hydrological and thermal processes ouyang et al 2016 wang et al 2009 woo et al 2004 freezing of soils reduces the hydraulic conductivity and results in more surface runoff due to decreased infiltration because of restricted drainage shanley and chalmers 1999 slater et al 1998 phase changes of soil water are associated with latent heat absorption and release which have direct influences on the thermal regime of soils riseborough 1990 meanwhile thermal gradients have considerable impacts on soil moisture migration cary 1966 energy exchange is particularly important in cold regions where freeze thaw cycles have a critical influence on water infiltration and solute movement hayashi et al 2003 the coexistence of liquid water and ice in soils dramatically changes the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of the soil zhao et al 1997 ice content in soil layers directly controls infiltration and soil moisture movement cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 liquid water flow was unhindered at relative low ice content while liquid water movement is restricted as the soil ice content increases harlan 1973 in addition the dynamics of soil heat fluxes are also depending on soil ice content which determines the soil thermal properties e g thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity slater et al 1998 the frozen depth in the soil profile is driven by the diurnal cycle of the soil surface temperature cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 in general the freezing front advances as the net heat flux out of the ground is positive and a thawing front may form at the surface and advance into the soil as the net heat flux is negative cheng et al 2014 the presence of snow cover further complicates the problem through its insulation effects which dampens daily heat fluxes and decreases frozen depth and timing groffman et al 2001 zhang 2005 for example an early snow that remains throughout the winter will result in shallower frozen depths than a late snow that falls after many days of cold weather iwata et al 2011 accurate simulation of the timing and depth of freeze thaw boundary in hydrological models will significantly improve their ability to model the hydrologic processes in cold region luo et al 2003 woo et al 2004 the inadequate representation of such freeze thaw processes in most hydrology models is a crucial source of uncertainty in many hydrologic modeling studies wellen et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 as a large scale hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool swat is designed to simulate hydrological processes and predict water quantity and quality as affected by landuse management practices and climate change at a watershed scale arnold et al 1998 the swat model has been used worldwide to solve complex watershed management problems and modified for different study purposes gassman et al 2007 li et al 2014 qi et al 2018a 2017 zhang et al 2017 in swat a watershed is partitioned into a number of subbasins which are further discretized into hydrological response units hrus based on specific combinations of landuse soils and slopes the model calculates the water balance i e surface and subsurface runoff percolation and base flow and evapotranspiration and transmission losses crop growth nutrient cycling and pesticide movement at the hru scale fontaine et al 2002 water flow sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru in a subbasin are summed and the resulting loadings are then routed through channels ponds and reservoirs to the watershed outlet in swat soil temperature tsoil is calculated at the center of a soil layer z on the hru scale by neitsch et al 2011 1 t soil z γ t soil z 1 γ d t aair t sur t sur where γ is the lag coefficient that relates current day s temperature to that of the previous day t soil is the soil temperature at a depth z on the previous day d quantifies the influence of depth on soil temperature t aair is the average annual air temperature and tsur is the temperature at soil surface the depth factor d is a function of depth at the center of the soil layer z maximum damping depth bulk density and soil water the soil surface temperature tsur is determined by the previous day s temperature the amount of ground cover and the bare soil temperature which is a function of daily average minimum and maximum temperature as well as solar radiation reaching the ground and albedo this empirical equation in general can reflect several features of temperature variation in soils the annual soil temperature variation follows a sinusoidal function the amplitude of the sine wave decreases with soil depth until temperature remains constant throughout the year at a certain depth the timing of maximum and minimum temperatures varies with depth this empirical formulation works well in warm temperate regions however in cold regions with snow accumulation predictions of soil temperature seldom agree with field measurements for example bélanger 2009 pointed out although the empirical formulation was able to simulate seasonal trends in soil temperature in the canadian boreal plains the formulation tended to underestimate soil temperature during winter even with an adjusted lag coefficient snow has high surface albedo and emissivity and low thermal conductivity which can protect the ground from excessive heat loss in winter zhang 2005 although such effects have been partially accounted for in the swat model through the incorporation of correction factors neitsch et al 2011 this does not fully address the physical processes driving soil temperature changes and as a result may not attend to the complexities associated with the presence of snow cover in winter bélanger 2009 in addition this empirical formulation does not simulate freeze thaw cycles because phase changes of water are not considered in swat as a result hydrological processes influenced by freeze thaw cycles cannot be accurately modeled at cold regions to overcome this problem a physically based soil temperature module has been developed in swat to consider the insulation effects of snow and latent heat exchange through phase changes of water in soils qi et al 2016a b instead of considering soil temperature as a function of air temperature the new soil temperature module simulates temperature change in snow and soils as a result of heat conduction and latent heat exchange compared with the empirical soil temperature module the new module can estimate snow or soil surface temperature based on an energy balance update thermal properties of snow and soils according to changes in snow density and soil water ice content and simulate phase changes of water in the soil profile the physically based module was tested with field observed temperatures from a small experimental watershed in atlantic canada qi et al 2016b demonstrating an improvement in modeling soil temperatures in the present study we intend to achieve two objectives 1 apply the modified version of swat hereafter tswat to a large scale

where the impact of air temperature diminishes fig 2 when snow accumulated on the ground the snow cover was treated as a single layer fig 2 2 3 1 boundary conditions the upper boundary temperature was determined by the energy balance equation hillel 1980 3 r sn r ln l e h s 0 where rsn is the net solar radiation rln is the net longwave radiation le is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat

default value of effcoe is 8 1 according to yin and arp 1993 for forest lands for agricultural lands effcoe is close to 50 according to previous studies qi et al 2016a b the amount of net solar radiation and net longwave radiation was calculated using the algorithms in swat neitsch et al 2011 the lower boundary of the simulation domain was defined at the damping depth determined by swat soil temperature tz c at this depth was determined following the method in steppuhn 1981 2 3 2 soil and snow thermal properties johansen 1975 developed a method to determine soil thermal conductivity for unfrozen and frozen soils the thermal conductivity of unsaturated soils k was determined by its thermal conductivities in dry kdry and saturated ksat states by introducing a kersten number i e ke the ke was determined by the degree of saturation which was calculated from the amount of water or ice in the soil for saturated soils a geometric mean equation based on the thermal conductivities of the

1991 2 3 3 latent heat exchange the new soil temperature module considered latent heat transfer due to freeze thaw cycles as an internal heat source or sink within individual soil layers fig 2 latent heat was calculated according to the release of energy during the freezing of liquid water and the absorption of energy during the melting of ice fig 2 each layer froze when its temperature reached or fell below 0 c and thawed when its temperature exceeded 0 c fig 2 volumetric soil ice and water content were updated at the daily time step based on the status of the soil with respect to freezing or thawing fig 2 detailed information regarding module development including above mentioned functions and variables could be found in qi et al 2016b 2 4 swat model setup and soil temperature calibration the swat model requires a variety of detailed information describing the land use soil and topography data of the umrb the present study adopted a previously established umrb swat project but running with latest version of swat ver 664 in the previous study the umrb was divided into 131 subbasins according to the eight digit united states geological survey usgs hydrologic unit codes hucs fig 1 national hydrography dataset nhd stream dataset and a 90 m digital elevation model dem was used to provide watershed configuration and topographic parameter estimation a land use map was created by combing two sources of information i e the cropland data layer cdl and 2001 national land cover data to better define cultivated and non agricultural land use the state soil geographic statsgo database 1 250 000 scale soil map was used for umrb using a threshold operation of 5 for land use 10 for soil and 5 for slope 14 568 hrus were generated and the number of hrus per subbasin ranged from 58 to 216 management practices such as tile drainage tillage crop rotation and fertilizer and manure application were included in the project according to various sources detailed model setup information can be found in srinivasan et al 2010 the six soil temperature monitoring stations were identified at the corresponding hrus in the umrb using arcgis fig 1 corresponding soil types and slope classes are shown in table 1 the tswat model was used to simulate soil temperatures at 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths in the six identified hrus with particle swarm optimization pso algorithm of swat cup to calibrate four relevant parameters i e effcoe kcoe ks coe and ccoe specifically the pao algorithm was applied to each site with hundreds of simulations by each iteration iteration and simulation numbers varies at different sites in order to simulate hydrology at the watershed scale we applied the optimized parameters of the six hrus to other hrus in the basin using the nearest neighbor method via arcgis the surface temperature records from the six stations were used to validate the model 2 5 model evaluation model performance was assessed according to three coefficients of

table 2 shows the calibrated parameter values for the physically based soil temperature module at the six uscrn stations the values of parameter effcoe calibrating surface energy ranged from 29 48 to 68 45 with most values ranging from 51 15 to 68 45 and the values of parameter kcoe calibrating soil thermal conductivity ranged from 7 53 to 18 25 these results are generally consistent with the values i e effcoe 50 and kcoe 10 determined in previous studies conducted in cold climates qi et al 2016a b in the present study we also calibrated the parameter ks coe for snow thermal conductivity and ccoe for soil heat capacity which were not calibrated in the previous studies i e default values 1 was used for both parameters the values of parameter ks coe ranged from 3 92 to 17 08 while the values of parameter ccoe ranged from 5 73 to 17 81 the reason for increased thermal conductivity for soil layers in the previous studies and also in the present studies is because swat tended to underestimate soil moisture which has much higher thermal conductivity compared with void soil air space qi et al 2018b the larger than default values of ccoe can partially compensate overestimated thermal conductivity due to unevenly distributed soil moisture in the entire soil profile ks coe was calibrated to better address snow insulation effects on soil temperature 3 2 model performance evaluation for soil temperature model performance of tswat on daily temperatures at surface and five different soil depths in the six uscrn stations was evaluated based on r2 ns and bias table 3 model performance of the original version of swat model with the empirical soil temperature module at five soil depths were also illustrated in table 3 daily surface temperature is not simulated by the original swat model simulated and observed mean daily temperatures for periods of record for each station see table 1 are also included in general tswat accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures with higher accuracy for top soil layers than for deeper soil layers the r2 and ns values are greater than 0 82 except for station wi54903 at 100 cm depth table 3 based on bias values tswat slightly overestimated surface and soil temperatures at different soil depths except for stations wi54903 and il54811 table 3 all r2 values of tswat were greater than the corresponding values of swat at different soil depths for different stations most ns values of tswat were also greater than those of swat except for station il54808 at soil depths of 5 10 20 cm table 3 the absolute bias values of tswat were generally less than the corresponding values of swat for stations in the northern portion of the basin at different soil depths table 3 fig 1 this indicates that the physically based soil temperature module outperformed the empirical soil temperature module especially in areas with seasonal snow cover on the other hand the empirical soil temperature model was able to capture the average conditions of soil temperatures especially at top soil layers in a temperate climate to illustrate the contrasting performance of tswat and swat for top and deep soil layers we show simulated vs observed daily soil temperature time series at 5 and 100 cm depths in figs 3 and 4 respectively tswat performed better than swat at describing the variations of daily soil temperature in winter at the top soil layer and for the whole year at the deepest soil layer in fact swat severely underestimated winter soil temperatures at the top soil layers while tswat was able to simulate winter soil temperatures more accurately which was the precondition of simulating freeze thaw cycles in winter at deeper soil layers although swat could capture the general trend of seasonal variations in soil temperature it had large biases with respect to summer temperature peaks fig 4 the poorer performance for both versions of swat at the 100 cm depth for station wi54903 may be caused by uncertainties associated with soil physical properties at deeper soil layers we also added analyses with respect to winter and non winter seasons to evaluate model performance based on bias at the surface and five different soil depths for the six uscrn stations as shown in table 4 for tswat most bias values c were within the range of 1 to 1 c during winter for different stations this is especially true for the surface and top soil layers i e soil depths 100 cm table 4 even for soil layer at 100 cm depth the bias values were within the range of 1 21 to 2 51 c for non winter seasons however the tswat model tended to have slightly greater absolute values of bias the maximum bias value was 3 16 c at the surface of il54808 while the minimum value was 4 22 c at 100 cm depth of wi54903 except for these two extremes the bias values ranged from 2 09 to 2 58 c for other data points table 4 the model tended to overestimate surface and soil temperatures during non winter seasons while this was not obvious during winter table 4 in most stations absolute values of bias for swat were greater than the corresponding values of tswat and the discrepancies between the absolute values of bias for swat and tswat were greatest at top soil layers and then decreased with soil depth in winter table 4 note that the bias values of soil temperature at 10 cm depth was 16 46 and 0 36 c for swat and tswat respectively in station mn54932 with the highest latitude fig 1 which demonstrated again that the empirical soil temperature module severely underestimated winter soil temperatures in top soil layers on the contrary absolute values of bias for swat were slightly less than the corresponding values of tswat at top soil layers for most stations while tswat tended to have lower absolute values of bias at deeper soil layers in all stations in the non winter seasons table 4 these results explained the reason for lower absolute values of bias of swat than those of tswat in stations in the southern portion of the basin on the annual temporal scale in table 3 as a result the physically based soil temperature model pronouncedly improved winter soil temperature simulation which is the basis for accurate simulate soil freeze thaw cycles 3 3 model performance evaluation for estimated frozen days to clarify small biases that may accumulate over time we calculated the total number of frozen days with temperature 0 c as observed and simulated by swat and tswat for each soil layer over all sites and their periods of record fig 5 note that the original swat model does not simulate soil surface temperature we used percent bias pbias in eq 13 to evaluate model performance for tswat the highest accuracy was found at 5 cm depth with pbias of 1 and the lowest accuracy was at 100 cm depth with pbias of 41 for the surface and other soil depths pbias ranged from 24 to 10 in general simulated frozen days were less than observed for the surface and 100 cm soil depth while more than observed for soil depths from 5 to 50 cm fig 5 for the original swat model the highest accuracy was also found at 5 cm soil depth but with a much lower pbias of 21 and the lowest accuracy was at 50 cm depth with pbias of 96 pbias values ranged from 34 to 62 at other soil depths in general swat pronouncedly overestimated frozen days than tswat mainly because the empirical soil temperature module tended to underestimate soil temperatures in winter the physically based soil temperature approach better matched observations due to its capability of better accounting for snow insulation effects we further analyzed simulated vs observed total frozen days at the surface and different soil depths by tswat as shown in fig 6 similar to the results derived from soil temperature simulation as discussed in section 3 2 it is not surprising to find that tswat performed better for capturing frozen days for top soil layers than for deep layers for example for the four northern stations pbias ranged from 7 to 8 from 17 to 32 from 22 to 45 from 16 to 37 and from 49 to 360 at the surface and 5 10 20 and 50 cm depths respectively note that for the two southern stations tswat generally performed poorer than the four northern stations particularly for the station mo23909 the reason for the relatively poor performance at the southern stations may be due to the rapid snow cover appearance and disappearance in the southern climate which is difficult to accurately simulated by tswat the accuracy of the physically based soil temperature is largely depended on surface conditions such as snow cover dynamics in the northern climate the snow cover develops gradually over winter while in the south surface conditions are rather unstable which causes difficulty in simulation of soil frozen status 3 4 model performance evaluation for frozen depth we also evaluated tswat simulated freeze thaw cycles based on observations of soil profile temperature and frozen depth fig 7 compares the simulated vertical soil temperature profile by tswat with the observations at the six uscrn stations the frozen depth in the simulated and observed soil profile is indicated by light bluish colors temperature 0 c for different stations the model reproduced the daily variations in frozen depth well except that the depth was underestimated at wi54903 by approximately 20 cm and overestimated at il54811 and two southern stations by approximately 20 40 cm in general the tswat model simulations captured well the seasonal changes of frozen depths in the soil profile across the six stations fig 7 3 5 sensitivity of hydrological modeling to freeze thaw cycle representation we applied tswat to simulate monthly stream flow at usgs gauge station 05587450 fig 1 from 1980 to 2015 meanwhile the original swat model was used for comparison note that neither version of the swat model was calibrated for hydrology the only difference between these two versions of the swat model is that one used the empirical soil temperature and another one used the calibrated new soil temperature module model performance evaluation results on monthly stream flow are summarized for annual winter nov to apr and non winter seasons are shown in table 5 time series of observed and simulated monthly stream flow by the two versions of swat model at usgs gauge station 05587450 are shown in fig 8 scatter plots of observed vs simulated monthly stream flow at the station for the two versions of swat model in winter and non winter are shown in fig 9 all values of r2 and ns generated with tswat were greater than the corresponding values generated with the original swat model and most absolute values of pbias of tswat were less than those of the original swat model except for that in winter table 5 in general the variation of simulated stream flow was consistent with the observed for the two versions of swat model fig 8 regression slope achieved by tswat was closer to the 1 1 line in winter and non winter periods than the original swat model and simulations by tswat had a stronger association with observations than those by the original swat especially during winter fig 9a and b as shown in table 5 tswat greatly improved stream flow simulation in winter r2 increased by 0 19 and ns by 0 15 compared with the original swat model for non winter seasons tswat also slightly improved r2 by 0 03 and ns by 0 07 we found that tswat exhibited slightly damped snowmelt flow peaks compared with the original swat model which is the major reason for improved model performance in winter tswat tended to generate more infiltration and less surface runoff during winter and snowmelt season on the watershed scale the new soil temperature module better accounted for snowpack insulation effects on soil temperature allowing surface soil layers to remain unfrozen when snow accumulating on the ground collectively the enhanced swat model improved its simulation of hydrological effects of freeze thaw cycles particularly during winter and the snowmelt season to illustrate the impacts of different freeze thaw cycle representation on hydrology we compared simulated monthly average surface runoff percolation lateral flow ground water discharge total water yield and soil moisture in the umrb from 1980 to 2015 as shown in fig 10 table 6 provides annual average statistical comparison by the two versions of swat model in table 6 the relative difference between results of both models is evaluated by percent difference i e simulated by tswat simulation by swat simulation by swat 100 compared with swat tswat generated much more percolation lateral flow and ground water discharge percent difference 28 13 and 25 respectively less surface runoff and soil moisture percent difference 19 and 4 on the annual scale total water yield was also increased by 5 based on the evaluation period of 1980 to 2015 table 6 fig 10 evidently explained the differences between simulations of swat and tswat on the monthly scale because soil frozen days and depths simulated by tswat were less than those of swat more infiltration was generated and that water was easily transported downwards from soil profile eventually becoming recharge percolation from soil profile to aquafers and lateral flow during winter and the snowmelt season fig 10b and c tswat generated ground water during winter slowly discharged to streams as base flow until summer months leading to prolonged differences between monthly ground water discharges of tswat and swat see the comparison from jan to jul in fig 10d apparently the corresponding surface runoff simulated by tswat was less than those of swat during winter months noticing that the dramatic difference in surface runoff in march fig 10a interestingly swat produced more total water yield than tswat from dec to mar next year while tswat had more total water yield from apr to jul fig 10e which can be explained by the differences between tswat and swat in terms of surface runoff and ground water discharge in fig 10a and d the original swat model tended to retain a large amount of frozen water in soils before soil thawing and resulted in overestimated soil water during winter months while tswat reduced soil water content during this period leading to slight reduction in soil moisture fig 10f as indicated in table 6 on the annual scale percent difference 4 which is close to the increase of total water yield of 5 4 conclusion in this study we present the comparison between a physically based soil temperature module and an empirical soil temperature module for simulating freeze thaw cycles in the upper mississippi river basin daily surface and soil temperature records at 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths derived from six stations of the u s climate reference network in the umrb were used to evaluate model performance further long term streamflow data was used to understand the implications of improvements in freeze thaw cycle representation for hydrological modeling using the modified version of swat equipped with the physically based soil temperature model i e tswat and the original version of swat equipped with the original empirical soil temperature model detailed analyses and statistical assessment demonstrate that compared with the original swat model tswat can reliably simulate surface and soil temperatures and frozen depth and days at six sites across the umrb the differences in freeze thaw cycle representation between swat and tswat translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables such as surface runoff lateral flow percolation and ground water discharge compared against long term observed streamflow 1980 2015 tswat outperforms swat in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non winter seasons these results and analyses demonstrate the importance of improving freeze thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in

6666,freeze thaw cycles are important processes relevant to terrestrial hydrological cycling however the representation of freeze thaw cycles has been often simplified in large scale watershed models the soil and water assessment tool swat which has been widely used to understand and assess hydrologic budgets and water resources management employs a simplified empirical approach to estimate soil temperature and determine the freezing and thawing status of soils here we compared the performance of a physically based soil temperature module and the built in empirical approach in swat against field measurements at surface and 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths at six stations of the u s climate reference network uscrn within the upper mississippi river basin umrb in general swat consistently underestimated winter soil temperatures and overestimated frozen days at all soil depths while the modified version of swat equipped with the physically based soil temperature model referred to as tswat pronouncedly reduced the bias in estimated winter soil temperatures and frozen days compared with swat model performance assessment is conducted with three statistical coefficients i e bias c the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns statistical analyses show that tswat accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures at the five depths with r2 and ns values greater than 0 82 at most sites and bias values were generally within the range of 1 to 1 c during winter and ranged between 2 09 and 2 58 c in non winter seasons the differences in freeze thaw cycle representation between swat and tswat translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables such as surface runoff percolation and baseflow compared against long term observed streamflow 1980 2015 tswat outperformed swat in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non winter seasons these results and analyses highlight the value of improving freeze thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in large watersheds that are subject to freeze thaw cycles keywords soil temperature freeze thaw cycles streamflow swat 1 introduction about 35 of the earth s surface is subject to freeze thaw cycles that have great hydrological and biogeochemical importance with respect to water security and climate change impacts li and fang 2016 solomon 2007 williams and smith 1991 the presence of frozen soil layers significantly influences surface and subsurface exchanges of water and energy in the cold regions through hydrological and thermal processes ouyang et al 2016 wang et al 2009 woo et al 2004 freezing of soils reduces the hydraulic conductivity and results in more surface runoff due to decreased infiltration because of restricted drainage shanley and chalmers 1999 slater et al 1998 phase changes of soil water are associated with latent heat absorption and release which have direct influences on the thermal regime of soils riseborough 1990 meanwhile thermal gradients have considerable impacts on soil moisture migration cary 1966 energy exchange is particularly important in cold regions where freeze thaw cycles have a critical influence on water infiltration and solute movement hayashi et al 2003 the coexistence of liquid water and ice in soils dramatically changes the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of the soil zhao et al 1997 ice content in soil layers directly controls infiltration and soil moisture movement cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 liquid water flow was unhindered at relative low ice content while liquid water movement is restricted as the soil ice content increases harlan 1973 in addition the dynamics of soil heat fluxes are also depending on soil ice content which determines the soil thermal properties e g thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity slater et al 1998 the frozen depth in the soil profile is driven by the diurnal cycle of the soil surface temperature cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 in general the freezing front advances as the net heat flux out of the ground is positive and a thawing front may form at the surface and advance into the soil as the net heat flux is negative cheng et al 2014 the presence of snow cover further complicates the problem through its insulation effects which dampens daily heat fluxes and decreases frozen depth and timing groffman et al 2001 zhang 2005 for example an early snow that remains throughout the winter will result in shallower frozen depths than a late snow that falls after many days of cold weather iwata et al 2011 accurate simulation of the timing and depth of freeze thaw boundary in hydrological models will significantly improve their ability to model the hydrologic processes in cold region luo et al 2003 woo et al 2004 the inadequate representation of such freeze thaw processes in most hydrology models is a crucial source of uncertainty in many hydrologic modeling studies wellen et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 as a large scale hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool swat is designed to simulate hydrological processes and predict water quantity and quality as affected by landuse management practices and climate change at a watershed scale arnold et al 1998 the swat model has been used worldwide to solve complex watershed management problems and modified for different study purposes gassman et al 2007 li et al 2014 qi et al 2018a 2017 zhang et al 2017 in swat a watershed is partitioned into a number of subbasins which are further discretized into hydrological response units hrus based on specific combinations of landuse soils and slopes the model calculates the water balance i e surface and subsurface runoff percolation and base flow and evapotranspiration and transmission losses crop growth nutrient cycling and pesticide movement at the hru scale fontaine et al 2002 water flow sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru in a subbasin are summed and the resulting loadings are then routed through channels ponds and reservoirs to the watershed outlet in swat soil temperature tsoil is calculated at the center of a soil layer z on the hru scale by neitsch et al 2011 1 t soil z γ t soil z 1 γ d t aair t sur t sur where γ is the lag coefficient that relates current day s temperature to that of the previous day t soil is the soil temperature at a depth z on the previous day d quantifies the influence of depth on soil temperature t aair is the average annual air temperature and tsur is the temperature at soil surface the depth factor d is a function of depth at the center of the soil layer z maximum damping depth bulk density and soil water the soil surface temperature tsur is determined by the previous day s temperature the amount of ground cover and the bare soil temperature which is a function of daily average minimum and maximum temperature as well as solar radiation reaching the ground and albedo this empirical equation in general can reflect several features of temperature variation in soils the annual soil temperature variation follows a sinusoidal function the amplitude of the sine wave decreases with soil depth until temperature remains constant throughout the year at a certain depth the timing of maximum and minimum temperatures varies with depth this empirical formulation works well in warm temperate regions however in cold regions with snow accumulation predictions of soil temperature seldom agree with field measurements for example bélanger 2009 pointed out although the empirical formulation was able to simulate seasonal trends in soil temperature in the canadian boreal plains the formulation tended to underestimate soil temperature during winter even with an adjusted lag coefficient snow has high surface albedo and emissivity and low thermal conductivity which can protect the ground from excessive heat loss in winter zhang 2005 although such effects have been partially accounted for in the swat model through the incorporation of correction factors neitsch et al 2011 this does not fully address the physical processes driving soil temperature changes and as a result may not attend to the complexities associated with the presence of snow cover in winter bélanger 2009 in addition this empirical formulation does not simulate freeze thaw cycles because phase changes of water are not considered in swat as a result hydrological processes influenced by freeze thaw cycles cannot be accurately modeled at cold regions to overcome this problem a physically based soil temperature module has been developed in swat to consider the insulation effects of snow and latent heat exchange through phase changes of water in soils qi et al 2016a b instead of considering soil temperature as a function of air temperature the new soil temperature module simulates temperature change in snow and soils as a result of heat conduction and latent heat exchange compared with the empirical soil temperature module the new module can estimate snow or soil surface temperature based on an energy balance update thermal properties of snow and soils according to changes in snow density and soil water ice content and simulate phase changes of water in the soil profile the physically based module was tested with field observed temperatures from a small experimental watershed in atlantic canada qi et al 2016b demonstrating an improvement in modeling soil temperatures in the present study we intend to achieve two objectives 1 apply the modified version of swat hereafter tswat to a large scale

where the impact of air temperature diminishes fig 2 when snow accumulated on the ground the snow cover was treated as a single layer fig 2 2 3 1 boundary conditions the upper boundary temperature was determined by the energy balance equation hillel 1980 3 r sn r ln l e h s 0 where rsn is the net solar radiation rln is the net longwave radiation le is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat

default value of effcoe is 8 1 according to yin and arp 1993 for forest lands for agricultural lands effcoe is close to 50 according to previous studies qi et al 2016a b the amount of net solar radiation and net longwave radiation was calculated using the algorithms in swat neitsch et al 2011 the lower boundary of the simulation domain was defined at the damping depth determined by swat soil temperature tz c at this depth was determined following the method in steppuhn 1981 2 3 2 soil and snow thermal properties johansen 1975 developed a method to determine soil thermal conductivity for unfrozen and frozen soils the thermal conductivity of unsaturated soils k was determined by its thermal conductivities in dry kdry and saturated ksat states by introducing a kersten number i e ke the ke was determined by the degree of saturation which was calculated from the amount of water or ice in the soil for saturated soils a geometric mean equation based on the thermal conductivities of the

was calculated with the snow module of swat parameter ks coe calibrated the thermal conductivity of the snow layer as a multiplier the volumetric heat capacity of snow was calculated based on verseghy 1991 2 3 3 latent heat exchange the new soil temperature module considered latent heat transfer due to freeze thaw cycles as an internal heat source or sink within individual soil layers fig 2 latent heat was calculated according to the release of energy during the freezing of liquid water and the absorption of energy during the melting of ice fig 2 each layer froze when its temperature reached or fell below 0 c and thawed when its temperature exceeded 0 c fig 2 volumetric soil ice and water content were updated at the daily time step based on the status of the soil with respect to freezing or thawing fig 2 detailed information regarding module development including above mentioned functions and variables could be found in qi et al 2016b 2 4 swat model setup and soil temperature calibration the swat model requires a variety of detailed information describing the land use soil and topography data of the umrb the present study adopted a previously established umrb swat project but running with latest version of swat ver 664 in the previous study the umrb was divided into 131 subbasins according to the eight digit united states geological survey usgs hydrologic unit codes hucs fig 1 national hydrography dataset nhd stream dataset and a 90 m digital elevation model dem was used to provide watershed configuration and topographic parameter estimation a land use map was created by combing two sources of information i e the cropland data layer cdl and 2001 national land cover data to better define cultivated and non agricultural land use the state soil geographic statsgo database 1 250 000 scale soil map was used for umrb using a threshold operation of 5 for land use 10 for soil and 5 for slope 14 568 hrus were generated and the number of hrus per subbasin ranged from 58 to 216 management practices such as tile drainage tillage crop rotation and fertilizer and manure application were included in the project according to various sources detailed model setup information can be found in srinivasan et al 2010 the six soil temperature monitoring stations were identified at the corresponding hrus in the umrb using arcgis fig 1 corresponding soil types and slope classes are shown in table 1 the tswat model was used to simulate soil temperatures at 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths in the six identified hrus with particle swarm optimization pso algorithm of swat cup to calibrate four relevant parameters i e effcoe kcoe ks coe and ccoe specifically the pao algorithm was applied to each site with hundreds of simulations by each iteration iteration and simulation numbers varies at different sites in order to simulate hydrology at the watershed scale we applied the optimized parameters of the six hrus to other hrus in the basin using the nearest neighbor method via arcgis the surface temperature records from the six stations were used to validate the model 2 5 model evaluation model performance was assessed according to three coefficients of

table 2 shows the calibrated parameter values for the physically based soil temperature module at the six uscrn stations the values of parameter effcoe calibrating surface energy ranged from 29 48 to 68 45 with most values ranging from 51 15 to 68 45 and the values of parameter kcoe calibrating soil thermal conductivity ranged from 7 53 to 18 25 these results are generally consistent with the values i e effcoe 50 and kcoe 10 determined in previous studies conducted in cold climates qi et al 2016a b in the present study we also calibrated the parameter ks coe for snow thermal conductivity and ccoe for soil heat capacity which were not calibrated in the previous studies i e default values 1 was used for both parameters the values of parameter ks coe ranged from 3 92 to 17 08 while the values of parameter ccoe ranged from 5 73 to 17 81 the reason for increased thermal conductivity for soil layers in the previous studies and also in the present studies is because swat tended to underestimate soil moisture which has much higher thermal conductivity compared with void soil air space qi et al 2018b the larger than default values of ccoe can partially compensate overestimated thermal conductivity due to unevenly distributed soil moisture in the entire soil profile ks coe was calibrated to better address snow insulation effects on soil temperature 3 2 model performance evaluation for soil temperature model performance of tswat on daily temperatures at surface and five different soil depths in the six uscrn stations was evaluated based on r2 ns and bias table 3 model performance of the original version of swat model with the empirical soil temperature module at five soil depths were also illustrated in table 3 daily surface temperature is not simulated by the original swat model simulated and observed mean daily temperatures for periods of record for each station see table 1 are also included in general tswat accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures with higher accuracy for top soil layers than for deeper soil layers the r2 and ns values are greater than 0 82 except for station wi54903 at 100 cm depth table 3 based on bias values tswat slightly overestimated surface and soil temperatures at different soil depths except for stations wi54903 and il54811 table 3 all r2 values of tswat were greater than the corresponding values of swat at different soil depths for different stations most ns values of tswat were also greater than those of swat except for station il54808 at soil depths of 5 10 20 cm table 3 the absolute bias values of tswat were generally less than the corresponding values of swat for stations in the northern portion of the basin at different soil depths table 3 fig 1 this indicates that the physically based soil temperature module outperformed the empirical soil temperature module especially in areas with seasonal snow cover on the other hand the empirical soil temperature model was able to capture the average conditions of soil temperatures especially at top soil layers in a temperate climate to illustrate the contrasting performance of tswat and swat for top and deep soil layers we show simulated vs observed daily soil temperature time series at 5 and 100 cm depths in figs 3 and 4 respectively tswat performed better than swat at describing the variations of daily soil temperature in winter at the top soil layer and for the whole year at the deepest soil layer in fact swat severely underestimated winter soil temperatures at the top soil layers while tswat was able to simulate winter soil temperatures more accurately which was the precondition of simulating freeze thaw cycles in winter at deeper soil layers although swat could capture the general trend of seasonal variations in soil temperature it had large biases with respect to summer temperature peaks fig 4 the poorer performance for both versions of swat at the 100 cm depth for station wi54903 may be caused by uncertainties associated with soil physical properties at deeper soil layers we also added analyses with respect to winter and non winter seasons to evaluate model performance based on bias at the surface and five different soil depths for the six uscrn stations as shown in table 4 for tswat most bias values c were within the range of 1 to 1 c during winter for different stations this is especially true for the surface and top soil layers i e soil depths 100 cm table 4 even for soil layer at 100 cm depth the bias values were within the range of 1 21 to 2 51 c for non winter seasons however the tswat model tended to have slightly greater absolute values of bias the maximum bias value was 3 16 c at the surface of il54808 while the minimum value was 4 22 c at 100 cm depth of wi54903 except for these two extremes the bias values ranged from 2 09 to 2 58 c for other data points table 4 the model tended to overestimate surface and soil temperatures during non winter seasons while this was not obvious during winter table 4 in most stations absolute values of bias for swat were greater than the corresponding values of tswat and the discrepancies between the absolute values of bias for swat and tswat were greatest at top soil layers and then decreased with soil depth in winter table 4 note that the bias values of soil temperature at 10 cm depth was 16 46 and 0 36 c for swat and tswat respectively in station mn54932 with the highest latitude fig 1 which demonstrated again that the empirical soil temperature module severely underestimated winter soil temperatures in top soil layers on the contrary absolute values of bias for swat were slightly less than the corresponding values of tswat at top soil layers for most stations while tswat tended to have lower absolute values of bias at deeper soil layers in all stations in the non winter seasons table 4 these results explained the reason for lower absolute values of bias of swat than those of tswat in stations in the southern portion of the basin on the annual temporal scale in table 3 as a result the physically based soil temperature model pronouncedly improved winter soil temperature simulation which is the basis for accurate simulate soil freeze thaw cycles 3 3 model performance evaluation for estimated frozen days to clarify small biases that may accumulate over time we calculated the total number of frozen days with temperature 0 c as observed and simulated by swat and tswat for each soil layer over all sites and their periods of record fig 5 note that the original swat model does not simulate soil surface temperature we used percent bias pbias in eq 13 to evaluate model performance for tswat the highest accuracy was found at 5 cm depth with pbias of 1 and the lowest accuracy was at 100 cm depth with pbias of 41 for the surface and other soil depths pbias ranged from 24 to 10 in general simulated frozen days were less than observed for the surface and 100 cm soil depth while more than observed for soil depths from 5 to 50 cm fig 5 for the original swat model the highest accuracy was also found at 5 cm soil depth but with a much lower pbias of 21 and the lowest accuracy was at 50 cm depth with pbias of 96 pbias values ranged from 34 to 62 at other soil depths in general swat pronouncedly overestimated frozen days than tswat mainly because the empirical soil temperature module tended to underestimate soil temperatures in winter the physically based soil temperature approach better matched observations due to its capability of better accounting for snow insulation effects we further analyzed simulated vs observed total frozen days at the surface and different soil depths by tswat as shown in fig 6 similar to the results derived from soil temperature simulation as discussed in section 3 2 it is not surprising to find that tswat performed better for capturing frozen days for top soil layers than for deep layers for example for the four northern stations pbias ranged from 7 to 8 from 17 to 32 from 22 to 45 from 16 to 37 and from 49 to 360 at the surface and 5 10 20 and 50 cm depths respectively note that for the two southern stations tswat generally performed poorer than the four northern stations particularly for the station mo23909 the reason for the relatively poor performance at the southern stations may be due to the rapid snow cover appearance and disappearance in the southern climate which is difficult to accurately simulated by tswat the accuracy of the physically based soil temperature is largely depended on surface conditions such as snow cover dynamics in the northern climate the snow cover develops gradually over winter while in the south surface conditions are rather unstable which causes difficulty in simulation of soil frozen status 3 4 model performance evaluation for frozen depth we also evaluated tswat simulated freeze thaw cycles based on observations of soil profile temperature and frozen depth fig 7 compares the simulated vertical soil temperature profile by tswat with the observations at the six uscrn stations the frozen depth in the simulated and observed soil profile is indicated by light bluish colors temperature 0 c for different stations the model reproduced the daily variations in frozen depth well except that the depth was underestimated at wi54903 by approximately 20 cm and overestimated at il54811 and two southern stations by approximately 20 40 cm in general the tswat model simulations captured well the seasonal changes of frozen depths in the soil profile across the six stations fig 7 3 5 sensitivity of hydrological modeling to freeze thaw cycle representation we applied tswat to simulate monthly stream flow at usgs gauge station 05587450 fig 1 from 1980 to 2015 meanwhile the original swat model was used for comparison note that neither version of the swat model was calibrated for hydrology the only difference between these two versions of the swat model is that one used the empirical soil temperature and another one used the calibrated new soil temperature module model performance evaluation results on monthly stream flow are summarized for annual winter nov to apr and non winter seasons are shown in table 5 time series of observed and simulated monthly stream flow by the two versions of swat model at usgs gauge station 05587450 are shown in fig 8 scatter plots of observed vs simulated monthly stream flow at the station for the two versions of swat model in winter and non winter are shown in fig 9 all values of r2 and ns generated with tswat were greater than the corresponding values generated with the original swat model and most absolute values of pbias of tswat were less than those of the original swat model except for that in winter table 5 in general the variation of simulated stream flow was consistent with the observed for the two versions of swat model fig 8 regression slope achieved by tswat was closer to the 1 1 line in winter and non winter periods than the original swat model and simulations by tswat had a stronger association with observations than those by the original swat especially during winter fig 9a and b as shown in table 5 tswat greatly improved stream flow simulation in winter r2 increased by 0 19 and ns by 0 15 compared with the original swat model for non winter seasons tswat also slightly improved r2 by 0 03 and ns by 0 07 we found that tswat exhibited slightly damped snowmelt flow peaks compared with the original swat model which is the major reason for improved model performance in winter tswat tended to generate more infiltration and less surface runoff during winter and snowmelt season on the watershed scale the new soil temperature module better accounted for snowpack insulation effects on soil temperature allowing surface soil layers to remain unfrozen when snow accumulating on the ground collectively the enhanced swat model improved its simulation of hydrological effects of freeze thaw cycles particularly during winter and the snowmelt season to illustrate the impacts of different freeze thaw cycle representation on hydrology we compared simulated monthly average surface runoff percolation lateral flow ground water discharge total water yield and soil moisture in the umrb from 1980 to 2015 as shown in fig 10 table 6 provides annual average statistical comparison by the two versions of swat model in table 6 the relative difference between results of both models is evaluated by percent difference i e simulated by tswat simulation by swat simulation by swat 100 compared with swat tswat generated much more percolation lateral flow and ground water discharge percent difference 28 13 and 25 respectively less surface runoff and soil moisture percent difference 19 and 4 on the annual scale total water yield was also increased by 5 based on the evaluation period of 1980 to 2015 table 6 fig 10 evidently explained the differences between simulations of swat and tswat on the monthly scale because soil frozen days and depths simulated by tswat were less than those of swat more infiltration was generated and that water was easily transported downwards from soil profile eventually becoming recharge percolation from soil profile to aquafers and lateral flow during winter and the snowmelt season fig 10b and c tswat generated ground water during winter slowly discharged to streams as base flow until summer months leading to prolonged differences between monthly ground water discharges of tswat and swat see the comparison from jan to jul in fig 10d apparently the corresponding surface runoff simulated by tswat was less than those of swat during winter months noticing that the dramatic difference in surface runoff in march fig 10a interestingly swat produced more total water yield than tswat from dec to mar next year while tswat had more total water yield from apr to jul fig 10e which can be explained by the differences between tswat and swat in terms of surface runoff and ground water discharge in fig 10a and d the original swat model tended to retain a large amount of frozen water in soils before soil thawing and resulted in overestimated soil water during winter months while tswat reduced soil water content during this period leading to slight reduction in soil moisture fig 10f as indicated in table 6 on the annual scale percent difference 4 which is close to the increase of total water yield of 5 4 conclusion in this study we present the comparison between a physically based soil temperature module and an empirical soil temperature module for simulating freeze thaw cycles in the upper mississippi river basin daily surface and soil temperature records at 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths derived from six stations of the u s climate reference network in the umrb were used to evaluate model performance further long term streamflow data was used to understand the implications of improvements in freeze thaw cycle representation for hydrological modeling using the modified version of swat equipped with the physically based soil temperature model i e tswat and the original version of swat equipped with the original empirical soil temperature model detailed analyses and statistical assessment demonstrate that compared with the original swat model tswat can reliably simulate surface and soil temperatures and frozen depth and days at six sites across the umrb the differences in freeze thaw cycle representation between swat and tswat translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables such as surface runoff lateral flow percolation and ground water discharge compared against long term observed streamflow 1980 2015 tswat outperforms swat in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non winter seasons these results and analyses demonstrate the importance of improving freeze thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in

6667,experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow in a 2 dimensional 2 d confined sand chamber the air saturation distribution was monitored using light transmission and the air pressure was measured by manometers as infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min significant increase in air pressure was observed due to the increase of air pressure water infiltration was retarded leading to a significant decrease in air outflow rate at high infiltration flux when the infiltration flux was larger than 800 ml min the air flowed out of the sand chamber in the form of air fingers the underlying process of the finger like air outflow pattern was analyzed quantitatively and the critical infiltration flux leading to air fingers was estimated based on the relative air water permeability of the working sand the green ampt model showed that the infiltration process was retarded by air counterflow when the air pressure head was comparable to the depth of the wetting front at high infiltration flux keywords vadose zone light transmission fingered flow wetting front air pressure 1 introduction infiltration is thought of as the phenomenon of water penetration from the ground surface into the subjacent soil chesworth et al 2008 when the infiltration flux is relatively low the air phase can escape freely from the vadose zone and is often assumed to have a minor effect on the infiltration process furman et al 2006 broadbridge et al 2009 assouline 2013 when the infiltration flux is high enough for example during intense rainfall or basin irrigation the air phase will be confined between the shallow water table and the wetting front of the infiltrating water leading to enhanced air counterflow hammecker et al 2003 kuang et al 2013 siemens et al 2014 the air counterflow pattern during infiltration is vital to understanding and modeling the infiltration processes culligan et al 2000 hammecker et al 2003 siemens et al 2013 but up to now the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow pattern has been seldom studied through experiments evidence of air counterflow during infiltration was observed in the early studies of peck 1965 and jarrett and fritton 1978 in their confined sand columns later different factors such as air pressure and boundary conditions that affected air counterflow were investigated through experiments by some researchers culligan et al 2000 weeks 2002 siemens et al 2013 culligan et al 2000 investigated the effect of air pressure on air counterflow using capillary glass tubes and found out that a slight increase in air pressure at the base of the sand column could lead to a measurable change in air counterflow weeks 2002 investigated the airflow induced by intense rain on a large scale and noted that air counterflow happened when air pressure exceeded the water pressure by an amount equal to the bubbling pressure hb recently siemens et al 2013 conducted a series of experiments to study the effect of boundary condition on air counterflow and found that air counterflow was more evident when the lower boundary is closed besides boundary conditions and air pressure infiltration flux is also supposed to be an important factor affecting the air counterflow pattern but up to now the effect of infiltration flux on the patterns of air counterflow has been rarely investigated through experiments on the other hand the finger like infiltration front under air draining conditions has been studied theoretically and experimentally by previous researchers according to parlange and hill 1976 under air draining conditions the instability criterion could be simplified to iw ks the critical rate of iw ks means that the finger like wetting pattern happens when the infiltration rate is lower than the saturated conductivity of the medium under air confining conditions the infiltration process is significantly affected by air counterflow thus the impedance of the air phase below the wetting front cannot be neglected according to wang et al 1998 the instability criterion was supplemented to h0 hwb haf 0 under air confining conditions h0 surface water head hwb water bubbling value haf air pressure head however the relationship between air pressure haf and infiltration rate iw can be quite complex and at present the estimation of critical infiltration rate iw that leads to finger like infiltration patterns under air confining conditions has been seldom investigated thus more studies should be carried out to investigate the underlying process that will lead to finger like infiltration patterns under air confining conditions the main aim of this research is to study the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow through experiments in a 2 dimensional 2 d confined sand chamber to achieve this aim a series of experiments are carried out with different infiltration fluxes different air counterflow patterns are first observed through the light transmission method ltm air outflow volumes at different infiltration fluxes are compared to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air outflow rate the critical infiltration flux that will lead to finger like infiltration patterns is estimated based on the relative permeability of the working sand the effect of air pressure on air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes is also analyzed using the modified green ampt model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the arrangement of the experimental equipments is shown in fig 1 a infiltration experiments were conducted in a 2 d sand chamber 45 cm 55 cm 2 5 cm as shown in fig 1b and summarized in table 1 the 2 d sand chamber was made of a u shaped aluminum frame with two parallel glass plates attached to it the porous medium was placed between the two parallel glass plates as shown in fig 1c the sand chamber was placed between the light bank and the charge coupled device ccd camera ap2e apogee instruments auburn ca the light bank was the only light source of the system and was placed 5 cm away from the sand chamber the ccd camera was placed on the other side of the chamber the distance between the sand chamber and the camera was 1 5 m the light transmission image taken by the ccd camera had a spatial resolution of 1536 pixels 1024 pixels covering the entire chamber which gave approximately 0 17 mm2 per pixel resolution the software maxim dl ottawa on was used to record the images automatically at the top of the sand chamber five flat fan nozzles were installed to ensure uniform water application a peristaltic pump longer pump bt100 1f was used to provide water at a given flux in order to make the water flowing uniformly in out of the bottom of the sand chamber a slot 55 cm in length 1 0 cm in width and 0 5 cm in depth was placed at the bottom of the sand chamber a fine stainless mesh is put on the top of the slot to prevent the sand from dropping into the slot and two valves were located on the left and right end of the slot controlling water flowing in out of the sand chamber three manometers testo inc 510i differential pressure manometer were installed 15 cm above the bottom an additional manometer was installed 35 cm above the bottom to record the water head when the saturated conductivity was measured accusand silica sand unimin corporation in 20 30 grade was used as the porous medium in the experiments it was reported by schroth et al 1996 that the accusand silica sand had well defined hydrologic properties high batch to batch consistency and was available in large quantities furthermore the sand was made up of high purity sio2 and was thus suitable for light transmission experiments the sand was washed thoroughly using deionized water and then oven dried for 48 h at 45 c before packing wet packing procedure was employed to prevent possible preferential flow paths and sand was packed into the chamber in small increments with both tapping and shaking between each successive addition during the packing procedure the water table was always maintained between 1 cm and 2 cm above the sand surface the final height of the packed sand was 40 cm and the average bulk density was ρb 1 80 0 04 g cm3 according to schroth et al 1996 the particle density of the working sand was ρp 2 65 g cm3 the total porosity φ equaled 1 ρb ρp and was 0 32 0 02 cm3 cm3 in the experiments when the packing procedure was completed the working sand had been completely saturated by water the difference in water pressure head δhw was measured by manometers located 15 cm and 35 cm δl of 20 cm from the base of the sand chamber the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated using darcy s law i e ks q δhw δl 1 by applying different water fluxes q 1 ml min 10 ml min 30 ml min and 100 ml min at the bottom of the sand chamber ks of the working sand was calculated and the mean value of ks was calculated to be 0 25 0 04 cm s given that the dynamic viscosity of water μw equaled 1 01 10 3 pa s the water density ρw equaled 1000 kg m3 and the gravity acceleration g equaled 9 81 m s then the permeability ks of the working sand calculated by ksμw ρwg equaled 2 58 0 41 10 10 m2 to calculate the residual water saturation sr the sand chamber was drained completely and the mass of the outflow water mout was measured the residual water saturation was calculated by 1 s r φ m o u t ρ w v 0 φ where φ was the porosity of the working sand mout was the mass of the outflow water ρw was the density of water v0 was the total volume of the sand chamber the capillary properties and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k s of the working sand are described by the van genuchten mualem model and the relevant parameters are summarized in table 2 the relative water permeability of the working sand was estimated using the van genuchten mualem model parker et al 1987 2 k r w s w s ew 1 2 1 1 s ew 1 m m 2 where krw sw was the relative water permeability at the water saturation of sw sew was the effective water saturation given by sw swr sws swr swr and sws was the residual and full water saturation as listed in table 2 m 1 1 nvg and nvg was the van genuchten parameter in table 2 the relative air permeability was estimated using the kuang s model kuang and jiao 2011 3 k r a s w 1 s ew 1 2 1 s ew 1 m 4 m where kra sw was the relative air permeability at the water saturation of sw the calculated relative air water permeability of the working sand is shown in fig 2 2 2 experimental procedure in order to ensure that the distribution of air and water was the same among different infiltration experiments several steps were employed before each infiltration experiment the sand chamber was firstly drained completely by opening the valves at the bottom and the chamber was left to stand for 24 h the valves at the bottom were then closed and the chamber was infiltrated by a peristaltic pump through the five flat fan nozzles the flat fan nozzles could apply water along a straight line uniformly only when the total infiltration flux was larger than 600 ml min when the infiltration flux was larger than 1100 ml min the sand surface was quickly sealed by about 5 cm thick ponded water layer and thus 1100 ml min was set as the maximum infiltration flux in these experiments during the experiments light transmission images were taken by the ccd camera every 6 s and the exposure time was set to be 0 2 s during infiltration experiments the air saturation distribution under different infiltration flux was calculated using the light transmission image obtained by ltm 2 3 interpretation of the light transmission images the light transmission images were interpreted into air saturation distribution using the image processing algorithm proposed by niemet and selker 2001 a brief description of the image processing algorithm is presented here and the details of the interpretation method could be found in the study of wei et al 2018 because the sand chamber was filled up using wet packing procedure the working sand was completely saturated by water before the drainage began so air saturation of the sand chamber was equal to 0 sair 0 then the chamber was drained completely and left to stand for 24 h and the residual water saturation of the working sand was equal to 0 12 as presented in table 2 which indicated that the air saturation of the sand chamber should be 0 88 sair 0 88 the measured light intensity transmitted through the working sand satisfied 4 ln i a s air b 5 ln i a s air b 6 ln i a s air b where both a and b were constants determined by the working sand i was the light intensity measured during the infiltration experiments sair was the corresponding air saturation when the light intensity i was measured i was the light intensity measured at the end of packing under water saturated conditions when swater 1 and sair 0 and i was the light intensity measured at the very beginning of infiltration under residual water condition when swater 0 12 and sair 0 88 the values of constants a and b could be solved using eqs 4 and 5 taking the values of a and b into eq 6 or directly combining eqs 4 6 the air saturation sair could be calculated from the light intensity i measured by the ccd camera as follows 7 s a i r ln i ln i ln i ln i s a i r s a i r s e f f s s r e s 1 s r e s ln i l n i r e s ln i s l n i r e s s s r e s 1 s r e s ln i l n i r e s ln i s l n i r e s it should be mentioned that the light intensity measured by the ccd sensor was in the unit of grayscale instead of the absolute light intensity in the unit of candela in fact measuring the absolute values of light intensity could be quite expensive and time consuming on the other hand the light intensity measured by the ccd sensor was linearly correlated with the absolute light intensity thus the grayscale data was not converted into the absolute values of light intensity in this study during the experiment the minimum light intensity was 1250 grayscale measured under residual water condition and the maximum light intensity was around 2800 grayscale measured under water saturated condition the system errors of the data measured by ltm were evaluated to be within 7 and the random errors were evaluated to be within 3 in this air water system systematic measuring errors could be caused by several factors e g opaque boundaries blocking up the light near the boundaries additionally the sand was packed into the chamber from bottom to top which would inevitably make the sand at the bottom slightly denser than the sand at the top this gradual change in density would bring overall deviation to the inflow outflow volume measured by ltm because the density was assumed to be uniform throughout the chamber when the ltm images were interpreted the cumulative air outflow volume vout was calculated by the integration of change in air saturation throughout the sand chamber i e 8 v o u t φ v e 0 nz 0 nx s a i r t s a i r 0 where φ was the porosity of the working sand ve was element volume of an ltm pixel nz was the number of rows in the ltm image nx was the number of columns in the ltm image s a i r t was the measured air saturation at time t and s a i r 0 was the initial air saturation as air flowed out from the sand chamber continuously the value of vout increased with time if the air outflow rate remained stable then the slope k of vout t lines represented the air outflow rate at each infiltration flux and in this study was obtained through linear regression 3 results and discussion 3 1 qualitative analysis of air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes 3 1 1 the relationship between air pressure and air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes because the air pressure measured by the three manometers was quite close to each other the mean air pressure was used it could be seen from fig 3 a and b that at low infiltration fluxes 600 ml min and 800 ml min air pressure increased slightly from 0 to 20 mmh2o and the slight increase in air pressure had little impact on air counterflow while at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min fig 3c air pressure increased significantly from around 20 mmh2o to 140 mmh2o at t 66 s and the air outflow was retarded the similar phenomenon could also be seen in fig 3d at t 18 s the significant increase in air pressure was associated with the formation of a ponded water layer at the top of the working sand at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min ponded water layer appeared at t 66 s while at the infiltration flux of 1100 ml min ponded water layer appeared at t 18 s it should be mentioned that if the impedance of air phase was not considered the ponding infiltration flux could be estimated as the product of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and infiltration area a which equaled 2062 5 ml min however the critical infiltration flux observed in this study was between 800 ml min and 1000 ml min which was quite smaller than the flux of 2062 5 ml min estimated by ksa the difference between the estimated flux and experimental observations indicated that the effect of air phase could not be ignored under the experimental conditions the accurate critical infiltration flux will be estimated in section 3 2 1 when the effect of air phase is taken into consideration it could be inferred that when the ponded water layer appeared the air in the sand chamber was isolated from the atmosphere and was pressurized below the wetting front as air was pressurized the infiltration front was impeded by the pressurized air and thus the water inflow air outflow was retarded as observed in fig 3c and d 3 1 2 the air outflow rate at different infiltration fluxes it could be seen in fig 4 that when a relatively low infiltration flux was imposed 600 ml min and 800 ml min the cumulative air outflow volume increased steadily and the slope of the trend line remained consistent during the whole infiltration when a higher infiltration flux was imposed 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min an obvious turning point was observed the slope of the trend line decreased significantly when the infiltration time approached 66 s qw 1000 ml min and 18 s qw 1100 ml min as mentioned in section 2 3 the slope k of the trend lines in fig 4 represented the air outflow rate at each infiltration flux thus it could be inferred from fig 4 that at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min the air outflow rate decreased as the infiltration proceeded to better analyze the relationship between air outflow rate and infiltration flux linear regression was employed here to obtain the slope k of the trend lines as shown in fig 4 the fitted slope k i e air outflow rate and fit quality r2 was presented in table 3 it could be seen in table 3 that when a relatively low infiltration flux was imposed 600 ml min and 800 ml min the air outflow rate was 709 0 ml min and 741 0 ml min respectively and the air outflow rate remained stable during the whole infiltration the imbalance in q and k could be attributed to air pressurization and measurement errors when infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min the air outflow rate was 941 1 ml min and 1072 9 ml min respectively at the beginning of infiltration and the air outflow rate suddenly decreased to 768 2 ml min and 517 2 ml min when infiltration time approached 66 s and 18 s respectively the decrease in air outflow rate at high infiltration flux could be explained by the sealing of the outflow paths above the wetting front under air confining conditions the only path for air escaping was upward through the sand surface however when the infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min or 1100 ml min the outflow paths above the wetting front was sealed by water the sealing of the outflow paths prevented air from flowing out of the sand chamber freely causing a significant decrease in air outflow rate at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min as seen in table 3 the results presented in fig 4 and table 3 implied that when the infiltration flux was smaller than 800 ml min the air outflow rate increased with infiltration flux while as the infiltration flux was larger than 1000 ml min the air outflow rate decreased with increasing infiltration flux when the outflow paths were sealed by water thus air was confined below the wetting front and could lead to concentrated air counterflow on the wetting front at high infiltration flux 3 1 3 air counterflow patterns at different infiltration fluxes the air saturation distribution at different infiltration fluxes was presented in fig 5 for clarity in the following discussion the zones where air saturation sair changed quickly from 0 5 to 0 7 was referred to as the wetting front from fig 5a c and d f it could be seen that when the infiltration flux was lower than 800 ml min the wetting front zone was relatively sharp when the infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min the wetting front zone became wavy in the later stage fig 5i as the infiltration flux increased to 1100 ml min fig 5j l especially fig 5l the air fingers started to develop and made the wetting front more diffusive as the infiltration continued the sharp wetting front at low infiltration flux meant that the water infiltrated into the sand steadily and uniformly with little impedance so air saturation changed quickly from sair 0 7 to sair 0 5 however when the infiltration flux was larger than 1000 ml min fig 5g i and j l air counterflow was no longer neglectable because water infiltration was retarded in the later stage as water infiltration was retarded the wetting front became broader vertically and air bubbles were observed on the sand surface at the locations where air fingers appeared comparing fig 5j with l it could be easily found out that the wetting front was much broader at the end of infiltration than at the beginning of infiltration it could be concluded from fig 5 that as infiltration flux increased from 600 ml min to 1100 ml min air counterflow was enhanced leading to a more unstable wetting front as reported in the literature white et al 1977 wang et al 1998 li et al 2008 the instability of the wetting front could be induced by air counterflow according to wang et al 1998 as air counterflow happened the wetting front was deformed from the very beginning of infiltration with a wetting tip moving much more rapidly than the wetting tail which was consistent with the observations in our experiments at high infiltration flux fig 5g l while in our experiments at low infiltration flux fig 5a f the air upflow seemed uniform and no finger like flow pattern was observed it could be found in fig 5 that the air upflow was quite uniform at low infiltration flux and the finger like flow pattern only happened when the infiltration flux was high enough the underlying process responsible for finger like wetting patterns is analyzed quantitatively in the section 3 2 1 below from the above discussion several findings can be summarized firstly the air pressure increased significantly at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min the significant increase in air pressure was attributed to the ponded water layer on the sand surface secondly as infiltration flux exceed 800 ml min the water inflow air outflow rate could be retarded significantly by air counterflow the process of air counterflow is vital to understanding and modeling the infiltration processes if the effect of air counterflow is not considered the infiltration rate could be overpredicted leading to significant error in surface runoff modeling thirdly the air counterflow became more concentrated as infiltration flux increases and could lead to a more unstable wetting front stability of the wetting front is a key problem for irrigation as the finger like wetting pattern may enhance leaching of water and agrochemicals beyond the depth of root uptake such wetting pattern not only wastes water resources but also contaminates groundwater by agrochemicals according to the experimental results shorter irrigation intervals with lower infiltration flux is preferred in order to avoid the finger like wetting pattern in order to make the experimental findings more sound two other sets of infiltration tests have been carried out using finer sands in 30 40 grade and 40 50 grade the effect of high infiltration rates on airflow in finer sands appear similar to the results in the sand of 20 30 grade and the results are summarized in the supplementary material 3 2 quantitative analysis of air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes 3 2 1 the estimation of the critical infiltration flux if the water inflow air outflow is uniform the wetting front should be horizontally flat and vertically sharp with a uniform air saturation above the wetting front thus based on the estimated relative air water permeability in fig 2 the uniform air outflow water inflow flux could be estimated using darcy s law i e 9 q a s air a k k ra μ a δ p a ρ a g δ l δ l q w s air a k k rw μ w δ p w ρ w g δ l δ l where qa sair is the uniform air outflow flux and qw sair is the uniform water inflow flux a is the cross section area of the sand chamber k is the permeability of the working sand kra is the relative air permeability above the wetting front and krw is the relative water permeability above the wetting front both kra and krw are the functions of sair μa is the dynamic viscosity of air and equals 1 98 10 5 pa s μw is the dynamic viscosity of water and equals 1 01 10 3 pa s δpa ρa g δl δl is the gradient of total air pressure and is assumed to be ρwg under gravity induced infiltration this is a fair assumption when the infiltration flux is relatively low and no ponded water layer is observed on the sand surface δpw ρw g δl δl is the gradient of total water pressure it can be seen in fig 6 that as sair decreases qa becomes smaller while qw becomes larger as sair decreases the cross sectional area available for air outflow also decreases while the cross sectional area available for water inflow increases making the water inflow easier and the air outflow more difficult however if the compression of air volume is not considered the water inflow volume should be the same as air outflow volume thus the actual infiltration flux is limited by the smaller one of qa and qw which is shown as the bold red line in fig 6 as presented in fig 6 the peak value of the bold red line is around 800 ml min the peak value of 800 ml min means that the maximum infiltration flux that can be approached under the condition of uniform water inflow air outflow is 800 ml min which is consistent with the observations in fig 5 it can also be seen from fig 6 that the infiltration flux approaches its maximum value at the air saturation of around 0 3 which is consistent with the value of air saturation observed in fig 5a f above the wetting front the estimated qc and sair yield a good approximation of the experimental results indicating that the assumptions of uniform water inflow air outflow in the sand chamber should be true when the infiltration flux is lower than qc it can also be found out from fig 6 that when the water inflow flux is larger than 800 ml min the air below the wetting front cannot flow out at the same rate as water inflow thus the air will be sealed below the wetting front of the infiltration water at high infiltration flux leading to the pressurization of the air below the wetting front when the air pressure increases over a significant value pa 100 mmh2o as observed in fig 3 in this study the pressurized air phase breaks through the sealing wetting front and flows out through the air fingers where sair is generally larger than 0 5 as observed in fig 5 it can be seen in fig 6 that when sair is larger than 0 4 the air outflow flux increases dramatically with sair which means that these fingers can transport the air phase quite efficiently the occurrence of these fingers leads to a significant increase in air outflow capacity so the air pressure quickly levels off after the breakthrough of these fingers as seen in fig 3 3 2 2 the effect of air pressurization on air counterflow when the infiltration flux is larger than qc ponded water layer will appear on the sand surface thus the assumption of δp δl ρwg in section 3 2 1 is no longer valid and the air outflow rate should be described by the modified green ampt model wang et al 1997 siemens et al 2013 10 i a k s a i r z h w b h 0 h a f z where ia is the air outflow rate k sair is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and is associated with the air saturation sair above the wetting front z is the depth of the wetting front hwb is the water entry value and equals 0 5 αvg as suggested by bouwer 1966 h0 is the water head at the surface and equals the thickness of the ponded water layer haf is the air pressure below the wetting front as reflected in eq 10 the air outflow rate generally decreases as air pressure head haf increases however if air pressure head is much smaller than the depth of wetting front i e haf z 1 the effect of haf on ia is neglectable from fig 7 it can be inferred that when haf z 0 3 the effect of air pressurization on infiltration could be neglected that s why the slight increase in air pressure had little impact on air counterflow as seen in fig 3a and 3b on the other hand as the haf increased significantly and was comparable to the value of z i e t 18 s at the infiltration flux of 1100 ml min and t 66 s at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min the air outflow rate decreased significantly as shown in fig 3c and d several findings can be summarized from the quantitative analysis of the air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes under air confining conditions firstly the water inflow air outflow is uniform only when the infiltration flux is smaller than the critical flux qc the critical flux qc can be estimated according to the relative air water permeability of the medium secondly the occurrence of finger like infiltration pattern can be attributed to the breakthrough of the pressurized air below the wetting front thirdly the effect of air pressurization on infiltration should only be taken into consideration when the air pressure head is comparable to the depth of the wetting front it should be mentioned that the compression of air volume was not considered in this study according to the clapeyron equation the relative change of air volume due to pressurization was 1 45 δv v0 δp patm 150 mmh2o 10 336 mmh2o throughout the experiment further studies should be carried out to examine the validity of these estimation methods in other conditions e g heterogeneous medium when the change of air pressure may be more significant and the compression of air volume could not be neglected 4 conclusions in this study experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow under air confining conditions the concentrated air counterflow at high infiltration flux was observed using ltm at high infiltration flux air pressure increased significantly and led to a significant decrease in air outflow rate as infiltration flux increased the wetting front became more unstable and the finger like wetting pattern appeared at the infiltration flux of 1100 ml min for the working sand in 20 30grade the critical infiltration flux of 800 ml min was estimated based on the relative air water permeability of the working sand the estimation process indicated that the occurrence of finger like air outflow pattern was caused by the sealing of infiltrating wetting front it could be inferred from the modified green ampt model that the impedance of air counterflow should be considered during infiltration when the change of air pressure was comparable to the depth of the wetting front from the experimental results it can be generally concluded that the air pressurization at high infiltration flux could cause finger like air outflow patterns and a substantial decrease in soil infiltration capacity resulting in problems of practical concern such as large runoff soil erosion and the waste of irrigation water the experimental results from this study might be instructional for irrigation system design and surface runoff modeling except for the infiltration flux some other factors such as particle size and medium heterogeneity can also affect air counterflow during infiltration and more work should be conducted to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the air counterflow during infiltration processes conflict of interest none acknowledgments we would express our deepest gratitude

6667,experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow in a 2 dimensional 2 d confined sand chamber the air saturation distribution was monitored using light transmission and the air pressure was measured by manometers as infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min significant increase in air pressure was observed due to the increase of air pressure water infiltration was retarded leading to a significant decrease in air outflow rate at high infiltration flux when the infiltration flux was larger than 800 ml min the air flowed out of the sand chamber in the form of air fingers the underlying process of the finger like air outflow pattern was analyzed quantitatively and the critical infiltration flux leading to air fingers was estimated based on the relative air water permeability of the working sand the green ampt model showed that the infiltration process was retarded by air counterflow when the air pressure head was comparable to the depth of the wetting front at high infiltration flux keywords vadose zone light transmission fingered flow wetting front air pressure 1 introduction infiltration is thought of as the phenomenon of water penetration from the ground surface into the subjacent soil chesworth et al 2008 when the infiltration flux is relatively low the air phase can escape freely from the vadose zone and is often assumed to have a minor effect on the infiltration process furman et al 2006 broadbridge et al 2009 assouline 2013 when the infiltration flux is high enough for example during intense rainfall or basin irrigation the air phase will be confined between the shallow water table and the wetting front of the infiltrating water leading to enhanced air counterflow hammecker et al 2003 kuang et al 2013 siemens et al 2014 the air counterflow pattern during infiltration is vital to understanding and modeling the infiltration processes culligan et al 2000 hammecker et al 2003 siemens et al 2013 but up to now the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow pattern has been seldom studied through experiments evidence of air counterflow during infiltration was observed in the early studies of peck 1965 and jarrett and fritton 1978 in their confined sand columns later different factors such as air pressure and boundary conditions that affected air counterflow were investigated through experiments by some researchers culligan et al 2000 weeks 2002 siemens et al 2013 culligan et al 2000 investigated the effect of air pressure on air counterflow using capillary glass tubes and found out that a slight increase in air pressure at the base of the sand column could lead to a measurable change in air counterflow weeks 2002 investigated the airflow induced by intense rain on a large scale and noted that air counterflow happened when air pressure exceeded the water pressure by an amount equal to the bubbling pressure hb recently siemens et al 2013 conducted a series of experiments to study the effect of boundary condition on air counterflow and found that air counterflow was more evident when the lower boundary is closed besides boundary conditions and air pressure infiltration flux is also supposed to be an important factor affecting the air counterflow pattern but up to now the effect of infiltration flux on the patterns of air counterflow has been rarely investigated through experiments on the other hand the finger like infiltration front under air draining conditions has been studied theoretically and experimentally by previous researchers according to parlange and hill 1976 under air draining conditions the instability criterion could be simplified to iw ks the critical rate of iw ks means that the finger like wetting pattern happens when the infiltration rate is lower than the saturated conductivity of the medium under air confining conditions the infiltration process is significantly affected by air counterflow thus the impedance of the air phase below the wetting front cannot be neglected according to wang et al 1998 the instability criterion was supplemented to h0 hwb haf 0 under air confining conditions h0 surface water head hwb water bubbling value haf air pressure head however the relationship between air pressure haf and infiltration rate iw can be quite complex and at present the estimation of critical infiltration rate iw that leads to finger like infiltration patterns under air confining conditions has been seldom investigated thus more studies should be carried out to investigate the underlying process that will lead to finger like infiltration patterns under air confining conditions the main aim of this research is to study the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow through experiments in a 2 dimensional 2 d confined sand chamber to achieve this aim a series of experiments are carried out with different infiltration fluxes different air counterflow patterns are first observed through the light transmission method ltm air outflow volumes at different infiltration fluxes are compared to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air outflow rate the critical infiltration flux that will lead to finger like infiltration patterns is estimated based on the relative permeability of the working sand the effect of air pressure on air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes is also analyzed using the modified green ampt model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the arrangement of the experimental equipments is shown in fig 1 a infiltration experiments were conducted in a 2 d sand chamber 45 cm 55 cm 2 5 cm as shown in fig 1b and summarized in table 1 the 2 d sand chamber was made of a u shaped aluminum frame with two parallel glass plates attached to it the porous medium was placed between the two parallel glass plates as shown in fig 1c the sand chamber was placed between the light bank and the charge coupled device ccd camera ap2e apogee instruments auburn ca the light bank was the only light source of the system and was placed 5 cm away from the sand chamber the ccd camera was placed on the other side of the chamber the distance between the sand chamber and the camera was 1 5 m the light transmission image taken by the ccd camera had a spatial resolution of 1536 pixels 1024 pixels covering the entire chamber which gave approximately 0 17 mm2 per pixel resolution the software maxim dl ottawa on was used to record the images automatically at the top of the sand chamber five flat fan nozzles were installed to ensure uniform water application a peristaltic pump longer pump bt100 1f was used to provide water at a given flux in order to make the water flowing uniformly in out of the bottom of the sand chamber a slot 55 cm in length 1 0 cm in width and 0 5 cm in depth was placed at the bottom of the sand chamber a fine stainless mesh is put on the top of the slot to prevent the sand from dropping into the slot and two valves were located on the left and right end of the slot controlling water flowing in out of the sand chamber three manometers testo inc 510i differential pressure manometer were installed 15 cm above the bottom an additional manometer was installed 35 cm above the bottom to record the water head when the saturated conductivity was measured accusand silica sand unimin corporation in 20 30 grade was used as the porous medium in the experiments it was reported by schroth et al 1996 that the accusand silica sand had well defined hydrologic properties high batch to batch consistency and was available in large quantities furthermore the sand was made up of high purity sio2 and was thus suitable for light transmission experiments the sand was washed thoroughly using deionized water and then oven dried for 48 h at 45 c before packing wet packing procedure was employed to prevent possible preferential flow paths and sand was packed into the chamber in small increments with both tapping and shaking between each successive addition during the packing procedure the water table was always maintained between 1 cm and 2 cm above the sand surface the final height of the packed sand was 40 cm and the average bulk density was ρb 1 80 0 04 g cm3 according to schroth et al 1996 the particle density of the working sand was ρp 2 65 g cm3 the total porosity φ equaled 1 ρb ρp and was 0 32 0 02 cm3 cm3 in the experiments when the packing procedure was completed the working sand had been completely saturated by water the difference in water pressure head δhw was measured by manometers located 15 cm and 35 cm δl of 20 cm from the base of the sand chamber the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated using darcy s law i e ks q δhw δl 1 by applying different water fluxes q 1 ml min 10 ml min 30 ml min and 100 ml min at the bottom of the sand chamber ks of the working sand was calculated and the mean value of ks was calculated to be 0 25 0 04 cm s given that the dynamic viscosity of water μw equaled 1 01 10 3 pa s the water density ρw equaled 1000 kg m3 and the gravity acceleration g equaled 9 81 m s then the permeability ks of the working sand calculated by ksμw ρwg equaled 2 58 0 41 10 10 m2 to calculate the residual water saturation sr the sand chamber was drained completely and the mass of the outflow water mout was measured the residual water saturation was calculated by 1 s r φ m o u t ρ w v 0 φ where φ was the porosity of the working sand mout was the mass of the outflow water ρw was the density of water v0 was the total volume of the sand chamber the capillary properties and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k s of the working sand are described by the van genuchten mualem model and the relevant parameters are summarized in table 2 the relative water permeability of the working sand was estimated using the van genuchten mualem model parker et al 1987 2 k r w s w s ew 1 2 1 1 s ew 1 m m 2 where krw sw was the relative water permeability at the water saturation of sw sew was the effective water saturation given by sw swr sws swr swr and sws was the residual and full water saturation as listed in table 2 m 1 1 nvg and nvg was the van genuchten parameter in table 2 the relative air permeability was estimated using the kuang s model kuang and jiao 2011 3 k r a s w 1 s ew 1 2 1 s ew 1 m 4 m where kra sw was the relative air permeability at the water saturation of sw the calculated relative air water permeability of the working sand is shown in fig 2 2 2 experimental procedure in order to ensure that the distribution of air and water was the same among different infiltration experiments several steps were employed before each infiltration experiment the sand chamber was firstly drained completely by opening the valves at the bottom and the chamber was left to stand for 24 h the valves at the bottom were then closed and the chamber was infiltrated by a peristaltic pump through the five flat fan nozzles the flat fan nozzles could apply water along a straight line uniformly only when the total infiltration flux was larger than 600 ml min when the infiltration flux was larger than 1100 ml min the sand surface was quickly sealed by about 5 cm thick ponded water layer and thus 1100 ml min was set as the maximum infiltration flux in these experiments during the experiments light transmission images were taken by the ccd camera every 6 s and the exposure time was set to be 0 2 s during infiltration experiments the air saturation distribution under different infiltration flux was calculated using the light transmission image obtained by ltm 2 3 interpretation of the light transmission images the light transmission images were interpreted into air saturation distribution using the image processing algorithm proposed by niemet and selker 2001 a brief description of the image processing algorithm is presented here and the details of the interpretation method could be found in the study of wei et al 2018 because the sand chamber was filled up using wet packing procedure the working sand was completely saturated by water before the drainage began so air saturation of the sand chamber was equal to 0 sair 0 then the chamber was drained completely and left to stand for 24 h and the residual water saturation of the working sand was equal to 0 12 as presented in table 2 which indicated that the air saturation of the sand chamber should be 0 88 sair 0 88 the measured light intensity transmitted through the working sand satisfied 4 ln i a s air b 5 ln i a s air b 6 ln i a s air b where both a and b were constants determined by the working sand i was the light intensity measured during the infiltration experiments sair was the corresponding air saturation when the light intensity i was measured i was the light intensity measured at the end of packing under water saturated conditions when swater 1 and sair 0 and i was the light intensity measured at the very beginning of infiltration under residual water condition when swater 0 12 and sair 0 88 the values of constants a and b could be solved using eqs 4 and 5 taking the values of a and b into eq 6 or directly combining eqs 4 6 the air saturation sair could be calculated from the light intensity i measured by the ccd camera as follows 7 s a i r ln i ln i ln i ln i s a i r s a i r s e f f s s r e s 1 s r e s ln i l n i r e s ln i s l n i r e s s s r e s 1 s r e s ln i l n i r e s ln i s l n i r e s it should be mentioned that the light intensity measured by the ccd sensor was in the unit of grayscale instead of the absolute light intensity in the unit of candela in fact measuring the absolute values of light intensity could be quite expensive and time consuming on the other hand the light intensity measured by the ccd sensor was linearly correlated with the absolute light intensity thus the grayscale data was not converted into the absolute values of light intensity in this study during the experiment the minimum light intensity was 1250 grayscale measured under residual water condition and the maximum light intensity was around 2800 grayscale measured under water saturated condition the system errors of the data measured by ltm were evaluated to be within 7 and the random errors were evaluated to be within 3 in this air water system systematic measuring errors could be caused by several factors e g opaque boundaries blocking up the light near the boundaries additionally the sand was packed into the chamber from bottom to top which would inevitably make the sand at the bottom slightly denser than the sand at the top this gradual change in density would bring overall deviation to the inflow outflow volume measured by ltm because the density was assumed to be uniform throughout the chamber when the ltm images were interpreted the cumulative air outflow volume vout was calculated by the integration of change in air saturation throughout the sand chamber i e 8 v o u t φ v e 0 nz 0 nx s a i r t s a i r 0 where φ was the porosity of the working sand ve was element volume of an ltm pixel nz was the number of rows in the ltm image nx was the number of columns in the ltm image s a i r t was the measured air saturation at time t and s a i r 0 was the initial air saturation as air flowed out from the sand chamber continuously the value of vout increased with time if the air outflow rate remained stable then the slope k of vout t lines represented the air outflow rate at each infiltration flux and in this study was obtained through linear regression 3 results and discussion 3 1 qualitative analysis of air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes 3 1 1 the relationship between air pressure and air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes because the air pressure measured by the three manometers was quite close to each other the mean air pressure was used it could be seen from fig 3 a and b that at low infiltration fluxes 600 ml min and 800 ml min air pressure increased slightly from 0 to 20 mmh2o and the slight increase in air pressure had little impact on air counterflow while at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min fig 3c air pressure increased significantly from around 20 mmh2o to 140 mmh2o at t 66 s and the air outflow was retarded the similar phenomenon could also be seen in fig 3d at t 18 s the significant increase in air pressure was associated with the formation of a ponded water layer at the top of the working sand at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min ponded water layer appeared at t 66 s while at the infiltration flux of 1100 ml min ponded water layer appeared at t 18 s it should be mentioned that if the impedance of air phase was not considered the ponding infiltration flux could be estimated as the product of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and infiltration area a which equaled 2062 5 ml min however the critical infiltration flux observed in this study was between 800 ml min and 1000 ml min which was quite smaller than the flux of 2062 5 ml min estimated by ksa the difference between the estimated flux and experimental observations indicated that the effect of air phase could not be ignored under the experimental conditions the accurate critical infiltration flux will be estimated in section 3 2 1 when the effect of air phase is taken into consideration it could be inferred that when the ponded water layer appeared the air in the sand chamber was isolated from the atmosphere and was pressurized below the wetting front as air was pressurized the infiltration front was impeded by the pressurized air and thus the water inflow air outflow was retarded as observed in fig 3c and d 3 1 2 the air outflow rate at different infiltration fluxes it could be seen in fig 4 that when a relatively low infiltration flux was imposed 600 ml min and 800 ml min the cumulative air outflow volume increased steadily and the slope of the trend line remained consistent during the whole infiltration when a higher infiltration flux was imposed 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min an obvious turning point was observed the slope of the trend line decreased significantly when the infiltration time approached 66 s qw 1000 ml min and 18 s qw 1100 ml min as mentioned in section 2 3 the slope k of the trend lines in fig 4 represented the air outflow rate at each infiltration flux thus it could be inferred from fig 4 that at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min the air outflow rate decreased as the infiltration proceeded to better analyze the relationship between air outflow rate and infiltration flux linear regression was employed here to obtain the slope k of the trend lines as shown in fig 4 the fitted slope k i e air outflow rate and fit quality r2 was presented in table 3 it could be seen in table 3 that when a relatively low infiltration flux was imposed 600 ml min and 800 ml min the air outflow rate was 709 0 ml min and 741 0 ml min respectively and the air outflow rate remained stable during the whole infiltration the imbalance in q and k could be attributed to air pressurization and measurement errors when infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min the air outflow rate was 941 1 ml min and 1072 9 ml min respectively at the beginning of infiltration and the air outflow rate suddenly decreased to 768 2 ml min and 517 2 ml min when infiltration time approached 66 s and 18 s respectively the decrease in air outflow rate at high infiltration flux could be explained by the sealing of the outflow paths above the wetting front under air confining conditions the only path for air escaping was upward through the sand surface however when the infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min or 1100 ml min the outflow paths above the wetting front was sealed by water the sealing of the outflow paths prevented air from flowing out of the sand chamber freely causing a significant decrease in air outflow rate at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min as seen in table 3 the results presented in fig 4 and table 3 implied that when the infiltration flux was smaller than 800 ml min the air outflow rate increased with infiltration flux while as the infiltration flux was larger than 1000 ml min the air outflow rate decreased with increasing infiltration flux when the outflow paths were sealed by water thus air was confined below the wetting front and could lead to concentrated air counterflow on the wetting front at high infiltration flux 3 1 3 air counterflow patterns at different infiltration fluxes the air saturation distribution at different infiltration fluxes was presented in fig 5 for clarity in the following discussion the zones where air saturation sair changed quickly from 0 5 to 0 7 was referred to as the wetting front from fig 5a c and d f it could be seen that when the infiltration flux was lower than 800 ml min the wetting front zone was relatively sharp when the infiltration flux increased to 1000 ml min the wetting front zone became wavy in the later stage fig 5i as the infiltration flux increased to 1100 ml min fig 5j l especially fig 5l the air fingers started to develop and made the wetting front more diffusive as the infiltration continued the sharp wetting front at low infiltration flux meant that the water infiltrated into the sand steadily and uniformly with little impedance so air saturation changed quickly from sair 0 7 to sair 0 5 however when the infiltration flux was larger than 1000 ml min fig 5g i and j l air counterflow was no longer neglectable because water infiltration was retarded in the later stage as water infiltration was retarded the wetting front became broader vertically and air bubbles were observed on the sand surface at the locations where air fingers appeared comparing fig 5j with l it could be easily found out that the wetting front was much broader at the end of infiltration than at the beginning of infiltration it could be concluded from fig 5 that as infiltration flux increased from 600 ml min to 1100 ml min air counterflow was enhanced leading to a more unstable wetting front as reported in the literature white et al 1977 wang et al 1998 li et al 2008 the instability of the wetting front could be induced by air counterflow according to wang et al 1998 as air counterflow happened the wetting front was deformed from the very beginning of infiltration with a wetting tip moving much more rapidly than the wetting tail which was consistent with the observations in our experiments at high infiltration flux fig 5g l while in our experiments at low infiltration flux fig 5a f the air upflow seemed uniform and no finger like flow pattern was observed it could be found in fig 5 that the air upflow was quite uniform at low infiltration flux and the finger like flow pattern only happened when the infiltration flux was high enough the underlying process responsible for finger like wetting patterns is analyzed quantitatively in the section 3 2 1 below from the above discussion several findings can be summarized firstly the air pressure increased significantly at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min and 1100 ml min the significant increase in air pressure was attributed to the ponded water layer on the sand surface secondly as infiltration flux exceed 800 ml min the water inflow air outflow rate could be retarded significantly by air counterflow the process of air counterflow is vital to understanding and modeling the infiltration processes if the effect of air counterflow is not considered the infiltration rate could be overpredicted leading to significant error in surface runoff modeling thirdly the air counterflow became more concentrated as infiltration flux increases and could lead to a more unstable wetting front stability of the wetting front is a key problem for irrigation as the finger like wetting pattern may enhance leaching of water and agrochemicals beyond the depth of root uptake such wetting pattern not only wastes water resources but also contaminates groundwater by agrochemicals according to the experimental results shorter irrigation intervals with lower infiltration flux is preferred in order to avoid the finger like wetting pattern in order to make the experimental findings more sound two other sets of infiltration tests have been carried out using finer sands in 30 40 grade and 40 50 grade the effect of high infiltration rates on airflow in finer sands appear similar to the results in the sand of 20 30 grade and the results are summarized in the supplementary material 3 2 quantitative analysis of air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes 3 2 1 the estimation of the critical infiltration flux if the water inflow air outflow is uniform the wetting front should be horizontally flat and vertically sharp with a uniform air saturation above the wetting front thus based on the estimated relative air water permeability in fig 2 the uniform air outflow water inflow flux could be estimated using darcy s law i e 9 q a s air a k k ra μ a δ p a ρ a g δ l δ l q w s air a k k rw μ w δ p w ρ w g δ l δ l where qa sair is the uniform air outflow flux and qw sair is the uniform water inflow flux a is the cross section area of the sand chamber k is the permeability of the working sand kra is the relative air permeability above the wetting front and krw is the relative water permeability above the wetting front both kra and krw are the functions of sair μa is the dynamic viscosity of air and equals 1 98 10 5 pa s μw is the dynamic viscosity of water and equals 1 01 10 3 pa s δpa ρa g δl δl is the gradient of total air pressure and is assumed to be ρwg under gravity induced infiltration this is a fair assumption when the infiltration flux is relatively low and no ponded water layer is observed on the sand surface δpw ρw g δl δl is the gradient of total water pressure it can be seen in fig 6 that as sair decreases qa becomes smaller while qw becomes larger as sair decreases the cross sectional area available for air outflow also decreases while the cross sectional area available for water inflow increases making the water inflow easier and the air outflow more difficult however if the compression of air volume is not considered the water inflow volume should be the same as air outflow volume thus the actual infiltration flux is limited by the smaller one of qa and qw which is shown as the bold red line in fig 6 as presented in fig 6 the peak value of the bold red line is around 800 ml min the peak value of 800 ml min means that the maximum infiltration flux that can be approached under the condition of uniform water inflow air outflow is 800 ml min which is consistent with the observations in fig 5 it can also be seen from fig 6 that the infiltration flux approaches its maximum value at the air saturation of around 0 3 which is consistent with the value of air saturation observed in fig 5a f above the wetting front the estimated qc and sair yield a good approximation of the experimental results indicating that the assumptions of uniform water inflow air outflow in the sand chamber should be true when the infiltration flux is lower than qc it can also be found out from fig 6 that when the water inflow flux is larger than 800 ml min the air below the wetting front cannot flow out at the same rate as water inflow thus the air will be sealed below the wetting front of the infiltration water at high infiltration flux leading to the pressurization of the air below the wetting front when the air pressure increases over a significant value pa 100 mmh2o as observed in fig 3 in this study the pressurized air phase breaks through the sealing wetting front and flows out through the air fingers where sair is generally larger than 0 5 as observed in fig 5 it can be seen in fig 6 that when sair is larger than 0 4 the air outflow flux increases dramatically with sair which means that these fingers can transport the air phase quite efficiently the occurrence of these fingers leads to a significant increase in air outflow capacity so the air pressure quickly levels off after the breakthrough of these fingers as seen in fig 3 3 2 2 the effect of air pressurization on air counterflow when the infiltration flux is larger than qc ponded water layer will appear on the sand surface thus the assumption of δp δl ρwg in section 3 2 1 is no longer valid and the air outflow rate should be described by the modified green ampt model wang et al 1997 siemens et al 2013 10 i a k s a i r z h w b h 0 h a f z where ia is the air outflow rate k sair is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and is associated with the air saturation sair above the wetting front z is the depth of the wetting front hwb is the water entry value and equals 0 5 αvg as suggested by bouwer 1966 h0 is the water head at the surface and equals the thickness of the ponded water layer haf is the air pressure below the wetting front as reflected in eq 10 the air outflow rate generally decreases as air pressure head haf increases however if air pressure head is much smaller than the depth of wetting front i e haf z 1 the effect of haf on ia is neglectable from fig 7 it can be inferred that when haf z 0 3 the effect of air pressurization on infiltration could be neglected that s why the slight increase in air pressure had little impact on air counterflow as seen in fig 3a and 3b on the other hand as the haf increased significantly and was comparable to the value of z i e t 18 s at the infiltration flux of 1100 ml min and t 66 s at the infiltration flux of 1000 ml min the air outflow rate decreased significantly as shown in fig 3c and d several findings can be summarized from the quantitative analysis of the air counterflow at different infiltration fluxes under air confining conditions firstly the water inflow air outflow is uniform only when the infiltration flux is smaller than the critical flux qc the critical flux qc can be estimated according to the relative air water permeability of the medium secondly the occurrence of finger like infiltration pattern can be attributed to the breakthrough of the pressurized air below the wetting front thirdly the effect of air pressurization on infiltration should only be taken into consideration when the air pressure head is comparable to the depth of the wetting front it should be mentioned that the compression of air volume was not considered in this study according to the clapeyron equation the relative change of air volume due to pressurization was 1 45 δv v0 δp patm 150 mmh2o 10 336 mmh2o throughout the experiment further studies should be carried out to examine the validity of these estimation methods in other conditions e g heterogeneous medium when the change of air pressure may be more significant and the compression of air volume could not be neglected 4 conclusions in this study experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow under air confining conditions the concentrated air counterflow at high infiltration flux was observed using ltm at high infiltration flux air pressure increased significantly and led to a significant decrease in air outflow rate as infiltration flux increased the wetting front became more unstable and the finger like wetting pattern appeared at the infiltration flux of 1100 ml min for the working sand in 20 30grade the critical infiltration flux of 800 ml min was estimated based on the relative air water permeability of the working sand the estimation process indicated that the occurrence of finger like air outflow pattern was caused by the sealing of infiltrating wetting front it could be inferred from the modified green ampt model that the impedance of air counterflow should be considered during infiltration when the change of air pressure was comparable to the depth of the wetting front from the experimental results it can be generally concluded that the air pressurization at high infiltration flux could cause finger like air outflow patterns and a substantial decrease in soil infiltration capacity resulting in problems of practical concern such as large runoff soil erosion and the waste of irrigation water the experimental results from this study might be instructional for irrigation system design and surface runoff modeling except for the infiltration flux some other factors such as particle size and medium heterogeneity can also affect air counterflow during infiltration and more work should be conducted to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the air counterflow during infiltration processes conflict of interest none acknowledgments we would express our deepest gratitude

downscaled ensembles of future climate variables derived from climate models for this purpose we present a methodology to re parameterize the awe gen 2d model advanced weather generator for a two dimensional grid the model simulates key meteorological variables needed by hydrological models and is particularly suitable to explore the effects of stochastic natural climatic uncertainty which is fundamental for hydrological applications especially at sub kilometer and hourly scales factors of change for different climate statistics are calculated from climate model simulations of present and

stochastic uncertainty is examined for present and future periods and for spatial scales from the rcm scale 12 km daily to 2 km demonstrating the potential use of awe gen 2d outputs at the rcm scale model results yield a small increase in annual precipitation 4 which is within the stochastic uncertainty range for present and future periods 7 at the fine scale of 2 km the increase in annual precipitation can exceed the stochastic uncertainty but for less than 10 of the domain area on the contrary changes in annual near surface air temperature exceed stochastic uncertainty both at the rcm and finer scales stochastic climate uncertainty was concluded to be very similar when comparing present and future periods and 12 km and 2 km scales the benefits of using awe gen 2d in hydrological climate change impact assessments are finally discussed keywords weather generator stochastic downscaling climate change internal climate variability climate uncertainty high resolution rainfall model 1 introduction the effects of climate change on hydrology are important as they might impose changes to the hydrological cycle and water resources at regional and local scales that exceed the historical natural variability ipcc 2018 hydrological models of different complexity are commonly used to explore and quantify these effects the typical procedure is to feed the hydrological model with climate variable inputs that are derived directly or indirectly from general circulation models gcms or regional climate models rcms burlando and rosso 2002 christensen et al 2004 xu 1999 xu et al 2005 the demand from policymakers to provide more targeted assessments of local climate impacts generates a need for climate projections at higher spatial and temporal resolution than delivered from gcms and most rcms kerr 2011 fatichi et al 2016a data from gcms and rcms are most often downscaled to match the spatial and temporal resolution required by the hydrological model fowler et al 2007 wilby and wigley 1997 wood et al 2004 and or bias corrected to fit the observations in the region of interest ehret et al 2012 peleg et al 2015a teutschbein and seibert 2012 there are three general types of downscaling methods dynamical statistical and stochastic fowler et al 2007 hewitson and crane 1996 maraun et al 2010 murphy 1999 in dynamical downscaling rcms are forced with boundary conditions derived from gcms to solve the physics of the climate system at a finer spatial and temporal resolution than the parent model in a given sub domain giorgi 1990 1995 giorgi and mearns 1991 while dynamical downscaling is robust and physically sound it has a fundamental limitation as it requires massive computational resources long running times and expertise in setting and running the models gutmann et al 2016 leutwyler et al 2016 prein et al 2015 this limitation has made this approach historically less appealing for most hydrologists statistical downscaling methods fealy and sweeney 2007 fowler et al 2000 katz 1996 jakob themeßl et al 2011 wilby and wigley 1997 such as linear regression bias correction and quantile mapping link gcm or rcm outputs predictors directly to local variables of interest predictants using some statistical methodology contrary to dynamical downscaling they are parsimonious in terms of computational cost and do not require specific expertise other than common statistical knowledge therefore statistical downscaling methods have been particularly popular for generating climate forcing subsequently used for hydrological climate impacts e g teutschbein and seibert 2012 a variant of statistical downscaling is stochastic downscaling and its general concept is to randomize the relation between predictors and predictants to account for natural climate variability together with the climate change signal an important issue in hydrological climate impact studies is the assessment of future uncertainties the uncertainty in climate is composed of three main sources emission scenario uncertainty climate model uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty also known as internal or natural climate variability for further discussion see e g deser et al 2012a fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2009 emission scenario uncertainty reflects the poor knowledge of the future trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions that depends on socio economic projections meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 climate model uncertainty is related to the different responses of gcms or rcms used to simulate the future climate for a given emission scenario the uncertainty emerges partially from the numerical approximations and parameterizations schemes used to describe the physical processes involved within the models and largely from the representation of sub grid scale physical processes slingo and palmer 2011 stochastic uncertainty originates from the chaotic nature of the climate system deser et al 2012a and is due to variations that are directly driven by a purely periodic external forcing variations due to the non linear interplay of feedbacks within the climate system and variations associated with random fluctuations in physical or chemical factors in the atmosphere ghil 2002 it is vital to understand how climate uncertainty is partitioned into these sources and indeed many past studies proposed different approaches to tackle this issue e g deser et al 2012a 2012b fatichi et al 2016a 2016b hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 hingray and said 2014 olonscheck and notz 2017 considering for example the dependency or independency between climate variables stationary and nonstationary assumptions various spatial and temporal scales and analyses for average climate or extremes the first two sources of climate uncertainty can be quantified when more than one emission scenario and several climate trajectories derived from different climate models are available the climate model uncertainty can also be quantified based on the assumptions simplifications and limitations of the climate models conversely to compute the stochastic uncertainty an ensemble composed of multiple realizations representing the same climate model and emission scenario is required the rationale is that each climate realization in the ensemble is a potential outcome with the same probability as the other realizations which differ from each other due to the chaotic nature of climate for example the future period of 2070 2099 can be represented by an ensemble that is composed of 50 or 100 realizations corresponding to a specific climate change trajectory each one 30 years long the stochastic uncertainty for a given climate variable in such a future can be computed with the median value of all ensemble members and a percentile range obtained from the 50 or 100 realizations e g fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2011 this operation can be repeated for different climate variables different levels of temporal aggregation e g hourly daily and various statistics e g mean variance of a given variable the impacts of considering stochastic uncertainty were explored in hydrological studies that estimated future reservoir levels fatichi et al 2015 future streamflow addor et al 2014 camici et al 2017 giuntoli et al 2018 peleg et al 2015b and urban flows peleg et al 2017a generally the relative contribution of stochastic uncertainty to the total uncertainty increases as finer spatial scales are considered fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2011 e g when exploring hydrological climate impacts over medium 102 103 km2 to small 102 km2 catchments and when precipitation is the variable of interest therefore it is advisable to generate multiple realizations when downscaling climate variables from gcms or rcms dynamical downscaling could be used to generate multiple realizations at the catchment scale but this option is not yet convenient due to the large computational costs also statistical downscaling methods in their basic structure i e with deterministic relations between predictors and predictants do not allow a direct exploration of the stochastic uncertainty stochastic downscaling is often performed using stochastic models of simple climatic variables typically precipitation and temperature e g bordoy and burlando 2014 burlando and rosso 1991 wasko and sharma 2017 or using weather generators wg see fatichi et al 2011 fowler et al 2005 2007 kilsby et al 2007 peleg et al 2017b semenov and barrow 1997 wilks and wilby 1999 which have been widely applied in hydrological studies e g camici et al 2017 caracciolo et al 2014 fatichi et al 2015 park and kim 2014 paschalis et al 2014 peleg and morin 2014 peleg et al 2015b singer and michaelides 2017 singer et al 2018 wheater et al 2005 and many more wgs simulate time series for a given climate variable for the present climate in the downscaling approach statistics for the present climate are modified to reproduce the statistics of a given future climate exploiting the change in statistics between the two periods that are obtained from gcms or rcms e g fatichi et al 2011 2013 most wgs are designed as single or multi site tools simulating the climate variables at a daily resolution e g hutchinson 1995 keller et al 2015 park et al 2018 climate time series at this resolution are adequate for certain hydrological applications especially if large catchments are examined and lumped or semi distributed hydrological models are used e g teutschbein et al 2011 however the increased availability and use of distributed hydrological models in the context of climate change impact analyses fatichi et al 2015 2016b perra et al 2018 and the importance of addressing the spatial variability of extremes generate a need for climate projections at higher spatial and temporal resolution the requirement for high space time resolutions was recently met by a new stochastic wg named awe gen 2d peleg et al 2017b that simulates key climate variables that are needed as input into hydrological models in a gridded form at resolutions as high as 100 m 100 m and 10 min in this manuscript we introduce a methodology for using awe gen 2d as a tool to downscale future climate variables e g precipitation and near surface air temperature by modifying the parameters of awe gen 2d that were calibrated using observed data for the present climate with information derived from rcm simulations awe gen 2d is intended to satisfy the hydrologists needs in generating multiple realizations of a given climate at a spatial and temporal resolution that is adequate for hydrological modeling purposes we discuss the assumptions advantages capabilities and limitations of using awe gen 2d as a non stationary simulator to downscale climate variables for a transient climate period in addition we use awe gen 2d to explore the role of stochastic uncertainty at different spatial scales the rcm scale 13 13 km2 and a finer 2 2 km2 scale last we discuss the importance of using a high resolution gridded stochastic downscaling method when making hydrological predictions at local spatial scales awe gen 2d is briefly described in the following section and its re parameterization scheme is presented thereafter the re parameterization the simulation of a future downscaled ensemble of climate projections and the analysis of the stochastic uncertainty is demonstrated for the engelberg region a mountainous area in the swiss alps 2 methods 2 1 awe gen 2d model awe gen 2d advanced weather generator for a 2 dimensional grid peleg et al 2017b is a stochastic weather generator that simulates gridded climate variables at high spatial sub kilometer and temporal sub daily resolutions it is a substantial evolution of the 1 dimensional awe gen model fatichi et al 2011 ivanov et al 2007 and was further developed using methods from three preceding models i streap paschalis et al 2013 ii hires wg peleg and morin 2014 and iii winds burlando et al 2007 awe gen 2d simulates key climate variables that are needed for hydrological ecological and agricultural applications e g precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity using a combination of stochastic and process based methods a brief description of how the model simulates key hydrological variables precipitation cloud cover and near surface air temperature is provided in the following paragraphs for further details the reader is referred to peleg et al 2017b precipitation fields are simulated in three stages first a temporal sequence of dry and wet spells affecting the entire domain is defined using an alternating renewal process peleg and morin 2014 in which the wet dry durations are sampled from specific probability distributions and are mutually independent second a gaussian stochastic process with a covariance function belonging to the whittle matern class gneiting et al 2010 is used for the simulation of the areal statistics of precipitation and cloud cover for each wet period these are the wet area ratio the mean areal precipitation intensity and the cloud area ratio these three variables are auto and cross correlated and thus have to be simulated as a tri variate stochastic process third the time series of wet area ratio and mean areal precipitation intensity are transformed into precipitation intensity fields paschalis et al 2013 for that two dimensional intermittent gaussian fields correlated in space and time are simulated using a fast fourier transform fft method lang and potthoff 2011 the generated precipitation intensity fields are treated as continuous in space between the east west and south north boundaries due to the symmetries of the fft paschalis et al 2013 this property is exploited to simulate advection of the fields a bi variate autoregressive model schneider and neumaier 2001 is used to simulate time series of the advection speed and direction velocities along the east west and south north components two spatial filters are applied to the precipitation fields peleg et al 2017b the first filter allows precipitation occurrence to be heterogeneous in space meaning it is used to generate regions in the field where precipitation occurrence is higher or lower than average the second filter adjust the probability distribution of precipitation intensity for each grid cell based on a generalized pareto gp distribution i e allowing spatial heterogeneity in precipitation intensity during a wet spell the cloudiness and precipitation intensity fields are assumed to be cross correlated meaning that the intermittent gaussian fields are used for the generation of both precipitation and cloud fields during a dry spell mean cloudiness in the domain is simulated through an autoregressive moving average model with a structure that forces the cloudiness to decay as a function of the time passed since the end of the previous wet spell and to increase toward the beginning of the next wet spell fatichi et al 2011 the johnson distribution johnson 1949 is used to transform the autoregressive moving average model outputs into a time series of cloud area ratio near surface air temperature is first simulated for a given reference level as the sum of a 1st order autoregressive model with a stochastic term and a deterministic component curtis and eagleson 1982 fatichi et al 2011 ivanov et al 2007 peleg et al 2017b and is then spatially distributed using a stochastic lapse rate the deterministic component is represented by the time derivative of air temperature which is a function of the air temperature itself the incoming longwave radiation which is dependent on cloud cover juszak and pellicciotti 2013 and the hourly position of the sun eagleson 2005 effects of shading in the terrain i e when the surface is shadowed by surrounding terrain are also accounted for chen et al 2006 dubayah and loechel 1997 further details about awe gen 2d can be found in the technical reference of the model peleg et al 2017b 2 2 re parameterizing awe gen 2d for the future climate awe gen 2d can be used to generate multiple realizations of future climate the approach to this end consists of re parameterizing several of the parameters of awe gen 2d listed in table 1 that were estimated from observed data the new parameters are based on modified climate statistics inferred from climate model outputs gcms or rcms and are considered representative of the future climate the approach downscales key climate variables that were simulated by climate models at their original spatial and temporal resolutions i e 101 102 km and daily to much finer resolution e g 100 km and hourly as it is often the case for climate downscaling this approach is based on the unverifiable assumptions that gcms and rcms changes in climate statistics are robust signals of climate change and that the weather generator structure is transferring those changes into finer resolutions accurately the factors of change fc approach anandhi et al 2011 bordoy and burlando 2014 burlando and rosso 1991 fatichi et al 2011 kilsby et al 2007 is used for the re parameterization of awe gen 2d the fc approach was chosen as it allows consideration of changes in the long term mean as well as changes in higher order statistics and accounts for seasonality fc are obtained by computing the difference between statistics of climate variables from a control realization and a future realization originated from a specific gcm or rcm the control realization con is the period for which both observed data and climate model simulations are available while the future realization fut is the period for which only climate model simulations are available fc can be applied at finer temporal scales than the scale of the original climate model with the due attention to scale dependency and breaks in the higher order statistics marani 2005 bordoy and burlando 2014 fc can be a product factor e g for precipitation statistics in such a case the ratio between statistics for fut and con realizations are used to modify the observed statistics as 1 s h v fut s h v clm f u t s h v clm c o n s h v obs where s is a statistical property e g mean h is the time aggregation e g daily the subscript v is the climate variable e g precipitation the superscript fut and con denote future and control realizations respectively clm denotes the climate model rcm or gcm and obs denotes the observed data alternatively fc can be an additive factor also known as δ change e g for temperature statistics in such a case the difference between statistics for fut and con realizations are used to modify the observed statistics as 2 s h v fut s h v obs s h v clm f u t s h v clm c o n with the same notations as above fc can theoretically be applied to every statistic of climate variables simulated by a climate model and used by awe gen 2d for the parameter estimation however at present the re parameterization is applied only for a limited number of statistics characterizing the simulated cloud cover precipitation and near surface air temperature table 1 as these climate variables are among conventional outputs available from gcms and rcms and are arguably the most important for hydrological simulations additionally once these climate variables are re parameterized in awe gen 2d other variables are indirectly affected due to the dependencies between variables that are implemented in the model peleg et al 2017b for example cloud cover controls the incoming shortwave radiation and solar radiation and near surface air temperature influence vapor pressure the fc are calculated in this study on a 3 monthly basis to include the effects of intra annual seasonality but we note that they can be applied in several ways depending on the specific local climatology and on the research question in mind for example the model can be used to simulate a given climate trajectory by using fc that are obtained from a specific climate model as demonstrated in the experiments described below or it can be used to simulate a multi model ensemble by using a statistical approach e g a bayesian framework see fatichi et al 2011 tebaldi et al 2005 xu et al 2018 to sample the fc obtained from multiple climate models in the following paragraphs details of the re parameterization of different components of awe gen 2d are provided the precipitation occurrence filter can be re parameterized for a future climate if rcm results are available at a relatively high resolution e g with a spatial resolution of 15 km or finer occurrence statistics are calculated for con and fut periods from the climate models and are linearly interpolated in space to match the grid cell resolution of awe gen 2d an additive fc is then applied to define the occurrence filter for fut period concurrently the gp distributions describing the precipitation intensity filter are re parameterized for the future climate using product fc the fc for the mean and variance of the precipitation intensities are calculated in each cell of the rcm interpolated spatially and applied to the observed statistics in such a way the parameters of the gp distributions are re estimated the parameters of the johnson distribution that simulates the cloud cover during dry spells is re parameterized for the future climate using product fc as the johnson distribution has more parameters than gp we use higher order statistics to fit the new parameters and reduce the uncertainty of the fit the fc for the mean standard deviation kurtosis and skewness of the cloud area ratio for the dry spells are calculated from rcm results and applied to the observed statistics the parameters of the johnson distribution are then re fitted an additive fc δt t is used to modify near surface air temperature for the future climate this is applied directly to the mean near surface air temperature over the entire domain 2 3 re parameterizing statistics based on observed natural variability the wet and dry spells are simulated in awe gen 2d using a renewal process at a temporal resolution hourly that is finer than the temporal resolution of data saved in most gcms and rcms simulations daily therefore the parameters of the probability distributions used to simulate future wet dry sequences cannot be directly re parameterized by using information derived from the climate models this means that we cannot use the fc approach for re parameterizing the alternating renewal process for the future climate instead we rely on observations and assume that climate change signals in the statistics of future wet dry spells can be represented by the current variability of the observed wet dry spells changes in the occurrence and duration of wet and dry spells were reported by many studies dealing with future climates heinrich and gobiet 2012 peleg et al 2015a svoboda et al 2016 and projected changes in the sequences of future wet and dry spells are in most cases comparable to the observed natural variability e g peleg et al 2015a to compute the observed variability in wet dry spells a bootstrap method efron 1979 is used bootstrapping has been applied many times in the past to analyze natural variability e g alexander and arblaster 2009 marra et al 2017 peleg et al 2018 if the observed wet dry sample is large enough e g 30 year of data it can be resampled with replacement on an annual scale meaning that a wet dry sequence of a given year can appear several times in the new sample or not at all once the new sample of wet dry sequences is generated new statistics and parameters for the probability distribution can be calculated in this way we consider the new set of parameters to represent a possible change in climate as we assume that the climate change signal impossible to compute from climate models is contained within the natural variability of the historical period then the stochastic nature of awe gen 2d superposes a stochastic variability on top of this climate change signal as done for climate change signals directly derived through fc e g mean air temperature section 2 2 3 case study 3 1 study area the engelberg region swiss alps 8 48 e 46 88 n was chosen as a case study to demonstrate awe gen 2d abilities to simulate an ensemble of climate variables for the period 2020 2089 and to discuss stochastic uncertainty over a typical size of a rcm grid cell the domain scale of engelberg area is 13 13 km2 and at the local grid scale 2 2 km2 or less that is simulated using awe gen 2d the region is characterized by complex topography with elevation ranging between 404 and 3119 m above sea level fig 1 we used awe gen 2d to simulate multiple climate variables for this region precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity of which only precipitation and near surface air temperature are discussed in the manuscript the other climate variables are presented exclusively in the supplementary material awe gen 2d was previously calibrated and validated for this region for present climate conditions peleg et al 2017b with 30 years of observations or more according to the climatic variable the wet and dry spell statistics the spatial distribution of precipitation intensity and the variability of precipitation at different scales were examined along with the diurnal cycle of near surface air temperature daily maximum mean and minimum temperature values and spatial distribution of temperature it was concluded that precipitation cloud cover which is a closely related variable to precipitation and near surface air temperature variables are generated by awe gen 2d with a high level of accuracy sufficient for most hydrological applications peleg et al 2017b the validation of the other climate variables is discussed in section s1 supplementary material the ability of awe gen 2d to simulate the natural climate variability of precipitation and temperature at different temporal scales over the domain is further examined here fig 2 an ensemble of meteorological variables hourly resolution made of 30 realizations of 30 years each was simulated with awe gen 2d and compared to an ensemble of the same dimension generated by bootstrapping the observed data but with daily resolution the median and the 5th and 95th percentiles a measure of variability of daily precipitation for the 30 year period were calculated for each individual realization and later averaged observed and simulated data were aggregated to weekly monthly and annual scales and the natural climate variability was computed at each scale an identical methodology was applied to the near surface air temperature data the model satisfactory reproduces the natural climate variability at the daily to monthly scales both for precipitation difference between the observed and simulated 5th 95th range are 2 3 mm at most and temperature 1 5 c fig 2 at the annual scale the 5th 95th range of the simulated natural climate variability for precipitation is larger by 24 6 mm or 3 4 in comparison to the observed range and smaller by 1 3 c 50 for temperature the latter problem is expected and known as overdispersion fatichi et al 2011 katz and parlange 1998 for temperature the model simulates the periodic external forces such as diurnal cycle and seasonality but is not able to account for variations in the climate system due to large scale circulation patterns e g variations in ocean heat content or persistent anomalies in a given region that can modify considerably annual means a similar issue should be expected for precipitation as well if not properly addressed fatichi et al 2011 but it is not evident from the obtained results most of the climatic data for this region were supplied by the swiss federal office for meteorology and climatology meteoswiss and from the merra re analysis rienecker et al 2011 data products details can be found in www meteoswiss admin ch include weather radar observations gridded data products of precipitation and temperature rhiresd and tabsy and classic meteorological ground stations swissmetnet fig 1 further details on the data used to calibrate and validate awe gen 2d for present climate conditions and their sources can be found in peleg et al 2017b 3 2 climate models and factors of change five rcms from the euro cordex initiative giorgi et al 2009 kotlarski et al 2014 prein et al 2016 were chosen for the re parameterization of awe gen 2d for future climate conditions table 2 the chosen rcms have daily temporal resolution and spatial resolution of about 12 km 0 11 the five models correspond to different gcm rcm chains chosen to minimize the potential effect of interdependence between climate models knutti et al 2013 on the multi model ensemble for the presented case study only the rcp8 5 emission scenario characterized by the largest increase in global temperature and greenhouse gas concentration meinshausen et al 2011 is considered cloud cover precipitation and near surface air temperature variables for the historical 1970 2005 and future 2006 2100 periods were used fc table 1 were calculated over the rcms grid and then they were spatially interpolated to the cartesian grid of awe gen 2d using a 2 dimensional linear interpolation fig 3 the fc were calculated on seasonal basis for each decade using a 30 year moving time window since 30 years are necessary for computing statistics see further explanation in section 4 the fc for precipitation statistics were computed for changes in the mean fig 4 occurrence fig s1 and standard deviation fig s2 differences are evident between decades and among the five climate models in general changes are more prominent toward the end of the century for all statistics the spatial pattern of the fc of precipitation mean fig 4 and standard deviation fig s2 is quite similar there is however no consensus between climate models when fc of precipitation mean fig 4 and occurrence fig s1 are jointly considered for example both fc of precipitation mean computed from mpi and knmi models for jja for the end of the century are indicating a general reduction in precipitation intensity while the fc of precipitation occurrence are pointing to both a decrease mpi or increase knmi seasonally the fc of precipitation mean are sometimes found to be larger than 1 25 clmcom djf end of the century or smaller than 0 80 mpi jja end of the century but at the annual scale the fc of precipitation mean are rarely exceeding the 10 range no clear trends were found for cloud cover changes for both near 2020 2029 or far 2089 2089 futures fig 5 the fc for cloud cover mean are changing between seasons climate models or decades but without any apparent pattern most fc for cloud cover mean were found to be within a 5 range thus making it impossible to judge if the difference represents a climate change signal or it is stochastic noise fc derived from the clmcom climate model yield a substantial cloud cover reduction by the end of the century e g 10 and 22 reduction in cloud cover mean for son and jja respectively however these results were considered unrealistic for example bartók et al 2017 indicated that changes in annual cloud cover for this region do not exceed 8 and these fc values were omitted for the subsequent re parameterization of awe gen 2d a clear signal of increase in near surface air temperature is projected from all models as evident from the fc for temperature mean fig 6 the spread in fc is relatively high for the end of the century and changes in temperature range between 2 75 c dmi model and 4 5 c smhi model when computing the fc at the annual scale model spread in fc is higher for djf and mam in comparison to jja and son 4 experimental setup weather generators can be used to simulate future climate scenarios for a long continuous period non stationary approach considering the transient nature of the climate change signals e g blenkinsop et al 2013 burton et al 2010 glenis et al 2015 or to simulate a given period usually 20 30 years long under the assumption of stationarity i e considering that the climate change signal is constant during this period e g camici et al 2014 fatichi et al 2013 2015 peleg et al 2015b singer and michaelides 2017 singer et al 2018 two experiments were conducted for the case study area in the first experiment a transient multi model ensemble was generated for the period 2020 2089 the fc are calculated based on a 30 year moving window a typical interval used to define climatological values according to the world meteorological organization and are updated every decade fig 7 each decade is simulated using a new set of fc that covers the preceding and following decades we note that the computation of fc can be sensitive to the size of the moving window but 30 years is long enough to guarantee a smooth transition between decades the first experiment allows the detection of the time when the signal of climate change is if at all greater than the natural stochastic variability of climate moreover it is a demonstration of awe gen 2d ability to generate climate variables for a long and continuous period in the future in this experiment precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity variables from annual to hourly scale and from domain to individual grid cell scale were explored the new sets of parameters for awe gen 2d were estimated on a decadal basis as illustrated in fig 7 and explained above in total 3500 years were generated 5 driving rcms 7 decades 10 stochastic realizations the second stationary experiment was designed to explore the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale 13 13 km2 and at the scale of a single grid cell 2 2 km2 for precipitation and 100 100 m2 for near surface air temperature for the control and future periods a new ensemble of 900 years equivalent to 30 realizations of 30 years each was simulated only for the period 2070 2099 the ensemble was then bootstrapped to form 1000 realizations of 30 years each the re parameterization set of the 2080 2089 decade from the first experiment was used for this purpose as the data from the climate models used for this period are representative of the period of interest see illustration in fig 7 a similar ensemble was simulated for the control period for this specific experiment only the fc obtained from a single rcm model knmi as a representative example were used in order to single out the role of stochastic uncertainty without the confounding role of different climate models this second experiment focuses on precipitation and near surface air temperature as they are the most important climate variables for hydrological applications for each of the simulated realizations the mean annual precipitation of the 30 year period was calculated the stochastic uncertainty of the annual precipitation was then computed as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the 30 year mean annual precipitation of the 1000 members of the ensemble the stochastic uncertainty can then be normalized by the median of the annual precipitation to allow a better comparison between the two spatial scales and the different periods the same procedure was conducted for the near surface air temperature but in this case the 5th 95th percentile range is not divided by median using the same approach the stochastic uncertainty of the daily extreme precipitation intensity was also explored the daily extreme precipitation intensity was computed for the 2 10 and 30 year return periods using the annual maxima method as in marra et al 2017 peleg et al 2018 5 results all climate variables were generated at the hourly scale precipitation and cloud cover are generated over a 2 2 km2 grid similar to the resolution of the weather radar inputs while the other climate variables near surface air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity are generated at a finer resolution of 100 100 m2 thus accounting for topographic features results of the first experiment for precipitation cloud cover and near surface air temperature are presented in the following subsection while results for incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity are given in the supplementary information section s3 fig s8 s11 changes are expressed as differences between awe gen 2d generated climate variables for present and future conditions 5 1 first experiment changes in precipitation are first analyzed at the areal i e for the entire domain and annual scales the simulated mean annual areal precipitation over engelberg for the control period is 1896 mm which is very similar to the multi model mean including 5 climate models and 10 stochastic realizations generated for each model for the future climate fig 8 the multi model mean is monotonically increasing from 1934 mm 2 increase in comparison to the control period for the period 2020 2029 to 1968 mm 3 8 increase at the end of the century 2080 2089 some of the realizations driven by specific rcms are showing lower mean annual areal precipitation compared to the control scenario e g knmi driven simulations some do not have any significant change e g clmcom and some produce an increase in precipitation larger than the median e g smhi fig 8 the combination of precipitation fc for occurrence mean and standard deviation generates spatially heterogeneous changes fig s3 the multi model mean increase for most grid cells in the domain hardly exceeds 5 in comparison to the control period and larger changes occur in cells with lower mean precipitation this is true for all the decades that were examined fig 9 the changes for the hourly precipitation intensity were also examined for 6 exemplary grid cells fig s3 and are presented in fig s4 showing a general intensification of the hourly precipitation by the end of the century there is basically no difference between the cloud cover simulated using awe gen 2d for the control and future periods fig s5 and s6 the simulated mean annual cloud cover for the control period is 58 while the simulated multi model means for the future vary between 58 5 and 59 5 with no clear temporal trend in general cloud cover simulations show consistency among decades both for the annual mean fig s5 and for the hourly distribution fig s6 the awe gen 2d simulations of near surface air temperature over the engelberg area show a considerable increase toward the end of the century for the first simulated decade 2020 2029 an increase in average near surface air temperature of 0 5 1 35 c is projected in comparison to the control period fig 10 the uncertainty mostly emerges from the climate model forcing i e the difference between the fc obtained from the 5 rcms and is increasing towards the end of the century for the last decade 2080 2089 an increase in average near surface air temperature of 2 5 4 7 c is simulated in comparison to the control period the changes in near surface air temperature as simulated by awe gen 2d are homogenous in space i e grid cells located at bottom of the valley or along mountain slopes show almost equal temperature changes see example in fig 11 this is due to the fact that the temperature lapse rates are not re parameterized and only spatially homogenous fc are applied changes in the cloudiness have the potential to spatially modify changes in the near surface air temperature but spatial variability of changes in near surface air temperature due to the cloudiness was found to be very small in the engelberg area in the order of 0 01 c for simulations at the end of the century fig 11 the diurnal cycle of the near surface air temperature is in fact uniformly shifted fig s7 and the simulated dynamics of the temperature diurnal cycle for the future climate are similar to the control period 5 2 second experiment the stochastic uncertainty 30 realizations of 30 years of the annual precipitation at the grid cell scale on average was found to be slightly higher in comparison to the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale for the control period 7 5 and 7 respectively and in the future period 8 1 and 7 6 respectively fig 12 a this tendency is expected since stochastic uncertainty should decrease as averages are taken over a larger area but absolute differences are minimal despite a forty times larger area the stochastic uncertainty at the individual grid cells was found to vary between 7 1 and 8 9 for the control period and between 7 6 and 9 4 for the future period fig 12a the stochastic uncertainty at the domain and grid cell scale for the daily precipitation extremes for the control and future periods is presented in fig 12b as expected the stochastic uncertainty increases when moving toward lower frequency extremes for example at the domain scale and for the future the stochastic uncertainty increases from 16 4 for the 2 year return period to 22 1 and 23 9 for the 10 and 30 year return periods respectively the stochastic uncertainties at the grid cell scale are higher in comparison to those at the domain scale for example for the 10 year return period control scenario the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale was 20 1 with a median precipitation intensity of 67 7 mm d 1 in comparison to 32 5 uncertainty and 102 6 mm d 1 median intensity at the grid scale finally we can note that the stochastic uncertainty of the precipitation extremes has a similar range when we compare the control and future periods for example for the 10 year return period at the domain scale the stochastic uncertainty of the control period is 20 1 and for the future period is 22 1 the stochastic uncertainty of the near surface air temperature was also examined it was found to have a very similar magnitude when comparing the grid cell and domain scales for the control and future periods at the domain scale the stochastic uncertainty was found to be 0 25 c for both periods fig 13 the stochastic uncertainty of the individual grid cells is deviating by less than 0 005 c from the stochastic uncertainty of the domain fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 the role of stochastic uncertainty across spatial scales climate outputs from gcms and rcms cannot be used directly as inputs into hydrological models in most studies due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolution often 25 km and daily respectively studies for catchments smaller than 10 000 km2 often require climatic forcing at higher spatial and temporal resolution e g at the kilometer or less and hourly scales moreover distributed hydrological models such as tribs ivanov et al 2004 topkapi eth fatichi et al 2015 wasim schulla and jasper 2007 geotop endrizzi et al 2014 or parflow condon and maxwell 2015 require gridded climatic data as inputs thus downscaling gcm rcms realizations to individual stations may be insufficient furthermore downscaling one or few realizations of climate models is a common practice but could be quite misleading since it neglects internal climate variability deser et al 2012b 2014 fatichi et al 2016a sexton and harris 2015 generating many climatic realizations is fundamental when exploring uncertainties as the relative contribution of stochastic uncertainty to the total uncertainty of climate change projections is large at fine spatial scales especially for precipitation fatichi et al 2016a the advantages of stochastically downscaled climate variables at high spatial gridded kilometer scale and temporal sub daily resolutions are demonstrated in the results presented here when awe gen 2d was used to simulate the future climate for a long continuous period of 80 years the multi model mean for future precipitation at the domain scale increased in comparison to the control period by up to 3 8 fig 8 however this increase remains well within the range of the stochastic uncertainty of 30 year mean precipitation which was found to vary between 7 and 7 6 control and future periods fig 12a when examining individual grid cells starting from 2060 to 2069 a few grid cells show an increase in mean annual precipitation of more than 8 fig 9 meaning that their signal of change is greater than what would be expected from natural variability alone however these grid cells cover less than 10 of the domain although future daily extreme precipitation is projected to increase slightly in comparison to present extremes the change is also well within the stochastic uncertainty fig 12b on the contrary changes in near surface air temperature are exceeding the stochastic uncertainty at the domain and individual grid cell scales which is 0 25 c fig 13 starting already from the near future 2020 2029 multi model mean increase of 1 c in comparison to the control period fig 10 the small changes in future cloud cover 1 fig s5 lead to minor changes in radiation and relative humidity e g 0 5 w m 2 change in the incoming shortwave radiation at the annual scale fig s8 and to considerable changes in vapor pressure up to 30 fig s10 we can therefore conclude from this analysis carried out for the engelberg region but eventually exemplary for prealpine and alpine regions that significant changes are expected for near surface air temperature and vapor pressure while statistics of the other climate variables are likely to remain largely within the range of present natural variability generally speaking the stochastic uncertainty of climate variables is expected to increase moving towards finer spatial scales fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2011 we observe such a pattern for precipitation for which our results indicate that the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale 13 13 km2 is slightly lower than the stochastic uncertainty at the scale of the individual grid cells 2 2 km2 fig 12a however the difference is smaller than we expected in the order of 0 5 and unlikely to be of any practical significance this suggests that stochastic variability may be a dominant factor for precipitation projections not only at the local scale fatichi et al 2016a but also at scales typical of rcm gcm grid cells and potentially even at larger scales as a matter of fact the role of internal climate variability has been found to be important for precipitation also at continental scale deser et al 2012b hawkins and sutton 2011 for near surface air temperature there is practically no difference between the stochastic uncertainties at the different scales fig 13 but as explained earlier this uncertainty is much smaller than the climate change signal overall it is likely that estimating the stochastic uncertainty at the local scale station level may provide a good estimate of uncertainty at the climate model scale 12 km for some of the euro cordex models and probably even at larger scales even though this remains to be tested 6 2 awe gen 2d and future climate projections awe gen 2d is a statistical stochastic weather generator and as such it has some limitations when simulating climate variables for the future parameters are calibrated based on statistics obtained from observed data that are perturbed with information derived from climate models these modified statistics are then used to estimate new sets of parameters unfortunately only a few statistics needed to properly re parameterize the wgs are derivable from currently available gcm rcm outputs inferring changes in other statistics would require sub daily or and gridded climate model outputs at the kilometer scale for example this resolution would be necessary to modify the statistics of the diurnal cycle of temperature or to modify the precipitation spatial structure moreover some of the data that is used for the calibration of the model such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide amounts in the atmosphere or information on the aerosol optical depth that are used for the calibration of the radiation components peleg et al 2017b are simply not available in common gcm rcm outputs awe gen 2d parameters that are not modified for the future climate simulations such as the statistics of wet and dry spells and the tri variate process that is used for the simulation of the areal statistics of each storm precipitation areal intensity wet area ratio and cloud cover ratio were used with the sameparameter set of the present climate yet theoretically all these parameters in awe gen 2d could be re computed in future studies depending on the availability of high resolution i e single run hourly and km scale simulations from the climate models while in the presented case study we restricted the number of simulations to the minimum that is sufficient to demonstrate awe gen 2d capabilities and to explore climate and stochastic uncertainties it is advisable to use as many climate models as possible to better capture climate model uncertainty and it is recommended to simulate at least 50 realizations per climate trajectory to compute stochastic uncertainty as a good compromise between computational requirements and representativeness of stochastic uncertainty fatichi et al 2016a kim et al 2016 peleg et al 2017b despite these limitations which are partially related to awe gen 2d and mostly to current availability of climate model outputs the model is a very useful tool to explore stochastic climate variability at the climate model sub grid scale awe gen 2d is parsimonious in terms of computational demands and can be run on a high end desktop computer without the needs of accessing high performance computational centers it allows downscaling and simulating multiple realizations of future climate and presents an attractive alternative tool to physically based models for downscaling gridded climatic variables that are needed as inputs for hydrological applications this is especially true when the major interest is to have a good representation of the natural climate variability which we showed to be extremely important for precipitation not only at the station level but also at the scale of a climate model grid 7 summary awe gen 2d is a stochastic grid based weather generator that simulates main climatic variables needed for hydrological modeling i e precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity at sub daily temporal and kilometer spatial resolutions a methodology to re parameterize awe gen 2d using information from climate models such as gcms or rcms and to simulate variables representative of a future climate is presented for the statistics of cloud cover precipitation and near surface air temperature the re parameterization scheme and the assumptions made are described together with the benefits and limitations of using such a high resolution space time stochastic weather generator climate change projections are derived for a mountainous area in the swiss alps to demonstrate the use of awe gen 2d it was found that the future climate for this region will be characterized by a considerable change in the statistics of near surface air temperature and vapor pressure while statistics of the other climate variables such as precipitation cloud cover and shortwave incoming radiation are likely to remain within the range of stochastic natural climate variability stochastic climate uncertainty generated by awe gen 2d was found to be very similar when comparing present and future periods and different spatial scales 13 13 km2 and 2 2 km2 simulating the stochastic climate uncertainty is fundamental for studies aimed at exploring the propagation of uncertainty in climatic forcing into other hydrological variables like evapotranspiration snow cover dynamics or runoff awe gen 2d is a very suitable tool for providing climatic inputs to hydrological models for such tasks 8

6668,exploring the effects of climate change on the hydrological response at the local scale requires climate data at high spatial and temporal resolutions this is best achieved by generating downscaled ensembles of future climate variables derived from climate models for this purpose we present a methodology to re parameterize the awe gen 2d model advanced weather generator for a two dimensional grid the model simulates key meteorological variables needed by hydrological models and is particularly suitable to explore the effects of stochastic natural climatic uncertainty which is fundamental for hydrological applications especially at sub kilometer and hourly scales factors of change for different climate statistics are calculated from climate model simulations of present and future climates and subsequently applied to the statistics derived from observations to re parameterize awe gen 2d the model abilities in generating an ensemble of future climate variables for the transient period 2020 2089 is presented with examples of precipitation and near surface air temperature fields from hourly to multi annual scales for a small mountainous region in the swiss alps the stochastic uncertainty is examined for present and future periods and for spatial scales from the rcm scale 12 km daily to 2 km demonstrating the potential use of awe gen 2d outputs at the rcm scale model results yield a small increase in annual precipitation 4 which is within the stochastic uncertainty range for present and future periods 7 at the fine scale of 2 km the increase in annual precipitation can exceed the stochastic uncertainty but for less than 10 of the domain area on the contrary changes in annual near surface air temperature exceed stochastic uncertainty both at the rcm and finer scales stochastic climate uncertainty was concluded to be very similar when comparing present and future periods and 12 km and 2 km scales the benefits of using awe gen 2d in hydrological climate change impact assessments are finally discussed keywords weather generator stochastic downscaling climate change internal climate variability climate uncertainty high resolution rainfall model 1 introduction the effects of climate change on hydrology are important as they might impose changes to the hydrological cycle and water resources at regional and local scales that exceed the historical natural variability ipcc 2018 hydrological models of different complexity are commonly used to explore and quantify these effects the typical procedure is to feed the hydrological model with climate variable inputs that are derived directly or indirectly from general circulation models gcms or regional climate models rcms burlando and rosso 2002 christensen et al 2004 xu 1999 xu et al 2005 the demand from policymakers to provide more targeted assessments of local climate impacts generates a need for climate projections at higher spatial and temporal resolution than delivered from gcms and most rcms kerr 2011 fatichi et al 2016a data from gcms and rcms are most often downscaled to match the spatial and temporal resolution required by the hydrological model fowler et al 2007 wilby and wigley 1997 wood et al 2004 and or bias corrected to fit the observations in the region of interest ehret et al 2012 peleg et al 2015a teutschbein and seibert 2012 there are three general types of downscaling methods dynamical statistical and stochastic fowler et al 2007 hewitson and crane 1996 maraun et al 2010 murphy 1999 in dynamical downscaling rcms are forced with boundary conditions derived from gcms to solve the physics of the climate system at a finer spatial and temporal resolution than the parent model in a given sub domain giorgi 1990 1995 giorgi and mearns 1991 while dynamical downscaling is robust and physically sound it has a fundamental limitation as it requires massive computational resources long running times and expertise in setting and running the models gutmann et al 2016 leutwyler et al 2016 prein et al 2015 this limitation has made this approach historically less appealing for most hydrologists statistical downscaling methods fealy and sweeney 2007 fowler et al 2000 katz 1996 jakob themeßl et al 2011 wilby and wigley 1997 such as linear regression bias correction and quantile mapping link gcm or rcm outputs predictors directly to local variables of interest predictants using some statistical methodology contrary to dynamical downscaling they are parsimonious in terms of computational cost and do not require specific expertise other than common statistical knowledge therefore statistical downscaling methods have been particularly popular for generating climate forcing subsequently used for hydrological climate impacts e g teutschbein and seibert 2012 a variant of statistical downscaling is stochastic downscaling and its general concept is to randomize the relation between predictors and predictants to account for natural climate variability together with the climate change signal an important issue in hydrological climate impact studies is the assessment of future uncertainties the uncertainty in climate is composed of three main sources emission scenario uncertainty climate model uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty also known as internal or natural climate variability for further discussion see e g deser et al 2012a fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2009 emission scenario uncertainty reflects the poor knowledge of the future trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions that depends on socio economic projections meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 climate model uncertainty is related to the different responses of gcms or rcms used to simulate the future climate for a given emission scenario the uncertainty emerges partially from the numerical approximations and parameterizations schemes used to describe the physical processes involved within the models and largely from the representation of sub grid scale physical processes slingo and palmer 2011 stochastic uncertainty originates from the chaotic nature of the climate system deser et al 2012a and is due to variations that are directly driven by a purely periodic external forcing variations due to the non linear interplay of feedbacks within the climate system and variations associated with random fluctuations in physical or chemical factors in the atmosphere ghil 2002 it is vital to understand how climate uncertainty is partitioned into these sources and indeed many past studies proposed different approaches to tackle this issue e g deser et al 2012a 2012b fatichi et al 2016a 2016b hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 hingray and said 2014 olonscheck and notz 2017 considering for example the dependency or independency between climate variables stationary and nonstationary assumptions various spatial and temporal scales and analyses for average climate or extremes the first two sources of climate uncertainty can be quantified when more than one emission scenario and several climate trajectories derived from different climate models are available the climate model uncertainty can also be quantified based on the assumptions simplifications and limitations of the climate models conversely to compute the stochastic uncertainty an ensemble composed of multiple realizations representing the same climate model and emission scenario is required the rationale is that each climate realization in the ensemble is a potential outcome with the same probability as the other realizations which differ from each other due to the chaotic nature of climate for example the future period of 2070 2099 can be represented by an ensemble that is composed of 50 or 100 realizations corresponding to a specific climate change trajectory each one 30 years long the stochastic uncertainty for a given climate variable in such a future can be computed with the median value of all ensemble members and a percentile range obtained from the 50 or 100 realizations e g fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2011 this operation can be repeated for different climate variables different levels of temporal aggregation e g hourly daily and various statistics e g mean variance of a given variable the impacts of considering stochastic uncertainty were explored in hydrological studies that estimated future reservoir levels fatichi et al 2015 future streamflow addor et al 2014 camici et al 2017 giuntoli et al 2018 peleg et al 2015b and urban flows peleg et al 2017a generally the relative contribution of stochastic uncertainty to the total uncertainty increases as finer spatial scales are considered fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2011 e g when exploring hydrological climate impacts over medium 102 103 km2 to small 102 km2 catchments and when precipitation is the variable of interest therefore it is advisable to generate multiple realizations when downscaling climate variables from gcms or rcms dynamical downscaling could be used to generate multiple realizations at the catchment scale but this option is not yet convenient due to the large computational costs also statistical downscaling methods in their basic structure i e with deterministic relations between predictors and predictants do not allow a direct exploration of the stochastic uncertainty stochastic downscaling is often performed using stochastic models of simple climatic variables typically precipitation and temperature e g bordoy and burlando 2014 burlando and rosso 1991 wasko and sharma 2017 or using weather generators wg see fatichi et al 2011 fowler et al 2005 2007 kilsby et al 2007 peleg et al 2017b semenov and barrow 1997 wilks and wilby 1999 which have been widely applied in hydrological studies e g camici et al 2017 caracciolo et al 2014 fatichi et al 2015 park and kim 2014 paschalis et al 2014 peleg and morin 2014 peleg et al 2015b singer and michaelides 2017 singer et al 2018 wheater et al 2005 and many more wgs simulate time series for a given climate variable for the present climate in the downscaling approach statistics for the present climate are modified to reproduce the statistics of a given future climate exploiting the change in statistics between the two periods that are obtained from gcms or rcms e g fatichi et al 2011 2013 most wgs are designed as single or multi site tools simulating the climate variables at a daily resolution e g hutchinson 1995 keller et al 2015 park et al 2018 climate time series at this resolution are adequate for certain hydrological applications especially if large catchments are examined and lumped or semi distributed hydrological models are used e g teutschbein et al 2011 however the increased availability and use of distributed hydrological models in the context of climate change impact analyses fatichi et al 2015 2016b perra et al 2018 and the importance of addressing the spatial variability of extremes generate a need for climate projections at higher spatial and temporal resolution the requirement for high space time resolutions was recently met by a new stochastic wg named awe gen 2d peleg et al 2017b that simulates key climate variables that are needed as input into hydrological models in a gridded form at resolutions as high as 100 m 100 m and 10 min in this manuscript we introduce a methodology for using awe gen 2d as a tool to downscale future climate variables e g precipitation and near surface air temperature by modifying the parameters of awe gen 2d that were calibrated using observed data for the present climate with information derived from rcm simulations awe gen 2d is intended to satisfy the hydrologists needs in generating multiple realizations of a given climate at a spatial and temporal resolution that is adequate for hydrological modeling purposes we discuss the assumptions advantages capabilities and limitations of using awe gen 2d as a non stationary simulator to downscale climate variables for a transient climate period in addition we use awe gen 2d to explore the role of stochastic uncertainty at different spatial scales the rcm scale 13 13 km2 and a finer 2 2 km2 scale last we discuss the importance of using a high resolution gridded stochastic downscaling method when making hydrological predictions at local spatial scales awe gen 2d is briefly described in the following section and its re parameterization scheme is presented thereafter the re parameterization the simulation of a future downscaled ensemble of climate projections and the analysis of the stochastic uncertainty is demonstrated for the engelberg region a mountainous area in the swiss alps 2 methods 2 1 awe gen 2d model awe gen 2d advanced weather generator for a 2 dimensional grid peleg et al 2017b is a stochastic weather generator that simulates gridded climate variables at high spatial sub kilometer and temporal sub daily resolutions it is a substantial evolution of the 1 dimensional awe gen model fatichi et al 2011 ivanov et al 2007 and was further developed using methods from three preceding models i streap paschalis et al 2013 ii hires wg peleg and morin 2014 and iii winds burlando et al 2007 awe gen 2d simulates key climate variables that are needed for hydrological ecological and agricultural applications e g precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity using a combination of stochastic and process based methods a brief description of how the model simulates key hydrological variables precipitation cloud cover and near surface air temperature is provided in the following paragraphs for further details the reader is referred to peleg et al 2017b precipitation fields are simulated in three stages first a temporal sequence of dry and wet spells affecting the entire domain is defined using an alternating renewal process peleg and morin 2014 in which the wet dry durations are sampled from specific probability distributions and are mutually independent second a gaussian stochastic process with a covariance function belonging to the whittle matern class gneiting et al 2010 is used for the simulation of the areal statistics of precipitation and cloud cover for each wet period these are the wet area ratio the mean areal precipitation intensity and the cloud area ratio these three variables are auto and cross correlated and thus have to be simulated as a tri variate stochastic process third the time series of wet area ratio and mean areal precipitation intensity are transformed into precipitation intensity fields paschalis et al 2013 for that two dimensional intermittent gaussian fields correlated in space and time are simulated using a fast fourier transform fft method lang and potthoff 2011 the generated precipitation intensity fields are treated as continuous in space between the east west and south north boundaries due to the symmetries of the fft paschalis et al 2013 this property is exploited to simulate advection of the fields a bi variate autoregressive model schneider and neumaier 2001 is used to simulate time series of the advection speed and direction velocities along the east west and south north components two spatial filters are applied to the precipitation fields peleg et al 2017b the first filter allows precipitation occurrence to be heterogeneous in space meaning it is used to generate regions in the field where precipitation occurrence is higher or lower than average the second filter adjust the probability distribution of precipitation intensity for each grid cell based on a generalized pareto gp distribution i e allowing spatial heterogeneity in precipitation intensity during a wet spell the cloudiness and precipitation intensity fields are assumed to be cross correlated meaning that the intermittent gaussian fields are used for the generation of both precipitation and cloud fields during a dry spell mean cloudiness in the domain is simulated through an autoregressive moving average model with a structure that forces the cloudiness to decay as a function of the time passed since the end of the previous wet spell and to increase toward the beginning of the next wet spell fatichi et al 2011 the johnson distribution johnson 1949 is used to transform the autoregressive moving average model outputs into a time series of cloud area ratio near surface air temperature is first simulated for a given reference level as the sum of a 1st order autoregressive model with a stochastic term and a deterministic component curtis and eagleson 1982 fatichi et al 2011 ivanov et al 2007 peleg et al 2017b and is then spatially distributed using a stochastic lapse rate the deterministic component is represented by the time derivative of air temperature which is a function of the air temperature itself the incoming longwave radiation which is dependent on cloud cover juszak and pellicciotti 2013 and the hourly position of the sun eagleson 2005 effects of shading in the terrain i e when the surface is shadowed by surrounding terrain are also accounted for chen et al 2006 dubayah and loechel 1997 further details about awe gen 2d can be found in the technical reference of the model peleg et al 2017b 2 2 re parameterizing awe gen 2d for the future climate awe gen 2d can be used to generate multiple realizations of future climate the approach to this end consists of re parameterizing several of the parameters of awe gen 2d listed in table 1 that were estimated from observed data the new parameters are based on modified climate statistics inferred from climate model outputs gcms or rcms and are considered representative of the future climate the approach downscales key climate variables that were simulated by climate models at their original spatial and temporal resolutions i e 101 102 km and daily to much finer resolution e g 100 km and hourly as it is often the case for climate downscaling this approach is based on the unverifiable assumptions that gcms and rcms changes in climate statistics are robust signals of climate change and that the weather generator structure is transferring those changes into finer resolutions accurately the factors of change fc approach anandhi et al 2011 bordoy and burlando 2014 burlando and rosso 1991 fatichi et al 2011 kilsby et al 2007 is used for the re parameterization of awe gen 2d the fc approach was chosen as it allows consideration of changes in the long term mean as well as changes in higher order statistics and accounts for seasonality fc are obtained by computing the difference between statistics of climate variables from a control realization and a future realization originated from a specific gcm or rcm the control realization con is the period for which both observed data and climate model simulations are available while the future realization fut is the period for which only climate model simulations are available fc can be applied at finer temporal scales than the scale of the original climate model with the due attention to scale dependency and breaks in the higher order statistics marani 2005 bordoy and burlando 2014 fc can be a product factor e g for precipitation statistics in such a case the ratio between statistics for fut and con realizations are used to modify the observed statistics as 1 s h v fut s h v clm f u t s h v clm c o n s h v obs where s is a statistical property e g mean h is the time aggregation e g daily the subscript v is the climate variable e g precipitation the superscript fut and con denote future and control realizations respectively clm denotes the climate model rcm or gcm and obs denotes the observed data alternatively fc can be an additive factor also known as δ change e g for temperature statistics in such a case the difference between statistics for fut and con realizations are used to modify the observed statistics as 2 s h v fut s h v obs s h v clm f u t s h v clm c o n with the same notations as above fc can theoretically be applied to every statistic of climate variables simulated by a climate model and used by awe gen 2d for the parameter estimation however at present the re parameterization is applied only for a limited number of statistics characterizing the simulated cloud cover precipitation and near surface air temperature table 1 as these climate variables are among conventional outputs available from gcms and rcms and are arguably the most important for hydrological simulations additionally once these climate variables are re parameterized in awe gen 2d other variables are indirectly affected due to the dependencies between variables that are implemented in the model peleg et al 2017b for example cloud cover controls the incoming shortwave radiation and solar radiation and near surface air temperature influence vapor pressure the fc are calculated in this study on a 3 monthly basis to include the effects of intra annual seasonality but we note that they can be applied in several ways depending on the specific local climatology and on the research question in mind for example the model can be used to simulate a given climate trajectory by using fc that are obtained from a specific climate model as demonstrated in the experiments described below or it can be used to simulate a multi model ensemble by using a statistical approach e g a bayesian framework see fatichi et al 2011 tebaldi et al 2005 xu et al 2018 to sample the fc obtained from multiple climate models in the following paragraphs details of the re parameterization of different components of awe gen 2d are provided the precipitation occurrence filter can be re parameterized for a future climate if rcm results are available at a relatively high resolution e g with a spatial resolution of 15 km or finer occurrence statistics are calculated for con and fut periods from the climate models and are linearly interpolated in space to match the grid cell resolution of awe gen 2d an additive fc is then applied to define the occurrence filter for fut period concurrently the gp distributions describing the precipitation intensity filter are re parameterized for the future climate using product fc the fc for the mean and variance of the precipitation intensities are calculated in each cell of the rcm interpolated spatially and applied to the observed statistics in such a way the parameters of the gp distributions are re estimated the parameters of the johnson distribution that simulates the cloud cover during dry spells is re parameterized for the future climate using product fc as the johnson distribution has more parameters than gp we use higher order statistics to fit the new parameters and reduce the uncertainty of the fit the fc for the mean standard deviation kurtosis and skewness of the cloud area ratio for the dry spells are calculated from rcm results and applied to the observed statistics the parameters of the johnson distribution are then re fitted an additive fc δt t is used to modify near surface air temperature for the future climate this is applied directly to the mean near surface air temperature over the entire domain 2 3 re parameterizing statistics based on observed natural variability the wet and dry spells are simulated in awe gen 2d using a renewal process at a temporal resolution hourly that is finer than the temporal resolution of data saved in most gcms and rcms simulations daily therefore the parameters of the probability distributions used to simulate future wet dry sequences cannot be directly re parameterized by using information derived from the climate models this means that we cannot use the fc approach for re parameterizing the alternating renewal process for the future climate instead we rely on observations and assume that climate change signals in the statistics of future wet dry spells can be represented by the current variability of the observed wet dry spells changes in the occurrence and duration of wet and dry spells were reported by many studies dealing with future climates heinrich and gobiet 2012 peleg et al 2015a svoboda et al 2016 and projected changes in the sequences of future wet and dry spells are in most cases comparable to the observed natural variability e g peleg et al 2015a to compute the observed variability in wet dry spells a bootstrap method efron 1979 is used bootstrapping has been applied many times in the past to analyze natural variability e g alexander and arblaster 2009 marra et al 2017 peleg et al 2018 if the observed wet dry sample is large enough e g 30 year of data it can be resampled with replacement on an annual scale meaning that a wet dry sequence of a given year can appear several times in the new sample or not at all once the new sample of wet dry sequences is generated new statistics and parameters for the probability distribution can be calculated in this way we consider the new set of parameters to represent a possible change in climate as we assume that the climate change signal impossible to compute from climate models is contained within the natural variability of the historical period then the stochastic nature of awe gen 2d superposes a stochastic variability on top of this climate change signal as done for climate change signals directly derived through fc e g mean air temperature section 2 2 3 case study 3 1 study area the engelberg region swiss alps 8 48 e 46 88 n was chosen as a case study to demonstrate awe gen 2d abilities to simulate an ensemble of climate variables for the period 2020 2089 and to discuss stochastic uncertainty over a typical size of a rcm grid cell the domain scale of engelberg area is 13 13 km2 and at the local grid scale 2 2 km2 or less that is simulated using awe gen 2d the region is characterized by complex topography with elevation ranging between 404 and 3119 m above sea level fig 1 we used awe gen 2d to simulate multiple climate variables for this region precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity of which only precipitation and near surface air temperature are discussed in the manuscript the other climate variables are presented exclusively in the supplementary material awe gen 2d was previously calibrated and validated for this region for present climate conditions peleg et al 2017b with 30 years of observations or more according to the climatic variable the wet and dry spell statistics the spatial distribution of precipitation intensity and the variability of precipitation at different scales were examined along with the diurnal cycle of near surface air temperature daily maximum mean and minimum temperature values and spatial distribution of temperature it was concluded that precipitation cloud cover which is a closely related variable to precipitation and near surface air temperature variables are generated by awe gen 2d with a high level of accuracy sufficient for most hydrological applications peleg et al 2017b the validation of the other climate variables is discussed in section s1 supplementary material the ability of awe gen 2d to simulate the natural climate variability of precipitation and temperature at different temporal scales over the domain is further examined here fig 2 an ensemble of meteorological variables hourly resolution made of 30 realizations of 30 years each was simulated with awe gen 2d and compared to an ensemble of the same dimension generated by bootstrapping the observed data but with daily resolution the median and the 5th and 95th percentiles a measure of variability of daily precipitation for the 30 year period were calculated for each individual realization and later averaged observed and simulated data were aggregated to weekly monthly and annual scales and the natural climate variability was computed at each scale an identical methodology was applied to the near surface air temperature data the model satisfactory reproduces the natural climate variability at the daily to monthly scales both for precipitation difference between the observed and simulated 5th 95th range are 2 3 mm at most and temperature 1 5 c fig 2 at the annual scale the 5th 95th range of the simulated natural climate variability for precipitation is larger by 24 6 mm or 3 4 in comparison to the observed range and smaller by 1 3 c 50 for temperature the latter problem is expected and known as overdispersion fatichi et al 2011 katz and parlange 1998 for temperature the model simulates the periodic external forces such as diurnal cycle and seasonality but is not able to account for variations in the climate system due to large scale circulation patterns e g variations in ocean heat content or persistent anomalies in a given region that can modify considerably annual means a similar issue should be expected for precipitation as well if not properly addressed fatichi et al 2011 but it is not evident from the obtained results most of the climatic data for this region were supplied by the swiss federal office for meteorology and climatology meteoswiss and from the merra re analysis rienecker et al 2011 data products details can be found in www meteoswiss admin ch include weather radar observations gridded data products of precipitation and temperature rhiresd and tabsy and classic meteorological ground stations swissmetnet fig 1 further details on the data used to calibrate and validate awe gen 2d for present climate conditions and their sources can be found in peleg et al 2017b 3 2 climate models and factors of change five rcms from the euro cordex initiative giorgi et al 2009 kotlarski et al 2014 prein et al 2016 were chosen for the re parameterization of awe gen 2d for future climate conditions table 2 the chosen rcms have daily temporal resolution and spatial resolution of about 12 km 0 11 the five models correspond to different gcm rcm chains chosen to minimize the potential effect of interdependence between climate models knutti et al 2013 on the multi model ensemble for the presented case study only the rcp8 5 emission scenario characterized by the largest increase in global temperature and greenhouse gas concentration meinshausen et al 2011 is considered cloud cover precipitation and near surface air temperature variables for the historical 1970 2005 and future 2006 2100 periods were used fc table 1 were calculated over the rcms grid and then they were spatially interpolated to the cartesian grid of awe gen 2d using a 2 dimensional linear interpolation fig 3 the fc were calculated on seasonal basis for each decade using a 30 year moving time window since 30 years are necessary for computing statistics see further explanation in section 4 the fc for precipitation statistics were computed for changes in the mean fig 4 occurrence fig s1 and standard deviation fig s2 differences are evident between decades and among the five climate models in general changes are more prominent toward the end of the century for all statistics the spatial pattern of the fc of precipitation mean fig 4 and standard deviation fig s2 is quite similar there is however no consensus between climate models when fc of precipitation mean fig 4 and occurrence fig s1 are jointly considered for example both fc of precipitation mean computed from mpi and knmi models for jja for the end of the century are indicating a general reduction in precipitation intensity while the fc of precipitation occurrence are pointing to both a decrease mpi or increase knmi seasonally the fc of precipitation mean are sometimes found to be larger than 1 25 clmcom djf end of the century or smaller than 0 80 mpi jja end of the century but at the annual scale the fc of precipitation mean are rarely exceeding the 10 range no clear trends were found for cloud cover changes for both near 2020 2029 or far 2089 2089 futures fig 5 the fc for cloud cover mean are changing between seasons climate models or decades but without any apparent pattern most fc for cloud cover mean were found to be within a 5 range thus making it impossible to judge if the difference represents a climate change signal or it is stochastic noise fc derived from the clmcom climate model yield a substantial cloud cover reduction by the end of the century e g 10 and 22 reduction in cloud cover mean for son and jja respectively however these results were considered unrealistic for example bartók et al 2017 indicated that changes in annual cloud cover for this region do not exceed 8 and these fc values were omitted for the subsequent re parameterization of awe gen 2d a clear signal of increase in near surface air temperature is projected from all models as evident from the fc for temperature mean fig 6 the spread in fc is relatively high for the end of the century and changes in temperature range between 2 75 c dmi model and 4 5 c smhi model when computing the fc at the annual scale model spread in fc is higher for djf and mam in comparison to jja and son 4 experimental setup weather generators can be used to simulate future climate scenarios for a long continuous period non stationary approach considering the transient nature of the climate change signals e g blenkinsop et al 2013 burton et al 2010 glenis et al 2015 or to simulate a given period usually 20 30 years long under the assumption of stationarity i e considering that the climate change signal is constant during this period e g camici et al 2014 fatichi et al 2013 2015 peleg et al 2015b singer and michaelides 2017 singer et al 2018 two experiments were conducted for the case study area in the first experiment a transient multi model ensemble was generated for the period 2020 2089 the fc are calculated based on a 30 year moving window a typical interval used to define climatological values according to the world meteorological organization and are updated every decade fig 7 each decade is simulated using a new set of fc that covers the preceding and following decades we note that the computation of fc can be sensitive to the size of the moving window but 30 years is long enough to guarantee a smooth transition between decades the first experiment allows the detection of the time when the signal of climate change is if at all greater than the natural stochastic variability of climate moreover it is a demonstration of awe gen 2d ability to generate climate variables for a long and continuous period in the future in this experiment precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity variables from annual to hourly scale and from domain to individual grid cell scale were explored the new sets of parameters for awe gen 2d were estimated on a decadal basis as illustrated in fig 7 and explained above in total 3500 years were generated 5 driving rcms 7 decades 10 stochastic realizations the second stationary experiment was designed to explore the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale 13 13 km2 and at the scale of a single grid cell 2 2 km2 for precipitation and 100 100 m2 for near surface air temperature for the control and future periods a new ensemble of 900 years equivalent to 30 realizations of 30 years each was simulated only for the period 2070 2099 the ensemble was then bootstrapped to form 1000 realizations of 30 years each the re parameterization set of the 2080 2089 decade from the first experiment was used for this purpose as the data from the climate models used for this period are representative of the period of interest see illustration in fig 7 a similar ensemble was simulated for the control period for this specific experiment only the fc obtained from a single rcm model knmi as a representative example were used in order to single out the role of stochastic uncertainty without the confounding role of different climate models this second experiment focuses on precipitation and near surface air temperature as they are the most important climate variables for hydrological applications for each of the simulated realizations the mean annual precipitation of the 30 year period was calculated the stochastic uncertainty of the annual precipitation was then computed as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the 30 year mean annual precipitation of the 1000 members of the ensemble the stochastic uncertainty can then be normalized by the median of the annual precipitation to allow a better comparison between the two spatial scales and the different periods the same procedure was conducted for the near surface air temperature but in this case the 5th 95th percentile range is not divided by median using the same approach the stochastic uncertainty of the daily extreme precipitation intensity was also explored the daily extreme precipitation intensity was computed for the 2 10 and 30 year return periods using the annual maxima method as in marra et al 2017 peleg et al 2018 5 results all climate variables were generated at the hourly scale precipitation and cloud cover are generated over a 2 2 km2 grid similar to the resolution of the weather radar inputs while the other climate variables near surface air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity are generated at a finer resolution of 100 100 m2 thus accounting for topographic features results of the first experiment for precipitation cloud cover and near surface air temperature are presented in the following subsection while results for incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity are given in the supplementary information section s3 fig s8 s11 changes are expressed as differences between awe gen 2d generated climate variables for present and future conditions 5 1 first experiment changes in precipitation are first analyzed at the areal i e for the entire domain and annual scales the simulated mean annual areal precipitation over engelberg for the control period is 1896 mm which is very similar to the multi model mean including 5 climate models and 10 stochastic realizations generated for each model for the future climate fig 8 the multi model mean is monotonically increasing from 1934 mm 2 increase in comparison to the control period for the period 2020 2029 to 1968 mm 3 8 increase at the end of the century 2080 2089 some of the realizations driven by specific rcms are showing lower mean annual areal precipitation compared to the control scenario e g knmi driven simulations some do not have any significant change e g clmcom and some produce an increase in precipitation larger than the median e g smhi fig 8 the combination of precipitation fc for occurrence mean and standard deviation generates spatially heterogeneous changes fig s3 the multi model mean increase for most grid cells in the domain hardly exceeds 5 in comparison to the control period and larger changes occur in cells with lower mean precipitation this is true for all the decades that were examined fig 9 the changes for the hourly precipitation intensity were also examined for 6 exemplary grid cells fig s3 and are presented in fig s4 showing a general intensification of the hourly precipitation by the end of the century there is basically no difference between the cloud cover simulated using awe gen 2d for the control and future periods fig s5 and s6 the simulated mean annual cloud cover for the control period is 58 while the simulated multi model means for the future vary between 58 5 and 59 5 with no clear temporal trend in general cloud cover simulations show consistency among decades both for the annual mean fig s5 and for the hourly distribution fig s6 the awe gen 2d simulations of near surface air temperature over the engelberg area show a considerable increase toward the end of the century for the first simulated decade 2020 2029 an increase in average near surface air temperature of 0 5 1 35 c is projected in comparison to the control period fig 10 the uncertainty mostly emerges from the climate model forcing i e the difference between the fc obtained from the 5 rcms and is increasing towards the end of the century for the last decade 2080 2089 an increase in average near surface air temperature of 2 5 4 7 c is simulated in comparison to the control period the changes in near surface air temperature as simulated by awe gen 2d are homogenous in space i e grid cells located at bottom of the valley or along mountain slopes show almost equal temperature changes see example in fig 11 this is due to the fact that the temperature lapse rates are not re parameterized and only spatially homogenous fc are applied changes in the cloudiness have the potential to spatially modify changes in the near surface air temperature but spatial variability of changes in near surface air temperature due to the cloudiness was found to be very small in the engelberg area in the order of 0 01 c for simulations at the end of the century fig 11 the diurnal cycle of the near surface air temperature is in fact uniformly shifted fig s7 and the simulated dynamics of the temperature diurnal cycle for the future climate are similar to the control period 5 2 second experiment the stochastic uncertainty 30 realizations of 30 years of the annual precipitation at the grid cell scale on average was found to be slightly higher in comparison to the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale for the control period 7 5 and 7 respectively and in the future period 8 1 and 7 6 respectively fig 12 a this tendency is expected since stochastic uncertainty should decrease as averages are taken over a larger area but absolute differences are minimal despite a forty times larger area the stochastic uncertainty at the individual grid cells was found to vary between 7 1 and 8 9 for the control period and between 7 6 and 9 4 for the future period fig 12a the stochastic uncertainty at the domain and grid cell scale for the daily precipitation extremes for the control and future periods is presented in fig 12b as expected the stochastic uncertainty increases when moving toward lower frequency extremes for example at the domain scale and for the future the stochastic uncertainty increases from 16 4 for the 2 year return period to 22 1 and 23 9 for the 10 and 30 year return periods respectively the stochastic uncertainties at the grid cell scale are higher in comparison to those at the domain scale for example for the 10 year return period control scenario the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale was 20 1 with a median precipitation intensity of 67 7 mm d 1 in comparison to 32 5 uncertainty and 102 6 mm d 1 median intensity at the grid scale finally we can note that the stochastic uncertainty of the precipitation extremes has a similar range when we compare the control and future periods for example for the 10 year return period at the domain scale the stochastic uncertainty of the control period is 20 1 and for the future period is 22 1 the stochastic uncertainty of the near surface air temperature was also examined it was found to have a very similar magnitude when comparing the grid cell and domain scales for the control and future periods at the domain scale the stochastic uncertainty was found to be 0 25 c for both periods fig 13 the stochastic uncertainty of the individual grid cells is deviating by less than 0 005 c from the stochastic uncertainty of the domain fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 the role of stochastic uncertainty across spatial scales climate outputs from gcms and rcms cannot be used directly as inputs into hydrological models in most studies due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolution often 25 km and daily respectively studies for catchments smaller than 10 000 km2 often require climatic forcing at higher spatial and temporal resolution e g at the kilometer or less and hourly scales moreover distributed hydrological models such as tribs ivanov et al 2004 topkapi eth fatichi et al 2015 wasim schulla and jasper 2007 geotop endrizzi et al 2014 or parflow condon and maxwell 2015 require gridded climatic data as inputs thus downscaling gcm rcms realizations to individual stations may be insufficient furthermore downscaling one or few realizations of climate models is a common practice but could be quite misleading since it neglects internal climate variability deser et al 2012b 2014 fatichi et al 2016a sexton and harris 2015 generating many climatic realizations is fundamental when exploring uncertainties as the relative contribution of stochastic uncertainty to the total uncertainty of climate change projections is large at fine spatial scales especially for precipitation fatichi et al 2016a the advantages of stochastically downscaled climate variables at high spatial gridded kilometer scale and temporal sub daily resolutions are demonstrated in the results presented here when awe gen 2d was used to simulate the future climate for a long continuous period of 80 years the multi model mean for future precipitation at the domain scale increased in comparison to the control period by up to 3 8 fig 8 however this increase remains well within the range of the stochastic uncertainty of 30 year mean precipitation which was found to vary between 7 and 7 6 control and future periods fig 12a when examining individual grid cells starting from 2060 to 2069 a few grid cells show an increase in mean annual precipitation of more than 8 fig 9 meaning that their signal of change is greater than what would be expected from natural variability alone however these grid cells cover less than 10 of the domain although future daily extreme precipitation is projected to increase slightly in comparison to present extremes the change is also well within the stochastic uncertainty fig 12b on the contrary changes in near surface air temperature are exceeding the stochastic uncertainty at the domain and individual grid cell scales which is 0 25 c fig 13 starting already from the near future 2020 2029 multi model mean increase of 1 c in comparison to the control period fig 10 the small changes in future cloud cover 1 fig s5 lead to minor changes in radiation and relative humidity e g 0 5 w m 2 change in the incoming shortwave radiation at the annual scale fig s8 and to considerable changes in vapor pressure up to 30 fig s10 we can therefore conclude from this analysis carried out for the engelberg region but eventually exemplary for prealpine and alpine regions that significant changes are expected for near surface air temperature and vapor pressure while statistics of the other climate variables are likely to remain largely within the range of present natural variability generally speaking the stochastic uncertainty of climate variables is expected to increase moving towards finer spatial scales fatichi et al 2016a hawkins and sutton 2011 we observe such a pattern for precipitation for which our results indicate that the stochastic uncertainty at the domain scale 13 13 km2 is slightly lower than the stochastic uncertainty at the scale of the individual grid cells 2 2 km2 fig 12a however the difference is smaller than we expected in the order of 0 5 and unlikely to be of any practical significance this suggests that stochastic variability may be a dominant factor for precipitation projections not only at the local scale fatichi et al 2016a but also at scales typical of rcm gcm grid cells and potentially even at larger scales as a matter of fact the role of internal climate variability has been found to be important for precipitation also at continental scale deser et al 2012b hawkins and sutton 2011 for near surface air temperature there is practically no difference between the stochastic uncertainties at the different scales fig 13 but as explained earlier this uncertainty is much smaller than the climate change signal overall it is likely that estimating the stochastic uncertainty at the local scale station level may provide a good estimate of uncertainty at the climate model scale 12 km for some of the euro cordex models and probably even at larger scales even though this remains to be tested 6 2 awe gen 2d and future climate projections awe gen 2d is a statistical stochastic weather generator and as such it has some limitations when simulating climate variables for the future parameters are calibrated based on statistics obtained from observed data that are perturbed with information derived from climate models these modified statistics are then used to estimate new sets of parameters unfortunately only a few statistics needed to properly re parameterize the wgs are derivable from currently available gcm rcm outputs inferring changes in other statistics would require sub daily or and gridded climate model outputs at the kilometer scale for example this resolution would be necessary to modify the statistics of the diurnal cycle of temperature or to modify the precipitation spatial structure moreover some of the data that is used for the calibration of the model such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide amounts in the atmosphere or information on the aerosol optical depth that are used for the calibration of the radiation components peleg et al 2017b are simply not available in common gcm rcm outputs awe gen 2d parameters that are not modified for the future climate simulations such as the statistics of wet and dry spells and the tri variate process that is used for the simulation of the areal statistics of each storm precipitation areal intensity wet area ratio and cloud cover ratio were used with the sameparameter set of the present climate yet theoretically all these parameters in awe gen 2d could be re computed in future studies depending on the availability of high resolution i e single run hourly and km scale simulations from the climate models while in the presented case study we restricted the number of simulations to the minimum that is sufficient to demonstrate awe gen 2d capabilities and to explore climate and stochastic uncertainties it is advisable to use as many climate models as possible to better capture climate model uncertainty and it is recommended to simulate at least 50 realizations per climate trajectory to compute stochastic uncertainty as a good compromise between computational requirements and representativeness of stochastic uncertainty fatichi et al 2016a kim et al 2016 peleg et al 2017b despite these limitations which are partially related to awe gen 2d and mostly to current availability of climate model outputs the model is a very useful tool to explore stochastic climate variability at the climate model sub grid scale awe gen 2d is parsimonious in terms of computational demands and can be run on a high end desktop computer without the needs of accessing high performance computational centers it allows downscaling and simulating multiple realizations of future climate and presents an attractive alternative tool to physically based models for downscaling gridded climatic variables that are needed as inputs for hydrological applications this is especially true when the major interest is to have a good representation of the natural climate variability which we showed to be extremely important for precipitation not only at the station level but also at the scale of a climate model grid 7 summary awe gen 2d is a stochastic grid based weather generator that simulates main climatic variables needed for hydrological modeling i e precipitation cloud cover near surface air temperature incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure and relative humidity at sub daily temporal and kilometer spatial resolutions a methodology to re parameterize awe gen 2d using information from climate models such as gcms or rcms and to simulate variables representative of a future climate is presented for the statistics of cloud cover precipitation and near surface air temperature the re parameterization scheme and the assumptions made are described together with the benefits and limitations of using such a high resolution space time stochastic weather generator climate change projections are derived for a mountainous area in the swiss alps to demonstrate the use of awe gen 2d it was found that the future climate for this region will be characterized by a considerable change in the statistics of near surface air temperature and vapor pressure while statistics of the other climate variables such as precipitation cloud cover and shortwave incoming radiation are likely to remain within the range of stochastic natural climate variability stochastic climate uncertainty generated by awe gen 2d was found to be very similar when comparing present and future periods and different spatial scales 13 13 km2 and 2 2 km2 simulating the stochastic climate uncertainty is fundamental for studies aimed at exploring the propagation of uncertainty in climatic forcing into other hydrological variables like evapotranspiration snow cover dynamics or runoff awe gen 2d is a very suitable tool for providing climatic inputs to hydrological models for such tasks 8

6669,the ecohydrological separation between soil water sources for plant water uptake and groundwater recharge has been recently examined in various climate zones primarily based on isotopic composition of water the existence of the ecohydrological separation has profound implications for mechanistic ecohydrological modeling and water resource management however it is still unclear when and where the ecohydrological separation occurs especially in humid regions in this study high frequency sampling of precipitation bulk soil water groundwater and twig xylem water for hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition measurement was conducted in a humid subtropical site in the central southern china from march 2017 to april 2018 we examined evidence of the ecohydrological separation with three methods dual isotope space line conditioned excess lc excess and the piecewise isotope balance pib method the results show that the isotopic composition of plant xylem and bulk soil water are not distinguishable from those of precipitation water on the dual isotope space due to a weak evaporation effect at the study site indicating that there is no evidence of the ecohydrological separation however the other two methods support the ecohydrological separation in this humid area with the results from the pib method revealing more temporal details the present study suggests that the ecohydrological separation can happen in subtropical humid climate it is more likely to occur in spring and winter at the study site when plant accessible water pool has been replenished by antecedent precipitation while ecohydrological connection seems to occur during winter snowmelt with the limitations of three methods the caution should be taken when only one method is applied in examining the ecohydrological separation in such an environment keywords ecohydrological separation stable isotopes plant accessible water water replenishment lc excess piecewise isotope balance method 1 introduction soil water is the immediate water source for plants in the terrestrial ecosystems thus the plant accessible water in soil is essential for plant growth generally soil water has been assumed to be a well mixed water pool hewlett and hibbert 1966 mccutcheon et al 2017 which means that plants extract water from the same pool that drains into groundwater and or flows into streams however recent studies suggest that streams and plants appear to have water originated from two different water pools mobile water for groundwater stream recharge and immobile water for plant use such a phenomenon was first proposed in brooks et al 2010 based on distinguished isotopic composition between stream and plant water in a mediterranean climate zone thereafter this phenomenon was referred to as the two water worlds mcdonnell 2014 or the ecohydrological separation hypothesis geris et al 2015 mccutcheon et al 2017 evidence for the ecohydrological separation hypothesis has been reported in various climate zones bowling et al 2017 brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2016 gierke et al 2016 goldsmith et al 2012 hervé fernández et al 2016 mccutcheon et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 meanwhile at the global scale evaristo et al 2015 suggest that the ecohydrological separation occurs at 80 of the sites and good et al 2015 report that 38 of surface water comes from the plant accessible soil water pool these studies suggest that the ecohydrological separation may commonly occur these findings not only challenge the assumptions e g water in soils is well mixed that have been commonly accepted in conceptualizations of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles but also have practical implications for agricultural fertilizer application surface induced groundwater pollution and fate and transport of subsurface contaminants phillips 2010 the reported degrees of the ecohydrological separation vary greatly among different studies the highest separation was estimated by brooks et al 2010 in a mediterranean climate in which the separation exists from the rainy season winter to the next wet up period in autumn however most other studies show that the ecohydrological separation seems to be temporal and more likely to occur during dry periods brooks et al 2010 in humid climate the reported results of ecohydrological separation are not consistent among studies for example no marked separation was found in wet environments geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 two studies qian et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 with investigations being conducted in the same climate zone subtropical monsoon climate showed contrasting results of the ecohydrological separation the inconsistency in these previous studies suggests that it is still unclear when and where the ecohydrological separation occurs especially in humid regions despite increasing evidence of the ecohydrological separation several potential problems arise from current methods in the investigation of the ecohydrological separation firstly current methods for assessing the ecohydrological separation do not necessarily work for humid environments the commonly used methods for assessing the ecohydrological separation hypothesis are the so called dual isotope space and line conditioned excess lc excess assessment for the dual isotope space groundwater and stream water generally plot on or near a local meteoric water line lmwl based on the seasonal δ2h and δ18o variations in precipitation soil water usually varies along a soil water evaporation line swel with different degree of deviation from the lmwl due to different evaporation and mixing processes the ecohydrological separation is considered occurring when plant water is plotted to the right of the lmwl and close to the swel with isotopic distinction from mobile water stream and ground water for the lc excess assessment this variable is to quantify the isotopic distance of a water sample from the lmwl landwehr and coplen 2006 theoretically precipitation lc excess values will fluctuate near zero so do the lc excess values of mobile water soil water that has undergone evaporation will have a negative lc excess value thus evaluation of the ecohydrological separation is based on the significant difference in the lc excess values between plant water and mobile water note that these two methods are effective based on the assumption that plant use water has undergone notable evaporation however this assumption may be problematic for an environment where evaporative effects on the isotopic composition of environmental waters are not significant this may be one reason for the inconsistent results of the reported ecohydrological separation in humid climate as we mentioned above secondly common soil water samplings do not necessarily reflect the isotopic composition of water used by plants recently sprenger et al 2015 gave an overview of various methods of soil water extraction for stable isotope analysis which shows that different methods extract pore waters of different mobility for those previous studies on the ecohydrological separation bulk soil water that includes both mobile and immobile matric bound water brooks et al 2010 was sampled with the cryogenic vacuum distillation in addition to bulk soil water sampling in some studies mobile soil water was extracted using suction lysimeters brooks et al 2010 hervé fernández et al 2016 centrifugation geris et al 2015 or wick samplers gierke et al 2016 as most studies on the ecohydrological separation assume that plants rely on the immobile soil water it should be reasonable to investigate the isotopic composition of immobile water to reflect the isotopic composition of water used by plants however it is difficult to sample the immobile soil water that is really extracted by plants based on current technologies although the isotopic composition of bulk soil water generally based on point measurements can reflect that of the water acquired by plants in some case e g during dry periods such bulk soil water samplings may give uncertainties in inferring the isotopic composition of water acquired by plants during wet periods finally the different degrees of the ecohydrological separation reported in the literature can be partly resulted from a low frequency of isotope sampling as hervé fernández et al 2016 mentioned that sampling frequency is still one of the most significant limitations in ecohydrological studies many field campaigns in the previous studies only have samples collected a few times per season e g wet dry season brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2016 geris et al 2015 goldsmith et al 2012 a low sampling frequency likely misses the detail of temporal variation such temporal variation likely provides important information to understand the mechanism of ecohydrological separation high frequency sampling of plant water and soil water for isotopic composition analysis is thus especially beneficial for improving understanding of the ecohydrological separation mcdonnell 2014 in this study we examined evidence of the ecohydrological separation in a humid subtropical area based on high frequency sampling two to four times in a month in addition to these two commonly used methods mentioned above we adopted a new approach referred to as the piecewise isotope balance method see section 2 6 for details the method requires high frequent samplings of isotopic composition of plant xylem water and precipitation the isotopic composition of plant xylem water generally reflects the integrated isotopic composition of plant accessible soil water with the assumption that no isotope fractionation occurs during root water uptake and water flow in plant xylem flanagan and ehleringer 1991 white et al 1985 with this assumption it is possible to use the isotopic composition of plant xylem water for investigating plant accessible water replenishment which can be used to infer the ecohydrological separation possibility in this study we aimed to answer the following questions 1 to what extent does ecohydrological separation happen in a humid subtropical area 2 what is the difference in assessing the ecohydrological separation hypothesis in this humid subtropical area by using the three methods dual isotope space lc excess assessment and the piecewise isotope balance method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment was conducted in a grove located in the suburb of changsha city in the central southern china 28 22 8 02 n 112 45 42 91 e 51 m a s l fig 1 this area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate generally with a dry and cold winter and a wet and hot summer mean annual air temperature is about 17 4 c and mean annual precipitation is 1447 mm mainly distributes from march to june resulting from different air mass influences in the summer monsoon season precipitation distributes unevenly between months often leading to low precipitation in midsummer luo et al 2016 soils at this site are silty loam with clay silt and sand content about 20 1 75 7 and 4 2 respectively the average soil bulk density at this site is about 1 32 g cm 3 the soil thickness at the study site exceeds 4 m based on a soil profile near the study grove see the fig s1 in the supplementary material the study grove is dominant by evergreen broadleaf trees cinnamomum camphora mixed with some cunninghamia lanceolata pinus massoniana and sparse grasses on soil surface we chose c camphora as our sample trees the average age and height of the trees are about 13 years and 9 m respectively most roots 85 of c camphora generally distribute in the shallow soil layer 0 40 cm in the study area according to yao et al 2003 we selected a plot of 20 40 m2 as the target site this site is flat slope 3 and thus the effect of lateral flow on root zone water can be neglected 2 2 sampling soil and twig xylem water sampling was conducted from march 2017 to april 2018 with a high sampling frequency two to four times in a month for twig samples only non photosynthetic stem sections about 4 cm in length and 1 5 2 cm in diameter were collected from 3 to 6 individual trees the bark was quickly removed before each sample was immediately sealed into glass bottles with parafilm soil samples were collected every 10 cm to a depth of 130 cm using a soil corer driven by an engine harmer christie engineering pty ltd australia three replicates of soil samples were collected near the trees from which the twig samples were taken meanwhile for each 10 cm soil section a 2 cm soil core 3 8 cm in diameter was collected for soil water content and bulk density analysis on the same day groundwater was collected from a well which was about 30 m away from the sampling site this well has a depth of 20 m with approximately 18 m to the water table it is pumped daily for the owners family use water from this well very likely represents the groundwater in this study area reflected by the elevation in fig 1 the well was perched by 30 min pumping at a rate about 1 m3 h before water samples were collected all samples were sealed in airtight vials placed in a cooler box and transported to the lab and stored in a refrigerator before analysis rainfall water samples were collected at an automatic meteorological station located in hunan normal university which is about 26 km away from the study site continuous precipitation sampling based on precipitation event greater than 0 1 mm for isotope analysis has been conducted for more than 8 years at the site we use these high frequency data to represent the isotopic composition of precipitation at the study site with an assumption that there is no significant difference between these two sites this is supported by high similarity in the precipitation event size pattern and isotopic composition between these two sites as shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material precipitation sampling includes rainfall water and snowfall if any more information of sampling at this site can be found in li et al 2015 wu et al 2015 2 3 soil water content soil volumetric water content θ cm3 cm3 was automatically monitored using a frequency domain reflectometry fdr system et100 insentek co ltd china this equipment estimates volumetric water content based on measurements of the apparent dielectric constant in the soil we installed et100 6 3 cm in diameter to a depth of 100 cm nearby the sample trees each et100 has two sensors at each layer with 10 cm intervals for monitoring soil water content and temperature average of each 10 cm soil layer the sampling interval was set as one hour 2 4 micrometeorological data an automatic weather station weatherhawk 232 usa was installed in an open area approximately 50 m from the grove meteorological variables including precipitation air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were measured at 30 min intervals 2 5 data analysis soil and twig xylem water samples were extracted using an automatic water extraction system li 2100 lica united technology limited china based on the cryogenic vacuum distillation method west et al 2006 generally a complete water extraction should be processed to obtain unfractionated water samples in this study we set moisture extraction time of 150 and 180 min for soil and twig samples respectively in order to collect more than 99 of the water from these samples isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o of the extracted water precipitation and well water were analyzed with a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotopic water analyzer los gatos research inc mountain view usa at the key laboratory of resources and environmental sciences hunan normal university δ2h and δ18o values are generally expressed in delta notation δ as 1 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where δ is the 2h h and 18o 16o ratio relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow r is the ratio 2h h and 18o 16o of sample and standard v smow respectively the accuracy of the crds analyzer was 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h previous studies have shown that organic materials in the extracted plant and soil water samples may cause spectral interference and lead to incorrect isotopic values by using isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy schultz et al 2011 west et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however such problems can be corrected by a standard curve method schultz et al 2011 methanol and ethanol are two main organic contaminations in the extracted water samples firstly we prepared water samples of known concentrations of methanol and ethanol and obtained the correcting curve according to wu et al 2014 then the spectral contamination identifier lwia sci post processing software was used to identify and quantify the spectral contamination only methanol contamination was found in twig xylem water samples in this study therefore all isotopic values for the extracted twig xylem water were corrected for the methanol contamination 2 6 methods for the ecohydrological separation assessment three methods dual isotope space lc excess and the piecewise isotope balance pib method were applied to examine the ecohydrological separation in this study for the dual isotope space method the ecohydrological separation of soil water sources for trees and groundwater is determined by the isotopic distinction between plant xylem water and groundwater with different degrees of deviation from the lmwl note that the lmwl in this study was produced based on isotopic composition of daily precipitation with the amount larger than 2 mm because we found there was no contribution of small rainfall events 2 mm to soil water for the lc excess assessment the isotopic composition of all water samples was compared to the lmwl by using lc excess which quantifies δ2h deviations from the lmwl in this study lc excess was calculated following landwehr and coplen 2006 2 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl generally the lc excess indicates the degree of offset of the sampled waters from the presumed source e g the lmwl once the lc excess values of plant xylem water are negative and significantly different from those of groundwater the ecohydrological separation is considered occurring for the piecewise isotope balance pib method based on high frequent sampling of twig xylem water and precipitation we calculated the proportion of plant accessible water reflected by the isotopic composition of xylem water within the root zone replenished by precipitation between two consecutive sampling events here we assumed that precipitation is the main source for plant accessible water replenishment meanwhile evaporation effects on water sources for plant use were neglected due to weak evaporation influencing the isotopic composition of waters at the study site this method has been applied to investigate root zone moisture replenishment in a mediterranean climate site unpublished in this study we only used δ18o values no fractionation of oxygen isotope was found during root water uptake in the literature for quantifying the replenishment proportion β using the following equation 3 β δ x i δ x i 1 δ p δ x i 1 100 where δx i and δx i 1 are δ18o values of twig xylem water between two consecutive sampling events δσp represents the volume weighted mean precipitation δ18o value between two consecutive samplings note that β was assumed to be 0 when δx i δx i 1 and δσp δx i 1 or when δx i δx i 1 and δσp δx i 1 in addition if the difference between δx i and δx i 1 was very small smaller than the accuracy 0 2 for δ18o during a short period when θ was high and did not change much between two sampling intervals β was assumed to be 0 only two such cases were found during the sampling period between 26 march and 9 april and between 29 april and 11 may 2017 2 7 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted using origin 9 0 software originlab usa the kruskall wallis test anova was used to analyze differences in isotopic composition and lc excess values among different water pools comparison of isotopic composition between different periods was analyzed via the non parametric mann whitney test 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in isotopic composition for specific waters fig 2 shows the range of isotopic composition for different water pools a large variability for h and o isotope composition is shown in precipitation with low values in summer and high values in spring which forms a local meteoric water line lmwl as δ2h 8 69 δ18o 19 99 r2 0 98 the volume weighted mean precipitation values for δ18o and δ2h are 7 1 and 42 6 respectively the isotopic composition of groundwater bulk soil water and twig xylem water plots close to or along the lmwl indicating that the evaporative effect is not significant in these water samples there are no significant differences in mean δ18o of twig xylem water groundwater and precipitation but mean δ18o of soil water is significant different p 0 05 with them such difference pattern for δ18o is not consistent with that for δ2h for groundwater δ18o and δ2h give a small seasonal variation in a range from 6 7 to 5 4 for δ18o and from 39 2 to 32 8 for δ2h fig 2 bulk soil water shows a notable temporal and spatial vertical variation in isotope values during the study period figs 2 and 3 b soil water is more enriched with heavy oxygen isotope in spring and more depleted in summer and autumn reflecting seasonal variation of precipitation inputs the mixing processes of δ18o within the soil profile over time are illustrated in fig 3b the δ18o of bulk soil water decreases with depth between march and early june 2017 however the largest decrease of δ18o in shallow soil water 0 40 cm occurs in mid june due to the more depleted oxygen isotope inputs from precipitation fig 3c the low δ18o in shallow soil persists to the end of autumn δ18o in shallow soil increases in the following season due to the replenishment and mixing by precipitation δ18o of deep soil water 60 cm maintains relatively stable between mid summer and winter the corresponding θ does not change much over time either twig xylem water δ18o has a small seasonal variability in comparison with that of precipitation fig 2a δ18o keeps relatively constant 3 89 0 33 in spring and decreases significantly p 0 05 in june and to a low value of 7 26 0 18 on 14th july this decrease indicates that root accessible water has been replenished twig water δ18o has been relatively stable 7 19 0 29 from july to february except for a slightly increase during a short dry period 21 rain free days in late july and two decreases in mid august and late october respectively due to replenishment by the precipitation inputs the δ18o value of twig xylem water is very close to that of snowfall and the groundwater in the early february indicating a relatively complete mixing in the soil and ecohydrological connection during the winter snowmelt twig xylem water δ18o shows a step change during the following spring 2018 in addition δ18o of twig water matches that of shallow soil water 0 40 cm for most of the time during the study period fig 3a and b 3 2 examination of the ecohydrological separation the isotopic values of all water samples are close to the lmwl as shown in the dual isotope plots in fig 2 which indicates that these waters have not experienced significant evaporation meanwhile twig xylem water and groundwater are not isotopically distinct reflected by δ18o thus this result does not support the ecohydrological separation based on the dual isotope method that has commonly been used in other studies precipitation shows both positive and negative lc excess values but they are not significantly different p 0 05 from 0 the lc excess of groundwater is significantly 0 p 0 05 fig 4 the lc excess values of soil water differ significantly from 0 twig xylem water has the most negative lc excess values and is significant different p 0 05 from that of groundwater this suggests that water extracted by plants twig xylem water is isotopically distinct from that recharges groundwater thus this result supports the ecohydrological separation hypothesis at the study site although the result based on the lc excess method suggests that ecohydrological separation occurs in this subtropical region it does not show the temporal variation in ecohydrological separation and its duration the lc excess values of twig xylem water are consistently different from that of groundwater during the whole study period fig 4 which seems to suggest that ecohydrological separation happens all the time at this site however this is unlikely the case as there have not been similar results reported in the literature therefore in order to investigate when the ecohydrological separation happens at this site and how long it lasts we investigate the dynamics of twig xylem water isotopic composition to examine the ecohydrological separation the δ18o values of twig water show relatively constant values between march and may 2017 while those of precipitation fluctuate this result indicates that precipitation is likely to have bypassed the root accessible water pool suggesting the ecohydrological separation occurs such an ecohydrological separation seems to happen in other periods at the study site e g late november to january and april 2018 based on the relatively constant isotope signature of twig xylem water the ecohydrological separation is further examined by the pib method which calculates plant accessible water replenishment shown in the following section 3 3 plant accessible water replenishment fig 5 shows the percentage of precipitation contributes to plant accessible water based on δ18o of twig water and precipitation the results indicate that no replenishment occurs between march and early may 2017 this means that plant accessible water does not mix with precipitation during this period and that the plant accessible water pool replenished by antecedent precipitation has maintained more than two months some similarities in the replenishment pattern can also be found in spring 2018 these replenishment patterns support the ecohydrological separation analyzed above the first large replenishment 41 occurs in later may and about 32 replenishment happen again between 7th june and 9th july 2017 due to heavy precipitation increasing θa to field capacity during the dry period from july to october 2017 plant accessible water has been replenished for several times such replenishments are easy to occur when θ is significantly low especially in the topsoil fig 3c however the isotopic composition of twig xylem water in september is close to that in august fig 3a this short life of replenishment signal suggests that they may occur only in the shallow root zone thus maintain for root water uptake only for about 2 3 weeks reflected by the variations in δ18o values of twig water in fig 3a in addition significant low replenishment 0 5 8 is inferred between december and mid january suggesting an ecohydrological separation during this period the highest replenishment 54 5 occurs between late january and early february which is mainly due to the contribution of snowmelt snowfall accounts for about 50 of precipitation during this period the δ18o value of twig xylem water observed in the early february is close to that of the snowfall fig 3a and groundwater indicating the possibility of ecohydrological connection such isotope signature of the replenished plant accessible water maintains until late march before the next replenishment event reflected by the δ18o values of twig xylem water in figs 3a and 5 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of the ecohydrological separation in subtropical humid climate the ecohydrological separation is observed in this subtropical humid study site the separation is more likely to occur in spring and winter season based on the integrated results from the lc excess and pib methods figs 4 and 5 such a pattern of separation differs from two other studies in the subtropical monsoon climate zones in china fig 6 qian et al 2017 suggest no ecohydrolgical separation in a subtropical riparian area based on the dual isotope space and lc excess method this may be due to significant contribution of river water and groundwater to plant water uptake in their riparian zone zhao et al 2018 report the existence of ecohydrolgical separation in may jun october and november but not during wet season in their study site between july and september based on the lc excess method nevertheless evaristo et al 2016 report that occurrence of ecohydrological separation in wet season for a humid tropical region the different results of these studies suggest complexity of the ecohydrological separation in humid climates based on the results from this present study and previous studies the ecohydrological separation very likely occurs in tropical and subtropical humid climates but with temporal pattern less predictable in this study the ecohydrological separation is more likely to occur in spring and winter and can last for a few months according to the pib inferred replenishment events generally small pores are filled first and dried out last while large pores will be a dominant pathway of infiltration water moving through the soil profile once small pores are fully filled brooks et al 2010 water in small pores is relatively immobile and has the longest residence time gouet kaplan et al 2009 therefore the common possibility for the separation in spring and winter at the study site is that immobile water plant accessible water for tree transpiration has been replenished by initial precipitation during the wet up period prior to these two seasons such as high replenishment in november 2017 or the early spring 2018 in fig 5 and such immobile water is sufficient for root water uptake but the condition for the separation seems to be different between spring and winter for spring the separation occurs under the condition of high soil water content and atmospheric demand precipitation over the remainder of the spring bypasses root zone through larger pores and preferential flow paths and does not seem to mix fully with immobile soil water used by plants reflected by relatively constant values of xylem water δ18o in fig 3a for winter the pre existing immobile water probably persists in small pores for a few months due to low depletion from evaporation and tree transpiration during this period based on sapflow measurements data not shown and thus does not mix with the subsequent precipitation inputs on the other hand the ecohydrological connection occurs during snowmelt in late winter at the site indicating that snowfall events occurred frequently at the study site based on records at the changsha weather station are likely to lead to the end of separation and be an important water source for root zone water replenishment 4 2 comparison of three methods for estimating the ecohydrological separation the results of the ecohydrological separation among these three methods are not consistent the dual isotope space method does not show evidence of the ecohydrological separation while the other two support ecohydrological separation at the study site due to weak evaporation isotope effect at the study site the isotopic composition of plant xylem and soil water are not distinguishable from precipitation water leaving the dual isotope method without a basis even though significant deviation of plant and soil water from the lmwl the dual isotope method cannot give an unambiguous determination of water source s of plant use bowling et al 2017 the lc excess assessment gives clear evidence of ecohydrological separation based on the significant difference in lc excess values between twig xylem water and groundwater few previous studies have focused on temporal variations in lc excess values of different water pools due to low frequency of isotope sampling hervé fernández et al 2016 and zhao et al 2018 suggest that the ecohydrological separation does not occur during the wet season based on temporal variations in lc excess values however temporal variations in lc excess values in this study infer a high degree of separation during the study period the consistently deviation of the lc excess values between twig xylem water and groundwater should not be caused by evaporation at the study site the potential cause for this is that the pre existing plant accessible water cannot be completely replaced by infiltration precipitation water also confirmed by the plant accessible water replenishment proportion 60 in fig 5 therefore the lc excess assessment does not seem to be a reliable method and its results need a further confirmation with other additional evidences for assessing the ecohydrological separation the pib method shows more details of the ecohydrological separation based on plant accessible water replenishment in this humid subtropical area the pattern of replenishment proportion is similar with the variation of δ18o values of xylem water in response to precipitation figs 3a and 5 the advantage of this method is that it shows when and how long the ecohydrological separation occurs and lasts furthermore the pib method only uses isotope data of plant xylem water and precipitation it does not rely on isotopically distinction between plant xylem water immobile water and ground stream water mobile water as such distinctions may not relate to soil water mobility mccutcheon et al 2017 despite the obvious advantages of the pib method some limitations still need to be noted the first limitation is that we neglect the evaporation effects between each sampling interval when calculating replenishment proportion nevertheless the effects of evaporation on isotope are not significant in this study which provides a good experiment condition to apply the pib method the second limitation is that there exist some uncertainties in estimation of replenishment proportion based on mean isotopic values of precipitation inputs between two consecutive sampling events it is difficult to accurately estimate the relative contribution of multiple precipitation events in any a sampling interval in this study a volume weighted isotopic composition was applied which can certainly lead to an error in pib calculation with an understanding that small events do not contribute to root zone moisture replenishment precipitation events smaller than 2 mm were excluded this is the best approximation we can have to apply for the pib method at this stage the third limitation is that the pib inferred replenishment does not necessarily suggest ecohydrological connectivity which needs to be confirmed with other evidences in addition the lateral flow should be considered if the study is conducted at a sloped site future studies need to take consideration of evaporation effects as well as lateral flow into investigations to further test the pib method in short there are no perfect methods for assessing the ecohydrological separation among current studies and caution should be taken in choosing a method for examining the ecohydrological separation in such a humid environment 5 conclusions the ecohydrological separation hypothesis was assessed based on high frequency of isotope sampling in the humid subtropical region of the central southern china in this study bulk soil water groundwater and twig xylem h and o isotopes plot close or along the local meteoric water line lmwl with isotopically similarity between groundwater and twig xylem water this indicates the evaporation effect on isotopic composition of these waters is not significant evaluations of the ecohydrological separation among the three methods are not consistent the dual isotope space method does not show evidence of ecohydrological separation the lc excess assessment suggests that the separation seems to occur during the whole study period which however is unlikely in this humid environment the piecewise isotope balance method supports the ecohydrological separation with more details in terms of the frequency and duration the pib result indicates that the ecohydrological separation does occur in this subtropical humid area it is more likely to occur in spring and winter snowmelt at the study site leads to mixture of the two water pools mobile and immobile water and thus the ecohydrological connection we suggest the ecohydrological separation should be examined with a combination of different methods aided with high frequency of samplings 6 declaration of interest statement we declare that we have no conflict of interest no financial or personal relationships with

6669,the ecohydrological separation between soil water sources for plant water uptake and groundwater recharge has been recently examined in various climate zones primarily based on isotopic composition of water the existence of the ecohydrological separation has profound implications for mechanistic ecohydrological modeling and water resource management however it is still unclear when and where the ecohydrological separation occurs especially in humid regions in this study high frequency sampling of precipitation bulk soil water groundwater and twig xylem water for hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition measurement was conducted in a humid subtropical site in the central southern china from march 2017 to april 2018 we examined evidence of the ecohydrological separation with three methods dual isotope space line conditioned excess lc excess and the piecewise isotope balance pib method the results show that the isotopic composition of plant xylem and bulk soil water are not distinguishable from those of precipitation water on the dual isotope space due to a weak evaporation effect at the study site indicating that there is no evidence of the ecohydrological separation however the other two methods support the ecohydrological separation in this humid area with the results from the pib method revealing more temporal details the present study suggests that the ecohydrological separation can happen in subtropical humid climate it is more likely to occur in spring and winter at the study site when plant accessible water pool has been replenished by antecedent precipitation while ecohydrological connection seems to occur during winter snowmelt with the limitations of three methods the caution should be taken when only one method is applied in examining the ecohydrological separation in such an environment keywords ecohydrological separation stable isotopes plant accessible water water replenishment lc excess piecewise isotope balance method 1 introduction soil water is the immediate water source for plants in the terrestrial ecosystems thus the plant accessible water in soil is essential for plant growth generally soil water has been assumed to be a well mixed water pool hewlett and hibbert 1966 mccutcheon et al 2017 which means that plants extract water from the same pool that drains into groundwater and or flows into streams however recent studies suggest that streams and plants appear to have water originated from two different water pools mobile water for groundwater stream recharge and immobile water for plant use such a phenomenon was first proposed in brooks et al 2010 based on distinguished isotopic composition between stream and plant water in a mediterranean climate zone thereafter this phenomenon was referred to as the two water worlds mcdonnell 2014 or the ecohydrological separation hypothesis geris et al 2015 mccutcheon et al 2017 evidence for the ecohydrological separation hypothesis has been reported in various climate zones bowling et al 2017 brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2016 gierke et al 2016 goldsmith et al 2012 hervé fernández et al 2016 mccutcheon et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 meanwhile at the global scale evaristo et al 2015 suggest that the ecohydrological separation occurs at 80 of the sites and good et al 2015 report that 38 of surface water comes from the plant accessible soil water pool these studies suggest that the ecohydrological separation may commonly occur these findings not only challenge the assumptions e g water in soils is well mixed that have been commonly accepted in conceptualizations of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles but also have practical implications for agricultural fertilizer application surface induced groundwater pollution and fate and transport of subsurface contaminants phillips 2010 the reported degrees of the ecohydrological separation vary greatly among different studies the highest separation was estimated by brooks et al 2010 in a mediterranean climate in which the separation exists from the rainy season winter to the next wet up period in autumn however most other studies show that the ecohydrological separation seems to be temporal and more likely to occur during dry periods brooks et al 2010 in humid climate the reported results of ecohydrological separation are not consistent among studies for example no marked separation was found in wet environments geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 two studies qian et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 with investigations being conducted in the same climate zone subtropical monsoon climate showed contrasting results of the ecohydrological separation the inconsistency in these previous studies suggests that it is still unclear when and where the ecohydrological separation occurs especially in humid regions despite increasing evidence of the ecohydrological separation several potential problems arise from current methods in the investigation of the ecohydrological separation firstly current methods for assessing the ecohydrological separation do not necessarily work for humid environments the commonly used methods for assessing the ecohydrological separation hypothesis are the so called dual isotope space and line conditioned excess lc excess assessment for the dual isotope space groundwater and stream water generally plot on or near a local meteoric water line lmwl based on the seasonal δ2h and δ18o variations in precipitation soil water usually varies along a soil water evaporation line swel with different degree of deviation from the lmwl due to different evaporation and mixing processes the ecohydrological separation is considered occurring when plant water is plotted to the right of the lmwl and close to the swel with isotopic distinction from mobile water stream and ground water for the lc excess assessment this variable is to quantify the isotopic distance of a water sample from the lmwl landwehr and coplen 2006 theoretically precipitation lc excess values will fluctuate near zero so do the lc excess values of mobile water soil water that has undergone evaporation will have a negative lc excess value thus evaluation of the ecohydrological separation is based on the significant difference in the lc excess values between plant water and mobile water note that these two methods are effective based on the assumption that plant use water has undergone notable evaporation however this assumption may be problematic for an environment where evaporative effects on the isotopic composition of environmental waters are not significant this may be one reason for the inconsistent results of the reported ecohydrological separation in humid climate as we mentioned above secondly common soil water samplings do not necessarily reflect the isotopic composition of water used by plants recently sprenger et al 2015 gave an overview of various methods of soil water extraction for stable isotope analysis which shows that different methods extract pore waters of different mobility for those previous studies on the ecohydrological separation bulk soil water that includes both mobile and immobile matric bound water brooks et al 2010 was sampled with the cryogenic vacuum distillation in addition to bulk soil water sampling in some studies mobile soil water was extracted using suction lysimeters brooks et al 2010 hervé fernández et al 2016 centrifugation geris et al 2015 or wick samplers gierke et al 2016 as most studies on the ecohydrological separation assume that plants rely on the immobile soil water it should be reasonable to investigate the isotopic composition of immobile water to reflect the isotopic composition of water used by plants however it is difficult to sample the immobile soil water that is really extracted by plants based on current technologies although the isotopic composition of bulk soil water generally based on point measurements can reflect that of the water acquired by plants in some case e g during dry periods such bulk soil water samplings may give uncertainties in inferring the isotopic composition of water acquired by plants during wet periods finally the different degrees of the ecohydrological separation reported in the literature can be partly resulted from a low frequency of isotope sampling as hervé fernández et al 2016 mentioned that sampling frequency is still one of the most significant limitations in ecohydrological studies many field campaigns in the previous studies only have samples collected a few times per season e g wet dry season brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2016 geris et al 2015 goldsmith et al 2012 a low sampling frequency likely misses the detail of temporal variation such temporal variation likely provides important information to understand the mechanism of ecohydrological separation high frequency sampling of plant water and soil water for isotopic composition analysis is thus especially beneficial for improving understanding of the ecohydrological separation mcdonnell 2014 in this study we examined evidence of the ecohydrological separation in a humid subtropical area based on high frequency sampling two to four times in a month in addition to these two commonly used methods mentioned above we adopted a new approach referred to as the piecewise isotope balance method see section 2 6 for details the method requires high frequent samplings of isotopic composition of plant xylem water and precipitation the isotopic composition of plant xylem water generally reflects the integrated isotopic composition of plant accessible soil water with the assumption that no isotope fractionation occurs during root water uptake and water flow in plant xylem flanagan and ehleringer 1991 white et al 1985 with this assumption it is possible to use the isotopic composition of plant xylem water for investigating plant accessible water replenishment which can be used to infer the ecohydrological separation possibility in this study we aimed to answer the following questions 1 to what extent does ecohydrological separation happen in a humid subtropical area 2 what is the difference in assessing the ecohydrological separation hypothesis in this humid subtropical area by using the three methods dual isotope space lc excess assessment and the piecewise isotope balance method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment was conducted in a grove located in the suburb of changsha city in the central southern china 28 22 8 02 n 112 45 42 91 e 51 m a s l fig 1 this area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate generally with a dry and cold winter and a wet and hot summer mean annual air temperature is about 17 4 c and mean annual precipitation is 1447 mm mainly distributes from march to june resulting from different air mass influences in the summer monsoon season precipitation distributes unevenly between months often leading to low precipitation in midsummer luo et al 2016 soils at this site are silty loam with clay silt and sand content about 20 1 75 7 and 4 2 respectively the average soil bulk density at this site is about 1 32 g cm 3 the soil thickness at the study site exceeds 4 m based on a soil profile near the study grove see the fig s1 in the supplementary material the study grove is dominant by evergreen broadleaf trees cinnamomum camphora mixed with some cunninghamia lanceolata pinus massoniana and sparse grasses on soil surface we chose c camphora as our sample trees the average age and height of the trees are about 13 years and 9 m respectively most roots 85 of c camphora generally distribute in the shallow soil layer 0 40 cm in the study area according to yao et al 2003 we selected a plot of 20 40 m2 as the target site this site is flat slope 3 and thus the effect of lateral flow on root zone water can be neglected 2 2 sampling soil and twig xylem water sampling was conducted from march 2017 to april 2018 with a high sampling frequency two to four times in a month for twig samples only non photosynthetic stem sections about 4 cm in length and 1 5 2 cm in diameter were collected from 3 to 6 individual trees the bark was quickly removed before each sample was immediately sealed into glass bottles with parafilm soil samples were collected every 10 cm to a depth of 130 cm using a soil corer driven by an engine harmer christie engineering pty ltd australia three replicates of soil samples were collected near the trees from which the twig samples were taken meanwhile for each 10 cm soil section a 2 cm soil core 3 8 cm in diameter was collected for soil water content and bulk density analysis on the same day groundwater was collected from a well which was about 30 m away from the sampling site this well has a depth of 20 m with approximately 18 m to the water table it is pumped daily for the owners family use water from this well very likely represents the groundwater in this study area reflected by the elevation in fig 1 the well was perched by 30 min pumping at a rate about 1 m3 h before water samples were collected all samples were sealed in airtight vials placed in a cooler box and transported to the lab and stored in a refrigerator before analysis rainfall water samples were collected at an automatic meteorological station located in hunan normal university which is about 26 km away from the study site continuous precipitation sampling based on precipitation event greater than 0 1 mm for isotope analysis has been conducted for more than 8 years at the site we use these high frequency data to represent the isotopic composition of precipitation at the study site with an assumption that there is no significant difference between these two sites this is supported by high similarity in the precipitation event size pattern and isotopic composition between these two sites as shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material precipitation sampling includes rainfall water and snowfall if any more information of sampling at this site can be found in li et al 2015 wu et al 2015 2 3 soil water content soil volumetric water content θ cm3 cm3 was automatically monitored using a frequency domain reflectometry fdr system et100 insentek co ltd china this equipment estimates volumetric water content based on measurements of the apparent dielectric constant in the soil we installed et100 6 3 cm in diameter to a depth of 100 cm nearby the sample trees each et100 has two sensors at each layer with 10 cm intervals for monitoring soil water content and temperature average of each 10 cm soil layer the sampling interval was set as one hour 2 4 micrometeorological data an automatic weather station weatherhawk 232 usa was installed in an open area approximately 50 m from the grove meteorological variables including precipitation air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were measured at 30 min intervals 2 5 data analysis soil and twig xylem water samples were extracted using an automatic water extraction system li 2100 lica united technology limited china based on the cryogenic vacuum distillation method west et al 2006 generally a complete water extraction should be processed to obtain unfractionated water samples in this study we set moisture extraction time of 150 and 180 min for soil and twig samples respectively in order to collect more than 99 of the water from these samples isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o of the extracted water precipitation and well water were analyzed with a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotopic water analyzer los gatos research inc mountain view usa at the key laboratory of resources and environmental sciences hunan normal university δ2h and δ18o values are generally expressed in delta notation δ as 1 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where δ is the 2h h and 18o 16o ratio relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow r is the ratio 2h h and 18o 16o of sample and standard v smow respectively the accuracy of the crds analyzer was 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h previous studies have shown that organic materials in the extracted plant and soil water samples may cause spectral interference and lead to incorrect isotopic values by using isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy schultz et al 2011 west et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however such problems can be corrected by a standard curve method schultz et al 2011 methanol and ethanol are two main organic contaminations in the extracted water samples firstly we prepared water samples of known concentrations of methanol and ethanol and obtained the correcting curve according to wu et al 2014 then the spectral contamination identifier lwia sci post processing software was used to identify and quantify the spectral contamination only methanol contamination was found in twig xylem water samples in this study therefore all isotopic values for the extracted twig xylem water were corrected for the methanol contamination 2 6 methods for the ecohydrological separation assessment three methods dual isotope space lc excess and the piecewise isotope balance pib method were applied to examine the ecohydrological separation in this study for the dual isotope space method the ecohydrological separation of soil water sources for trees and groundwater is determined by the isotopic distinction between plant xylem water and groundwater with different degrees of deviation from the lmwl note that the lmwl in this study was produced based on isotopic composition of daily precipitation with the amount larger than 2 mm because we found there was no contribution of small rainfall events 2 mm to soil water for the lc excess assessment the isotopic composition of all water samples was compared to the lmwl by using lc excess which quantifies δ2h deviations from the lmwl in this study lc excess was calculated following landwehr and coplen 2006 2 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl generally the lc excess indicates the degree of offset of the sampled waters from the presumed source e g the lmwl once the lc excess values of plant xylem water are negative and significantly different from those of groundwater the ecohydrological separation is considered occurring for the piecewise isotope balance pib method based on high frequent sampling of twig xylem water and precipitation we calculated the proportion of plant accessible water reflected by the isotopic composition of xylem water within the root zone replenished by precipitation between two consecutive sampling events here we assumed that precipitation is the main source for plant accessible water replenishment meanwhile evaporation effects on water sources for plant use were neglected due to weak evaporation influencing the isotopic composition of waters at the study site this method has been applied to investigate root zone moisture replenishment in a mediterranean climate site unpublished in this study we only used δ18o values no fractionation of oxygen isotope was found during root water uptake in the literature for quantifying the replenishment proportion β using the following equation 3 β δ x i δ x i 1 δ p δ x i 1 100 where δx i and δx i 1 are δ18o values of twig xylem water between two consecutive sampling events δσp represents the volume weighted mean precipitation δ18o value between two consecutive samplings note that β was assumed to be 0 when δx i δx i 1 and δσp δx i 1 or when δx i δx i 1 and δσp δx i 1 in addition if the difference between δx i and δx i 1 was very small smaller than the accuracy 0 2 for δ18o during a short period when θ was high and did not change much between two sampling intervals β was assumed to be 0 only two such cases were found during the sampling period between 26 march and 9 april and between 29 april and 11 may 2017 2 7 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted using origin 9 0 software originlab usa the kruskall wallis test anova was used to analyze differences in isotopic composition and lc excess values among different water pools comparison of isotopic composition between different periods was analyzed via the non parametric mann whitney test 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in isotopic composition for specific waters fig 2 shows the range of isotopic composition for different water pools a large variability for h and o isotope composition is shown in precipitation with low values in summer and high values in spring which forms a local meteoric water line lmwl as δ2h 8 69 δ18o 19 99 r2 0 98 the volume weighted mean precipitation values for δ18o and δ2h are 7 1 and 42 6 respectively the isotopic composition of groundwater bulk soil water and twig xylem water plots close to or along the lmwl indicating that the evaporative effect is not significant in these water samples there are no significant differences in mean δ18o of twig xylem water groundwater and precipitation but mean δ18o of soil water is significant different p 0 05 with them such difference pattern for δ18o is not consistent with that for δ2h for groundwater δ18o and δ2h give a small seasonal variation in a range from 6 7 to 5 4 for δ18o and from 39 2 to 32 8 for δ2h fig 2 bulk soil water shows a notable temporal and spatial vertical variation in isotope values during the study period figs 2 and 3 b soil water is more enriched with heavy oxygen isotope in spring and more depleted in summer and autumn reflecting seasonal variation of precipitation inputs the mixing processes of δ18o within the soil profile over time are illustrated in fig 3b the δ18o of bulk soil water decreases with depth between march and early june 2017 however the largest decrease of δ18o in shallow soil water 0 40 cm occurs in mid june due to the more depleted oxygen isotope inputs from precipitation fig 3c the low δ18o in shallow soil persists to the end of autumn δ18o in shallow soil increases in the following season due to the replenishment and mixing by precipitation δ18o of deep soil water 60 cm maintains relatively stable between mid summer and winter the corresponding θ does not change much over time either twig xylem water δ18o has a small seasonal variability in comparison with that of precipitation fig 2a δ18o keeps relatively constant 3 89 0 33 in spring and decreases significantly p 0 05 in june and to a low value of 7 26 0 18 on 14th july this decrease indicates that root accessible water has been replenished twig water δ18o has been relatively stable 7 19 0 29 from july to february except for a slightly increase during a short dry period 21 rain free days in late july and two decreases in mid august and late october respectively due to replenishment by the precipitation inputs the δ18o value of twig xylem water is very close to that of snowfall and the groundwater in the early february indicating a relatively complete mixing in the soil and ecohydrological connection during the winter snowmelt twig xylem water δ18o shows a step change during the following spring 2018 in addition δ18o of twig water matches that of shallow soil water 0 40 cm for most of the time during the study period fig 3a and b 3 2 examination of the ecohydrological separation the isotopic values of all water samples are close to the lmwl as shown in the dual isotope plots in fig 2 which indicates that these waters have not experienced significant evaporation meanwhile twig xylem water and groundwater are not isotopically distinct reflected by δ18o thus this result does not support the ecohydrological separation based on the dual isotope method that has commonly been used in other studies precipitation shows both positive and negative lc excess values but they are not significantly different p 0 05 from 0 the lc excess of groundwater is significantly 0 p 0 05 fig 4 the lc excess values of soil water differ significantly from 0 twig xylem water has the most negative lc excess values and is significant different p 0 05 from that of groundwater this suggests that water extracted by plants twig xylem water is isotopically distinct from that recharges groundwater thus this result supports the ecohydrological separation hypothesis at the study site although the result based on the lc excess method suggests that ecohydrological separation occurs in this subtropical region it does not show the temporal variation in ecohydrological separation and its duration the lc excess values of twig xylem water are consistently different from that of groundwater during the whole study period fig 4 which seems to suggest that ecohydrological separation happens all the time at this site however this is unlikely the case as there have not been similar results reported in the literature therefore in order to investigate when the ecohydrological separation happens at this site and how long it lasts we investigate the dynamics of twig xylem water isotopic composition to examine the ecohydrological separation the δ18o values of twig water show relatively constant values between march and may 2017 while those of precipitation fluctuate this result indicates that precipitation is likely to have bypassed the root accessible water pool suggesting the ecohydrological separation occurs such an ecohydrological separation seems to happen in other periods at the study site e g late november to january and april 2018 based on the relatively constant isotope signature of twig xylem water the ecohydrological separation is further examined by the pib method which calculates plant accessible water replenishment shown in the following section 3 3 plant accessible water replenishment fig 5 shows the percentage of precipitation contributes to plant accessible water based on δ18o of twig water and precipitation the results indicate that no replenishment occurs between march and early may 2017 this means that plant accessible water does not mix with precipitation during this period and that the plant accessible water pool replenished by antecedent precipitation has maintained more than two months some similarities in the replenishment pattern can also be found in spring 2018 these replenishment patterns support the ecohydrological separation analyzed above the first large replenishment 41 occurs in later may and about 32 replenishment happen again between 7th june and 9th july 2017 due to heavy precipitation increasing θa to field capacity during the dry period from july to october 2017 plant accessible water has been replenished for several times such replenishments are easy to occur when θ is significantly low especially in the topsoil fig 3c however the isotopic composition of twig xylem water in september is close to that in august fig 3a this short life of replenishment signal suggests that they may occur only in the shallow root zone thus maintain for root water uptake only for about 2 3 weeks reflected by the variations in δ18o values of twig water in fig 3a in addition significant low replenishment 0 5 8 is inferred between december and mid january suggesting an ecohydrological separation during this period the highest replenishment 54 5 occurs between late january and early february which is mainly due to the contribution of snowmelt snowfall accounts for about 50 of precipitation during this period the δ18o value of twig xylem water observed in the early february is close to that of the snowfall fig 3a and groundwater indicating the possibility of ecohydrological connection such isotope signature of the replenished plant accessible water maintains until late march before the next replenishment event reflected by the δ18o values of twig xylem water in figs 3a and 5 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of the ecohydrological separation in subtropical humid climate the ecohydrological separation is observed in this subtropical humid study site the separation is more likely to occur in spring and winter season based on the integrated results from the lc excess and pib methods figs 4 and 5 such a pattern of separation differs from two other studies in the subtropical monsoon climate zones in china fig 6 qian et al 2017 suggest no ecohydrolgical separation in a subtropical riparian area based on the dual isotope space and lc excess method this may be due to significant contribution of river water and groundwater to plant water uptake in their riparian zone zhao et al 2018 report the existence of ecohydrolgical separation in may jun october and november but not during wet season in their study site between july and september based on the lc excess method nevertheless evaristo et al 2016 report that occurrence of ecohydrological separation in wet season for a humid tropical region the different results of these studies suggest complexity of the ecohydrological separation in humid climates based on the results from this present study and previous studies the ecohydrological separation very likely occurs in tropical and subtropical humid climates but with temporal pattern less predictable in this study the ecohydrological separation is more likely to occur in spring and winter and can last for a few months according to the pib inferred replenishment events generally small pores are filled first and dried out last while large pores will be a dominant pathway of infiltration water moving through the soil profile once small pores are fully filled brooks et al 2010 water in small pores is relatively immobile and has the longest residence time gouet kaplan et al 2009 therefore the common possibility for the separation in spring and winter at the study site is that immobile water plant accessible water for tree transpiration has been replenished by initial precipitation during the wet up period prior to these two seasons such as high replenishment in november 2017 or the early spring 2018 in fig 5 and such immobile water is sufficient for root water uptake but the condition for the separation seems to be different between spring and winter for spring the separation occurs under the condition of high soil water content and atmospheric demand precipitation over the remainder of the spring bypasses root zone through larger pores and preferential flow paths and does not seem to mix fully with immobile soil water used by plants reflected by relatively constant values of xylem water δ18o in fig 3a for winter the pre existing immobile water probably persists in small pores for a few months due to low depletion from evaporation and tree transpiration during this period based on sapflow measurements data not shown and thus does not mix with the subsequent precipitation inputs on the other hand the ecohydrological connection occurs during snowmelt in late winter at the site indicating that snowfall events occurred frequently at the study site based on records at the changsha weather station are likely to lead to the end of separation and be an important water source for root zone water replenishment 4 2 comparison of three methods for estimating the ecohydrological separation the results of the ecohydrological separation among these three methods are not consistent the dual isotope space method does not show evidence of the ecohydrological separation while the other two support ecohydrological separation at the study site due to weak evaporation isotope effect at the study site the isotopic composition of plant xylem and soil water are not distinguishable from precipitation water leaving the dual isotope method without a basis even though significant deviation of plant and soil water from the lmwl the dual isotope method cannot give an unambiguous determination of water source s of plant use bowling et al 2017 the lc excess assessment gives clear evidence of ecohydrological separation based on the significant difference in lc excess values between twig xylem water and groundwater few previous studies have focused on temporal variations in lc excess values of different water pools due to low frequency of isotope sampling hervé fernández et al 2016 and zhao et al 2018 suggest that the ecohydrological separation does not occur during the wet season based on temporal variations in lc excess values however temporal variations in lc excess values in this study infer a high degree of separation during the study period the consistently deviation of the lc excess values between twig xylem water and groundwater should not be caused by evaporation at the study site the potential cause for this is that the pre existing plant accessible water cannot be completely replaced by infiltration precipitation water also confirmed by the plant accessible water replenishment proportion 60 in fig 5 therefore the lc excess assessment does not seem to be a reliable method and its results need a further confirmation with other additional evidences for assessing the ecohydrological separation the pib method shows more details of the ecohydrological separation based on plant accessible water replenishment in this humid subtropical area the pattern of replenishment proportion is similar with the variation of δ18o values of xylem water in response to precipitation figs 3a and 5 the advantage of this method is that it shows when and how long the ecohydrological separation occurs and lasts furthermore the pib method only uses isotope data of plant xylem water and precipitation it does not rely on isotopically distinction between plant xylem water immobile water and ground stream water mobile water as such distinctions may not relate to soil water mobility mccutcheon et al 2017 despite the obvious advantages of the pib method some limitations still need to be noted the first limitation is that we neglect the evaporation effects between each sampling interval when calculating replenishment proportion nevertheless the effects of evaporation on isotope are not significant in this study which provides a good experiment condition to apply the pib method the second limitation is that there exist some uncertainties in estimation of replenishment proportion based on mean isotopic values of precipitation inputs between two consecutive sampling events it is difficult to accurately estimate the relative contribution of multiple precipitation events in any a sampling interval in this study a volume weighted isotopic composition was applied which can certainly lead to an error in pib calculation with an understanding that small events do not contribute to root zone moisture replenishment precipitation events smaller than 2 mm were excluded this is the best approximation we can have to apply for the pib method at this stage the third limitation is that the pib inferred replenishment does not necessarily suggest ecohydrological connectivity which needs to be confirmed with other evidences in addition the lateral flow should be considered if the study is conducted at a sloped site future studies need to take consideration of evaporation effects as well as lateral flow into investigations to further test the pib method in short there are no perfect methods for assessing the ecohydrological separation among current studies and caution should be taken in choosing a method for examining the ecohydrological separation in such a humid environment 5 conclusions the ecohydrological separation hypothesis was assessed based on high frequency of isotope sampling in the humid subtropical region of the central southern china in this study bulk soil water groundwater and twig xylem h and o isotopes plot close or along the local meteoric water line lmwl with isotopically similarity between groundwater and twig xylem water this indicates the evaporation effect on isotopic composition of these waters is not significant evaluations of the ecohydrological separation among the three methods are not consistent the dual isotope space method does not show evidence of ecohydrological separation the lc excess assessment suggests that the separation seems to occur during the whole study period which however is unlikely in this humid environment the piecewise isotope balance method supports the ecohydrological separation with more details in terms of the frequency and duration the pib result indicates that the ecohydrological separation does occur in this subtropical humid area it is more likely to occur in spring and winter snowmelt at the study site leads to mixture of the two water pools mobile and immobile water and thus the ecohydrological connection we suggest the ecohydrological separation should be examined with a combination of different methods aided with high frequency of samplings 6 declaration of interest statement we declare that we have no conflict of interest no financial or personal relationships with
