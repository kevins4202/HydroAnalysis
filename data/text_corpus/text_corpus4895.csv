24475,the ecological carrying capacity ecc assessment in coastal zones is essential for sustainable coastal management but there remains a lack of a more effective assessment method to be applied across broad contexts in this study we proposed the concept of spatial scene a geographical unit with a coordinate position and high unification in social economic attributes land cover ecological function and externalities to substitute for the land use land cover lulc in the traditional three dimensional ecological footprint ef3d model thereby establishing a novel framework for coastal ecc cecc assessment the coastal zone of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba was chosen to examine the applicability and reliability of our framework results showed that the cecc estimated by spatial scene in the study area reached 0 1877 gha per capita totaled 3 99 million gha in 2019 and the scenes of marine capture and forest provided the largest cecc the per capita ecological footprint size efsize ecological footprint depth efdepth and ef3d reached 0 1684 gha 14 35 and 2 42 gha respectively representing unsustainable development in the gba coastal zone the ef3d mainly distributed in scenes of grassland forest industrial marine capture coastal intertidal and offshore cio port shipping traffic station dryland and cio industrial urban while only the scenes of services and cio tourism entertainment were within cecc and therefore sustainable hong kong huizhou and dongguan had the largest per capita ef3d compared to our results the cecc and efsize estimated by the traditional ef3d model were respectively 18 and 6 lower while their efdepth and ef3d were respectively 21 and 13 higher which should be attributed to the significant differences in classification standard and scale between spatial scene and lulc our results showed higher correlations and more significant relationships with total gross domestic product gdp marine gdp and main energy ef than those based on the traditional lulc indicating a better reflection of the economic development status energy consumption structure and marine economic development modes by our framework it is recommended to accelerate the industrial transformation and upgrading and strengthen the conservation of ecological agricultural and marine space in order to promote the sustainable development of gba coastal zone our study revealed that our framework is capable of serving as a more effective and accurate method for assessing cecc and sustainability graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coastal zone ecological carrying capacity spatial scene three dimensional ecological footprint guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area 1 introduction as the vast area radiating to the mainland islands and adjacent seas based on the coastline the coastal zone involves both marine and terrestrial ecosystems making it the most dynamic complicated and changeable area in the world unced 1992 crossland et al 2005 su 2015 and is an important entry point for sustainable scientific research liu et al 2020a in recent decades it has been recognized that coastal zones have suffered from severe natural habitat and resource loss environmental pollution and ecological degradation duxbury and dickinson 2007 mee 2012 wu et al 2018 which substantially attributes to the observed unsustainable development pattern from coastal land reclamation high energy consumption and high pollution industries lakshmi and rajagopalan 2000 yu et al 2017 sengupta et al 2018 therefore the sustainability assessment of current development patterns is essential for sustainable coastal management the ecological carrying capacity ecc refers to the maximum limit of human activities accommodated by the regional natural resources ecological environment and social economy under rational natural resource exploitation and benign circulation of the environment arrow et al 1995 fan and he 2017 zhao et al 2019a and is an effective tool for evaluating sustainability rajaram and das 2011 chen et al 2021 ecc not only reflects the degree of utilization of resources and the intensity of damage to the eco environment by human activities zhang et al 2018 but also reveals the deficit and surplus of specific ecosystem components under the prevailing social economy development ma et al 2017 thus it is more easily understood by the public and decision makers wang et al 2014 peng et al 2016 for the coastal zone the overall deterioration of the eco environment is a concrete indication that the ecc therein has already been saturated or overburdened wang et al 2017 which indicates an urgent need to establish an effective assessment for coastal ecc and sustainability there are several approaches for ecc and sustainability evaluation such as the ecological footprint model efm galli et al 2012 ahmed et al 2020 comprehensive evaluation index system ceis method wei et al 2014 liu et al 2020a system dynamics models wang et al 2014 and state space models tang et al 2016 however many of the relevant studies have used these methods to evaluate the ecc of terrestrial ecosystems without deep concern for coastal and marine ecosystems as a narrow feature of mainland tidal flats and adjacent seas and a natural society economy complex ecosystem with significant human land interaction the ecc assessment for coastal zone should consider the comprehensive impact of different social activities economic developments and ecological process in both terrestrial and marine systems simultaneously which is significantly different from those for terrestrial areas to the best of our knowledge the ecc evaluation of coastal and marine ecosystems is still relatively rare compared to terrestrial ecosystems but it has increased rapidly in recent years wei et al 2014 ma et al 2017 and liu et al 2020a respectively proposed a ceis reflecting socioeconomic development resource consumption and ecological resilience associated with coastal and marine areas to assess the integrated coastal carrying capacity peng et al 2018 used an improved emergy ecological footprint method and four indices to evaluate the sustainability of the complex eco economic system of qingdao china and xu et al 2019 evaluated the sea use carrying capacity based on marine functional zoning and exploitation indices concerning resource consumption and environmental impact it is clear that most relevant studies prefer to assess coastal and marine ecc by building up a ceis although the ceis demonstrates the influence of society economy and ecology on ecc explicitly the diverse indicators vary in studies without unified criteria which might lead to missed or incorrect assessment index selection and the different weight values in disparate studies result in significant differences or even conflicting conclusions in addition because the ecc evaluation indices needs to adapt to the social and environmental conditions of a study area it is inherently impossible to establish a uniform ceis for ecc comparison between different regions thus limiting its broad application among all ecc evaluation methods the efm is the most widely used worldwide wackernagel et al 1999 borucke et al 2013 wwf 2020 efm terms the ecc as biocapacity which represents the maximum theoretical rate of resource supply that can be sustained in its territory under prevailing technology and management schemes monfreda et al 2004 lin et al 2018 as a component based integrated and multiscale accounting system rather than a normalized indicator system the efm allows the metric to be applied across broad contexts which is a key element of sustainability assessment frameworks sala et al 2015 lin et al 2018 and fulfills the need to track the use and overuse of different natural resources however the principal limitation of efm is that it recognizes the six land use land cover lulc types that is cropland grazing land fishing grounds forests built up land and carbon uptake land galli et al 2012 as biocapacity components to describe the differences in biological productivity between areas which are not capable of expressing the change in ecc and ecological footprint ef brought by the different production modes lifestyles technology and ecological environment protection strategies and thus might lead to inaccurate results especially in a coastal zone at the regional scale where intense human activities complex land use modes and coexisting land and ocean exploitation and protection the efm cannot meet the needs of ecc assessment to address this deficiency and fill the gaps in coastal ecc assessment we propose a concept of spatial scene and establish a novel framework for coastal ecc cecc assessment based on the spatial scene and three dimensional efm an enhanced version of classical efm we then select the coastal zone of guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area china to examine the applicability and reliability of our framework this study is expected to serve as an important reference for studies on ecc assessment in coastal and marine areas and even for applications in terrestrial regions 2 conceptual framework and methodology 2 1 concept of spatial scene space and scene are two different perspectives in geographic analysis space or the spatial perspective is one of the most fundamental concepts of geography tuan 1977 and generally refers to the surface and near surface of the earth organized by coordinate systems or geometric measures offering a measurable or computable analytical framework for the objective physical environment goodchild and li 2011 roche 2016 scene on the other hand originates from comparatively complex sources one is extended from film and drama where the elements of venues props dialog clothing and actors interconnect organically to express a certain idea wu 2011 the chicago school of economics introduced the concept of scene into the urban development of the post industrial era clark 2007 miller and silver 2015 which specifies scene as a range of symbolic meanings that collections of amenities formed by various consumption practices expressing local culture and key values of cities to residents and visitors silver et al 2011 clark and silver 2013 the other is derived from scene recognition technology in computer vision which trains the computer to identify the context automatically and accurately in images zhou et al 2014 this concept was then introduced into the field of interpretation and recognition of high resolution remote sensing images called scene classification to extract and classify a variety of land cover types and ground objects within the remote sensing images into respective semantic categories especially in urban built up areas xiao et al 2010 cheng et al 2017 rao et al 2021 the former emphasizes the immaterial features of scene that is the metaphysical identity of the cultural connotation value orientation and lifestyle the latter emphasizes the material features that is the similarity of land cover type land use mode and landscape structure they both expound the connotations of scenes from different dimensions however the existing concepts about scenes mainly focus on the classification of leisure oriented consumption places and lulc objects in cities which is similar to urban functional zoning namely identifying zones in a city in accordance with their specific urban functions in human activities or land use type zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b such as residential commercial industrial water and forest zones zotic et al 2010 ignoring the ecological dimension of landscapes with the tightening of resource and environmental constraints ecological and environmental protection has received unprecedented attention in recent years in china concepts of ecological zoning such as ecological function zoning fang et al 2008 ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china mep chinese academy of sciences cas 2008 major function oriented zoning state council of the prc 2010 fan et al 2012 and ecological space planning central committee of the cpc and state council of the prc 2019 have emerged furthermore the practices of ecological utilization of coasts and oceans protection and improvement of coastal and marine eco environments have become the central focus in coastal and marine management and functional zoning in recent decades clark 1996 state bureau of oceanic administration soa 2012 therefore the ecological dimension should be added to the concept of scene in other words scene classification should also consider the sensitivity of eco environment and the ecosystem function of landscapes as well as the environmental impact of human activities therein consequently we regard the spatial scene as a geographical unit with a coordinate position and high unification in social economic attributes land cover ecological function and externalities the spatial scene is a type of spatial heterogeneity distribution of geographical unit functional attributes with multi dimensional properties covering nature society economy ecology etc it is a cognition and synthesis at a higher level than the traditional lulc while considering the differences introduced by land use function or location in land cover it is also a quantitative reflection of the present socioeconomic and ecological functions of the objective world which is not oriented toward planning goals and therefore is different from functional zoning 2 2 spatial scene classification for coastal zone the coastal zone is a natural society economy complex according to the concept of spatial scene four attributes that is social economic attributes land cover ecological function and externalities were comprehensively considered in the spatial scene classification for coastal zone firstly the coastal zone was divided into two major categories according to the most obvious land cover difference the coastal land and coastal intertidal and offshore cio areas the former was terrestrial ecosystem while the latter was coastal and marine ecosystem as for the coastal land it was first classified by land cover and ecological functions such as forestland inland water and settlements etc and then these subclasses were subdivided into spatial scenes by the dominant socioeconomic attributes utilization modes of human activities and ecological externalities for example the forestland was classified into forest not for economic activities and plantations for economic activities and settlements were classified into residential services commercial and industrial types it should be noted that there exists significant difference in the basis of classification between coastal land spatial scene and lulc for the latter concerns less about the social economic attributes and externalities of a geographical unit such as its major function for production living or eco environment protection while the former takes all the above factors into consideration carefully unlike land the cio area is covered largely by sea water thus its spatial scene classification mainly considers the primary ecological function dominant socioeconomic attributes and utilization modes of human activities here we referred to the national marine function zoning 2011 2020 published by china s state oceanic administration state bureau of oceanic administration soa 2012 which had fully taken the relevant index into account to classify the spatial scene of the cio area the spatial scene category ssc system and detailed explanation of the classification are shown in table 1 2 3 three dimensional ecological footprint model the three dimensional ecological footprint ef3d model niccolucci et al 2009 2011 is an improvement of the traditional efm which has been widely used in region ecc assessment peng et al 2015 yang and hu 2018 chen et al 2019 in the traditional efm the lulc types are translated into standardized units of bioproductive area as the regional ecc monfreda et al 2004 and the natural capital consumption and waste generated by human activities are converted into areas of bioproductive land and sea that is the ef wackernagel et al 2002 by simply comparing ef with ecc the traditional efm obtains the sustainability of local development in the ef3d model two basic indices ef size efsize and ef depth efdepth in which the former accounts for the human appropriation of the annual income from natural capital while the latter accounts for the depletion of natural capital stock niccolucci et al 2009 2011 were introduced to reflect the temporal accumulation of ecological overdraft with the use of efdepth we can measure whether the existing human activities and development modes are sustainable under the constraint of renewable resources and ecological services without consuming the natural capital stock and further determine which biological components within the study region are overloaded fang 2015 2 4 framework for assessing ecological carrying capacity of coastal zone based on spatial scene and three dimensional ecological footprint to overcome the deficiencies in lulc we introduced the concept of a spatial scene into the ef3d model sscs are adopted as the calculation basis for ecc instead of the traditional lulc types thus ecc is expressed as follows 1 e c i n e c i n a i r i y i 1 b 2 e c n e c n i e c i i e c i where i is the number of sscs eci and ec are the eccs of the i th ssc and of the whole area respectively global hectares gha eci and ec are the per capita eccs of the i th ssc and of the whole area gha cap respectively n is the regional population cap ai is the per capita area of the i th ssc in hectares ha cap ri is the equivalence factor of the i th ssc yi is the yield factor of the i th ssc and b is the area proportion preserved for biodiversity protection which are adopted as 12 here according to most studies wackernagel et al 1999 xun and hu 2019 wang et al 2020 consumption items including biological resource consumption and energy consumption and their relevant data should also be collected based on the sscs therefore the ef for each ssc is expressed as follows 3 e f i n e f i n j c j p j r i where efi and efi are the total ef and per capita ef of the i th ssc respectively gha gha cap j is the number of consumption items in the i th ssc cj is the per capita consumption of the j th item t cap m3 cap gj cap and pj is the global average production of the j th item t gha m3 gha gj gha the efsize efdepth and ef3d were calculated by the revised equations from fang 2015 which indicated the regional efsize and efdepth were constrained by the comparison of ef and ec of various land types simultaneously xun and hu 2019 4 e f size i min e f i e c i 5 e f depth i 1 max e f i e c i 0 e c i 6 e f 3 d i e f size i e f depth i 7 e f size region i min e f i e c i 8 e f depth region 1 i max e f i e c i 0 i e c i 9 e f 3 d region e f size region e f depth region where ef size i ef depth i and ef 3d i are the efsize efdepth and ef3d of the i th ssc respectively gha dimensionless gha and ef size region ef depth region and ef 3d region are the regional efsize regional efdepth and regional ef3d in the study area respectively gha dimensionless gha from eq 4 9 we could find that the ef size region is the sum of all ef size i whereas the ef depth region and ef 3d region are not the sum of all ef depth i and ef 3d i respectively from eq 8 when all the efi eci regional efdepth has the original value of 1 meaning that the present natural consumptions and waste generations are within the regional sustainable development range when efi eci regional efdepth 1 implying that the capital flows within some or all sscs cannot meet the needs of current social economic development and capital stock had been depleted a smaller efsize and larger efdepth indicate a more unsustainable development 3 framework application and results 3 1 study area the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba 21 32 24 26 n 111 20 115 24 e is located in the central and southern part of guangdong province it is composed of nine cities in guangdong guangzhou shenzhen foshan dongguan huizhou zhongshan zhuhai zhaoqing and jiangmen and two special administrative regions of hong kong and macao covering a total area of 56 000 km2 the terrain is mainly hills and plains with a majority of elevation lower than 200 m dominated by the subtropical and tropical monsoon climates this area has an annual average temperature of 22 5 c and average annual rainfall of 1929 8 mm gmb et al 2019 the gba is one of the most open and economically dynamic world class city cluster in china by the end of 2019 the resident population of the gba had reached 72 67 million with a gross national product gdp of 11 595 trillion yuan approximately 1 68 trillion dollars and a per capita gdp of 159 560 yuan around 23 130 dollars as the most populous and fastest growing of the four world class bay areas the gba boasts a total economic volume exceeded the san francisco bay and its port container throughput is 3 7 times of the sum of those of san francisco new york and tokyo bay areas zhang 2021a the gba has a vast sea area with a long coastline wide mudflats excellent harbors and numerous islands coastal ecosystems are widely distributed such as mangroves coral reefs and seagrass beds favorable climate conditions and natural environments make this region rich in terrestrial and marine resources with extremely high biological and ecological diversity promoting flourishing fishery shipping and other marine industries however large scale coastal land reclamation and tremendous industrial development in recent decades have caused the coastal area of the gba to suffer eco environment damage and degradation including a decline in biodiversity loss of coastal wetlands degradation of fishery resources and frequent occurrence of marine pollution and ecological disasters zhao et al 2019b zhang et al 2021b threatening regional ecological security and sustainable development therefore the coastal zone of the gba is representative for application in cecc and sustainability assessment we took the coastal area of gba as our study area and the year of 2019 as our study year according to the commonly accepted definition in china national coastal zone office 1991 su 2015 we selected the land area extending 10 km from the shoreline to the landside side and the sea area extending 12 nautical miles from the baseline of the territorial sea to the marine side as the coastal zone of the gba fig 1 the study area covers 36 223 03 km2 of which the land area is 9796 23 km2 27 04 involving nine cities of guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai dongguan huizhou zhongshan jiangmen hong kong and macao while the sea area covers 26 426 8 km2 72 96 including the pearl river estuary shizi ocean shenzhen bay and hong kong bay etc fig 1 the general information and social economic development about the nine cities are listed in table 2 to learn the accuracy and effectiveness of our framework in cecc assessment we calculated and compared the results estimated by ssc and lulc 3 2 data sources the spatial scenes and lulc of coastal land and intertidal areas were generated from sentinel 2 images openstreetmap data and google earth sample data using the object oriented method random forest classification method and supersiat 2 1 platform hu et al 2013 2016 hu 2020 the average overall accuracies of spatial scene data and lulc data of coastal land and intertidal areas reached 81 25 and 87 10 respectively the spatial scenes of offshore marine areas were derived from the marine function zone spatial dataset of the marine function zoning of guangdong province 2011 2020 the equivalence factors and yield factors were estimated according to the net primary productivity npp based methods proposed by liu et al liu and li 2009 liu et al 2010 by overlapping the spatial scene data and lulc data on the npp spatial data the average npp value of each ssc and lulc type can be derived and their corresponding equivalence factors and yield factors can be then calculated the consumption data were mainly collected from the province level and city level statistical yearbooks china statistical yearbook about energy traffic and fishery and the faostat http www fao org population density data were obtained from worldpop https www worldpop org detailed data collection treatment and calculations are provided in the supplementary materials 3 3 results 3 3 1 spatial scenes distribution and composition the distribution of spatial scenes in the gba coastal area is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 and table 3 the marine capture scene occupied the largest part of the entire region reaching 0 0688 ha per capita and 14 639 95 km2 in total accounting for 40 89 of the whole followed by cio reserve 20 78 forest 11 80 cio protection 7 11 and residential 3 01 the proportions of other sscs were less than 3 and the areas of cio special use and inland wetland were the smallest with proportions below 0 1 as shown in fig 3 zhuhai occupied the largest coastal area of 11 439 km2 accounted for 31 95 which was mainly composed of cio sscs especially the cio reserved jiangmen and huizhou also possessed large coastal areas between 12 5 and 14 5 the former mainly came from the forest scene while the latter mainly came from the cio reserved scene despite the greatest occupancy of marine capture for its nearly even distribution in each city 1 1 most of the marine capture areas have no strict administration boundaries and were allowed for fisheries by the nearby coastal fishermen thus were divided equally to the seven chinese mainland cities except the special administrative regions of hong kong and macao which retain relative independent ocean administration areas the very few forests in coastal guangzhou dongguan and zhongshan contributed to their comparatively small total spatial scene areas all below 8 1 whereas the significantly small administration area made macao the city with smallest total spatial scene area only 0 33 the per capita area of the sscs fig 3 for coastal jiangmen had the highest value of 1 16 ha about 5 9 times higher than the regional average value followed by huizhou zhongshan and zhuhai between 0 6 and 0 9 ha the second tier was guangzhou and dongguan with values of 0 15 0 26 ha cap macao hong kong and shenzhen had the lowest values from 0 02 to 0 05 ha in addition to the total spatial scene area within the city the population affected the per capita area significantly fig 3 3 3 2 ecological carrying capacity of coastal zone based on spatial scenes and its comparison with that based on lulc according to our framework the results of total and per capita ceccs estimated by spatial scenes ceccss in the study area are listed in table 4 the ceccss in the gba coastal zone was estimated to be 0 1877 gha per capita totaling 3 99 million gha in 2019 the marine capture scene provided the highest ceccss for the region reaching 1 69 million gha and 0 0796 gha cap accounted for 42 39 followed by forest 28 82 cio reserved 6 12 and residential 4 24 mainly owing to their large area and relatively high bioproductivity compared to global levels the per capita ceccss of most sscs ranged between 0 0013 and 0 0046 gha the ceccss of cio areas reached 2 21 million gha 23 64 higher than that of coastal land fig 4 demonstrated the composition of total and per capita ceccss in each city by comparing the fig 3 and fig 4 we can find out that the cities ranks in ceccss were similar to those in spatial scene area but there existed some discrepancies because of the difference in composition and bioproductivity of sscs and population for example the coastal zone of jiangmen contributed the highest ceccss in both total 765 11 thousand gha 19 15 and per capita values 1 73 gha cap mainly due to the large coverage of high bioproductive forests as well as the low population although zhuhai had the largest coastal spatial scene area much higher than jiangmen its main component of cio reserved was not as highly bioproductive as forest leading to its lower total ceccss 764 56 thousand gha 19 14 than that of jiangmen besides forest and cio reserved the proportions of cio protection plantation residential etc also caused differences between ceccss and spatial scene area the total ceccss of huizhou hong kong and shenzhen ranged between 510 and 545 thousand gha whereas those of guangzhou dongguan and zhongshan were only approximately 300 thousand gha which also indicated the significant impact of forests on ceccss most cities were approximately 0 2 1 1 gha of per capita ceccss however the overpopulation in coastal zones led to the extremely low per capita ceccss in shenzhen and hong kong only about 0 07 gha almost the lowest of all nine cities the lowest total 15 14 thousand gha and per capita ceccss 0 02 gha was found in macao because of its smallest administration area and dense population the cecc calculated by lulc cecclu in the study area reached 0 1535 gha per capita totaling 3 27 million gha approximately 18 19 lower than the ceccss results to compare with the cecclu components we added the ceccss of spatial scenes of forests forest and plantation cropland paddy and dryland fishing grounds all inland water and cio scenes and built up land all the settlement and transportation scenes respectively the results showed that a significant difference between cecclu and ceccss existed in cropland in which the former was 79 12 higher than the latter nevertheless all the cecclu values of the remaining lulc were lower than the related ceccss implying that the ecc is likely to be underestimated by the traditional ef3d model table 5 the difference between cecclu and ceccss should be attributed to the significant differences in classification standard and scale between spatial scene and lulc taking the cropland as an example this lulc type involves two spatial scenes i e paddy and dryland they differ remarkably in ecological process and biological productivity but are still regarded as a whole in lulc classification consequently it is inevitable that the equivalence factor and yield factor of cropland see supplementary table 7 differ largely from those of paddy table 4 although they are close to those of dryland as there are far more paddy than dryland in the gba coastal zone the deviation between cecclu and ceccss in cropland become inevitably significant 3 3 3 three dimensional ecological footprint of coastal zone based on spatial scenes and its comparison with that based on lulc efsize is the value between ef and ecc denoting the natural capital flow occupancy in 2019 the per capita efsize in the gba coastal zone estimated by spatial scenes efsize ss reached 0 1684 gha most sscs ceccss were occupied in 2019 except for the scenes of coastal aquaculture and mariculture services and cio tourism entertainment in some cities suggesting that nearly all the natural capital flows were taken up in each spatial scene efsize ss mainly existed in forest and marine capture fig 5 the occupations of per capita efsize ss in per capita cecc in guangzhou shenzhen dongguan and hong kong were over 90 while those in zhuhai and huizhou were around 60 and those in zhongshan jiangmen and macao were 40 54 efdepth represents the level of natural capital stock consumption the per capita efdepth in the study area estimated by spatial scenes efdepth ss reached 14 35 in 2019 and all the per capita efdepth ss values of the nine cities exceeded the original value of 1 implying unsustainable development in the coastal zones of all cities in the gba as shown in fig 6 a the per capita efdepth ss of most sscs exceeded 1 largely especially in grassland and traffic station which exceeded 200 much higher than other sscs showing an excessive biological resource energy consumption and ecological deficit in addition the scenes of cio port shipping industrial and dryland also had high values of per capita efdepth ss between 90 and 105 while those of cio industrial urban and road were around 40 indicating the natural capital stock therein was still substantially exploited due to the large bioproductive areas and comparatively low consumptions the per capita efdepth ss in plantation paddy commercial and forest scenes were 9 12 lower than the regional average but it should still be addressed to reduce the depletion of related resources the inland aquaculture marine capture residential and inland open water surface scenes were 3 5 in per capita efdepth ss a little higher than the original value of 1 indicating the relatively low level of capital stock consumption only the scenes of services and cio tourism entertainment equaled to 1 in per capita efdepth ss and were therefore sustainable as shown in fig 6b macao took the lead in the per capita efdepth ss 93 74 followed by hong kong 58 07 shenzhen 28 61 and dongguan 17 22 the per capita efdepth ss values of guangzhou huizhou zhuhai and zhongshan were between 3 and 9 jiangmen had the lowest per capita efdepth ss 1 76 ef3d demonstrates the comprehensive depletion of natural capital flows and stocks in 2019 the per capita ef3d in the gba coastal zone estimated by spatial scenes ef3d ss reached 2 42 gha the highest per capita ef3d ss occurred in the grassland reaching 0 57 gha followed by forest 0 49 gha industrial 0 46 gha and marine capture 0 35 gha scenes the remaining per capita ef3d ss were below 0 20 gha fig 7 a as seen in fig 7b hong kong had the largest per capita ef3d ss of 3 93 gha mainly owing to its high consumption in grassland marine capture and cio port shipping huizhou was the second high city in per capita ef3d ss reaching 3 20 gha which was attributed to the greatest ef3d ss in industrial scene for the high energy consumption in electricity and power generation the per capita ef3d ss in dongguan and guangzhou were 2 3 gha while those in shenzhen jiangmen zhongshan and zhuhai were 1 2 gha despite the highest efdepth ss macao still had the lowest value of per capita ef3d ss below 1 gha attributing to its very small efsize ss detailed ef3d ss of each spatial scene in each city are listed in table 6 along with the efsize ss and efdepth ss of the entire study area table 7 compares the per capita efsize efdepth and ef3d calculated by lulc efsize lu efdepth lu ef3d lu respectively with those estimated by spatial scenes in each city and the entire study area the efdepth lu and ef3d lu were found to be 20 56 and 13 17 higher than the efdepth ss and ef3d ss respectively while the efsize lu was 6 13 less than the efsize ss the efdepth and ef3d estimated by lulc in most of the nine cities were higher than those estimated by spatial scenes whereas the efsize lu in most cities were lower than efsize ss which should be attributed to the ecc underestimation by the traditional ef3d model the largest overestimation of ef3d and efsize occurred in macao the per capita ef3d lu were more than twice the per capita ef3d ss and the per capita efsize lu were 81 12 higher than the per capita efsize ss the per capita ef3d lu in most cities were slightly below 11 higher than the per capita ef3d ss while the per capita efsize lu were mainly 20 30 lower than the efsize ss the largest overestimation of efdepth occurred in dongguan 37 83 higher and the per capita efdepth lu in most cities were 24 35 higher than the per capita efdepth ss apart from engendering difference between cecclu and ceccss the significant differences of classification standard and scale between spatial scene and lulc also contribute to the disparity in division of biological resource consumption and energy consumption therefore the ecc and ef differences will lead to the disparity in ef efsize efdepth and ef3d between the spatial scene based framework and the traditional lulc based calculation in particular taking macao as an example the per capita areas and eccs of most spatial scenes are extremely small thus the accumulation of the smaller one of the ecc and ef within each spatial scene will result to a much smaller efsize ss than the efsize lu together with a smaller efdepth ss it ultimately leads to a significantly smaller ef3d ss than the ef3d lu 4 discussion and suggestions 4 1 discussion efdepth has been revealed to be significantly impacted by the economy while ef3d is highly correlated with the energy consumption structure in many related studies du et al 2016 xun and hu 2019 wang et al 2020 hence to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of our results we compared the relationship of per capita gross domestic product gdp as an economic indicator with the per capita efdepth ss and efdepth lu and explored the relationship of per capita energy ef with the per capita ef3d lu and ef3d ss of the secondary and tertiary industries stis as the energy ef mainly existed in these two industries other than the primary industry at the city scale as shown in fig 8 the relationship between gdp and efdepth ss had a greater correlation r² 0 9433 p 0 0001 than that between gdp and efdepth lu r² 0 9369 p 0 0001 fig 8a and the correlation of energy ef with ef3d ss of stis r² 0 8485 p 0 0004 was much greater and more significant than that with ef3d lu r² 0 6610 p 0 0077 fig 8b indicating a better reflection of the economic development status and energy consumption structure by the results estimated by spatial scene than that by lulc from fig 8 we can also see that the efdepth lu is higher than efdepth ss overall whereas the ef3d lu is higher than the ef3d ss when energy ef is small and lower than the ef3d ss when energy ef reaches a certain height implying that the consumption of natural capital stocks might be slightly overvalued while the comprehensive depletion of natural capital flows and stocks is likely to be overestimated under a small energy consumption and underestimated under a large energy consumption by the traditional ef3d model in addition our framework considers the diversity of human activities and energy consumption among cio areas by dividing them into scenes of fishery port shipping industrial urban protection etc thus embodying the regional differences in marine economic development modes and is therefore superior to the traditional ef3d model which only considers all marine areas as fishing grounds and neglects other utilization or reservation of the sea as illustrated in fig 9 the ef3d ss in cio areas cio ef3d ss showed a significant positive correlation with marine gdp overall r² 0 6199 p 0 05 revealing stress of marine economic development activities on coastal and marine eco environment the cio ef3d ss in hong kong and guangzhou were far higher than the regression line between the cio ef3d ss and marine gdp of the nine cities indicating the high consumption per gdp of their marine industries whereas it was on the opposite side of zhuhai and macao hong kong 2 2 according to world shipping council shenzhen guangzhou hong kong and dongguan ranked the 4th 5th 8th and 46th respectively in the world s busiest container ports in 2019 based on the total number of twenty foot equivalent units teus transported through the port which reached 25 770 23 236 18 361 and 4 000 thousand teus respectively nevertheless there were more ocean faring container ships to hong kong than to the other three cities owing to its ideal conditions for berthing and a more open registration environment is a vitally important international port city the marine logistics and transportation industry for import and export trade consumes a plethora of energy guangzhou dongguan shenzhen and zhongshan are also important domestic port cities besides marine logistics and transportation industry they also develop plenty of high energy consumed industries such as marine chemical and steel industry marine shipbuilding and engineering equipment manufacturing industry compare to above cities huizhou and jiangmen have higher proportions of marine primary industry while zhuhai 3 3 zhuhai was awarded one of the first ten chinese tourism and leisure demonstration cities in 2017 and it was also the only city selected in guangdong province by the end of 2019 zhuhai received 46 million visitors about 23 times the permanent resident population and the revenue of tourism totalled 54 billion yuan around 7 83 billion dollars about 16 of the gdp and macao 4 4 macao is famous for gaming entertainment and tourism industries by the end of 2019 macao received 39 4 million visitors about 58 times the permanent resident population and the tourism value added totalled 220 9 billion mop around 27 50 billion dollars about 50 5 of the gross value added of all industries focus more on marine tourism and marine service industry making them far lower energy consumed the high efdepth and ef3d with small efsize and cecc per capita in the gba coastal zone reveals that the natural capital flow occupancy no longer meets the regional resource demand under the current activities and economic development mode and abundant capital stocks are being consumed therein or transferred from other countries and regions in 2020 the population density in gba coastal areas was as high as 2173 people per km2 about 14 8 times the average population density 147 capita km2 in china at the same time according to our estimation the gba coastal zone consumed substantial energy and biological resource including 1629 kw h km2 of electricity 2636 tons km2 of coal 86 tons km2 of gasoline 599 tons km2 of kerosene 767 tons km2 of diesel and 2019 m3 km2 of wood and paper products 244 tons km2 of cereals 207 tons km2 of meat 88 tons km2 of seafood much higher than the average level of china shortage of land and natural resources accompany with tremendous domestic commercial and industrial consumption demand led to insufficient ecc and great ef in gba coastal zone in addition comparisons of our results with those of other relevant studies reveal similar conclusions wang et al 2020b assessed the efdepth and ef3d of each city in the gba from 2009 to 2016 regardless of the different methods and study year in the two studies the comparison still shows that the per capita efdepth and ef3d 5 5 wang et al 2020b used a different method to calculate the ef3d to be comparable we recalculated the ef3d by multiplying the efsize and efdepth in the study of the coastal areas in most cities were respectively 0 4 6 5 times and 1 1 14 7 times higher than those of the entire administration area in 2016 implying a much greater pressure in the coastal zones than the inland areas within the same region we also compared our coastal land efdepth and ef3d with the results 6 6 to be comparable only the per capita efdepth and ef3d of coastal cities in shandong i e binzhou dongying weifang qingdao yantai weihai and rizhao were selected and averaged for comparison the population and heavy industries in shandong coastal cities mostly distribute in the coastal area of xun and hu 2019 who evaluated ecological sustainability in shandong province in china it was found that the per capita efdepth and ef3d in our study area were 5 and 76 smaller than those in the coastal cities in shandong respectively this might be attributed to the significant industry structural differences in the two regions high energy consumption is caused by heavy industries in shandong especially crude oil raw coal and coke xun and hu 2019 which is not the main consumption in the light industries dominating our study area this finding also verifies the impact of energy consumption structure on the regional ef and further confirms the rationality and accuracy of our results 4 2 implications and suggestions the classification of spatial scenes in our framework for cecc and ef assessment could effectively reflect diverse human activities complex land use modes and exploitation and protection of the land and ocean thus offering a finer resolution than lulc in cecc and ef assessment and providing a more valuable insight into improving sustainability development fig 10 demonstrates the ef3d composition in the nine cities the ef3d ss in the whole gba coastal zone mainly distributed in grassland 23 57 forest 20 31 industrial 18 87 marine capture 14 62 cio port shipping 8 27 traffic station 7 97 dryland 5 18 and cio industrial urban 4 89 the industrial forest grassland marine capture and dryland scenes respectively contributed a large proportion of ef3d ssin most cities and the ef3d ss of traffic station had a comparatively higher percentage in guangzhou shenzhen hong kong and macao while the large occupation of ef3d ss of cio port shipping only existed hong kong and guangzhou the industry is well developed in the gba coastal cities however they are still at the cost of high energy and biological resources according to a report by china development institute cdi 2019 the energy consumption and electricity consumption per unit of gdp of the gba are about twice and treble the average levels of the san francisco new york and tokyo bay areas respectively the forestry industries in the study area including processing of timber manufacture of wood products furniture papermaking and printing consumed over 63 13 million m3 wood in 2019 approximately two thirds of the total consumption of guangdong province in addition hong kong macao guangzhou and shenzhen are international and domestic metropolis with world s busiest air sea and land transportation and logistics activities consuming substantial oil and coal products at the same time the long term and excessive marine capture activities make the gba offshore area at risk of fishery resources exhaustion moreover the high level of urbanization has resulted in insufficient arable land and grassland and the dense population has led to strong rigid demand for food resources and energy contributing to a gargantuan depletion of natural capital in the region accordingly the following suggestions are put forward 1 accelerating the industrial transformation and upgrading the local government should regulate the economic activities of various enterprises under the cecc restrict the energy and resources consumption in industries activities and raise clean production evaluation standards thus prompting enterprises to promote technological innovation and raise resource use efficiency spontaneously especially in the papermaking printing marine chemistry and steel industry marine shipbuilding and engineering equipment manufacturing industry marine logistics and transportation industry and so on an economic structure conducive to green low carbon and circular development shall be vigorously fostered and emerging marine economy such as marine tourism and marine service industry shall be vigorously developed 2 strengthening the conservation of ecological agricultural and marine space a certain proportion of ecologically significant land and cultivated land must be demarcated preserved and strictly forbidden to occupy such as grassland farmland wood land nature reserves and so on to ensure ecological and food security expanding prohibited fishing area coastal wetland such as mangrove and coral reef and important waters such as spawning grounds feeding grounds wintering grounds and migration channels must be conserved and restored classification and gradation of prohibited fishing system shall be established the prohibition extent and period in conserved areas estuary trunk stream and important tributaries shall be more strict than other water area at the same time the local authority should strictly control the scale of coastal reclamation and the development and utilization activities of coastline maintaining basic stability of the sea used for fisheries in addition it is necessary to develop intensive and environment friendly agriculture and aquaculture 3 transforming the public consumption concepts and production methods it is necessary to guide the public to change the consumption concepts in daily life and production methods and form green and low carbon consumption pattern by reasonable policy and effected measures in addition the local government should strictly control the excessive population growth thus conducive to limit the resource consumption and environmental pollution to coastal area 4 3 uncertainties nevertheless there remain some uncertainties in our study the relatively rough calculations of consumption data and some key parameters e g equivalence and yield factors might cause a slight deviation in the final results in addition because spatial scenes require finer spatial resolution and classification they are difficult to be extracted and classified from remote sensing images automatically and accurately which requires substantial manual work and time especially in a large study area this may cause errors in the spatial scene recognition and limit the application of our framework to some extent we recommend applying our framework on a regional scale to guarantee accuracy furthermore we believe that the coastal spatial scene classification proposed here represents only one possible option modification in accordance with study area situation is welcomed 5 conclusions this study proposed the concept of spatial scene to substitute the calculation basis lulc of the traditional ef3d model and established a novel framework for cecc and sustainability assessment an assessment of cecc and sustainability was conducted in the coastal zone of gba in 2019 to examine the applicability and reliability of our framework the framework has great advantages in of reflecting diverse human activities complex land use modes and exploitation and protection of the land and ocean thus providing a more effective and accurate assessment for cecc and sustainability in 2019 the ceccss in the study area reached 0 1877 gha per capita totaled 3 99 million gha and largest ceccss distributes in the scenes of marine capture and forest and the cities of jiangmen and zhuhai the per capita efsize ss efdepth ss and ef3d ss reached 0 1684 gha 14 35 and 2 42 gha respectively representing unsustainable development in the gba coastal zone efsize ss mainly existed in forest and marine capture while the grassland and traffic station possessed the highest efdepth ss the ef3d mainly distributed in scenes of grassland forest industrial marine capture cio port shipping traffic station dryland and cio industrial urban while only the services and cio tourism entertainment scenes were within cecc and therefore sustainable macao hong kong and shenzhen took the lead in the per capita efdepth ss while hong kong huizhou and dongguan had the largest per capita ef3d therefore suggestions are put forward to promote the sustainable development of cba coastal zone such as accelerating the industrial transformation and upgrading strengthening the conservation of ecological agricultural and marine space and transforming the public consumption concepts and production methods eq 1 7 supplementary materials can be found online at https doi org xxx declaration of

24475,the ecological carrying capacity ecc assessment in coastal zones is essential for sustainable coastal management but there remains a lack of a more effective assessment method to be applied across broad contexts in this study we proposed the concept of spatial scene a geographical unit with a coordinate position and high unification in social economic attributes land cover ecological function and externalities to substitute for the land use land cover lulc in the traditional three dimensional ecological footprint ef3d model thereby establishing a novel framework for coastal ecc cecc assessment the coastal zone of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba was chosen to examine the applicability and reliability of our framework results showed that the cecc estimated by spatial scene in the study area reached 0 1877 gha per capita totaled 3 99 million gha in 2019 and the scenes of marine capture and forest provided the largest cecc the per capita ecological footprint size efsize ecological footprint depth efdepth and ef3d reached 0 1684 gha 14 35 and 2 42 gha respectively representing unsustainable development in the gba coastal zone the ef3d mainly distributed in scenes of grassland forest industrial marine capture coastal intertidal and offshore cio port shipping traffic station dryland and cio industrial urban while only the scenes of services and cio tourism entertainment were within cecc and therefore sustainable hong kong huizhou and dongguan had the largest per capita ef3d compared to our results the cecc and efsize estimated by the traditional ef3d model were respectively 18 and 6 lower while their efdepth and ef3d were respectively 21 and 13 higher which should be attributed to the significant differences in classification standard and scale between spatial scene and lulc our results showed higher correlations and more significant relationships with total gross domestic product gdp marine gdp and main energy ef than those based on the traditional lulc indicating a better reflection of the economic development status energy consumption structure and marine economic development modes by our framework it is recommended to accelerate the industrial transformation and upgrading and strengthen the conservation of ecological agricultural and marine space in order to promote the sustainable development of gba coastal zone our study revealed that our framework is capable of serving as a more effective and accurate method for assessing cecc and sustainability graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coastal zone ecological carrying capacity spatial scene three dimensional ecological footprint guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area 1 introduction as the vast area radiating to the mainland islands and adjacent seas based on the coastline the coastal zone involves both marine and terrestrial ecosystems making it the most dynamic complicated and changeable area in the world unced 1992 crossland et al 2005 su 2015 and is an important entry point for sustainable scientific research liu et al 2020a in recent decades it has been recognized that coastal zones have suffered from severe natural habitat and resource loss environmental pollution and ecological degradation duxbury and dickinson 2007 mee 2012 wu et al 2018 which substantially attributes to the observed unsustainable development pattern from coastal land reclamation high energy consumption and high pollution industries lakshmi and rajagopalan 2000 yu et al 2017 sengupta et al 2018 therefore the sustainability assessment of current development patterns is essential for sustainable coastal management the ecological carrying capacity ecc refers to the maximum limit of human activities accommodated by the regional natural resources ecological environment and social economy under rational natural resource exploitation and benign circulation of the environment arrow et al 1995 fan and he 2017 zhao et al 2019a and is an effective tool for evaluating sustainability rajaram and das 2011 chen et al 2021 ecc not only reflects the degree of utilization of resources and the intensity of damage to the eco environment by human activities zhang et al 2018 but also reveals the deficit and surplus of specific ecosystem components under the prevailing social economy development ma et al 2017 thus it is more easily understood by the public and decision makers wang et al 2014 peng et al 2016 for the coastal zone the overall deterioration of the eco environment is a concrete indication that the ecc therein has already been saturated or overburdened wang et al 2017 which indicates an urgent need to establish an effective assessment for coastal ecc and sustainability there are several approaches for ecc and sustainability evaluation such as the ecological footprint model efm galli et al 2012 ahmed et al 2020 comprehensive evaluation index system ceis method wei et al 2014 liu et al 2020a system dynamics models wang et al 2014 and state space models tang et al 2016 however many of the relevant studies have used these methods to evaluate the ecc of terrestrial ecosystems without deep concern for coastal and marine ecosystems as a narrow feature of mainland tidal flats and adjacent seas and a natural society economy complex ecosystem with significant human land interaction the ecc assessment for coastal zone should consider the comprehensive impact of different social activities economic developments and ecological process in both terrestrial and marine systems simultaneously which is significantly different from those for terrestrial areas to the best of our knowledge the ecc evaluation of coastal and marine ecosystems is still relatively rare compared to terrestrial ecosystems but it has increased rapidly in recent years wei et al 2014 ma et al 2017 and liu et al 2020a respectively proposed a ceis reflecting socioeconomic development resource consumption and ecological resilience associated with coastal and marine areas to assess the integrated coastal carrying capacity peng et al 2018 used an improved emergy ecological footprint method and four indices to evaluate the sustainability of the complex eco economic system of qingdao china and xu et al 2019 evaluated the sea use carrying capacity based on marine functional zoning and exploitation indices concerning resource consumption and environmental impact it is clear that most relevant studies prefer to assess coastal and marine ecc by building up a ceis although the ceis demonstrates the influence of society economy and ecology on ecc explicitly the diverse indicators vary in studies without unified criteria which might lead to missed or incorrect assessment index selection and the different weight values in disparate studies result in significant differences or even conflicting conclusions in addition because the ecc evaluation indices needs to adapt to the social and environmental conditions of a study area it is inherently impossible to establish a uniform ceis for ecc comparison between different regions thus limiting its broad application among all ecc evaluation methods the efm is the most widely used worldwide wackernagel et al 1999 borucke et al 2013 wwf 2020 efm terms the ecc as biocapacity which represents the maximum theoretical rate of resource supply that can be sustained in its territory under prevailing technology and management schemes monfreda et al 2004 lin et al 2018 as a component based integrated and multiscale accounting system rather than a normalized indicator system the efm allows the metric to be applied across broad contexts which is a key element of sustainability assessment frameworks sala et al 2015 lin et al 2018 and fulfills the need to track the use and overuse of different natural resources however the principal limitation of efm is that it recognizes the six land use land cover lulc types that is cropland grazing land fishing grounds forests built up land and carbon uptake land galli et al 2012 as biocapacity components to describe the differences in biological productivity between areas which are not capable of expressing the change in ecc and ecological footprint ef brought by the different production modes lifestyles technology and ecological environment protection strategies and thus might lead to inaccurate results especially in a coastal zone at the regional scale where intense human activities complex land use modes and coexisting land and ocean exploitation and protection the efm cannot meet the needs of ecc assessment to address this deficiency and fill the gaps in coastal ecc assessment we propose a concept of spatial scene and establish a novel framework for coastal ecc cecc assessment based on the spatial scene and three dimensional efm an enhanced version of classical efm we then select the coastal zone of guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area china to examine the applicability and reliability of our framework this study is expected to serve as an important reference for studies on ecc assessment in coastal and marine areas and even for applications in terrestrial regions 2 conceptual framework and methodology 2 1 concept of spatial scene space and scene are two different perspectives in geographic analysis space or the spatial perspective is one of the most fundamental concepts of geography tuan 1977 and generally refers to the surface and near surface of the earth organized by coordinate systems or geometric measures offering a measurable or computable analytical framework for the objective physical environment goodchild and li 2011 roche 2016 scene on the other hand originates from comparatively complex sources one is extended from film and drama where the elements of venues props dialog clothing and actors interconnect organically to express a certain idea wu 2011 the chicago school of economics introduced the concept of scene into the urban development of the post industrial era clark 2007 miller and silver 2015 which specifies scene as a range of symbolic meanings that collections of amenities formed by various consumption practices expressing local culture and key values of cities to residents and visitors silver et al 2011 clark and silver 2013 the other is derived from scene recognition technology in computer vision which trains the computer to identify the context automatically and accurately in images zhou et al 2014 this concept was then introduced into the field of interpretation and recognition of high resolution remote sensing images called scene classification to extract and classify a variety of land cover types and ground objects within the remote sensing images into respective semantic categories especially in urban built up areas xiao et al 2010 cheng et al 2017 rao et al 2021 the former emphasizes the immaterial features of scene that is the metaphysical identity of the cultural connotation value orientation and lifestyle the latter emphasizes the material features that is the similarity of land cover type land use mode and landscape structure they both expound the connotations of scenes from different dimensions however the existing concepts about scenes mainly focus on the classification of leisure oriented consumption places and lulc objects in cities which is similar to urban functional zoning namely identifying zones in a city in accordance with their specific urban functions in human activities or land use type zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b such as residential commercial industrial water and forest zones zotic et al 2010 ignoring the ecological dimension of landscapes with the tightening of resource and environmental constraints ecological and environmental protection has received unprecedented attention in recent years in china concepts of ecological zoning such as ecological function zoning fang et al 2008 ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china mep chinese academy of sciences cas 2008 major function oriented zoning state council of the prc 2010 fan et al 2012 and ecological space planning central committee of the cpc and state council of the prc 2019 have emerged furthermore the practices of ecological utilization of coasts and oceans protection and improvement of coastal and marine eco environments have become the central focus in coastal and marine management and functional zoning in recent decades clark 1996 state bureau of oceanic administration soa 2012 therefore the ecological dimension should be added to the concept of scene in other words scene classification should also consider the sensitivity of eco environment and the ecosystem function of landscapes as well as the environmental impact of human activities therein consequently we regard the spatial scene as a geographical unit with a coordinate position and high unification in social economic attributes land cover ecological function and externalities the spatial scene is a type of spatial heterogeneity distribution of geographical unit functional attributes with multi dimensional properties covering nature society economy ecology etc it is a cognition and synthesis at a higher level than the traditional lulc while considering the differences introduced by land use function or location in land cover it is also a quantitative reflection of the present socioeconomic and ecological functions of the objective world which is not oriented toward planning goals and therefore is different from functional zoning 2 2 spatial scene classification for coastal zone the coastal zone is a natural society economy complex according to the concept of spatial scene four attributes that is social economic attributes land cover ecological function and externalities were comprehensively considered in the spatial scene classification for coastal zone firstly the coastal zone was divided into two major categories according to the most obvious land cover difference the coastal land and coastal intertidal and offshore cio areas the former was terrestrial ecosystem while the latter was coastal and marine ecosystem as for the coastal land it was first classified by land cover and ecological functions such as forestland inland water and settlements etc and then these subclasses were subdivided into spatial scenes by the dominant socioeconomic attributes utilization modes of human activities and ecological externalities for example the forestland was classified into forest not for economic activities and plantations for economic activities and settlements were classified into residential services commercial and industrial types it should be noted that there exists significant difference in the basis of classification between coastal land spatial scene and lulc for the latter concerns less about the social economic attributes and externalities of a geographical unit such as its major function for production living or eco environment protection while the former takes all the above factors into consideration carefully unlike land the cio area is covered largely by sea water thus its spatial scene classification mainly considers the primary ecological function dominant socioeconomic attributes and utilization modes of human activities here we referred to the national marine function zoning 2011 2020 published by china s state oceanic administration state bureau of oceanic administration soa 2012 which had fully taken the relevant index into account to classify the spatial scene of the cio area the spatial scene category ssc system and detailed explanation of the classification are shown in table 1 2 3 three dimensional ecological footprint model the three dimensional ecological footprint ef3d model niccolucci et al 2009 2011 is an improvement of the traditional efm which has been widely used in region ecc assessment peng et al 2015 yang and hu 2018 chen et al 2019 in the traditional efm the lulc types are translated into standardized units of bioproductive area as the regional ecc monfreda et al 2004 and the natural capital consumption and waste generated by human activities are converted into areas of bioproductive land and sea that is the ef wackernagel et al 2002 by simply comparing ef with ecc the traditional efm obtains the sustainability of local development in the ef3d model two basic indices ef size efsize and ef depth efdepth in which the former accounts for the human appropriation of the annual income from natural capital while the latter accounts for the depletion of natural capital stock niccolucci et al 2009 2011 were introduced to reflect the temporal accumulation of ecological overdraft with the use of efdepth we can measure whether the existing human activities and development modes are sustainable under the constraint of renewable resources and ecological services without consuming the natural capital stock and further determine which biological components within the study region are overloaded fang 2015 2 4 framework for assessing ecological carrying capacity of coastal zone based on spatial scene and three dimensional ecological footprint to overcome the deficiencies in lulc we introduced the concept of a spatial scene into the ef3d model sscs are adopted as the calculation basis for ecc instead of the traditional lulc types thus ecc is expressed as follows 1 e c i n e c i n a i r i y i 1 b 2 e c n e c n i e c i i e c i where i is the number of sscs eci and ec are the eccs of the i th ssc and of the whole area respectively global hectares gha eci and ec are the per capita eccs of the i th ssc and of the whole area gha cap respectively n is the regional population cap ai is the per capita area of the i th ssc in hectares ha cap ri is the equivalence factor of the i th ssc yi is the yield factor of the i th ssc and b is the area proportion preserved for biodiversity protection which are adopted as 12 here according to most studies wackernagel et al 1999 xun and hu 2019 wang et al 2020 consumption items including biological resource consumption and energy consumption and their relevant data should also be collected based on the sscs therefore the ef for each ssc is expressed as follows 3 e f i n e f i n j c j p j r i where efi and efi are the total ef and per capita ef of the i th ssc respectively gha gha cap j is the number of consumption items in the i th ssc cj is the per capita consumption of the j th item t cap m3 cap gj cap and pj is the global average production of the j th item t gha m3 gha gj gha the efsize efdepth and ef3d were calculated by the revised equations from fang 2015 which indicated the regional efsize and efdepth were constrained by the comparison of ef and ec of various land types simultaneously xun and hu 2019 4 e f size i min e f i e c i 5 e f depth i 1 max e f i e c i 0 e c i 6 e f 3 d i e f size i e f depth i 7 e f size region i min e f i e c i 8 e f depth region 1 i max e f i e c i 0 i e c i 9 e f 3 d region e f size region e f depth region where ef size i ef depth i and ef 3d i are the efsize efdepth and ef3d of the i th ssc respectively gha dimensionless gha and ef size region ef depth region and ef 3d region are the regional efsize regional efdepth and regional ef3d in the study area respectively gha dimensionless gha from eq 4 9 we could find that the ef size region is the sum of all ef size i whereas the ef depth region and ef 3d region are not the sum of all ef depth i and ef 3d i respectively from eq 8 when all the efi eci regional efdepth has the original value of 1 meaning that the present natural consumptions and waste generations are within the regional sustainable development range when efi eci regional efdepth 1 implying that the capital flows within some or all sscs cannot meet the needs of current social economic development and capital stock had been depleted a smaller efsize and larger efdepth indicate a more unsustainable development 3 framework application and results 3 1 study area the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba 21 32 24 26 n 111 20 115 24 e is located in the central and southern part of guangdong province it is composed of nine cities in guangdong guangzhou shenzhen foshan dongguan huizhou zhongshan zhuhai zhaoqing and jiangmen and two special administrative regions of hong kong and macao covering a total area of 56 000 km2 the terrain is mainly hills and plains with a majority of elevation lower than 200 m dominated by the subtropical and tropical monsoon climates this area has an annual average temperature of 22 5 c and average annual rainfall of 1929 8 mm gmb et al 2019 the gba is one of the most open and economically dynamic world class city cluster in china by the end of 2019 the resident population of the gba had reached 72 67 million with a gross national product gdp of 11 595 trillion yuan approximately 1 68 trillion dollars and a per capita gdp of 159 560 yuan around 23 130 dollars as the most populous and fastest growing of the four world class bay areas the gba boasts a total economic volume exceeded the san francisco bay and its port container throughput is 3 7 times of the sum of those of san francisco new york and tokyo bay areas zhang 2021a the gba has a vast sea area with a long coastline wide mudflats excellent harbors and numerous islands coastal ecosystems are widely distributed such as mangroves coral reefs and seagrass beds favorable climate conditions and natural environments make this region rich in terrestrial and marine resources with extremely high biological and ecological diversity promoting flourishing fishery shipping and other marine industries however large scale coastal land reclamation and tremendous industrial development in recent decades have caused the coastal area of the gba to suffer eco environment damage and degradation including a decline in biodiversity loss of coastal wetlands degradation of fishery resources and frequent occurrence of marine pollution and ecological disasters zhao et al 2019b zhang et al 2021b threatening regional ecological security and sustainable development therefore the coastal zone of the gba is representative for application in cecc and sustainability assessment we took the coastal area of gba as our study area and the year of 2019 as our study year according to the commonly accepted definition in china national coastal zone office 1991 su 2015 we selected the land area extending 10 km from the shoreline to the landside side and the sea area extending 12 nautical miles from the baseline of the territorial sea to the marine side as the coastal zone of the gba fig 1 the study area covers 36 223 03 km2 of which the land area is 9796 23 km2 27 04 involving nine cities of guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai dongguan huizhou zhongshan jiangmen hong kong and macao while the sea area covers 26 426 8 km2 72 96 including the pearl river estuary shizi ocean shenzhen bay and hong kong bay etc fig 1 the general information and social economic development about the nine cities are listed in table 2 to learn the accuracy and effectiveness of our framework in cecc assessment we calculated and compared the results estimated by ssc and lulc 3 2 data sources the spatial scenes and lulc of coastal land and intertidal areas were generated from sentinel 2 images openstreetmap data and google earth sample data using the object oriented method random forest classification method and supersiat 2 1 platform hu et al 2013 2016 hu 2020 the average overall accuracies of spatial scene data and lulc data of coastal land and intertidal areas reached 81 25 and 87 10 respectively the spatial scenes of offshore marine areas were derived from the marine function zone spatial dataset of the marine function zoning of guangdong province 2011 2020 the equivalence factors and yield factors were estimated according to the net primary productivity npp based methods proposed by liu et al liu and li 2009 liu et al 2010 by overlapping the spatial scene data and lulc data on the npp spatial data the average npp value of each ssc and lulc type can be derived and their corresponding equivalence factors and yield factors can be then calculated the consumption data were mainly collected from the province level and city level statistical yearbooks china statistical yearbook about energy traffic and fishery and the faostat http www fao org population density data were obtained from worldpop https www worldpop org detailed data collection treatment and calculations are provided in the supplementary materials 3 3 results 3 3 1 spatial scenes distribution and composition the distribution of spatial scenes in the gba coastal area is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 and table 3 the marine capture scene occupied the largest part of the entire region reaching 0 0688 ha per capita and 14 639 95 km2 in total accounting for 40 89 of the whole followed by cio reserve 20 78 forest 11 80 cio protection 7 11 and residential 3 01 the proportions of other sscs were less than 3 and the areas of cio special use and inland wetland were the smallest with proportions below 0 1 as shown in fig 3 zhuhai occupied the largest coastal area of 11 439 km2 accounted for 31 95 which was mainly composed of cio sscs especially the cio reserved jiangmen and huizhou also possessed large coastal areas between 12 5 and 14 5 the former mainly came from the forest scene while the latter mainly came from the cio reserved scene despite the greatest occupancy of marine capture for its nearly even distribution in each city 1 1 most of the marine capture areas have no strict administration boundaries and were allowed for fisheries by the nearby coastal fishermen thus were divided equally to the seven chinese mainland cities except the special administrative regions of hong kong and macao which retain relative independent ocean administration areas the very few forests in coastal guangzhou dongguan and zhongshan contributed to their comparatively small total spatial scene areas all below 8 1 whereas the significantly small administration area made macao the city with smallest total spatial scene area only 0 33 the per capita area of the sscs fig 3 for coastal jiangmen had the highest value of 1 16 ha about 5 9 times higher than the regional average value followed by huizhou zhongshan and zhuhai between 0 6 and 0 9 ha the second tier was guangzhou and dongguan with values of 0 15 0 26 ha cap macao hong kong and shenzhen had the lowest values from 0 02 to 0 05 ha in addition to the total spatial scene area within the city the population affected the per capita area significantly fig 3 3 3 2 ecological carrying capacity of coastal zone based on spatial scenes and its comparison with that based on lulc according to our framework the results of total and per capita ceccs estimated by spatial scenes ceccss in the study area are listed in table 4 the ceccss in the gba coastal zone was estimated to be 0 1877 gha per capita totaling 3 99 million gha in 2019 the marine capture scene provided the highest ceccss for the region reaching 1 69 million gha and 0 0796 gha cap accounted for 42 39 followed by forest 28 82 cio reserved 6 12 and residential 4 24 mainly owing to their large area and relatively high bioproductivity compared to global levels the per capita ceccss of most sscs ranged between 0 0013 and 0 0046 gha the ceccss of cio areas reached 2 21 million gha 23 64 higher than that of coastal land fig 4 demonstrated the composition of total and per capita ceccss in each city by comparing the fig 3 and fig 4 we can find out that the cities ranks in ceccss were similar to those in spatial scene area but there existed some discrepancies because of the difference in composition and bioproductivity of sscs and population for example the coastal zone of jiangmen contributed the highest ceccss in both total 765 11 thousand gha 19 15 and per capita values 1 73 gha cap mainly due to the large coverage of high bioproductive forests as well as the low population although zhuhai had the largest coastal spatial scene area much higher than jiangmen its main component of cio reserved was not as highly bioproductive as forest leading to its lower total ceccss 764 56 thousand gha 19 14 than that of jiangmen besides forest and cio reserved the proportions of cio protection plantation residential etc also caused differences between ceccss and spatial scene area the total ceccss of huizhou hong kong and shenzhen ranged between 510 and 545 thousand gha whereas those of guangzhou dongguan and zhongshan were only approximately 300 thousand gha which also indicated the significant impact of forests on ceccss most cities were approximately 0 2 1 1 gha of per capita ceccss however the overpopulation in coastal zones led to the extremely low per capita ceccss in shenzhen and hong kong only about 0 07 gha almost the lowest of all nine cities the lowest total 15 14 thousand gha and per capita ceccss 0 02 gha was found in macao because of its smallest administration area and dense population the cecc calculated by lulc cecclu in the study area reached 0 1535 gha per capita totaling 3 27 million gha approximately 18 19 lower than the ceccss results to compare with the cecclu components we added the ceccss of spatial scenes of forests forest and plantation cropland paddy and dryland fishing grounds all inland water and cio scenes and built up land all the settlement and transportation scenes respectively the results showed that a significant difference between cecclu and ceccss existed in cropland in which the former was 79 12 higher than the latter nevertheless all the cecclu values of the remaining lulc were lower than the related ceccss implying that the ecc is likely to be underestimated by the traditional ef3d model table 5 the difference between cecclu and ceccss should be attributed to the significant differences in classification standard and scale between spatial scene and lulc taking the cropland as an example this lulc type involves two spatial scenes i e paddy and dryland they differ remarkably in ecological process and biological productivity but are still regarded as a whole in lulc classification consequently it is inevitable that the equivalence factor and yield factor of cropland see supplementary table 7 differ largely from those of paddy table 4 although they are close to those of dryland as there are far more paddy than dryland in the gba coastal zone the deviation between cecclu and ceccss in cropland become inevitably significant 3 3 3 three dimensional ecological footprint of coastal zone based on spatial scenes and its comparison with that based on lulc efsize is the value between ef and ecc denoting the natural capital flow occupancy in 2019 the per capita efsize in the gba coastal zone estimated by spatial scenes efsize ss reached 0 1684 gha most sscs ceccss were occupied in 2019 except for the scenes of coastal aquaculture and mariculture services and cio tourism entertainment in some cities suggesting that nearly all the natural capital flows were taken up in each spatial scene efsize ss mainly existed in forest and marine capture fig 5 the occupations of per capita efsize ss in per capita cecc in guangzhou shenzhen dongguan and hong kong were over 90 while those in zhuhai and huizhou were around 60 and those in zhongshan jiangmen and macao were 40 54 efdepth represents the level of natural capital stock consumption the per capita efdepth in the study area estimated by spatial scenes efdepth ss reached 14 35 in 2019 and all the per capita efdepth ss values of the nine cities exceeded the original value of 1 implying unsustainable development in the coastal zones of all cities in the gba as shown in fig 6 a the per capita efdepth ss of most sscs exceeded 1 largely especially in grassland and traffic station which exceeded 200 much higher than other sscs showing an excessive biological resource energy consumption and ecological deficit in addition the scenes of cio port shipping industrial and dryland also had high values of per capita efdepth ss between 90 and 105 while those of cio industrial urban and road were around 40 indicating the natural capital stock therein was still substantially exploited due to the large bioproductive areas and comparatively low consumptions the per capita efdepth ss in plantation paddy commercial and forest scenes were 9 12 lower than the regional average but it should still be addressed to reduce the depletion of related resources the inland aquaculture marine capture residential and inland open water surface scenes were 3 5 in per capita efdepth ss a little higher than the original value of 1 indicating the relatively low level of capital stock consumption only the scenes of services and cio tourism entertainment equaled to 1 in per capita efdepth ss and were therefore sustainable as shown in fig 6b macao took the lead in the per capita efdepth ss 93 74 followed by hong kong 58 07 shenzhen 28 61 and dongguan 17 22 the per capita efdepth ss values of guangzhou huizhou zhuhai and zhongshan were between 3 and 9 jiangmen had the lowest per capita efdepth ss 1 76 ef3d demonstrates the comprehensive depletion of natural capital flows and stocks in 2019 the per capita ef3d in the gba coastal zone estimated by spatial scenes ef3d ss reached 2 42 gha the highest per capita ef3d ss occurred in the grassland reaching 0 57 gha followed by forest 0 49 gha industrial 0 46 gha and marine capture 0 35 gha scenes the remaining per capita ef3d ss were below 0 20 gha fig 7 a as seen in fig 7b hong kong had the largest per capita ef3d ss of 3 93 gha mainly owing to its high consumption in grassland marine capture and cio port shipping huizhou was the second high city in per capita ef3d ss reaching 3 20 gha which was attributed to the greatest ef3d ss in industrial scene for the high energy consumption in electricity and power generation the per capita ef3d ss in dongguan and guangzhou were 2 3 gha while those in shenzhen jiangmen zhongshan and zhuhai were 1 2 gha despite the highest efdepth ss macao still had the lowest value of per capita ef3d ss below 1 gha attributing to its very small efsize ss detailed ef3d ss of each spatial scene in each city are listed in table 6 along with the efsize ss and efdepth ss of the entire study area table 7 compares the per capita efsize efdepth and ef3d calculated by lulc efsize lu efdepth lu ef3d lu respectively with those estimated by spatial scenes in each city and the entire study area the efdepth lu and ef3d lu were found to be 20 56 and 13 17 higher than the efdepth ss and ef3d ss respectively while the efsize lu was 6 13 less than the efsize ss the efdepth and ef3d estimated by lulc in most of the nine cities were higher than those estimated by spatial scenes whereas the efsize lu in most cities were lower than efsize ss which should be attributed to the ecc underestimation by the traditional ef3d model the largest overestimation of ef3d and efsize occurred in macao the per capita ef3d lu were more than twice the per capita ef3d ss and the per capita efsize lu were 81 12 higher than the per capita efsize ss the per capita ef3d lu in most cities were slightly below 11 higher than the per capita ef3d ss while the per capita efsize lu were mainly 20 30 lower than the efsize ss the largest overestimation of efdepth occurred in dongguan 37 83 higher and the per capita efdepth lu in most cities were 24 35 higher than the per capita efdepth ss apart from engendering difference between cecclu and ceccss the significant differences of classification standard and scale between spatial scene and lulc also contribute to the disparity in division of biological resource consumption and energy consumption therefore the ecc and ef differences will lead to the disparity in ef efsize efdepth and ef3d between the spatial scene based framework and the traditional lulc based calculation in particular taking macao as an example the per capita areas and eccs of most spatial scenes are extremely small thus the accumulation of the smaller one of the ecc and ef within each spatial scene will result to a much smaller efsize ss than the efsize lu together with a smaller efdepth ss it ultimately leads to a significantly smaller ef3d ss than the ef3d lu 4 discussion and suggestions 4 1 discussion efdepth has been revealed to be significantly impacted by the economy while ef3d is highly correlated with the energy consumption structure in many related studies du et al 2016 xun and hu 2019 wang et al 2020 hence to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of our results we compared the relationship of per capita gross domestic product gdp as an economic indicator with the per capita efdepth ss and efdepth lu and explored the relationship of per capita energy ef with the per capita ef3d lu and ef3d ss of the secondary and tertiary industries stis as the energy ef mainly existed in these two industries other than the primary industry at the city scale as shown in fig 8 the relationship between gdp and efdepth ss had a greater correlation r² 0 9433 p 0 0001 than that between gdp and efdepth lu r² 0 9369 p 0 0001 fig 8a and the correlation of energy ef with ef3d ss of stis r² 0 8485 p 0 0004 was much greater and more significant than that with ef3d lu r² 0 6610 p 0 0077 fig 8b indicating a better reflection of the economic development status and energy consumption structure by the results estimated by spatial scene than that by lulc from fig 8 we can also see that the efdepth lu is higher than efdepth ss overall whereas the ef3d lu is higher than the ef3d ss when energy ef is small and lower than the ef3d ss when energy ef reaches a certain height implying that the consumption of natural capital stocks might be slightly overvalued while the comprehensive depletion of natural capital flows and stocks is likely to be overestimated under a small energy consumption and underestimated under a large energy consumption by the traditional ef3d model in addition our framework considers the diversity of human activities and energy consumption among cio areas by dividing them into scenes of fishery port shipping industrial urban protection etc thus embodying the regional differences in marine economic development modes and is therefore superior to the traditional ef3d model which only considers all marine areas as fishing grounds and neglects other utilization or reservation of the sea as illustrated in fig 9 the ef3d ss in cio areas cio ef3d ss showed a significant positive correlation with marine gdp overall r² 0 6199 p 0 05 revealing stress of marine economic development activities on coastal and marine eco environment the cio ef3d ss in hong kong and guangzhou were far higher than the regression line between the cio ef3d ss and marine gdp of the nine cities indicating the high consumption per gdp of their marine industries whereas it was on the opposite side of zhuhai and macao hong kong 2 2 according to world shipping council shenzhen guangzhou hong kong and dongguan ranked the 4th 5th 8th and 46th respectively in the world s busiest container ports in 2019 based on the total number of twenty foot equivalent units teus transported through the port which reached 25 770 23 236 18 361 and 4 000 thousand teus respectively nevertheless there were more ocean faring container ships to hong kong than to the other three cities owing to its ideal conditions for berthing and a more open registration environment is a vitally important international port city the marine logistics and transportation industry for import and export trade consumes a plethora of energy guangzhou dongguan shenzhen and zhongshan are also important domestic port cities besides marine logistics and transportation industry they also develop plenty of high energy consumed industries such as marine chemical and steel industry marine shipbuilding and engineering equipment manufacturing industry compare to above cities huizhou and jiangmen have higher proportions of marine primary industry while zhuhai 3 3 zhuhai was awarded one of the first ten chinese tourism and leisure demonstration cities in 2017 and it was also the only city selected in guangdong province by the end of 2019 zhuhai received 46 million visitors about 23 times the permanent resident population and the revenue of tourism totalled 54 billion yuan around 7 83 billion dollars about 16 of the gdp and macao 4 4 macao is famous for gaming entertainment and tourism industries by the end of 2019 macao received 39 4 million visitors about 58 times the permanent resident population and the tourism value added totalled 220 9 billion mop around 27 50 billion dollars about 50 5 of the gross value added of all industries focus more on marine tourism and marine service industry making them far lower energy consumed the high efdepth and ef3d with small efsize and cecc per capita in the gba coastal zone reveals that the natural capital flow occupancy no longer meets the regional resource demand under the current activities and economic development mode and abundant capital stocks are being consumed therein or transferred from other countries and regions in 2020 the population density in gba coastal areas was as high as 2173 people per km2 about 14 8 times the average population density 147 capita km2 in china at the same time according to our estimation the gba coastal zone consumed substantial energy and biological resource including 1629 kw h km2 of electricity 2636 tons km2 of coal 86 tons km2 of gasoline 599 tons km2 of kerosene 767 tons km2 of diesel and 2019 m3 km2 of wood and paper products 244 tons km2 of cereals 207 tons km2 of meat 88 tons km2 of seafood much higher than the average level of china shortage of land and natural resources accompany with tremendous domestic commercial and industrial consumption demand led to insufficient ecc and great ef in gba coastal zone in addition comparisons of our results with those of other relevant studies reveal similar conclusions wang et al 2020b assessed the efdepth and ef3d of each city in the gba from 2009 to 2016 regardless of the different methods and study year in the two studies the comparison still shows that the per capita efdepth and ef3d 5 5 wang et al 2020b used a different method to calculate the ef3d to be comparable we recalculated the ef3d by multiplying the efsize and efdepth in the study of the coastal areas in most cities were respectively 0 4 6 5 times and 1 1 14 7 times higher than those of the entire administration area in 2016 implying a much greater pressure in the coastal zones than the inland areas within the same region we also compared our coastal land efdepth and ef3d with the results 6 6 to be comparable only the per capita efdepth and ef3d of coastal cities in shandong i e binzhou dongying weifang qingdao yantai weihai and rizhao were selected and averaged for comparison the population and heavy industries in shandong coastal cities mostly distribute in the coastal area of xun and hu 2019 who evaluated ecological sustainability in shandong province in china it was found that the per capita efdepth and ef3d in our study area were 5 and 76 smaller than those in the coastal cities in shandong respectively this might be attributed to the significant industry structural differences in the two regions high energy consumption is caused by heavy industries in shandong especially crude oil raw coal and coke xun and hu 2019 which is not the main consumption in the light industries dominating our study area this finding also verifies the impact of energy consumption structure on the regional ef and further confirms the rationality and accuracy of our results 4 2 implications and suggestions the classification of spatial scenes in our framework for cecc and ef assessment could effectively reflect diverse human activities complex land use modes and exploitation and protection of the land and ocean thus offering a finer resolution than lulc in cecc and ef assessment and providing a more valuable insight into improving sustainability development fig 10 demonstrates the ef3d composition in the nine cities the ef3d ss in the whole gba coastal zone mainly distributed in grassland 23 57 forest 20 31 industrial 18 87 marine capture 14 62 cio port shipping 8 27 traffic station 7 97 dryland 5 18 and cio industrial urban 4 89 the industrial forest grassland marine capture and dryland scenes respectively contributed a large proportion of ef3d ssin most cities and the ef3d ss of traffic station had a comparatively higher percentage in guangzhou shenzhen hong kong and macao while the large occupation of ef3d ss of cio port shipping only existed hong kong and guangzhou the industry is well developed in the gba coastal cities however they are still at the cost of high energy and biological resources according to a report by china development institute cdi 2019 the energy consumption and electricity consumption per unit of gdp of the gba are about twice and treble the average levels of the san francisco new york and tokyo bay areas respectively the forestry industries in the study area including processing of timber manufacture of wood products furniture papermaking and printing consumed over 63 13 million m3 wood in 2019 approximately two thirds of the total consumption of guangdong province in addition hong kong macao guangzhou and shenzhen are international and domestic metropolis with world s busiest air sea and land transportation and logistics activities consuming substantial oil and coal products at the same time the long term and excessive marine capture activities make the gba offshore area at risk of fishery resources exhaustion moreover the high level of urbanization has resulted in insufficient arable land and grassland and the dense population has led to strong rigid demand for food resources and energy contributing to a gargantuan depletion of natural capital in the region accordingly the following suggestions are put forward 1 accelerating the industrial transformation and upgrading the local government should regulate the economic activities of various enterprises under the cecc restrict the energy and resources consumption in industries activities and raise clean production evaluation standards thus prompting enterprises to promote technological innovation and raise resource use efficiency spontaneously especially in the papermaking printing marine chemistry and steel industry marine shipbuilding and engineering equipment manufacturing industry marine logistics and transportation industry and so on an economic structure conducive to green low carbon and circular development shall be vigorously fostered and emerging marine economy such as marine tourism and marine service industry shall be vigorously developed 2 strengthening the conservation of ecological agricultural and marine space a certain proportion of ecologically significant land and cultivated land must be demarcated preserved and strictly forbidden to occupy such as grassland farmland wood land nature reserves and so on to ensure ecological and food security expanding prohibited fishing area coastal wetland such as mangrove and coral reef and important waters such as spawning grounds feeding grounds wintering grounds and migration channels must be conserved and restored classification and gradation of prohibited fishing system shall be established the prohibition extent and period in conserved areas estuary trunk stream and important tributaries shall be more strict than other water area at the same time the local authority should strictly control the scale of coastal reclamation and the development and utilization activities of coastline maintaining basic stability of the sea used for fisheries in addition it is necessary to develop intensive and environment friendly agriculture and aquaculture 3 transforming the public consumption concepts and production methods it is necessary to guide the public to change the consumption concepts in daily life and production methods and form green and low carbon consumption pattern by reasonable policy and effected measures in addition the local government should strictly control the excessive population growth thus conducive to limit the resource consumption and environmental pollution to coastal area 4 3 uncertainties nevertheless there remain some uncertainties in our study the relatively rough calculations of consumption data and some key parameters e g equivalence and yield factors might cause a slight deviation in the final results in addition because spatial scenes require finer spatial resolution and classification they are difficult to be extracted and classified from remote sensing images automatically and accurately which requires substantial manual work and time especially in a large study area this may cause errors in the spatial scene recognition and limit the application of our framework to some extent we recommend applying our framework on a regional scale to guarantee accuracy furthermore we believe that the coastal spatial scene classification proposed here represents only one possible option modification in accordance with study area situation is welcomed 5 conclusions this study proposed the concept of spatial scene to substitute the calculation basis lulc of the traditional ef3d model and established a novel framework for cecc and sustainability assessment an assessment of cecc and sustainability was conducted in the coastal zone of gba in 2019 to examine the applicability and reliability of our framework the framework has great advantages in of reflecting diverse human activities complex land use modes and exploitation and protection of the land and ocean thus providing a more effective and accurate assessment for cecc and sustainability in 2019 the ceccss in the study area reached 0 1877 gha per capita totaled 3 99 million gha and largest ceccss distributes in the scenes of marine capture and forest and the cities of jiangmen and zhuhai the per capita efsize ss efdepth ss and ef3d ss reached 0 1684 gha 14 35 and 2 42 gha respectively representing unsustainable development in the gba coastal zone efsize ss mainly existed in forest and marine capture while the grassland and traffic station possessed the highest efdepth ss the ef3d mainly distributed in scenes of grassland forest industrial marine capture cio port shipping traffic station dryland and cio industrial urban while only the services and cio tourism entertainment scenes were within cecc and therefore sustainable macao hong kong and shenzhen took the lead in the per capita efdepth ss while hong kong huizhou and dongguan had the largest per capita ef3d therefore suggestions are put forward to promote the sustainable development of cba coastal zone such as accelerating the industrial transformation and upgrading strengthening the conservation of ecological agricultural and marine space and transforming the public consumption concepts and production methods eq 1 7 supplementary materials can be found online at https doi org xxx declaration of

24476,yellow fever yf is an acute infectious hemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus yfv and transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes in brazil and other south american countries the disease has been restricted to the sylvatic cycle in which the virus circulates among mosquitoes and non human primates in forested areas frequent outbreaks in the amazon basin that spread to other brazilian ecoregions have been observed in recent years the most recent started in 2014 and spread to forests in densely populated areas on the brazilian atlantic coast resulting in the death of hundreds of humans and thousands of monkeys however the underlying ecological mechanisms that support yfv amplification and the severity of an epizootic and persistence of the virus on a microgeographic scale in these forest patches are still poorly understood here we developed an agent based model that simulates the dynamics of yfv transmission in a hypothetical forest fragment the proposed model contains individual agents representing mosquitoes breeding sites howler monkeys alouatta and other vertebrate species living and interacting in an environment where the yfv has emerged the model simulations aimed to investigate the isolated and interaction effects of important input parameters linked to mosquitoes monkeys the environment and hypothetical alternative hosts on the following outcomes 1 maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes 2 proportion of dead monkeys and 3 yfv persistence in the environment local and global sensitivity analyses were used to assess the influence of different sets of input parameter values on the outputs the model simulations indicated that mosquito abundance had the greatest influence on the outputs and made a major contribution to monkey mortality additionally most of the variation in the outputs was due to complex and indirect effects of the different input parameters these results suggest that mosquito density is one of the main factors responsible for yfv amplification during epizootics and reinforce the hypothesis that the severity and persistence of an outbreak depend on a complex web of interactions between different factors associated with vectors hosts and the environment keywords yellow fever agent based model mosquitoes alouatta haemagogus 1 introduction yellow fever yf represents a significant public health issue in tropical and subtropical areas of africa and south america even though a safe effective vaccine has been available since the 1930s who 2018 while epidemics in rural and urban areas frequently occur on the african continent in brazil and other south american countries the yellow fever virus yfv has been restricted to the sylvatic cycle monath and vasconcelos 2015 the last large urban yf epidemic in brazil occurred in 1928 and was associated with the urban vector aedes aegypti franco 1969 the yellow fever virus circulates enzootically and endemically in the amazon basin where epizootic events in non human primate nhp populations have frequently occurred over the last hundred years preceding the appearance of human cases in rural or peri urban areas close to locations in northern and central brazil where epizootics occur dispersion of the virus from endemic regions in the brazilian amazon to non endemic regions in the rest of the country has been reported since the 1940s vasconcelos 2010 these dispersion events occur at least once every decade causing epizootic and epidemic waves in eastern and southern regions of the country franco 1969 monath and vasconcelos 2015 the most recent reemergence of yf in south america expanded yfv transmission to areas with no vaccine recommendation on the atlantic coast of southeastern brazil reaching forests in the vicinity of densely populated areas such as the cities of são paulo and rio de janeiro and significantly increasing the risk of re urbanization of the disease possas et al 2018 a total of 4217 nhp deaths 852 human deaths and 2839 human cases were reported in brazil between 2014 and 2019 of which 98 occurred in southeastern states paho 2019 brazilian ministry of health 2020 the majority of new world nhp species are highly susceptible to yfv infection but some are more severely affected resulting in high lethality rates for these species especially howler monkeys alouatta mares guia et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a susceptible nhp species are yfv amplifier hosts that can infect sylvatic mosquitoes however they are not considered yfv reservoirs because of the short viremic periods from 2 to 6 days and high lethality or permanent immunity after recovery in these animals hervé et al 1986 on the other hand there are mosquito species that are both yfv vectors and reservoirs because they can transmit the virus not only to nhps horizontal transmission but also to their progeny vertical transmission as they lay eggs that can remain viable for months in unfavorable environmental conditions dutary and leduc 1981 hervé et al 1986 mondet et al 2002 the sylvatic mosquitoes haemagogus janthinomys and h leucocelaenus are the primary vectors and reservoirs of the yfv in brazil abreu et al 2019a invasion by and amplification and establishment of vector borne diseases in a new environment are determined by multiple factors that vary over time and space kilpatrick and randolph 2012 johnson et al 2015 ogden et al 2019 these factors which include favorable climatic conditions high vector and host densities changes in land use and low vaccine coverage have been contributing to the appearance of novel yfv strains and ultimately to large scale epizootic and epidemic events in brazil vasconcelos 2010 possas et al 2018 almeida et al 2019 thoisy et al 2020 nevertheless the underlying mechanisms that support yfv amplification as well as the severity of the epizootic and persistence of the virus on a microgeographic scale remain poorly understood the many variables and species involved in the transmission cycle make it costly time consuming and in certain cases unfeasible to obtain the empirical data necessary for a better understanding of the sylvatic dynamics of yf therefore the development of models to simulate the transmission dynamics of the virus between host and vector populations can be an alternative for testing and proposing new hypotheses about the ecology and epidemiology of the disease allowing researchers to identify issues that should be investigated as a matter of priority in empirical studies and to predict risk situations given the worrisome number of human cases and deaths and the high nhp mortality during the recent reemergence of yf in brazil paho 2019 fernandes et al 2021a we developed an agent based model abm that simulates the dynamic of yfv transmission in a hypothetical forest fragment the proposed model contains individual agents representing mosquitoes breeding sites howler monkeys and other vertebrate species

forest fragment inhabited by populations of the vector mosquito howler monkeys and other vertebrate animals the purpose of the model is to answer the following questions which conditions parameters have a greater influence on a the prevalence of the virus in the mosquito population b howler monkey mortality and c the persistence of the virus in the environment the following criteria which reflect patterns observed empirically are used for the usefulness of the model 1 once inserted in the environment and under suitable conditions the virus must spread between vectors and hosts reducing the population of howler monkeys 2 the model must reproduce similar patterns to those found in mosquito populations e g similar parity longevity infection rate and seasonal changes in abundance and larval development time 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model consists of four entities mosquitoes monkeys other hosts and patches the mosquitoes represent female individuals of the genus haemagogus the main vectors of the yfv in brazil abreu et al 2019a the monkeys represent howler monkeys genus alouatta whose lethality is very high during yf epizootic outbreaks mares guia et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a other hosts represent species of terrestrial vertebrates inhabiting the forest fragment the other hosts agents can assume two different roles when in contact with the virus 1 they can be dead end hosts which means they are not able to replicate the virus at sufficient levels in the bloodstream to transmit it again to mosquitoes or 2 they can be alternative hosts that can replicate the virus and transmit it to vector mosquitoes finally the model distinguishes between two types of patches forest and breeding sites circulation of the virus is represented by different state variables for the vertebrate hosts and mosquitoes susceptible exposed the individual has been infected but is not yet able to transmit the virus to a susceptible agent infectious the individual can transmit the virus to a susceptible agent and immune the agents that represent mosquitoes have two state variables corresponding to the gonotrophic cycle and yfv infection state the gonotrophic cycle can assume four states newly emerged blood seeking engorged or gravid as for yfv infection the mosquitoes can assume three states susceptible exposed or infectious each mosquito also has quantitative state variables to indicate the number of oviposition events it has performed amount of blood ingested and blood digestion time in addition parameters that define biting success daily survival rate and host and breeding site detection radius are set for the population five groups of six individuals representing monkeys are allocated in the grid and each group moves through a limited territory each individual has a number that relates it to the group it belongs to a list containing the patches that represent the group s territory an area with a radius of 18 patches around a central patch and its status in the group i e alpha or subordinate the alpha individuals define the direction in which the group will move and whether or not any movement will be performed at each time step the yfv state for each individual in the group can be susceptible exposed infectious or immune the other hosts have a state variable that defines the individual as a dead end host or alternative host alternative hosts can be susceptible exposed infectious or immune an average lifespan for the populations can be set and mortality due to yfv infection is considered null except for dead end hosts all agents have parameters that define the virus latent period and transmission competence in addition while monkeys and alternative hosts have parameters that define the viremic period when they are in an infectious state once mosquito individuals become infectious they remain in this state patches of the type forest have no state variables other than their location on the grid while breeding site patches represent places in the forest where mosquitoes in the gravid state can lay their eggs breeding site patches have lists that indicate whether any eggs were laid in the patch how many eggs were laid the time elapsed since each oviposition event and whether an infectious mosquito performed a given oviposition there is also a mechanism that controls larval density so that when the patch receives a large number of eggs larval mortality also increases see submodels section each time step of the model represents one hour of the day for modeling purposes the day lasts 10 h 10 time steps representing the diurnal activity of howler monkeys and haemagogus mosquitoes since both have daytime behavior and usually rest at night the grid consists of 101 101 patches with a bounded space simulating an isolated forest fragment extending over approximately 102 hectares each patch represents an area of 100m² and the linear distance between the center of two adjacent patches represents 10 m 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the model has two main processes 1 mosquito population dynamics consisting of the gonotrophic cycle larval development and control of mosquito abundance and larval density 2 virus transmission dynamics consisting of the vector host interaction the incubation period in the vector and hosts and the recovery or death of hosts table 1 shows the order of events performed at each time step 2 1 4 submodels the model actions or submodels listed in table 1 are performed in sequential time steps their empirical and theoretical backgrounds are described below 2 1 4 1 update the current k parameter the abundance of mosquitoes including those of the genus haemagogus is influenced by seasonal variations in rainfall temperature and relative humidity marcondes and alencar 2010 ribeiro et al 2012 couto lima et al 2020 for example chadee et al 1992 observed that the abundance of h janthinomys in trinidad was up to six times greater in rainy periods than in dry periods to simulate the effect of seasonal variations on mosquito populations the proposed model uses a parameter that controls the carrying capacity in the environment here called current k current k has two functions 1 to simulate the effect of seasonal variations in the abundance of mosquitoes during a year i e 3650 time steps 2 to control the emergence of new adult mosquitoes in the grid as the breeding site patches access the current k information current k is updated at each time step with the following equation c u r r e n t k α β sin 2 π t 180 π γ cos 2 π t 180 π where α k max k min 2 k max initial number of mosquitoes k min k max 6 β k max k min 3650 2 γ α k max t 0 5 time 3650 the sine and cosine terms assign a cyclic pattern to the equation the constant 2π 180 π is the circumference of a circle where 180 π does the conversion from degrees netlogo standard to radians 2 1 4 2 update the time elapsed since oviposition and count the number of immatures in the patch each breeding site patch contains a list called larval development time that records the number of immatures at the site and updates the development time for each individual for each egg laid in the patch a new item with value 0 is added to the beginning of the list each new time step adds a unit to all items in the list 2 1 4 3 check and control oviposition density in the patch each breeding site patch in the model represents an area of 100 m² with larval habitats for mosquitoes haemagogus mosquitoes usually lay their eggs in tree holes and bamboo internodes at each time step the breeding site patch checks the total number of larval individuals it has and selects and eliminates one or more individuals at random with a probability p which increases with the larval density this mechanism aims to simulate density dependent intraspecific competition walker et al 1991 the parameter p follows a logistic distribution figure s2 and is obtained by assigning the values sv1 0 99 sv2 0 5 lv1 15 and lv2 90 where sv is the survival probability and lv is the number of larvae in the patch the parameter p is calculated as follows d l n s v 1 1 s v 1 c l n s v 2 1 s v 2 b d c l v 1 l v 2 a d b l v 1 z e x p a b l v p z 1 z when there are no more than fifteen immatures lv1 in the same patch each individual s survival probability is above 99 sv1 a value for the density of immatures at which the likelihood of survival becomes 50 sv2 was then parameterized the average time taken from oviposition to emergence of an adult was used to fit this parameter so that this time should be short in favorable seasonal periods and relatively long in unfavorable seasonal periods for this purpose values of 60 90 and 120 immatures were tested and adjusted to a 50 probability of survival it was then decided to select 90 immatures lv2 since this value allowed for a plausible pattern in the average times for emergence of an adult corresponding to 20 days in favorable periods at maximum current k and 60 days in unfavorable periods at minimum current k for haemagogus and other aedini mosquitoes adults are not expected to emerge for months in colder less rainy periods as the eggs are resistant to desiccation and can diapause for periods of up to one year marcondes and alencar 2010 2 1 4 4 update and check the newly emerged mosquitoes the time elapsed since the emergence of the new adult individual is updated after ten time steps the state of the individual is changed from newly emerged to blood seeking as soon as a new adult emerges the individual is kept immobile in the same patch it emerged in until its state changes this action simulates the time it takes for exoskeletons to harden and newly emerged females to copulate forattini 2002 2 1 4 5 move monkeys firstly the model checks whether there is an alpha individual in the group if not another individual is chosen randomly from the group members to become the alpha member of the group next the individuals check if they are within their group s territory limits and return to the territory if they are outside it the alpha individuals in each group then move after which the subordinate individuals move the alpha individual chooses a random direction between 0 and 360 and moves from 0 to 10 patches at random in a single time step howler monkeys often travel less than 1 km day fortes et al 2015 subordinate individuals select a direction that does not vary by more than 10 from the direction chosen by the alpha individual and move the same distance with a variation of up to one patch this mechanism allows the group to be kept less dispersed while it moves in its territory even during their active period howler monkeys do not move very much and spend most of their time sleeping or eating crockett and eisenberg 1987 chiarello 1993 the model therefore allows groups of monkeys to move at each time step with a probability of only 20 each group s territory extends over an area with a radius of 18 patches around a central patch so that the territories have an approximately circular shape and are arranged on the grid in such a way that they do not overlap as the distance between the center of two adjacent patches is 10 m the total area for each group of monkeys is equivalent to π 1802 101 788 m2 a value close to the average living area for howler monkeys which is around 10 2 hectares bicca marques et al 2018 2 1 4 6 move other hosts each individual randomly selects a direction within a 360 radius and moves from 0 to 5 patches for simplicity the movement is random and there is no interaction with other individuals of the same species 2 1 4 7 digest the blood meal the time since the mosquitoes in the engorged state obtained blood from the hosts is checked if more than 50 time steps have elapsed since the individual fed its state is updated to gravid and the individual starts to move in search of breeding site patches to lay its eggs if 50 time steps or fewer have elapsed and the individual has obtained enough blood for the eggs to develop it will move slowly and randomly in the environment no more than 0 5 patches per time step however if the individual has not obtained enough blood it will continue to search for hosts the time taken between digestion of blood and oviposition was selected to be similar to that of the haemagogus gonotrophic cycle around 5 7 days mondet 1997 dégallier et al 1998 2 1 4 8 search for a host for a blood meal mosquitoes in the blood seeking state will search for hosts in their surroundings according to the parameter that controls the host detection radius if a host is detected the mosquito will move towards it the movement of the mosquito towards the host is randomly assigned varying from 0 to the distance to the host if the blood seeking mosquito detects no host it moves random distances of up to one patch per time step in a random direction between 0 and 360 2 1 4 9 search for a breeding site to lay eggs mosquitoes in the gravid state will search for a breeding site patch in their surroundings according to the parameter that controls the breeding site detection radius if a breeding site patch is detected the individual moves towards the patch if no breeding site patches are detected the individual keeps moving at random distances of up to 1 patch per time step in a random direction between 0 and 360 when the individual is in a breeding site patch oviposition is performed immediately the individual then changes its state from gravid to blood seeking and the number of ovipositions the individual has completed is updated in turn the patch in which the oviposition occurred updates both its lists the first includes information about each immature individual s development time and the second specifies whether the individual came from an infectious female or not oviposition is interpreted here as deposition of the entire egg load of a gravid female in a gonotrophic cycle which is around 15 to 40 eggs for haemagogus chadee and tikasingh 1989 mondet 1997 therefore assuming that a gravid female lays a mean of 30 eggs in her gonotrophic cycle half of which will become adult females for the purposes of the model each mosquito lays an average of 15 eggs at the breeding site and the number of eggs varies according to a poisson distribution based on the study by chadee and tikasingh 1989 on the oviposition behavior of h janthinomys it was assumed that there is no nocturnal oviposition activity for gravid mosquitoes 2 1 4 10 vector host interaction mosquitoes with a blood seeking state detect whether there is a vertebrate host less than five meters 0 5 patches away see breugel et al 2015 if a host is detected an interaction can occur for situations where two or more hosts are detected the mosquito will select one of them at random interaction between a mosquito and host will only occur if a random value generated between 0 and 1 is less than 0 5 which is the value assumed for the biting success parameter after the interaction the mosquito s state changes to engorged and if it has obtained enough blood it will stop looking for a blood meal when the individual does not obtain enough blood from the host it keeps trying to have new blood meals until it can obtain the minimum amount of blood necessary for eggs to develop see farjana and tuno 2013 once the interaction has occurred a random number between 0 and 1 is generated if this number is less than 0 5 the mosquito has not obtained enough blood for the eggs to develop and will try to obtain a new blood meal from the same or another host the value of a blood meal is added to the value of the previous ones and when the total reaches 0 5 the mosquito will be satiated and its state will no longer be blood seeking after an interaction between a mosquito and a host the digestion time for the ingested blood starts to count even if the mosquito has not yet obtained enough blood in which case the individual will be simultaneously in the engorged and blood seeking states at each interaction virus transmission between vector and hosts can occur depending on the yfv state of each individual and the parameters that control the transmission competence thus if a mosquito in the susceptible state feeds on the blood of an infectious monkey or alternative host the mosquito has a probability of becoming infected with the virus and moving to the exposed state in turn mosquitoes in the infectious state can transmit the virus by interacting with susceptible hosts thereby changing the host s state to exposed during an infective contact a random number between 0 and 1 is generated according to a uniform distribution if the value is lower than the infectious individual s transmission competence parameter the virus is transmitted 2 1 4 11 check extrinsic incubation period the time since mosquitoes in the exposed state became infected is checked and updated as individuals complete the extrinsic incubation period their state changes to infectious based on studies with the vector aedes aegypti johansson et al 2010 the extrinsic incubation period for the yfv was assumed to be twelve days 2 1 4 12 check incubation period the time since exposed monkeys and alternative hosts became infected is checked and updated if the individual has reached the latent period of the virus the state exposed is updated to infectious a latency of 3 days is assumed for both monkeys and alternative hosts moreno et al 2015 2 1 4 13 recovery or death once the monkeys enter the viremic period infectious state the time elapsed is checked and updated if the entire viremic period has elapsed the state is updated according to the probability of death for infected monkeys md a random number between 0 and 1 is generated with a uniform distribution if the number generated is greater than md the individual s state changes from infectious to immune and if it is less than md the individual is eliminated from the simulation the viremic period considered for monkeys was four days moreno et al 2015 and the probability of death for infected monkeys was set to 0 8 see mason et al 1973 2 1 4 14 check and eliminate mosquito a number between 0 and 1 is generated with a uniform random distribution for each mosquito if the number is less than the hourly mosquito mortality rate the individual is eliminated from the simulation the hourly mortality rate µh can be obtained based on the daily survival rate s of haemagogus using the equation µh ln s 10 2 1 4 15 emergence of adult mosquitoes each breeding site patch accesses information about the abundance of mosquitoes in the environment and the value of the parameter current k if the abundance is lower than current k and an immature mosquito in the patch has reached the minimum development time a new adult mosquito emerges the minimum development time from egg to emergence of an adult was assumed to be 12 days alencar et al 2008a if the newly emerged mosquito comes from an infected female s oviposition the individual has a probability of starting its adult phase in the infectious state that depends on the vertical infection rate vir parameter see supplementary text s3 a number between 0 and 1 is randomly generated with a uniform distribution if the number is less than vir the new mosquitoes will be in the infectious state and if it is greater than vir they will be in the susceptible state after a new adult emerges the patch eliminates the information it contains about this individual 2 1 4 16 check other hosts lifespan the time each individual has lived is updated if its lifetime has been reached the individual is eliminated from the simulation after the individual dies another is generated to keep the population size constant the generated individual starts the simulation in the susceptible state if it is an alternative host or in the immune state if it is a dead end host the time the new individual will live is assigned according to the lifespan parameter which is the mean of a poisson distribution 2 1 4 17 insert infected mosquitoes at a certain point in the simulation individuals from the mosquito population will be randomly selected and their state will be changed from susceptible to infectious to start the virus transmission cycle to allow the mosquito population dynamics to stabilize during the simulation and considering that yfv outbreaks tend to occur in periods of high abundance of mosquitoes the mechanism that simulates viral transmission is inserted into the model 365 days after the start 3650 time steps coinciding with a period of maximum mosquito abundance maximum current k to this end the state of 2 of the mosquito population is changed to infectious this procedure can be compared to an imaginary experiment in which the transmission dynamics are observed by introducing a certain number of infected mosquitoes into a controlled natural environment 18 update the outputs check stop conditions and update the time step after the outputs are updated the stop conditions are checked three criteria are needed to stop the simulation 1 the time step must be greater than 3650 when the virus starts to circulate 2 there must be no mosquitoes monkeys or other hosts with infectious or exposed state and 3 there must be no oviposition events by infectious mosquitoes in the breeding site patches once these three conditions are met the simulation is completed since the virus is no longer circulating in the environment if the stop conditions are not met the time step is updated and the simulation returns to the first action in table 1 2 1 5 initialization to initialize the model five groups of monkeys each with six individuals and a defined initial number of dead end hosts alternative hosts and mosquitoes are inserted in the grid since the maximum supported abundance of mosquitoes in a given environment also depends on the availability of breeding sites the model was balanced so that the number of breeding site patches depends on the initial number of mosquitoes it was therefore decided to have one breeding site patch inserted for every twelve mosquitoes the mosquitoes and other hosts are randomly allocated in the grid while the monkey groups start in the center of their territories the breeding site patches start the simulation with between zero and 89 immatures the development time for each immature is also selected at random between 1 and 150 time steps all mosquitoes and hosts start the simulation in the susceptible for yfv state mosquitoes initialize with the following state variable values 1 number of ovipositions performed 0 2 amount of blood ingested 0 3 blood digestion time 1 this value is changed to 0 immediately after a mosquito has a blood meal and 4 biting success for each interaction with a host 0 5 the mosquito parameters daily survival rate 0 93 and host and breeding site detection radius 4 were parameterized using sensitivity tests supplementary text s2 the same proportion of mosquitoes 25 is initially set for each of the four states of the gonotrophic cycle based on this configuration the mosquito population dynamics tend to take around 150 time steps to stabilize for the agents representing the monkeys initialization involves creating an individual in the center of their territory this individual is assigned to the alpha state and immediately generates five other individuals who are assigned to the subordinate state all individuals also have state variables that define their group and the patches that comprise their territory for other hosts remaining lifetimes ranging from 0 to the parameter that defines the average lifespan of the population are assigned to each individual for example if the average lifespan of other hosts is set to 1000 days each initial individual will be assigned a random value between 0 and 1000 that will define its remaining lifetime the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes or spatial configurations 2 2 model parameterization and calibration the model parameters 35 parameters supplementary table s1 were assigned based on empirical data obtained from observational and experimental studies calibration and plausible assumptions nine key parameters were selected and evaluated by local and global sensitivity analyses to assess their influence on the model outputs see section 2 3 visual and quantitative comparison of the outputs of the model and data from empirical observations were used to validate the mosquito population dynamics by calibrating the parameters to reproduce accurately the time from egg to emergence of an adult see section 2 1 and supplementary figure s3 mean and maximum mosquito longevity and parity patterns supplementary text s2 supplementary figure s4 2 3 data analysis and simulation experiments in order to achieve the study goals three outputs were analyzed in the simulations 1 maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes 2 proportion of dead monkeys and 3 number of days the yfv persists in the environment to prevent the maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes being influenced by the initial proportion of infected mosquitoes 2 the program counts this output only after the second generation of infected mosquitoes and ignores the generation that starts the circulation of the virus nine input parameters were subjected to sensitivity analyses to assess their influence on the outputs the selected parameters were mosquito abundance mosqab also represented by the parameter k max vertical infection rate vir mosquito transmission competence mosqcomp monkey transmission competence monkcomp alternative host transmission competence altcomp alternative host mean lifespan altlife alternative host viremic period altvirem alternative host abundance altab and dead end host abundance d endab local and global sensitivity analyses explored the influence of different sets of input parameter values on the outputs a local sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the selected input parameters by 50 above or below their default value following the one factor at time approach thiele et al 2014 the following default values were assigned to the input parameters considering both constraints in computational resources avoiding a large number of agents in the simulations and plausible assumptions mosqab 1200 individuals vir 0 1 mosqcomp 0 4 monkcomp 0 4 altcomp 0 4 altlife 1460 days altvirem 12 days altab 30 individuals and d endab 60 individuals each set of parameters was run for 100 repetitions to account for stochasticity in the outputs the mean and standard deviation were used to measure the variation in the outputs the percentage deviation from the average value of the default output was used as a comparison metric a global sensitivity analysis was performed using sobol s method sobol et al 2007 saltelli et al 2010 which allows the sensitivity of model outputs to each parameter to be quantified by decomposing the variance into main and interaction effects the analysis thus yields two measures the first order sensitivity index si which calculates the main effect and a total effects sensitivity index sti which calculates the main and all higher order effects the sample space of the input parameters was obtained using a latin hypercube sample and the values of each parameter were generated with three decimal digits using a uniform distribution the variation in input parameters was limited to 50 around the default value because of the high computational cost of a sobol sensitivity analysis 520 samples were allowed for each input parameter giving a total cost of 5720 model evaluations calculated as samples parameters 2 according to the method confidence intervals for the estimates were obtained using 1000 bootstraps to ensure reproducibility of the analysis the seed 1 was used the analyses were performed using the behavior space tool available in netlogo 6 1 1 wilensky and shargel 2002 and the nlrx package in the r computing environment salecker et al 2019 the sobol analyses were performed using the sobol2007 function available in the sensitivity package pujol et al 2015 given that even small effects can be found to be statistically significant after a sufficiently high number of replications white et al 2014 it was decided not to perform statistical tests to compare the effect of changes in input parameters on variations in the outputs 3 results the local sensitivity analysis indicated that the maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes mean 0 0189 sd 0 0101 max 0 0571 was highly sensitive to variations in six of the nine tested parameters the highest average values of the output were observed when there was a decrease in the abundance of dead end hosts 48 2 more infection and increases in alternative host transmission competence and mosquito abundance 40 8 and 36 more infection respectively while decreases in mosquito transmission competence and abundance were responsible for greater reductions in the average maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes 52 and 51 1 less infection respectively table 2 fig 1 a for the proportion of dead monkeys mean 0 306 sd 0 172 max 0 933 the highest average figures were observed with increases in mosquito abundance and transmission competence 81 4 and 53 2 more mortality respectively and a decrease in the abundance of dead end hosts 43 1 more mortality as with the proportion of infected mosquitoes reductions in mosquito abundance and transmission competence were responsible for lower average proportions of dead monkeys 75 7 and 62 6 less mortality respectively table 2 fig 1b regarding the number of days of yfv persistence mean 233 4 sd 72 9 max 642 7 the highest variation was observed with a decrease in mosquito abundance which reduced virus persistence by 47 6 decreases in mosquito transmission competence and alternative host viremic period led to average reductions of between 20 and 30 in virus circulation time an increase in mosquito abundance and a decrease in the abundance of dead end hosts led to higher increases in the average number of days the virus circulated for 11 6 and 10 8 respectively table 2 fig 1c a total of 5720 simulations were evaluated for variance decomposition analysis using sobol s method the results indicate that for the maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes mean 0 019 sd 0 014 max 0 098 the parameters mosqab altcomp altvirem and d endab have a small yet significant main effect si the highest total sensitivity indexes for this output were observed for the parameters mosqab sti 0 444 ci95 0 350 0 536 and altvirem sti 0 422 ci95 0 336 0 506 fig 2 a supplementary table s2 for the proportion of dead monkeys mean 0 317 sd 0 221 max 0 933 the variance decomposition analysis indicates an important main effect of mosquito abundance si 0 310 ci95 0 202 0 417 and an irrelevant or no main effect was noted for the other parameters higher total sensitivity indexes were observed for mosqab sti 0 644 ci95 0 561 0 730 and mosqcomp sti 0 397 ci95 0 329 0 460 suggesting these parameters play an important role in variations in monkey mortality fig 2b supplementary table s2 the interaction between the input

ci95 0 70822 0 883 indicating this parameter was the most important in defining the time for which the yfv circulates except for vir and monkcomp all the other input parameters had an average sti above 0 4 for this output fig 2c supplementary table s2 4 discussion the ability to manipulate and simulate controlled experiments using a simplified representation of the natural world and observe how high level properties emerge from the interaction between lower level system components is one of the significant advantages of abms macal and north 2009 deangelis and grimm 2014 abms can be especially useful to investigate complex systems for which controlled experimentation to obtain empirical data can be too costly unethical or even unfeasible a common situation in disease ecology and epidemiology peck 2004 duan et al 2015 given the unfeasibility of carrying out a natural experiment to investigate the dynamics of yf epizootics in a systematically controlled fashion the present model proves very useful as it allows virtual experimentation to be used to provide insights into the main underlying factors involved in the transmission dynamics of the yfv in a forest environment our model simulations indicated that increased abundances of haemagogus mosquitoes in the environment could increase the three outputs studied maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes proportion of dead monkeys and number of days the yfv persists for in the environment this effect was particularly strong for an increase in monkey mortality although the abundance of haemagogus mosquitoes was one of the factors with the greatest influence on the output most of this variation was due to the interaction effect between the different parameters tested this further means that the severity of a yf epizootic and persistence of the virus in a sylvatic environment depend on multiple factors and exhibit complex behavior as observed in the local sensitivity analysis fig 1 one of the most notable influences of mosquito abundance was on monkey deaths a 50 increase in maximum mosquito density led to an 81 increase in average monkey mortality in the context of vector borne diseases vector density control is one of the main strategies for reducing the prevalence of infections and the persistence of pathogens in the environment as it directly impacts the number of potentially infectious contacts between vectors and their hosts achee et al 2019 for the yfv studies suggest that periods of climatic anomalies that result in changes in precipitation and temperature increase the probability of large scale yf epizootic and epidemic waves if mosquito abundance increases above normal levels vasconcelos et al 2001 vasconcelos 2010 zhao et al 2018 in turn the effect from vertical infection rate vir in fig 1 i e transmission from mosquitoes to their progeny showed a relatively weak influence on the three outputs evaluated at least in the range of tested values while vertical transmission has been credited with being one of the main factors that allow the maintenance of the yfv in endemic areas mondet et al 2002 and may indeed be necessary for virus survival in nature the frequency of vertical transmission observed for most arboviruses including the yfv is generally low 1 see supplementary text s3 making persistence of the virus for long periods unlikely in the absence of horizontal transmission aitken et al 1979 dutary and leduc 1981 lequime and lambrechts 2014 alencar et al 2021 hence vertical transmission alone cannot sustain a long term yf epizootic wave from the amazon basin to the brazilian atlantic forest studies that test the transmission competence of sylvatic yf vectors and hosts in south america are still scarce galindo 1973 couto lima et al 2017 recent experiments have shown that wild vectors such as h leucocelaenus and sabethes albiprivus as well as the anthropophilic aedes aegypti and a albopictus are highly competent to infect and transmit both american and african yfv strains couto lima et al 2017 in the present study mosquito competence had a greater impact on monkey mortality and increased this output more than the other competence parameters tested overall changes in mosquito and alternative host competence produced greater output variations than those observed for monkey competence for the virus this difference results from the fact that infectious individuals in the howler monkey population have a shorter viremic period and a higher lethality rate than those of alternative hosts mason et al 1973 moreno et al 2015 mares guia et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a and are quickly removed from the system or become immune reducing the spread and persistence of the virus alternative hosts that can develop high enough viremia to infect mosquitoes while being unaffected or only slightly affected by the infection may play an important role in maintaining the yfv in endemic areas and amplifying the virus during epizootics taufflieb et al 1971 monath 1994 however the variance decomposition analysis fig 2 indicated an irrelevant or absent main effect associated with the four traits tested for alternative hosts except for a small main effect of transmission competence and viremic period on the prevalence of infection in the mosquito population as for high order effects the four characteristics showed a reasonable ability to amplify and influence virus persistence when interacting with other parameters in the real world it is unclear whether wild non primate vertebrates play a role as alternative hosts of the yfv in forested areas and there are only rare reports of positive serology or viral isolation in wild non primate mammals taufflieb et al 1971 thoisy et al 2004 it is more likely that this role is played by nhp species more resistant to the yfv as observed in many african nhp species and new world primate species from the genera cebus ateles and callithrix galindo 1973 silva et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a for vector borne disease systems a high abundance of non competent hosts can reduce the circulation of pathogens in the environment by decreasing the frequency of encounters between vectors and competent hosts vectors tend to waste their infectious bites on non competent dead end hosts roche et al 2013 ferguson et al 2018 this mechanism called the dilution effect supports the hypothesis that highly biodiverse environments favor a reduction in pathogen burden and infection prevalence in the community thus generating a protective effect against infections in highly susceptible hosts kessing et al 2010 ostfeld and keesing 2012 haemagogus mosquitoes are considered opportunistic and eclectic in their feeding habits feeding on birds and several mammal species alencar et al 2005 2008b which makes it important to include the wasted infective bites when modeling the transmission dynamics of the yfv the simulations performed here support the dilution effect hypothesis as they indicate that a reduction in the abundance of dead end hosts can lead to a substantial increase in monkey mortality virus persistence and the prevalence of infection in mosquitoes in contrast an increase in the abundance of dead end hosts leads to an opposite effect fig 1 furthermore the variance decomposition analysis fig 2 suggests that the dilution or amplification effects of respectively increasing or decreasing the abundance of dead end hosts are highly conditioned to interactions with other parameters tested here e g mosquito vector abundance a challenging question is whether the yfv can persist for long periods in forest fragments after its emergence although some studies have shown that the virus can continue to circulate in the same fragment for two or three years rezende et al 2018 abreu et al 2019b what is generally observed is that the yfv tends to persist for short periods in forests outside its endemic region during outbreaks a possible reason for this is that transmission occurs in highly fragmented areas and causes high lethality in the dense populations of howler monkeys and other nhps harbored by these fragments thus rapidly reducing the number of susceptible hosts fernandes et al 2021a ilacqua et al 2021 priest et al 2021 there was at least for the parameters range of values and spatial scale simulated in the present study no trend towards virus persistence for more than three years average of 220 and maximum of 971 days in the sobol analysis this result suggests that isolated forest fragments have a limited ability to maintain an enzootic yfv transmission cycle corroborating current empirical knowledge the lesson to be drawn from the model for the control and prevention of sylvatic yellow fever described here is that mosquito surveillance is undeniably a key element when developing an early warning system every time haemagogus abundance goes up in a certain forest patch an early warning system should forecast a potentially riskier scenario for the emergence of yf in terms of mosquito control however reducing the number of larval habitats of this species in the forest remains a challenge if vector mosquito populations can be managed so that their abundance is reduced and the availability of breeding sites can be limited this will have a significant impact on the severity of epizootics and persistence of the virus in the environment although many different methods have been applied to control the urban yfv vector a aegypti achee et al 2019 developing a strategy for managing and reducing the abundance of wild haemagogus vectors with the least possible impact on non target fauna remains a challenge should an epizootic incident spill over to human populations it is worth remembering that the vaccine developed over 80 years ago is still the best way to prevent human yf cases and urban cycles of the yfv becoming established chen and wilson 2020 furthermore recent research has shown that the 17dd vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in howler monkeys which may be a possible strategy for reducing mortality and preserving these primates in parks protected areas and zoos fernandes et al 2021b therefore use of the current model to support an early warning system may ensure timely immunization of the target population the abm presented here is a new tool for simulating the intrafragment dynamics of the yfv and testing the influence of key parameters the proposed model can also be used to investigate other mosquito borne pathogens that circulate in forest areas and infect wild animals and humans such as malaria plasmodia e g plasmodium vivax simium and p knowlesi and several arboviruses e g mayaro zika and west nile viruses pina costa et al 2014 chancey et al 2015 esposito and fonseca 2017 gutiérrez bugallo et al 2019 future studies by our research group will explore the predictions made by and validate the model for some untested scenarios including the presence of alternative vectors and humans as well as transmission in landscapes with multiple fragments 5 conclusion the simulation results suggest that mosquito density is one of the main factors responsible for yfv amplification during epizootics and reinforce the hypothesis that the severity of an outbreak and persistence of the virus in the environment depend on complex interaction between

24476,yellow fever yf is an acute infectious hemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus yfv and transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes in brazil and other south american countries the disease has been restricted to the sylvatic cycle in which the virus circulates among mosquitoes and non human primates in forested areas frequent outbreaks in the amazon basin that spread to other brazilian ecoregions have been observed in recent years the most recent started in 2014 and spread to forests in densely populated areas on the brazilian atlantic coast resulting in the death of hundreds of humans and thousands of monkeys however the underlying ecological mechanisms that support yfv amplification and the severity of an epizootic and persistence of the virus on a microgeographic scale in these forest patches are still poorly understood here we developed an agent based model that simulates the dynamics of yfv transmission in a hypothetical forest fragment the proposed model contains individual agents representing mosquitoes breeding sites howler monkeys alouatta and other vertebrate species living and interacting in an environment where the yfv has emerged the model simulations aimed to investigate the isolated and interaction effects of important input parameters linked to mosquitoes monkeys the environment and hypothetical alternative hosts on the following outcomes 1 maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes 2 proportion of dead monkeys and 3 yfv persistence in the environment local and global sensitivity analyses were used to assess the influence of different sets of input parameter values on the outputs the model simulations indicated that mosquito abundance had the greatest influence on the outputs and made a major contribution to monkey mortality additionally most of the variation in the outputs was due to complex and indirect effects of the different input parameters these results suggest that mosquito density is one of the main factors responsible for yfv amplification during epizootics and reinforce the hypothesis that the severity and persistence of an outbreak depend on a complex web of interactions between different factors associated with vectors hosts and the environment keywords yellow fever agent based model mosquitoes alouatta haemagogus 1 introduction yellow fever yf represents a significant public health issue in tropical and subtropical areas of africa and south america even though a safe effective vaccine has been available since the 1930s who 2018 while epidemics in rural and urban areas frequently occur on the african continent in brazil and other south american countries the yellow fever virus yfv has been restricted to the sylvatic cycle monath and vasconcelos 2015 the last large urban yf epidemic in brazil occurred in 1928 and was associated with the urban vector aedes aegypti franco 1969 the yellow fever virus circulates enzootically and endemically in the amazon basin where epizootic events in non human primate nhp populations have frequently occurred over the last hundred years preceding the appearance of human cases in rural or peri urban areas close to locations in northern and central brazil where epizootics occur dispersion of the virus from endemic regions in the brazilian amazon to non endemic regions in the rest of the country has been reported since the 1940s vasconcelos 2010 these dispersion events occur at least once every decade causing epizootic and epidemic waves in eastern and southern regions of the country franco 1969 monath and vasconcelos 2015 the most recent reemergence of yf in south america expanded yfv transmission to areas with no vaccine recommendation on the atlantic coast of southeastern brazil reaching forests in the vicinity of densely populated areas such as the cities of são paulo and rio de janeiro and significantly increasing the risk of re urbanization of the disease possas et al 2018 a total of 4217 nhp deaths 852 human deaths and 2839 human cases were reported in brazil between 2014 and 2019 of which 98 occurred in southeastern states paho 2019 brazilian ministry of health 2020 the majority of new world nhp species are highly susceptible to yfv infection but some are more severely affected resulting in high lethality rates for these species especially howler monkeys alouatta mares guia et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a susceptible nhp species are yfv amplifier hosts that can infect sylvatic mosquitoes however they are not considered yfv reservoirs because of the short viremic periods from 2 to 6 days and high lethality or permanent immunity after recovery in these animals hervé et al 1986 on the other hand there are mosquito species that are both yfv vectors and reservoirs because they can transmit the virus not only to nhps horizontal transmission but also to their progeny vertical transmission as they lay eggs that can remain viable for months in unfavorable environmental conditions dutary and leduc 1981 hervé et al 1986 mondet et al 2002 the sylvatic mosquitoes haemagogus janthinomys and h leucocelaenus are the primary vectors and reservoirs of the yfv in brazil abreu et al 2019a invasion by and amplification and establishment of vector borne diseases in a new environment are determined by multiple factors that vary over time and space kilpatrick and randolph 2012 johnson et al 2015 ogden et al 2019 these factors which include favorable climatic conditions high vector and host densities changes in land use and low vaccine coverage have been contributing to the appearance of novel yfv strains and ultimately to large scale epizootic and epidemic events in brazil vasconcelos 2010 possas et al 2018 almeida et al 2019 thoisy et al 2020 nevertheless the underlying mechanisms that support yfv amplification as well as the severity of the epizootic and persistence of the virus on a microgeographic scale remain poorly understood the many variables and species involved in the transmission cycle make it costly time consuming and in certain cases unfeasible to obtain the empirical data necessary for a better understanding of the sylvatic dynamics of yf therefore the development of models to simulate the transmission dynamics of the virus between host and vector populations can be an alternative for testing and proposing new hypotheses about the ecology and epidemiology of the disease allowing researchers to identify issues that should be investigated as a matter of priority in empirical studies and to predict risk situations given the worrisome number of human cases and deaths and the high nhp mortality during the recent reemergence of yf in brazil paho 2019 fernandes et al 2021a we developed an agent based model abm that simulates the dynamic of yfv transmission in a hypothetical forest fragment the proposed model contains individual agents representing mosquitoes breeding sites howler monkeys and other vertebrate species living and interacting in an environment where the yfv has emerged the model simulations aimed to investigate the isolated and interaction effects of important input parameters linked to mosquitoes abundance transmission competence transovarial transmission monkeys transmission competence the environment abundance of dead end hosts and hypothetical alternative hosts lifespan viremic period abundance and transmission competence on the following outcomes 1 maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes 2 proportion of dead monkeys and 3 yfv persistence in the environment 2 methods this section is divided into the following three subsections to describe the development and analysis of the model 2 1 model description using the odd overview design concepts and details protocol grimm et al 2010 2020 2 2 model parameterization and calibration and 2 3 data analysis and simulation experiments the design concepts section of the odd protocol is presented in supplementary text s1 a pattern oriented modeling pom framework was used to guide model design parameterization and analysis pom refers to the use of multiple patterns observed in the real system empirical data to decide on model structure and parameter values and select the most appropriate submodels for key processes grimm et al 2005 the model was implemented in netlogo 6 1 1 wilensky 1999 figure s1 and the software is available at github com aralphms syfam 2 1 model description overview and details 2 1 1 purpose and patterns the model simulates the transmission dynamics of the yfv after its introduction into a forest fragment inhabited by populations of the vector mosquito howler monkeys and other vertebrate animals the purpose of the model is to answer the following questions which conditions parameters have a greater influence on a the prevalence of the virus in the mosquito population b howler monkey mortality and c the persistence of the virus in the environment the following criteria which reflect patterns observed empirically are used for the usefulness of the model 1 once inserted in the environment and under suitable conditions the virus must spread between vectors and hosts reducing the population of howler monkeys 2 the model must reproduce similar patterns to those found in mosquito populations e g similar parity longevity infection rate and seasonal changes in abundance and larval development time 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model consists of four entities mosquitoes monkeys other hosts and patches the mosquitoes represent female individuals of the genus haemagogus the main vectors of the yfv in brazil abreu et al 2019a the monkeys represent howler monkeys genus alouatta whose lethality is very high during yf epizootic outbreaks mares guia et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a other hosts represent species of terrestrial vertebrates inhabiting the forest fragment the other hosts agents can assume two different roles when in contact with the virus 1 they can be dead end hosts which means they are not able to replicate the virus at sufficient levels in the bloodstream to transmit it again to mosquitoes or 2 they can be alternative hosts that can replicate the virus and transmit it to vector mosquitoes finally the model distinguishes between two types of patches forest and breeding sites circulation of the virus is represented by different state variables for the vertebrate hosts and mosquitoes susceptible exposed the individual has been infected but is not yet able to transmit the virus to a susceptible agent infectious the individual can transmit the virus to a susceptible agent and immune the agents that represent mosquitoes have two state variables corresponding to the gonotrophic cycle and yfv infection state the gonotrophic cycle can assume four states newly emerged blood seeking engorged or gravid as for yfv infection the mosquitoes can assume three states susceptible exposed or infectious each mosquito also has quantitative state variables to indicate the number of oviposition events it has performed amount of blood ingested and blood digestion time in addition parameters that define biting success daily survival rate and host and breeding site detection radius are set for the population five groups of six individuals representing monkeys are allocated in the grid and each group moves through a limited territory each individual has a number that relates it to the group it belongs to a list containing the patches that represent the group s territory an area with a radius of 18 patches around a central patch and its status in the group i e alpha or subordinate the alpha individuals define the direction in which the group will move and whether or not any movement will be performed at each time step the yfv state for each individual in the group can be susceptible exposed infectious or immune the other hosts have a state variable that defines the individual as a dead end host or alternative host alternative hosts can be susceptible exposed infectious or immune an average lifespan for the populations can be set and mortality due to yfv infection is considered null except for dead end hosts all agents have parameters that define the virus latent period and transmission competence in addition while monkeys and alternative hosts have parameters that define the viremic period when they are in an infectious state once mosquito individuals become infectious they remain in this state patches of the type forest have no state variables other than their location on the grid while breeding site patches represent places in the forest where mosquitoes in the gravid state can lay their eggs breeding site patches have lists that indicate whether any eggs were laid in the patch how many eggs were laid the time elapsed since each oviposition event and whether an infectious mosquito performed a given oviposition there is also a mechanism that controls larval density so that when the patch receives a large number of eggs larval mortality also increases see submodels section each time step of the model represents one hour of the day for modeling purposes the day lasts 10 h 10 time steps representing the diurnal activity of howler monkeys and haemagogus mosquitoes since both have daytime behavior and usually rest at night the grid consists of 101 101 patches with a bounded space simulating an isolated forest fragment extending over approximately 102 hectares each patch represents an area of 100m² and the linear distance between the center of two adjacent patches represents 10 m 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the model has two main processes 1 mosquito population dynamics consisting of the gonotrophic cycle larval development and control of mosquito abundance and larval density 2 virus transmission dynamics consisting of the vector host interaction the incubation period in the vector and hosts and the recovery or death of hosts table 1 shows the order of events performed at each time step 2 1 4 submodels the model actions or submodels listed in table 1 are performed in sequential time steps their empirical and theoretical backgrounds are described below 2 1 4 1 update the current k parameter the abundance of mosquitoes including those of the genus haemagogus is influenced by seasonal variations in rainfall temperature and relative humidity marcondes and alencar 2010 ribeiro et al 2012 couto lima et al 2020 for example chadee et al 1992 observed that the abundance of h janthinomys in trinidad was up to six times greater in rainy periods than in dry periods to simulate the effect of seasonal variations on mosquito populations the proposed model uses a parameter that controls the carrying capacity in the environment here called current k current k has two functions 1 to simulate the effect of seasonal variations in the abundance of mosquitoes during a year i e 3650 time steps 2 to control the emergence of new adult mosquitoes in the grid as the breeding site patches access the current k information current k is updated at each time step with the following equation c u r r e n t k α β sin 2 π t 180 π γ cos 2 π t 180 π where α k max k min 2 k max initial number of mosquitoes k min k max 6 β k max k min 3650 2 γ α k max t 0 5 time 3650 the sine and cosine terms assign a cyclic pattern to the equation the constant 2π 180 π is the circumference of a circle where 180 π does the conversion from degrees netlogo standard to radians 2 1 4 2 update the time elapsed since oviposition and count the number of immatures in the patch each breeding site patch contains a list called larval development time that records the number of immatures at the site and updates the development time for each individual for each egg laid in the patch a new item with value 0 is added to the beginning of the list each new time step adds a unit to all items in the list 2 1 4 3 check and control oviposition density in the patch each breeding site patch in the model represents an area of 100 m² with larval habitats for mosquitoes haemagogus mosquitoes usually lay their eggs in tree holes and bamboo internodes at each time step the breeding site patch checks the total number of larval individuals it has and selects and eliminates one or more individuals at random with a probability p which increases with the larval density this mechanism aims to simulate density dependent intraspecific competition walker et al 1991 the parameter p follows a logistic distribution figure s2 and is obtained by assigning the values sv1 0 99 sv2 0 5 lv1 15 and lv2 90 where sv is the survival probability and lv is the number of larvae in the patch the parameter p is calculated as follows d l n s v 1 1 s v 1 c l n s v 2 1 s v 2 b d c l v 1 l v 2 a d b l v 1 z e x p a b l v p z 1 z when there are no more than fifteen immatures lv1 in the same patch each individual s survival probability is above 99 sv1 a value for the density of immatures at which the likelihood of survival becomes 50 sv2 was then parameterized the average time taken from oviposition to emergence of an adult was used to fit this parameter so that this time should be short in favorable seasonal periods and relatively long in unfavorable seasonal periods for this purpose values of 60 90 and 120 immatures were tested and adjusted to a 50 probability of survival it was then decided to select 90 immatures lv2 since this value allowed for a plausible pattern in the average times for emergence of an adult corresponding to 20 days in favorable periods at maximum current k and 60 days in unfavorable periods at minimum current k for haemagogus and other aedini mosquitoes adults are not expected to emerge for months in colder less rainy periods as the eggs are resistant to desiccation and can diapause for periods of up to one year marcondes and alencar 2010 2 1 4 4 update and check the newly emerged mosquitoes the time elapsed since the emergence of the new adult individual is updated after ten time steps the state of the individual is changed from newly emerged to blood seeking as soon as a new adult emerges the individual is kept immobile in the same patch it emerged in until its state changes this action simulates the time it takes for exoskeletons to harden and newly emerged females to copulate forattini 2002 2 1 4 5 move monkeys firstly the model checks whether there is an alpha individual in the group if not another individual is chosen randomly from the group members to become the alpha member of the group next the individuals check if they are within their group s territory limits and return to the territory if they are outside it the alpha individuals in each group then move after which the subordinate individuals move the alpha individual chooses a random direction between 0 and 360 and moves from 0 to 10 patches at random in a single time step howler monkeys often travel less than 1 km day fortes et al 2015 subordinate individuals select a direction that does not vary by more than 10 from the direction chosen by the alpha individual and move the same distance with a variation of up to one patch this mechanism allows the group to be kept less dispersed while it moves in its territory even during their active period howler monkeys do not move very much and spend most of their time sleeping or eating crockett and eisenberg 1987 chiarello 1993 the model therefore allows groups of monkeys to move at each time step with a probability of only 20 each group s territory extends over an area with a radius of 18 patches around a central patch so that the territories have an approximately circular shape and are arranged on the grid in such a way that they do not overlap as the distance between the center of two adjacent patches is 10 m the total area for each group of monkeys is equivalent to π 1802 101 788 m2 a value close to the average living area for howler monkeys which is around 10 2 hectares bicca marques et al 2018 2 1 4 6 move other hosts each individual randomly selects a direction within a 360 radius and moves from 0 to 5 patches for simplicity the movement is random and there is no interaction with other individuals of the same species 2 1 4 7 digest the blood meal the time since the mosquitoes in the engorged state obtained blood from the hosts is checked if more than 50 time steps have elapsed since the individual fed its state is updated to gravid and the individual starts to move in search of breeding site patches to lay its eggs if 50 time steps or fewer have elapsed and the individual has obtained enough blood for the eggs to develop it will move slowly and randomly in the environment no more than 0 5 patches per time step however if the individual has not obtained enough blood it will continue to search for hosts the time taken between digestion of blood and oviposition was selected to be similar to that of the haemagogus gonotrophic cycle around 5 7 days mondet 1997 dégallier et al 1998 2 1 4 8 search for a host for a blood meal mosquitoes in the blood seeking state will search for hosts in their surroundings according to the parameter that controls the host detection radius if a host is detected the mosquito will move towards it the movement of the mosquito towards the host is randomly assigned varying from 0 to the distance to the host if the blood seeking mosquito detects no host it moves random distances of up to one patch per time step in a random direction between 0 and 360 2 1 4 9 search for a breeding site to lay eggs mosquitoes in the gravid state will search for a breeding site patch in their surroundings according to the parameter that controls the breeding site detection radius if a breeding site patch is detected the individual moves towards the patch if no breeding site patches are detected the individual keeps moving at random distances of up to 1 patch per time step in a random direction between 0 and 360 when the individual is in a breeding site patch oviposition is performed immediately the individual then changes its state from gravid to blood seeking and the number of ovipositions the individual has completed is updated in turn the patch in which the oviposition occurred updates both its lists the first includes information about each immature individual s development time and the second specifies whether the individual came from an infectious female or not oviposition is interpreted here as deposition of the entire egg load of a gravid female in a gonotrophic cycle which is around 15 to 40 eggs for haemagogus chadee and tikasingh 1989 mondet 1997 therefore assuming that a gravid female lays a mean of 30 eggs in her gonotrophic cycle half of which will become adult females for the purposes of the model each mosquito lays an average of 15 eggs at the breeding site and the number of eggs varies according to a poisson distribution based on the study by chadee and tikasingh 1989 on the oviposition behavior of h janthinomys it was assumed that there is no nocturnal oviposition activity for gravid mosquitoes 2 1 4 10 vector host interaction mosquitoes with a blood seeking state detect whether there is a vertebrate host less than five meters 0 5 patches away see breugel et al 2015 if a host is detected an interaction can occur for situations where two or more hosts are detected the mosquito will select one of them at random interaction between a mosquito and host will only occur if a random value generated between 0 and 1 is less than 0 5 which is the value assumed for the biting success parameter after the interaction the mosquito s state changes to engorged and if it has obtained enough blood it will stop looking for a blood meal when the individual does not obtain enough blood from the host it keeps trying to have new blood meals until it can obtain the minimum amount of blood necessary for eggs to develop see farjana and tuno 2013 once the interaction has occurred a random number between 0 and 1 is generated if this number is less than 0 5 the mosquito has not obtained enough blood for the eggs to develop and will try to obtain a new blood meal from the same or another host the value of a blood meal is added to the value of the previous ones and when the total reaches 0 5 the mosquito will be satiated and its state will no longer be blood seeking after an interaction between a mosquito and a host the digestion time for the ingested blood starts to count even if the mosquito has not yet obtained enough blood in which case the individual will be simultaneously in the engorged and blood seeking states at each interaction virus transmission between vector and hosts can occur depending on the yfv state of each individual and the parameters that control the transmission competence thus if a mosquito in the susceptible state feeds on the blood of an infectious monkey or alternative host the mosquito has a probability of becoming infected with the virus and moving to the exposed state in turn mosquitoes in the infectious state can transmit the virus by interacting with susceptible hosts thereby changing the host s state to exposed during an infective contact a random number between 0 and 1 is generated according to a uniform distribution if the value is lower than the infectious individual s transmission competence parameter the virus is transmitted 2 1 4 11 check extrinsic incubation period the time since mosquitoes in the exposed state became infected is checked and updated as individuals complete the extrinsic incubation period their state changes to infectious based on studies with the vector aedes aegypti johansson et al 2010 the extrinsic incubation period for the yfv was assumed to be twelve days 2 1 4 12 check incubation period the time since exposed monkeys and alternative hosts became infected is checked and updated if the individual has reached the latent period of the virus the state exposed is updated to infectious a latency of 3 days is assumed for both monkeys and alternative hosts moreno et al 2015 2 1 4 13 recovery or death once the monkeys enter the viremic period infectious state the time elapsed is checked and updated if the entire viremic period has elapsed the state is updated according to the probability of death for infected monkeys md a random number between 0 and 1 is generated with a uniform distribution if the number generated is greater than md the individual s state changes from infectious to immune and if it is less than md the individual is eliminated from the simulation the viremic period considered for monkeys was four days moreno et al 2015 and the probability of death for infected monkeys was set to 0 8 see mason et al 1973 2 1 4 14 check and eliminate mosquito a number between 0 and 1 is generated with a uniform random distribution for each mosquito if the number is less than the hourly mosquito mortality rate the individual is eliminated from the simulation the hourly mortality rate µh can be obtained based on the daily survival rate s of haemagogus using the equation µh ln s 10 2 1 4 15 emergence of adult mosquitoes each breeding site patch accesses information about the abundance of mosquitoes in the environment and the value of the parameter current k if the abundance is lower than current k and an immature mosquito in the patch has reached the minimum development time a new adult mosquito emerges the minimum development time from egg to emergence of an adult was assumed to be 12 days alencar et al 2008a if the newly emerged mosquito comes from an infected female s oviposition the individual has a probability of starting its adult phase in the infectious state that depends on the vertical infection rate vir parameter see supplementary text s3 a number between 0 and 1 is randomly generated with a uniform distribution if the number is less than vir the new mosquitoes will be in the infectious state and if it is greater than vir they will be in the susceptible state after a new adult emerges the patch eliminates the information it contains about this individual 2 1 4 16 check other hosts lifespan the time each individual has lived is updated if its lifetime has been reached the individual is eliminated from the simulation after the individual dies another is generated to keep the population size constant the generated individual starts the simulation in the susceptible state if it is an alternative host or in the immune state if it is a dead end host the time the new individual will live is assigned according to the lifespan parameter which is the mean of a poisson distribution 2 1 4 17 insert infected mosquitoes at a certain point in the simulation individuals from the mosquito population will be randomly selected and their state will be changed from susceptible to infectious to start the virus transmission cycle to allow the mosquito population dynamics to stabilize during the simulation and considering that yfv outbreaks tend to occur in periods of high abundance of mosquitoes the mechanism that simulates viral transmission is inserted into the model 365 days after the start 3650 time steps coinciding with a period of maximum mosquito abundance maximum current k to this end the state of 2 of the mosquito population is changed to infectious this procedure can be compared to an imaginary experiment in which the transmission dynamics are observed by introducing a certain number of infected mosquitoes into a controlled natural environment 18 update the outputs check stop conditions and update the time step after the outputs are updated the stop conditions are checked three criteria are needed to stop the simulation 1 the time step must be greater than 3650 when the virus starts to circulate 2 there must be no mosquitoes monkeys or other hosts with infectious or exposed state and 3 there must be no oviposition events by infectious mosquitoes in the breeding site patches once these three conditions are met the simulation is completed since the virus is no longer circulating in the environment if the stop conditions are not met the time step is updated and the simulation returns to the first action in table 1 2 1 5 initialization to initialize the model five groups of monkeys each with six individuals and a defined initial number of dead end hosts alternative hosts and mosquitoes are inserted in the grid since the maximum supported abundance of mosquitoes in a given environment also depends on the availability of breeding sites the model was balanced so that the number of breeding site patches depends on the initial number of mosquitoes it was therefore decided to have one breeding site patch inserted for every twelve mosquitoes the mosquitoes and other hosts are randomly allocated in the grid while the monkey groups start in the center of their territories the breeding site patches start the simulation with between zero and 89 immatures the development time for each immature is also selected at random between 1 and 150 time steps all mosquitoes and hosts start the simulation in the susceptible for yfv state mosquitoes initialize with the following state variable values 1 number of ovipositions performed 0 2 amount of blood ingested 0 3 blood digestion time 1 this value is changed to 0 immediately after a mosquito has a blood meal and 4 biting success for each interaction with a host 0 5 the mosquito parameters daily survival rate 0 93 and host and breeding site detection radius 4 were parameterized using sensitivity tests supplementary text s2 the same proportion of mosquitoes 25 is initially set for each of the four states of the gonotrophic cycle based on this configuration the mosquito population dynamics tend to take around 150 time steps to stabilize for the agents representing the monkeys initialization involves creating an individual in the center of their territory this individual is assigned to the alpha state and immediately generates five other individuals who are assigned to the subordinate state all individuals also have state variables that define their group and the patches that comprise their territory for other hosts remaining lifetimes ranging from 0 to the parameter that defines the average lifespan of the population are assigned to each individual for example if the average lifespan of other hosts is set to 1000 days each initial individual will be assigned a random value between 0 and 1000 that will define its remaining lifetime the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes or spatial configurations 2 2 model parameterization and calibration the model parameters 35 parameters supplementary table s1 were assigned based on empirical data obtained from observational and experimental studies calibration and plausible assumptions nine key parameters were selected and evaluated by local and global sensitivity analyses to assess their influence on the model outputs see section 2 3 visual and quantitative comparison of the outputs of the model and data from empirical observations were used to validate the mosquito population dynamics by calibrating the parameters to reproduce accurately the time from egg to emergence of an adult see section 2 1 and supplementary figure s3 mean and maximum mosquito longevity and parity patterns supplementary text s2 supplementary figure s4 2 3 data analysis and simulation experiments in order to achieve the study goals three outputs were analyzed in the simulations 1 maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes 2 proportion of dead monkeys and 3 number of days the yfv persists in the environment to prevent the maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes being influenced by the initial proportion of infected mosquitoes 2 the program counts this output only after the second generation of infected mosquitoes and ignores the generation that starts the circulation of the virus nine input parameters were subjected to sensitivity analyses to assess their influence on the outputs the selected

parameters by 50 above or below their default value following the one factor at time approach thiele et al 2014 the following default values were assigned to the input parameters considering both

were used to measure the variation in the outputs the percentage deviation from the average value of the default output was used as a comparison metric a global sensitivity analysis was performed using sobol s method sobol et al 2007 saltelli et al 2010 which allows the sensitivity of model outputs to each parameter to be quantified by decomposing the variance into main and interaction effects the analysis thus yields two measures the first order sensitivity index si which calculates the main effect and a total effects sensitivity index sti which calculates the main and all higher order effects the sample space of the input parameters was obtained using a latin hypercube sample and the values of each parameter were generated with three decimal digits using a uniform distribution the variation in input parameters was limited to 50 around the default value because of the high computational cost of a sobol sensitivity analysis 520 samples were allowed for each input parameter giving a total cost of 5720 model evaluations calculated as samples parameters 2 according to the method confidence intervals for the estimates were obtained using 1000 bootstraps to ensure reproducibility of the analysis the seed 1 was used the analyses were performed using the behavior space tool available in netlogo 6 1 1 wilensky and shargel 2002 and the nlrx package in the r computing environment salecker et al 2019 the sobol analyses were performed using the sobol2007 function available in the sensitivity package pujol et al 2015 given that even small effects can be found to be statistically significant after a sufficiently high number of replications white et al 2014 it was decided not to perform statistical tests to compare the effect of changes in input parameters on variations in the outputs 3 results the local sensitivity analysis indicated that the maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes mean 0 0189 sd 0 0101 max 0 0571 was highly sensitive to variations in six of the nine tested parameters the highest average values of the output were observed when there was a decrease in the abundance of dead end hosts 48 2 more infection and increases in alternative host transmission competence and mosquito abundance 40 8 and 36 more infection respectively while decreases in mosquito transmission competence and abundance were responsible for greater reductions in the average

above 0 4 for this output fig 2c supplementary table s2 4 discussion the ability to manipulate and simulate controlled experiments using a simplified representation of the natural world and observe how high level properties emerge from the interaction between lower level system components is one of the significant advantages of abms macal and north 2009 deangelis and grimm 2014 abms can be especially useful to investigate complex systems for which controlled experimentation to obtain empirical data can be too costly unethical or even unfeasible a common situation in disease ecology and epidemiology peck 2004 duan et al 2015 given the unfeasibility of carrying out a natural experiment to investigate the dynamics of yf epizootics in a systematically controlled fashion the present model proves very useful as it allows virtual experimentation to be used to provide insights into the main underlying factors involved in the transmission dynamics of the yfv in a forest environment our model simulations indicated that increased abundances of haemagogus mosquitoes in the environment could increase the three outputs studied maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes proportion of dead monkeys and number of days the yfv persists for in the environment this effect was particularly strong for an increase in monkey mortality although the abundance of haemagogus mosquitoes was one of the factors with the greatest influence on the output most of this variation was due to the interaction effect between the different parameters tested this further means that the severity of a yf epizootic and persistence of the virus in a sylvatic environment depend on multiple factors and exhibit complex behavior as observed in the local sensitivity analysis fig 1 one of the most notable influences of mosquito abundance was on monkey deaths a 50 increase in maximum mosquito density led to an 81 increase in average monkey mortality in the context of vector borne diseases vector density control is one of the main strategies for reducing the prevalence of infections and the persistence of pathogens in the environment as it directly impacts the number of potentially infectious contacts between vectors and their hosts achee et al 2019 for the yfv studies suggest that periods of climatic anomalies that result in changes in precipitation and temperature increase the probability of large scale yf epizootic and epidemic waves if mosquito abundance increases above normal levels vasconcelos et al 2001 vasconcelos 2010 zhao et al 2018 in turn the effect from vertical infection rate vir in fig 1 i e transmission from mosquitoes to their progeny showed a relatively weak influence on the three outputs evaluated at least in the range of tested values while vertical transmission has been credited with being one of the main factors that allow the maintenance of the yfv in endemic areas mondet et al 2002 and may indeed be necessary for virus survival in nature the frequency of vertical transmission observed for most arboviruses including the yfv is generally low 1 see supplementary text s3 making persistence of the virus for long periods unlikely in the absence of horizontal transmission aitken et al 1979 dutary and leduc 1981 lequime and lambrechts 2014 alencar et al 2021 hence vertical transmission alone cannot sustain a long term yf epizootic wave from the amazon basin to the brazilian atlantic forest studies that test the transmission competence of sylvatic yf vectors and hosts in south america are still scarce galindo 1973 couto lima et al 2017 recent experiments have shown that wild vectors such as h leucocelaenus and sabethes albiprivus as well as the anthropophilic aedes aegypti and a albopictus are highly competent to infect and transmit both american and african yfv strains couto lima et al 2017 in the present study mosquito competence had a greater impact on monkey mortality and increased this output more than the other competence parameters tested overall changes in mosquito and alternative host competence produced greater output variations than those observed for monkey competence for the virus this difference results from the fact that infectious individuals in the howler monkey population have a shorter viremic period and a higher lethality rate than those of alternative hosts mason et al 1973 moreno et al 2015 mares guia et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a and are quickly removed from the system or become immune reducing the spread and persistence of the virus alternative hosts that can develop high enough viremia to infect mosquitoes while being unaffected or only slightly affected by the infection may play an important role in maintaining the yfv in endemic areas and amplifying the virus during epizootics taufflieb et al 1971 monath 1994 however the variance decomposition analysis fig 2 indicated an irrelevant or absent main effect associated with the four traits tested for alternative hosts except for a small main effect of transmission competence and viremic period on the prevalence of infection in the mosquito population as for high order effects the four characteristics showed a reasonable ability to amplify and influence virus persistence when interacting with other parameters in the real world it is unclear whether wild non primate vertebrates play a role as alternative hosts of the yfv in forested areas and there are only rare reports of positive serology or viral isolation in wild non primate mammals taufflieb et al 1971 thoisy et al 2004 it is more likely that this role is played by nhp species more resistant to the yfv as observed in many african nhp species and new world primate species from the genera cebus ateles and callithrix galindo 1973 silva et al 2020 fernandes et al 2021a for vector borne disease systems a high abundance of non competent hosts can reduce the circulation of pathogens in the environment by decreasing the frequency of encounters between vectors and competent hosts vectors tend to waste their infectious bites on non competent dead end hosts roche et al 2013 ferguson et al 2018 this mechanism called the dilution effect supports the hypothesis that highly biodiverse environments favor a reduction in pathogen burden and infection prevalence in the community thus generating a protective effect against infections in highly susceptible hosts kessing et al 2010 ostfeld and keesing 2012 haemagogus mosquitoes are considered opportunistic and eclectic in their feeding habits feeding on birds and several mammal species alencar et al 2005 2008b which makes it important to include the wasted infective bites when modeling the transmission dynamics of the yfv the simulations performed here support the dilution effect hypothesis as they indicate that a reduction in the abundance of dead end hosts can lead to a substantial increase in monkey mortality virus persistence and the prevalence of infection in mosquitoes in contrast an increase in the abundance of dead end hosts leads to an opposite effect fig 1 furthermore the variance decomposition analysis fig 2 suggests that the dilution or amplification effects of respectively increasing or decreasing the abundance of dead end hosts are highly conditioned to interactions with other parameters tested here e g mosquito vector abundance a challenging question is whether the yfv can persist for long periods in forest fragments after its emergence although some studies have shown that the virus can continue to circulate in the same fragment for two or three years rezende et al 2018 abreu et al 2019b what is generally observed is that the yfv tends to persist for short periods in forests outside its endemic region during outbreaks a possible reason for this is that transmission occurs in highly fragmented areas and causes high lethality in the dense populations of howler monkeys and other nhps harbored by these fragments thus rapidly reducing the number of susceptible hosts fernandes et al 2021a ilacqua et al 2021 priest et al 2021 there was at least for the parameters range of values and spatial scale simulated in the present study no trend towards virus persistence for more than three years average of 220 and maximum of 971 days in the sobol analysis this result suggests that isolated forest fragments have a limited ability to maintain an enzootic yfv transmission cycle corroborating current empirical knowledge the lesson to be drawn from the model for the control and prevention of sylvatic yellow fever described here is that mosquito surveillance is undeniably a key element when developing an early warning system every time haemagogus abundance goes up in a certain forest patch an early warning system should forecast a potentially riskier scenario for the emergence of yf in terms of mosquito control however reducing the number of larval habitats of this species in the forest remains a challenge if vector mosquito populations can be managed so that their abundance is reduced and the availability of breeding sites can be limited this will have a significant impact on the severity of epizootics and persistence of the virus in the environment although many different methods have been applied to control the urban yfv vector a aegypti achee et al 2019 developing a strategy for managing and reducing the abundance of wild haemagogus vectors with the least possible impact on non target fauna remains a challenge should an epizootic incident spill over to human populations it is worth remembering that the vaccine developed over 80 years ago is still the best way to prevent human yf cases and urban cycles of the yfv becoming established chen and wilson 2020 furthermore recent research has shown that the 17dd vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in howler monkeys which may be a possible strategy for reducing mortality and preserving these primates in parks protected areas and zoos fernandes et al 2021b therefore use of the current model to support an early warning system may ensure timely immunization of the target population the abm presented here is a new tool for simulating the intrafragment dynamics of the yfv and testing the influence of key parameters the proposed model can also be used to investigate other mosquito borne pathogens that circulate in forest areas and infect wild animals and humans such as malaria plasmodia e g plasmodium vivax simium and p knowlesi and several arboviruses e g mayaro zika and west nile viruses pina costa et al 2014 chancey et al 2015 esposito and fonseca 2017 gutiérrez bugallo et al 2019 future studies by our research group will explore the predictions made by and validate the model for some untested scenarios including the presence of alternative vectors and humans as well as transmission in landscapes with multiple fragments 5 conclusion the simulation results suggest that mosquito density is one of the main factors responsible for yfv amplification during epizootics and reinforce the hypothesis that the severity of an outbreak and persistence of the virus in the environment depend on complex interaction between

24477,the northern stock of european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax is a large high value slow growing and late maturing fish that is an important target species for both commercial and recreational fisheries around the uk scientific assessments have shown a rapid eight year decline in spawning stock biomass since 2010 attributed to poor recruitment this was likely driven by environmental factors and high fishing mortality management of the stock is informed by scientific assessments in which a population model is fitted to the available data and used to forecast the possible consequences of various catch options however the model currently used cannot represent the spatial distribution of the stock or any effects of environmental variability one approach that may be used to represent the effects of spatial and temporal variation in environmental drivers is with individual based models ibms in ibms populations are represented by their constituent individuals that interact with their environment and each other the mechanistic nature of ibms is often advantageous as a management tool for complex systems including fisheries here we add to an existing ibm to produce a spatio temporally explicit ibm of the northern stock of sea bass in which individual fish respond to local food supply and sea surface temperature all life stages i e pelagic stages juvenile and mature fish are modelled and individual fish have their own realistic energy budgets driven by observed dynamic maps of phytoplankton density and sea surface temperature the model is calibrated using approximate bayesian computation abc after calibration by abc the model gives good fits to key population parameters including spawning stock biomass the model provides a mechanistic link between observed local food supplies and sea surface temperatures and overall population dynamics plots of spatial biomass distribution show how the model uses the energy budget to predict spatial and temporal change in sea bass biomass distribution in response to environmental variability our results indicate that the ibm is a promising approach that could be used to support stock assessment with scope for testing a range of spatially and temporally explicit management scenarios in addition to testing stock responses to novel environmental change keywords individual based modelling agent based modelling european sea bass dicentrachus labrax fisheries management approximate bayesian computation 1 introduction the european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax has been an important target species for commercial and recreational fishers around the uk for more than 50 years however after decades of exploitation and minimal regulation the stock began to rapidly decline in 2010 pickett and pawson 1994 ices 2021 the decline continued for eight years and was attributed to a combination of poor recruitment and fishing mortality which led to the implementation of emergency management measures in 2015 with continuing stringent harvest restrictions to present day ices 2019 2021 sea bass are a slow growing long lived generalist predator with a complex life cycle that includes feeding and spawning migrations pickett and pawson 1994 a further complex component of the sea bass life cycle is the recruitment process i e the surviving from egg through larval stages to a harvestable fish which is particularly precarious and influenced by many drivers the result of which can be observed as recruitment rates with high levels of interannual variation pickett and pawson 1994 ices 2021 these life history components make the building of assessment models for this stock particularly challenging the northern sea bass stock is assessed by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices using stock synthesis 3 ss3 an analytical age and length based assessment model optimized for tactical management ices 2019 ss3 includes 1 a population dynamics model which represents growth mortality and recruitment 2 an observation model which relates the population dynamics to available data and 3 a statistical model which estimates parameters to maximise the goodness of fit between population model and data while ss3 is well suited for use in tactical management there are important strategic questions which it cannot and is not designed to answer first ss3 can include only a crude representation of the spatial distribution of the stock using its multi area configuration methot and wetzel 2013 for this reason it is limited in its ability to represent the effects of spatial management scenarios e g sea bass fishery spatial closures in key spawning areas gov uk 2020 second ss3 does not represent the effects of environmental variability on the stock for this reason it cannot make predictions about how the stock will develop against uncertain climate backdrops or how climate uncertainty might interact with harvesting scenarios e g boyd thorpe et al 2020 walker et al 2020 developed an individual based model for european sea bass this model and others like it are widely used to simulate the spatial distribution of fish populations watkins and rose 2017 heinänen et al 2018 boyd walker et al 2020 as well as population size and structure politikos huret and petitgas 2015 boyd walker et al 2020 bueno pardo et al 2020 in walker et al 2020 the stock s spatial distribution results from algorithms that govern the movements of the individuals but the population dynamics component is that of ss3 the logical next step is to allow individual vital rates to respond to observed local variation in key environmental drivers to do so one must first identify important environmental drivers and then incorporate sub models that describe the ways in which individuals respond to these drivers prey availability and temperature are two key environmental drivers that affect rates of growth and reproduction in sea bass and ultimately population dynamics pickett and pawson 1994 the effects of prey availability and temperature on fish are typically modelled using energy budgets sometimes called bioenergetics our energy budget approach follows an established methodology sibly et al 2013 that has been used for a range of species and applications sibly et al 2013 grimm et al 2014 van der vaart et al 2015 boult et al 2019 boyd walker et al 2020 mintram et al 2020 watson et al 2020 the energy budget models describe the acquisition of energy from food in the environment and its allocation to maintenance metabolism growth reproduction and energy storage rates of acquisition and expenditure depend on temperature and body size and these can be modelled using established theoretical relationships recently bioenergetics models have been implemented in ibms which enables extrapolation of the individual level effects of prey availability and temperature e g on body size and reproductive output to the population level boyd walker et al 2020 here we use phytoplankton density and sea surface temperature sst assessed through remote sensing phytoplankton density is used as an index of food supply and together with sst drives the energy budgets of individual fish the energy budgets link population dynamics to environmental drivers and ultimately outputs the population metrics that are used in fisheries management in this study we extend the model of walker et al 2020 incorporating a bioenergetics module to account for spatio temporal variation in prey availability and temperature information on prey availability and temperature are derived from two satellite products chlorophyll concentration which we use as a proxy for prey availability this is discussed further in the discussion and sea surface temperature sst we estimate five parameters of the bioenergetics model by fitting the ibm to individual and population level outputs from the latest stock assessment we show that the calibrated model matches the stock assessment outputs well and we show some spatial outputs to demonstrate how the model links environmental drivers to spatial and temporal distribution of sea bass biomass finally we discuss the potential utility of our model for strategic management of the european sea bass stock 2 methods 2 1 overview here we provide a summary description of the ibm a full description following the odd overview design concepts details

model environment is composed of a grid landscape of 36 38 patches grid cells representing the area from 9 e to 9 w and 48 n to 57 5 n fig 1 the model uses dynamic patch variables of sea surface temperature sst shown in blue fig 1a a key driver of sea bass dynamics pickett pawson 1994 trace section 8 2 and 10 2 sst in the model affects all life processes including ingestion rate maintenance i

variable of phytoplankton density phy shown in orange fig 1b derived from chlorophyll concentration using an empirical conversion factor see discussion and trace sections 8 2 and 10 3 for discussion of the role of phy as a base of the marine food web and the basis for energy in our energy budget update the patches of the model environment are categorised depending on location within the

mutually exclusive while patch types are not as all nursery patches are coastal and all spawning patches are offshore fig 1 for simplicity we assume the population is closed to migration outside the model domain to keep model run times practical the sea bass population is modelled with super individuals hereafter termed individuals each of which represents many fish with identical state variables

in 2015 ices 2021 in each time step individuals follow six main processes all constructed from several sub models ingestion and assimilation maintenance i e metabolic rate and reserves growth reproduction i e spawning movement and mortality fig 2 provides a conceptual overview of the processes and sub models relevant to the different life stages represented in the ibm in the following sections we give an overview of these sub models highlighting the new energy budget updates and directing the reader towards relevant supplementary materials trace sections for further details 2 1 1 initialization and spin up the model is initialised on 1st of january 1985 and runs with daily time steps for a 19 year spin up period thereafter emergent results are collected from 1st of january 2004 until 31st of december 2014 during the spin up numbers at age data from the ices stock assessment 2020 are used to base the initialized population and then each year new agents are introduced from estimates of numbers at age 0 also from the stock assessment numbers at age 0 emerge from the simulation once the spin up period is over the remote sensing data for sst and phy for 2004 is used on repeat for each year in the spin up as it was unavailable before this date for full details of spin up see trace section 5 2 1 2 process overview and scheduling an overview of the sub models is presented here but for complete detail we refer the reader to the relevant trace sections the major addition to the model of walker et al 2020 are the energy budget processes and the sub models ingestion and assimilation maintenance i e metabolic rate and reserves growth and reproduction i e spawning the eqs 1 5 that make up the energy budget approach follow an established methodology sibly et al 2013 that has subsequently been used for a range of species and applications sibly et al 2013 grimm et al 2014 van der vaart et al 2015 boult et al 2019 boyd walker et al 2020 mintram et al 2020 watson et al 2020 the model proceeds through all sub models in daily time steps the following sub models are executed in the order they are presented within each sub model super individuals and patches are processed in a random order as there are no interactions amongst agents an overview can be seen in fig 2 agents age one day each time step and the cohort age is increased by one year every 365 time steps update patches new sst and phy data is assigned to patches and offshore patches update their spawning patch status though note that sst and phy data only changes every 8 days natural mortality the number of fish in each super individual is discounted by its natural mortality rate any super individuals reaching the terminal age of 30 are removed from the simulation ingestion and assimilation all life stages calculate ingestion and assimilation except for eggs and egg sac larvae as these early life stages rely on their own energy source rather than feeding pickett and pawson 1994 for the older life stages larvae juvenile and mature sea bass the rates of ingestion and assimilation are dictated by size of the individual energy available in the environment temperature and density dependence i e intraspecific competition for food the assimilated energy e is then the energy available for the remainder of the energy budget processes i e growth maintenance and reproduction and is calculated as 1 e c m a x p h y h p h y m t 2 3 i 1 m n m 2 3 e p a e a h where cmax is the maximum consumption of food in relation to body size phy is the energy value of the patch h is the half saturation constant mt is total mass note the 2 3 power refers to body surface area following boyd et al 2018 kooijman metz 1984 i is importance of conspecific density mnm is the sum of non egg biomass in the same patch ep is the energy in phytoplankton and ae is the product of assimilation efficiency i e the proportion of energy that is absorbed from prey and trophic delay i e how long how much energy from a phytoplankton bloom makes its way through the trophic levels to sea bass prey and ah is an arrhenius function for details see trace sections 7 8 2 10 3 and see table 1 for parameter values maintenance and reserves all life stages calculate metabolic rate and its energetic cost except for eggs and egg sac larvae metabolic rate is affected by body mass and temperature and here we calculate field metabolic rate as twice the standard metabolic rate peters 1986 and is calculated as mr below 2 m r a o m t 3 4 2 a h where ao is a metabolic rate normalisation mt is total mass and ah is an arrhenius function once the energetic cost of maintenance metabolic rate is established it is either paid for directly from assimilated energy or if this is insufficient e g reduced feeding available in the winter then energy reserves are added to assimilated energy and metabolic costs are taken from this for details see trace sections 7 and see table 1 for parameter values growth all life stages except eggs calculate their total mass mass of an individual including if any fat reserves and gonad mass 3 m t a l b e r e l g m where a and b are length mass coefficient values for details see trace section 8 3 er is how much energy is in reserves el is the energy content of lipid and gm is mass of gonads next the maximum possible growth increment maxgr is calculated and here we assume individuals under 70 days have a constant maximum growth rate for details see trace section 8 3 and those older are assumed to follow a von bertalanffy growth curve 4 m a x g r g l a h a g e 70

annual growth constant and ah is an arrhenius function after calculating the theoretical maximum size increase the energetic cost of this maximum increase is calculated eggs do not grow instead they develop and transform into yolk sac larvae which do not ingest energy and thus are assumed to have maximum energy available to grow maximally however once egg sac larvae have transformed to larvae they begin to ingest energy and here larvae juvenile and mature sea bass only grow maximally if there is adequate assimilated energy and update length accordingly if there is not enough assimilated energy they will grow at a suboptimal growth rate for details see trace section 8 and see table 1 for parameter values calculate speed the swimming speed of each fish is calculated from its length and sst of the patch for details see trace section 7 transform in our model we include the full fish life cycle and use length based definitions to distinguish between life stages in the transform sub model if a super individual meets the criteria sufficient length see fig 2 then it transforms to the next life stage the life stages are egg yolk sac larvae larvae juvenile sea bass and mature sea bass when juveniles transition to mature sea bass they set their coastal feeding ground affinity as the ices division in which they are in at the time of exceeding this length requirement this could be a different division to the original ices division target they would have drifted towards when they were in pelagic stages see trace section 8 7 note that at the end of the first spawning migration there is an opportunity to change ices division affinity which is altered with a probability that can be set by the model user fishing mortality for fish that are over the minimum landing sizes the number of fish represented by each super individual is discounted by fishing mortality rates from the commercial offshore commercial inshore and recreational fleets data obtained from ices stock assessment 2020 movement juvenile and mature movement sub models remain mostly unchanged from walker et al 2020 however a major addition to the model is the full fish life cycle and the inclusion of life stages of eggs yolk sac larvae and larvae in our update we provide movement sub models for these pelagic life stages spawn migration during the months october may if sst is below the 9 c spawning trigger threshold then mature fish move towards offshore spawning grounds feeding migration when spawning period is over at the end of may each mature fish moves back towards or within its assigned coastal feeding ground local movement each juvenile fish moves randomly within coastal patches juveniles less than 32 cm not yet classed as adolescent are further constrained to nursery coastal

fecundity and then the energy required to produce this number of eggs maxr 5 m a x r m s t r e g p w e g m e f f s where mstr is structural mass of sea bass i e not including any fat reserves or gonad mass egpw is number of eggs per kg of sea bass pickett and pawson 1994 egm is the weight of eggs ef is the energy in flesh and fs is the cost of synthesising flesh if there is enough energy to produce maximum potential fecundity then the energy needed to do this is deducted from energy reserves and gonad mass and realised fecundity are set accordingly however if there is not enough energy to reach maximum fecundity then energy reserve is set to whatever is left after subtracting maintenance costs and gonad mass and realised fecundity is set to what is achievable with the limited resources once calculated for all mature sea bass a random sample of 10 mature sea bass super individuals spawn introduce one super individual into the model which represents as many eggs as determined by total realised fecundity of the whole spawning stock divided by 10 the number of eggs is therefore based on the cumulative available energy reserves with only 10 individuals spawning the number of super individuals remains consistent for each cohort and 10 new super individuals continue to represent the spatial aspect of the fishery for details see trace sections 7 8 7 and see table 1 for parameter values 2 1 3 model calibration the model contains 25 parameters and the values were where possible taken from literature see trace section 5 and trace table 2 where absolute values of these parameters could not be directly taken from the literature we used a version of approximate bayesian computation abc called simulated annealing abc albert künsch and scheidegger 2015 as implemented in the python library abcpy dutta et al 2017 in all we estimated 5 parameters using abc h half saturation constant am adult natural mortality ae absorbed energy pm pelagic mortality and i importance of density dependence this method is highly parallelizable making it an excellent algorithm for use by high performance computers abc began by randomly drawing values of h am ae pm and i from uniform prior distributions for full details of priors see trace section 9 4 and ran the ibm with these parameter values subsequent runs were guided according to how well the outputs of previous runs fitted data as indicated by the sum of the weighted euclidean distance between the model outputs and data the data used for parameter calibration was from the sea bass stock assessment model stock synthesis 3 ss3 these outputs include annual time series of spawning stock biomass ssb numbers at age and weight at age ss3 outputs for ssb and numbers at age are estimated annually however mass at age is simply taken as the stock assessment parameters of the von bertalanffy model it is necessary to include mass at age in the calibration to get a realistic population size structure and in the absence of real data this is the best available guide the estimated posterior means for all five parameters and 95 credible intervals are shown in table 2 together with the prior distributions used the estimated correlation matrix between parameters is shown in table 3 and the values shown suggest medium to weak correlations between these five model parameters with a maximum of 0 47 between parameters pm and am to quantify the uncertainty in predictions that results from uncertainty in the five calibrated parameters we ran a posterior predictive check by drawing 111 parameter samples from the inferred approximate posterior distribution and simulating 111 data sets each using a different parameter sample from these we obtained posterior predictive inter quartile ranges and these are shown in figs 3 5 to indicate the uncertainty in predictions 2 1 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of model outputs for ssb and numbers mass at age are shown in table 4 as percentage change in output for a 10 decrease increase in the energy budget model parameters of table 1 the model remains robust against most parameters with most sensitivities less than 10 the model was most sensitive to changes in length weight parameter b g for the full table of sensitivities of number and mass at age see trace section 12 3 results to assess the model fits to data we compare the ibm outputs for ssb and numbers mass at age with outputs from stock synthesis 3 from 2004 to 2014 ices 2019 as shown in figs 3 5 in these figures the black points represent the data i e outputs from stock synthesis 3 and the solid red lines dots are ibm outputs using posterior medians uncertainty about these outputs is indicated by ribbons representing posterior predictive inter quartile ranges ssb is the total mass of all fish that are mature 42 cm the fit of ssb is shown in fig 3 the ibm captures the shape of the data well and follows the decline in ssb from 2010 suggested by the ss3 data mass at age predictions are assessed by reference to the von bertalanffy growth curve assumed by ss3 fig 4 which assumes no variation year to year the model slightly overpredicts mass for ages 0 to 4 and underpredicts mass after age 7 the fit of numbers at age predictions are shown in fig 5 model fits to the ss3 data are good for ages 5 and above and reasonably good for all ages in addition to the calibration plots figs 3 4 and 5 we show some spatial model outputs in fig 6 these show the spatial intra annual spatial distribution of sea bass biomass note there is also interannual variation which can be seen in the trace figure 19 4 discussion here we have presented a spatially explicit individual based model of the northern stock of sea bass which has been calibrated and assessed for goodness of fit against stock synthesis 3 outputs of ssb and the numbers and individual masses of 30 age classes the model builds on walker et al 2020 but our addition of individual energy budgets driven by phytoplankton density provides a mechanistic link between environmental drivers and fish populations we also present spatial outputs of biomass distribution to demonstrate how the energy budget creates a mechanistic link between changes in environmental drivers and predictions of temporal and spatial distribution of sea bass the energy budget approach follows established methods boyd walker et al 2020 mintram et al 2020 watson et al 2020 our model is intended for use by fisheries managers to complement not replace current stock assessment approaches using ss3 a key assumption in our model is that local food density available to sea bass can be represented by observed phytoplankton density sea bass are generalist predators and their diet is opportunistic so it is difficult to predict what they will be eating at any particular time pickett and pawson 1994 their food choices could in principle be derived from a model of local ecosystems but this would require many unobservable parameters i e what when and where sea bass are eating and the associated uncertainly we therefore chose instead to make use of remote sensing data of phytoplankton blooms which constitute the base of the marine food web there are several problems in attempting to estimate how much of the energy present in phytoplankton is feasibly available to sea bass we reason that areas of high phytoplankton density are likely favourable to all trophic levels that is they will correlate with high densities of species that directly consume phytoplankton and consequently will be attractive to species that prey upon these secondary consumers and a continuation of this pattern up the food chain further many species in the marine environment including much of sea bass prey are highly mobile and may move around seeking energy in the form of their preferred prey on the other hand there is likely a delay which we term trophic delay in time from a large amount of energy being present in the form of phytoplankton till it is available to sea bass as a range of prey because prey species increase in biomass through individual growth or reproduction in this model we bypass these complexities by using a single parameter absorbed energy to indicate how much of the phytoplankton ends up in the fish our approach can be considered justified by the good fits to the data seen in figs 3 4 and 5 methods of calibrating and evaluating complex models have advanced considerably in recent years here we used simulated annealing abc sabc albert künsch and scheidegger 2015 to calibrate five model parameters adult and pelagic mortality rates absorbed energy and two density dependences that would otherwise be extremely difficult to estimate sabc is much faster and more accurate than rejection abc methods dutta et al 2017 which have previously been used to calibrate similar ibms e g boult et al 2018 boyd walker et al 2020 van der vaart et al 2015 the model outputs we have presented give insight into how different aspects of the model are working spawning stock biomass ssb fig 3 is the size of the mature stock which is the basis for setting legislative targets to manage the stock we see good fits for ssb across the simulation period we also see good fits to body weights at age fig 4 which suggests that both the numbers and sizes of the individuals are reasonable the numbers and masses in each age class are discussed below the numbers in each age class are shown in fig 5 assessing numbers at age rather than total abundance is necessary to avoid the more numerous younger fish dominating the model fits overall the dynamic model age structure shown in fig 5 is a good fit against the ss3 data although some of the goodness of fit may stem from what happens in the spin up period cohorts born in the spin up period are read in from ices numbers at age data and their numbers thereafter are only affected by two model parameters natural mortality am and fishing mortality the n0 panel shown in fig 5 represents the number of fish that are age 0 and no longer in the pelagic stage defined in our model as an individual with age 1 and length 1 4 cm beraud et al 2018 predicted n0 fits ss3 data well in some years but in others there are significant discrepancies discrepancies almost certainly arise from lack of realism in our model predicting recruitment is famously difficult but may also arise from errors in the ss3 data the ss3 estimates of the n0 are outputs of a population dynamics model described in the introduction and subject to some uncertainty so the discrepancies between our predictions and the ss3 data do not necessarily mean our predictions are wrong n0 i e the number of n0 individuals in our model is an emergent property driven by the number of mature fish and their spawning success which depends on the condition of the parents mcbride et al 2015 and early survival larger fish with higher fat reserves can produce more eggs i e have higher potential fecundity than smaller fish so the more mature fish there are in the simulation the greater their collective realised fecundity if the mature fish have had access to abundant energy there is more left to produce eggs after the necessary allocation to maintenance and growth it is important to note that the model does not cover quality of eggs though there is some evidence that fish that have had access to better nutrition may also be able to produce higher quality eggs which may increase larval survival and stock recruitment cerdá et al 1994 chatzifotis et al 2011 in the model presented the amount of energy to produce eggs is also influenced by temperature since individuals in warmer sea temperatures may ingest more energy grow faster and have higher levels of reserves from which to produce eggs the other major contributor to the n0 output is pelagic natural mortality rate the daily pelagic mortality rate 8 01 10 2 is far greater than that of the adult mortality parameter in our model 4 71 10 4 so there is a substantial payoff to growing faster to escape the pelagic phase earlier in this way the number of larvae that make it through to be juvenile fish i e classified as n0 is dependant on their growth rate which in turn depends on food availability temperature and the density of competitors the masses of the individuals in each age class are presented in fig 4 although the models provide fairly good fits for younger fish the masses of older fish are underpredicted discrepancies between our predictions and the ss3 data do not necessarily mean our predictions are wrong because the ss3 data are simply outputs of a fitted von bertalanffy growth curve ices 2021 discrepancies may also arise as a result of the spin up process during spin up we read in the numbers at age 0 estimates from ss3 as is done in the spawning sub models of walker et al 2020 but afterwards spawning is determined by the fishes energy budgets and the two methods differ in when spawning takes place the result is that the ibm age 0 cohort consists of older and larger fish than in the ss3 data as the cohort ages it continues heavier for a few years and this may explain the overpredictions of mass for m0 m4 in the first few years of the simulations see figure 17 in trace section 11 the underpredictions of masses of older fish are harder to explain but may result from some lack of realism in our representation of energy budgets in our model an individual s mass depends on its history of ingesting energy and this in turn depends on the energy available in the environment competition from other fish and sea surface temperature and this is what the ae and i parameters hoped to capture in excess of structural mass individuals have the potential to put on weight as fat reserves high reserves result from abundant energy high sst and or low competition and eventually allow mature individuals to spawn these processes result in fluctuations in fat reserves that the ss3 assessment does not capture there are many potential fisheries management applications for the ibm we present here the original model published by walker et al 2020 was designed to complement the ss3 stock assessment and to test spatial management scenarios and the updated model here still retains that utility though note movement sub model limitations discussed below we demonstrate some of the spatial and temporal inter trace figure 19 and intra annual variation utility in figure 6 where results show predictions of variation in the distribution of sea bass our energy budget additions and the subsequent emergent population dynamics that are driven by the environmental drivers make the model a good tool to study a range of climate impacts on the stock using different climate projections the energy budget could capture the effect of temperature on life processes of ingestion metabolic rate growth and sea bass recruitment known to be heavily influenced by temperature pawson pickett and smith 2005 and the subsequent impacts of the stock could be analysed another advantage of the full fish life cycle and closed energy budget additions is that changes in condition or number of the spawning stock will have consequences on the following year s recruitment this closed loop facilitates testing of a range of existing and new management measures for recreational and commercial fishing e g spatial and temporal closures changes to total allowable catch minimum landing size bag limits etc the model is built in a modular fashion making additions or changes to further the model utility achievable one promising line of work is to add other dynamic maps of anthropogenic stressors to the model environment for example the addition of a soundscape map to which the individuals would suffer sublethal effects through reduced ingestion and the knock on effects through the energy budget watson et al 2020 would give rise to emergent population effects of anthropogenic noise a similar approach was done for porpoise in a study by nabe nielsen et al 2014 in addition there is scope to update fishing pressure which is currently read in from ices data to a more mechanistic sub model sea bass are mostly targeted by the under 10 m fleet in the uk williams et al 2018 and the small vessels are often most vulnerable to bad weather sainsbury et al 2018 young et al 2019 an updated fishing pressure sub model that responded mechanistically to environmental and socio economic pressures would further develop the model utility to fisheries management e g jules dreyfus león 1999 millischer and gascuel 2006 bastardie et al 2010 bailey et al 2019 lindkvist et al 2020 we believe that the ibm we present here is a useful tool in its current form however there are some caveats and further opportunities for improvement firstly a general critique of individual agent based models is the large amount of data that they require for model parameterisation calibration and validation johnston et al 2019 to calibrate and asses the fits of the model we use outputs from the sea bass ss3 assessment model the ss3 model takes all the available data from surveys and literature to assess the state of the stock ices 2021 and outputs modelled data so we are fitting the ibm model outputs to another model s outputs this is suboptimal but in the absence of the extensive long term field data on individuals outputs from ss3 remain the best calibration option and the limited availability of calibration data may also explain why the credible intervals remain wide for the five parameters fitted with abc table 2 further detailed spatial distribution data would also be required to truly validate the spatial and temporal explicit predictions by the model shown in fig 6 another limitation is the movement sub model which remains unchanged from walker et al 2020 walker et al 2020 outline how modern tagging methods quayle et al 2009 o neill et al 2018 de pontual et al 2019 could provide data on which a mechanistic movement sub model could be built and added to further the spatial utility of the model to conclude we hope that fisheries managers may find the spatial mechanistic and emergent merits of

24477,the northern stock of european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax is a large high value slow growing and late maturing fish that is an important target species for both commercial and recreational fisheries around the uk scientific assessments have shown a rapid eight year decline in spawning stock biomass since 2010 attributed to poor recruitment this was likely driven by environmental factors and high fishing mortality management of the stock is informed by scientific assessments in which a population model is fitted to the available data and used to forecast the possible consequences of various catch options however the model currently used cannot represent the spatial distribution of the stock or any effects of environmental variability one approach that may be used to represent the effects of spatial and temporal variation in environmental drivers is with individual based models ibms in ibms populations are represented by their constituent individuals that interact with their environment and each other the mechanistic nature of ibms is often advantageous as a management tool for complex systems including fisheries here we add to an existing ibm to produce a spatio temporally explicit ibm of the northern stock of sea bass in which individual fish respond to local food supply and sea surface temperature all life stages i e pelagic stages juvenile and mature fish are modelled and individual fish have their own realistic energy budgets driven by observed dynamic maps of phytoplankton density and sea surface temperature the model is calibrated using approximate bayesian computation abc after calibration by abc the model gives good fits to key population parameters including spawning stock biomass the model provides a mechanistic link between observed local food supplies and sea surface temperatures and overall population dynamics plots of spatial biomass distribution show how the model uses the energy budget to predict spatial and temporal change in sea bass biomass distribution in response to environmental variability our results indicate that the ibm is a promising approach that could be used to support stock assessment with scope for testing a range of spatially and temporally explicit management scenarios in addition to testing stock responses to novel environmental change keywords individual based modelling agent based modelling european sea bass dicentrachus labrax fisheries management approximate bayesian computation 1 introduction the european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax has been an important target species for commercial and recreational fishers around the uk for more than 50 years however after decades of exploitation and minimal regulation the stock began to rapidly decline in 2010 pickett and pawson 1994 ices 2021 the decline continued for eight years and was attributed to a combination of poor recruitment and fishing mortality which led to the implementation of emergency management measures in 2015 with continuing stringent harvest restrictions to present day ices 2019 2021 sea bass are a slow growing long lived generalist predator with a complex life cycle that includes feeding and spawning migrations pickett and pawson 1994 a further complex component of the sea bass life cycle is the recruitment process i e the surviving from egg through larval stages to a harvestable fish which is particularly precarious and influenced by many drivers the result of which can be observed as recruitment rates with high levels of interannual variation pickett and pawson 1994 ices 2021 these life history components make the building of assessment models for this stock particularly challenging the northern sea bass stock is assessed by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices using stock synthesis 3 ss3 an analytical age and length based assessment model optimized for tactical management ices 2019 ss3 includes 1 a population dynamics model which represents growth mortality and recruitment 2 an observation model which relates the population dynamics to available data and 3 a statistical model which estimates parameters to maximise the goodness of fit between population model and data while ss3 is well suited for use in tactical management there are important strategic questions which it cannot and is not designed to answer first ss3 can include only a crude representation of the spatial distribution of the stock using its multi area configuration methot and wetzel 2013 for this reason it is limited in its ability to represent the effects of spatial management scenarios e g sea bass fishery spatial closures in key spawning areas gov uk 2020 second ss3 does not represent the effects of environmental variability on the stock for this reason it cannot make predictions about how the stock will develop against uncertain climate backdrops or how climate uncertainty might interact with harvesting scenarios e g boyd thorpe et al 2020 walker et al 2020 developed an individual based model for european sea bass this model and others like it are widely used to simulate the spatial distribution of fish populations watkins and rose 2017 heinänen et al 2018 boyd walker et al 2020 as well as population size and structure politikos huret and petitgas 2015 boyd walker et al 2020 bueno pardo et al 2020 in walker et al 2020 the stock s spatial distribution results from algorithms that govern the movements of the individuals but the population dynamics component is that of ss3 the logical next step is to allow individual vital rates to respond to observed local variation in key environmental drivers to do so one must first identify important environmental drivers and then incorporate sub models that describe the ways in which individuals respond to these drivers prey availability and temperature are two key environmental drivers that affect rates of growth and reproduction in sea bass and ultimately population dynamics pickett and pawson 1994 the effects of prey availability and temperature on fish are typically modelled using energy budgets sometimes called bioenergetics our energy budget approach follows an established methodology sibly et al 2013 that has been used for a range of species and applications sibly et al 2013 grimm et al 2014 van der vaart et al 2015 boult et al 2019 boyd walker et al 2020 mintram et al 2020 watson et al 2020 the energy budget models describe the acquisition of energy from food in the environment and its allocation to maintenance metabolism growth reproduction and energy storage rates of acquisition and expenditure depend on temperature and body size and these can be modelled using established theoretical relationships recently bioenergetics models have been implemented in ibms which enables extrapolation of the individual level effects of prey availability and temperature e g on body size and reproductive output to the population level boyd walker et al 2020 here we use phytoplankton density and sea surface temperature sst assessed through remote sensing phytoplankton density is used as an index of food supply and together with sst drives the energy budgets of individual fish the energy budgets link population dynamics to environmental drivers and ultimately outputs the population metrics that are used in fisheries management in this study we extend the model of walker et al 2020 incorporating a bioenergetics module to account for spatio temporal variation in prey availability and temperature information on prey availability and temperature are derived from two satellite products chlorophyll concentration which we use as a proxy for prey availability this is discussed further in the discussion and sea surface temperature sst we estimate five parameters of the bioenergetics model by fitting the ibm to individual and population level outputs from the latest stock assessment we show that the calibrated model matches the stock assessment outputs well and we show some spatial outputs to demonstrate how the model links environmental drivers to spatial and temporal distribution of sea bass biomass finally we discuss the potential utility of our model for strategic management of the european sea bass stock 2 methods 2 1 overview here we provide a summary description of the ibm a full description following the odd overview design concepts details

model environment is composed of a grid landscape of 36 38 patches grid cells representing the area from 9 e to 9 w and 48 n to 57 5 n fig 1 the model uses dynamic patch variables of sea surface temperature sst shown in blue fig 1a a key driver of sea bass dynamics pickett pawson 1994 trace section 8 2 and 10 2 sst in the model affects all life processes including ingestion rate maintenance i

variable of phytoplankton density phy shown in orange fig 1b derived from chlorophyll concentration using an empirical conversion factor see discussion and trace sections 8 2 and 10 3 for discussion of the role of phy as a base of the marine food web and the basis for energy in our energy budget update the patches of the model environment are categorised depending on location within the

mutually exclusive while patch types are not as all nursery patches are coastal and all spawning patches are offshore fig 1 for simplicity we assume the population is closed to migration outside the model domain to keep model run times practical the sea bass population is modelled with super individuals hereafter termed individuals each of which represents many fish with identical state variables

sections we give an overview of these sub models highlighting the new energy budget updates and directing the reader towards relevant supplementary materials trace sections for further details 2 1 1 initialization and spin up the model is initialised on 1st of january 1985 and runs with daily time steps for a 19 year spin up period thereafter emergent results are collected from 1st of january 2004 until 31st of december 2014 during the spin up numbers at age data from the ices stock assessment 2020 are used to base the initialized population and then each year new agents are introduced from estimates of numbers at age 0 also from the stock assessment numbers at age 0 emerge from the simulation once the spin up period is over the remote sensing data for sst and phy for 2004 is used on repeat for each year in the spin up as it was unavailable before this date for full details of spin up see trace section 5 2 1 2 process overview and scheduling an overview of the sub models is

watson et al 2020 the model proceeds through all sub models in daily time steps the following sub models are executed in the order they are presented within each sub model super individuals and patches are processed in a random order as there are no interactions amongst agents an overview can be seen in fig 2 agents age one day each time step and the cohort age is increased by one year every 365 time steps update patches new sst and phy data is assigned to patches and offshore patches update their spawning patch status though note that sst and phy data only changes every 8 days natural mortality the number of fish in each super individual is discounted by its natural mortality rate any super individuals reaching the terminal age of 30 are removed from the simulation ingestion and assimilation all life stages calculate ingestion and assimilation except for eggs and egg sac larvae as these early life stages rely on their own energy source rather than feeding pickett and pawson 1994 for the older life stages larvae juvenile and mature sea bass the rates of ingestion and assimilation are dictated by size of the individual energy available in the environment temperature and density dependence i e intraspecific competition for food the assimilated energy e is then the energy available for the remainder of the energy budget processes i e growth maintenance and reproduction and is calculated as 1 e c m a x p h y h p h y m t 2 3 i 1 m n m 2 3 e p a e a h where cmax is the maximum consumption of food in relation to body size phy is the energy value of the patch h is the

values maintenance and reserves all life stages calculate metabolic rate and its energetic cost except for eggs and egg sac larvae metabolic rate is affected by body mass and temperature and here we calculate field metabolic rate as twice the standard metabolic rate peters 1986 and is calculated as mr below 2 m r a o m t 3 4 2 a h where ao is a metabolic rate normalisation mt is total mass and ah is an arrhenius function once the energetic cost of maintenance metabolic rate is established it is either paid for directly from assimilated energy or if this is insufficient e g reduced feeding

develop and transform into yolk sac larvae which do not ingest energy and thus are assumed to have maximum energy available to grow maximally however once egg sac larvae have transformed to larvae they begin to ingest energy and here larvae juvenile and mature sea bass only grow maximally if there is adequate assimilated energy and update length accordingly if there is not enough assimilated energy they will grow at a suboptimal growth rate for details see trace section 8 and see table 1 for parameter values calculate speed the swimming speed of each fish is calculated from its length and sst of the patch for details see trace section 7 transform in our model we include the full fish life cycle and use length based definitions to distinguish between life stages in the transform sub model if a super individual meets the criteria sufficient length see fig 2 then it transforms to the next life stage the life stages are egg yolk sac larvae larvae juvenile sea bass and mature sea bass when juveniles transition to mature sea bass they set their coastal feeding ground affinity as the ices division in which they are in at the time of exceeding this length requirement this could be a different division to the original ices division target they would have drifted towards when they were in pelagic stages see trace section 8 7 note that at the end of the first spawning migration there is an opportunity to change ices division affinity which is altered with a probability that can be set by the model user fishing mortality for fish that are over the minimum landing sizes the number of fish represented by each super individual is discounted by fishing mortality rates from the commercial offshore commercial inshore and recreational fleets data obtained from ices stock assessment 2020 movement juvenile and mature movement sub models remain mostly unchanged from walker et al 2020 however a major addition to the model is the full fish life cycle and the inclusion of life stages of eggs yolk sac larvae and larvae in our update we provide movement sub models for these pelagic life stages spawn migration during the months october may if sst is below the 9 c spawning trigger threshold then mature fish move towards offshore spawning grounds feeding migration when spawning period is over at the end of may each mature fish moves back towards or within its assigned coastal feeding ground local movement each juvenile fish moves randomly within coastal patches juveniles less than 32 cm not yet classed as adolescent are further constrained to nursery coastal patches larval stages drift each egg yolk sac larvae and larva move one patch closer to its assigned coastal feeding ground reproduction on the 17th of march mature sea bass calculate their potential fecundity and then the energy required to produce this number of eggs maxr 5 m a x r m s t r e g p w e g m e f f s where mstr is structural mass of sea bass i e not including any fat reserves or gonad mass egpw is number of eggs per kg of sea bass pickett and pawson 1994 egm is the weight of eggs ef is the energy in flesh and fs is the cost of synthesising flesh if there is enough energy to produce maximum potential fecundity then the energy needed to do this is deducted from energy reserves and gonad mass and realised fecundity are set accordingly however if there is not enough energy to reach maximum fecundity then energy reserve is set to whatever is left after subtracting maintenance costs and gonad mass and realised fecundity is set to what is achievable with the limited resources once calculated for all mature sea bass a random sample of 10 mature sea bass super individuals spawn introduce one super individual into the model which represents as many eggs as determined by total realised fecundity of the whole spawning stock divided by 10 the number of eggs is therefore based on the cumulative available energy reserves with only 10 individuals spawning the number of super individuals remains consistent for each cohort and 10 new super individuals continue to represent the spatial aspect of the fishery for details see trace sections 7 8 7 and see table 1 for parameter values 2 1 3 model calibration the model contains 25 parameters and the values were where possible taken from literature see trace section 5 and trace table 2 where absolute values of these parameters could not be directly taken from the literature we used a version of approximate bayesian computation abc called simulated annealing abc albert künsch and scheidegger 2015 as implemented in the python library abcpy dutta et al 2017 in all we estimated 5 parameters using abc h half saturation constant am adult natural mortality ae absorbed energy pm pelagic mortality and i importance of density dependence this method is highly parallelizable making it an excellent algorithm for use by high performance computers abc began by randomly drawing values of h am ae pm and i from uniform prior distributions for full details of priors see trace section 9 4 and ran the ibm with these parameter values subsequent runs were guided according to how well the outputs of previous runs fitted data as indicated by the sum of the weighted euclidean distance between the model outputs and data the data used for parameter calibration was from the sea bass stock assessment model stock synthesis 3 ss3 these outputs include annual time series of spawning stock biomass ssb numbers at age and weight at age ss3 outputs for ssb and numbers at age are estimated annually however mass at age is simply taken as the stock assessment parameters of the von bertalanffy model it is necessary to include mass at age in the calibration to get a realistic population size structure and in the absence of real data this is the best available guide the estimated posterior means for all five parameters and 95 credible intervals are shown in table 2 together with the prior distributions used the estimated correlation matrix between parameters is shown in table 3 and the values shown suggest medium to weak correlations between these five model parameters with a maximum of 0 47 between parameters pm and am to quantify the uncertainty in predictions that results from uncertainty in the five calibrated parameters we ran a posterior predictive check by drawing 111 parameter samples from the inferred approximate posterior distribution and simulating 111 data sets each using a different parameter sample from these we obtained posterior predictive inter quartile ranges and these are shown in figs 3 5 to indicate the uncertainty in predictions 2 1 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of model outputs for ssb and numbers mass at age are shown in table 4 as percentage change in output for a 10 decrease increase in the energy budget model parameters of table 1 the model remains robust against most parameters with most sensitivities less than 10 the model was most sensitive to changes in length weight parameter b g for the full table of sensitivities of number and mass at age see trace section 12 3 results to assess the model fits to data we compare the ibm outputs for ssb and numbers mass at age with outputs from stock synthesis 3 from 2004 to 2014 ices 2019 as shown in figs 3 5 in these figures the black points represent the data i e outputs from stock synthesis 3 and the solid red lines dots are ibm outputs using posterior medians uncertainty about these outputs is indicated by ribbons representing posterior predictive inter quartile ranges ssb is the total mass of all fish that are mature 42 cm the fit of ssb is shown in fig 3 the ibm captures the shape of the data well and follows the decline in ssb from 2010 suggested by the ss3 data mass at age predictions are assessed by reference to the von bertalanffy growth curve assumed by ss3 fig 4 which assumes no variation year to year the model slightly overpredicts mass for ages 0 to 4 and underpredicts mass after age 7 the fit of numbers at age predictions are shown in fig 5 model fits to the ss3 data are good for ages 5 and above and reasonably good for all ages in addition to the calibration plots figs 3 4 and 5 we show some spatial model outputs in fig 6 these show the spatial intra annual spatial distribution of sea bass biomass note there is also interannual variation which can be seen in the trace figure 19 4 discussion here we have presented a spatially explicit individual based model of the northern stock of sea bass which has been calibrated and assessed for goodness of fit against stock synthesis 3 outputs of ssb and the numbers and individual masses of 30 age classes the model builds on walker et al 2020 but our addition of individual energy budgets driven by phytoplankton density provides a mechanistic link between environmental drivers and fish populations we also present spatial outputs of biomass distribution to demonstrate how the energy budget creates a mechanistic link between changes in environmental drivers and predictions of temporal and spatial distribution of sea bass the energy budget approach follows established methods boyd walker et al 2020 mintram et al 2020 watson et al 2020 our model is intended for use by fisheries managers to complement not replace current stock assessment approaches using ss3 a key assumption in our model is that local food density available to sea bass can be represented by observed phytoplankton density sea bass are generalist predators and their diet is opportunistic so it is difficult to predict what they will be eating at any particular time pickett and pawson 1994 their food choices could in principle be derived from a model of local ecosystems but this would require many unobservable parameters i e what when and where sea bass are eating and the associated uncertainly we therefore chose instead to make use of remote sensing data of phytoplankton blooms which constitute the base of the marine food web there are several problems in attempting to estimate how much of the energy present in phytoplankton is feasibly available to sea bass we reason that areas of high phytoplankton density are likely favourable to all trophic levels that is they will correlate with high densities of species that directly consume phytoplankton and consequently will be attractive to species that prey upon these secondary consumers and a continuation of this pattern up the food chain further many species in the marine environment including much of sea bass prey are highly mobile and may move around seeking energy in the form of their preferred prey on the other hand there is likely a delay which we term trophic delay in time from a large amount of energy being present in the form of phytoplankton till it is available to sea bass as a range of prey because prey species increase in biomass through individual growth or reproduction in this model we bypass these complexities by using a single parameter absorbed energy to indicate how much of the phytoplankton ends up in the fish our approach can be considered justified by the good fits to the data seen in figs 3 4 and 5 methods of calibrating and evaluating complex models have advanced considerably in recent years here we used simulated annealing abc sabc albert künsch and scheidegger 2015 to calibrate five model parameters adult and pelagic mortality rates absorbed energy and two density dependences that would otherwise be extremely difficult to estimate sabc is much faster and more accurate than rejection abc methods dutta et al 2017 which have previously been used to calibrate similar ibms e g boult et al 2018 boyd walker et al 2020 van der vaart et al 2015 the model outputs we have presented give insight into how different aspects of the model are working spawning stock biomass ssb fig 3 is the size of the mature stock which is the basis for setting legislative targets to manage the stock we see good fits for ssb across the simulation period we also see good fits to body weights at age fig 4 which suggests that both the numbers and sizes of the individuals are reasonable the numbers and masses in each age class are discussed below the numbers in each age class are shown in fig 5 assessing numbers at age rather than total abundance is necessary to avoid the more numerous younger fish dominating the model fits overall the dynamic model age structure shown in fig 5 is a good fit against the ss3 data although some of the goodness of fit may stem from what happens in the spin up period cohorts born in the spin up period are read in from ices numbers at age data and their numbers thereafter are only affected by two model parameters natural mortality am and fishing mortality the n0 panel shown in fig 5 represents the number of fish that are age 0 and no longer in the pelagic stage defined in our model as an individual with age 1 and length 1 4 cm beraud et al 2018 predicted n0 fits ss3 data well in some years but in others there are significant discrepancies discrepancies almost certainly arise from lack of realism in our model predicting recruitment is famously difficult but may also arise from errors in the ss3 data the ss3 estimates of the n0 are outputs of a population dynamics model described in the introduction and subject to some uncertainty so the discrepancies between our predictions and the ss3 data do not necessarily mean our predictions are wrong n0 i e the number of n0 individuals in our model is an emergent property driven by the number of mature fish and their spawning success which depends on the condition of the parents mcbride et al 2015 and early survival larger fish with higher fat reserves can produce more eggs i e have higher potential fecundity than smaller fish so the more mature fish there are in the simulation the greater their collective realised fecundity if the mature fish have had access to abundant energy there is more left to produce eggs after the necessary allocation to maintenance and growth it is important to note that the model does not cover quality of eggs though there is some evidence that fish that have had access to better nutrition may also be able to produce higher quality eggs which may increase larval survival and stock recruitment cerdá et al 1994 chatzifotis et al 2011 in the model presented the amount of energy to produce eggs is also influenced by temperature since individuals in warmer sea temperatures may ingest more energy grow faster and have higher levels of reserves from which to produce eggs the other major contributor to the n0 output is pelagic natural mortality rate the daily pelagic mortality rate 8 01 10 2 is far greater than that of the adult mortality parameter in our model 4 71 10 4 so there is a substantial payoff to growing faster to escape the pelagic phase earlier in this way the number of larvae that make it through to be juvenile fish i e classified as n0 is dependant on their growth rate which in turn depends on food availability temperature and the density of competitors the masses of the individuals in each age class are presented in fig 4 although the models provide fairly good fits for younger fish the masses of older fish are underpredicted discrepancies between our predictions and the ss3 data do not necessarily mean our predictions are wrong because the ss3 data are simply outputs of a fitted von bertalanffy growth curve ices 2021 discrepancies may also arise as a result of the spin up process during spin up we read in the numbers at age 0 estimates from ss3 as is done in the spawning sub models of walker et al 2020 but afterwards spawning is determined by the fishes energy budgets and the two methods differ in when spawning takes place the result is that the ibm age 0 cohort consists of older and larger fish than in the ss3 data as the cohort ages it continues heavier for a few years and this may explain the overpredictions of mass for m0 m4 in the first few years of the simulations see figure 17 in trace section 11 the underpredictions of masses of older fish are harder to explain but may result from some lack of realism in our representation of energy budgets in our model an individual s mass depends on its history of ingesting energy and this in turn depends on the energy available in the environment competition from other fish and sea surface temperature and this is what the ae and i parameters hoped to capture in excess of structural mass individuals have the potential to put on weight as fat reserves high reserves result from abundant energy high sst and or low competition and eventually allow mature individuals to spawn these processes result in fluctuations in fat reserves that the ss3 assessment does not capture there are many potential fisheries management applications for the ibm we present here the original model published by walker et al 2020 was designed to complement the ss3 stock assessment and to test spatial management scenarios and the updated model here still retains that utility though note movement sub model limitations discussed below we demonstrate some of the spatial and temporal inter trace figure 19 and intra annual variation utility in figure 6 where results show predictions of variation in the distribution of sea bass our energy budget additions and the subsequent emergent population dynamics that are driven by the environmental drivers make the model a good tool to study a range of climate impacts on the stock using different climate projections the energy budget could capture the effect of temperature on life processes of ingestion metabolic rate growth and sea bass recruitment known to be heavily influenced by temperature pawson pickett and smith 2005 and the subsequent impacts of the stock could be analysed another advantage of the full fish life cycle and closed energy budget additions is that changes in condition or number of the spawning stock will have consequences on the following year s recruitment this closed loop facilitates testing of a range of existing and new management measures for recreational and commercial fishing e g spatial and temporal closures changes to total allowable catch minimum landing size bag limits etc the model is built in a modular fashion making additions or changes to further the model utility achievable one promising line of work is to add other dynamic maps of anthropogenic stressors to the model environment for example the addition of a soundscape map to which the individuals would suffer sublethal effects through reduced ingestion and the knock on effects through the energy budget watson et al 2020 would give rise to emergent population effects of anthropogenic noise a similar approach was done for porpoise in a study by nabe nielsen et al 2014 in addition there is scope to update fishing pressure which is currently read in from ices data to a more mechanistic sub model sea bass are mostly targeted by the under 10 m fleet in the uk williams et al 2018 and the small vessels are often most vulnerable to bad weather sainsbury et al 2018 young et al 2019 an updated fishing pressure sub model that responded mechanistically to environmental and socio economic pressures would further develop the model utility to fisheries management e g jules dreyfus león 1999 millischer and gascuel 2006 bastardie et al 2010 bailey et al 2019 lindkvist et al 2020 we believe that the ibm we present here is a useful tool in its current form however there are some caveats and further opportunities for improvement firstly a general critique of individual agent based models is the large amount of data that they require for model parameterisation calibration and validation johnston et al 2019 to calibrate and asses the fits of the model we use outputs from the sea bass ss3 assessment model the ss3 model takes all the available data from surveys and literature to assess the state of the stock ices 2021 and outputs modelled data so we are fitting the ibm model outputs to another model s outputs this is suboptimal but in the absence of the extensive long term field data on individuals outputs from ss3 remain the best calibration option and the limited availability of calibration data may also explain why the credible intervals remain wide for the five parameters fitted with abc table 2 further detailed spatial distribution data would also be required to truly validate the spatial and temporal explicit predictions by the model shown in fig 6 another limitation is the movement sub model which remains unchanged from walker et al 2020 walker et al 2020 outline how modern tagging methods quayle et al 2009 o neill et al 2018 de pontual et al 2019 could provide data on which a mechanistic movement sub model could be built and added to further the spatial utility of the model to conclude we hope that fisheries managers may find the spatial mechanistic and emergent merits of this ibm a useful complementary tool to ss3 with scope for further development to aid the sustainable management of northern sea bass stock declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

24478,marine reserves can improve fisheries yields of target species while maintaining the persistence of bycatch species however the prevalent equilibrium analyses prevent our understandings in transient behaviours to achieve fisheries adaptive management by incorporating age structure we develop high dimensional theoretical frameworks including both target and bycatch species to compare the yields of target species under different fisheries management strategies with practical applications to the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa our research suggests that strategies with reserves can perform more benefits than traditional strategies without reserves in both conservation and fisheries aspects if target species have old ages at maturity and low adult survivorships in addition if fisheries yields are measured by weight fisheries management has multiple choices over short time scales which is contrary to the conclusions when yields are measured by numbers the generality of applying our theoretical frameworks to fisheries management is tested with hypothetical parameters our work can be used to choose suitable measurement metrics and design more precise optimal fisheries strategies for given natural systems with specific life histories keywords bycatch persistence fisheries yields life histories marine reserves transients 1 introduction a central problem in marine ecology is the need to improve fisheries yields while maintaining species persistence and conserving biodiversity to simultaneously meet these goals various management strategies have been proposed among which the most widely used are traditional fixed limited harvesting strategies and relatively newly proposed methods that rely on the design of marine protected areas mpas or marine reserves hastings and botsford 1999 gaines et al 2010 hastings et al 2017 hilborn 2017 given the frequent use of these management strategies it is necessary to determine which method is best for increasing fisheries yields without increasing the risk of species extinction because of overfishing although the debate is underway hilborn et al 2006 white and kendall 2007 de leo and micheli 2015 liu et al 2018 the role of marine reserves in fisheries management cannot be ignored one theoretical framework in which single species were considered suggests that the establishment of marine reserves is a better option than traditional fisheries management approaches based on controlling the harvesting effort each year for achieving equivalent fisheries yields while providing advantages in maintaining species persistence hastings and botsford 1999 however only considering single species prevents the development of more general predictions related to biodiversity such as those related to the possible effects of different management practices on sensitive species relative to those on target fisheries species through incorporating the incidental catch of unwanted species i e bycatch species aalto and baskett 2013 komoroske and lewison 2015 scales et al 2018 welch et al 2018 one extended two species model suggests that marine reserves can provide simultaneous conservation and fisheries benefits hastings et al 2017 however the reliance of these existing models on equilibrium conditions prevents investigations of how marine reserves influence fisheries yields of target species while maintaining bycatch persistence on relatively short time scales i e before an ecosystem achieves a stable equilibrium state therefore the requirements exist for insights into transient ecosystem dynamics hopf et al 2016 hastings et al 2018 morozov et al 2020 lundström et al 2019 which encompass dynamic behaviors on short time scales and differ from long term asymptotic behaviors hastings et al 2018 morozov et al 2020 francis et al 2021 understanding how the transient dynamics of fisheries yields and population density respond to different management strategies is essential for monitoring fisheries and making appropriate adaptive management decisions i e taking decisions iteratively based on the differences between empirical monitoring data and theoretical expectations as that is frequently employed to enforce the implementation of fisheries policies kaplan et al 2019 nickols et al 2019 it has been suggested that setting an expected timeline is necessary for adaptive management during the recovery of harvested populations kaplan et al 2019 because once marine reserves are established the abundance of fish species may vary greatly due to a variety of factors such as their life histories which leads to undetectability in fisheries white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 nickols et al 2019 this variation provides an important basis for comparing yields among different fisheries management strategies because if the transient oscillations in yield are too strong and the amplitude is sufficiently large fisheries yields under a reserve implementation policy will likely be higher at one moment but lower at another moment relative to the yields achieved using traditional limited harvesting approaches this issue may result in misleading assessments in the relative advantages of different fisheries management strategies for the existing models with equilibrium analyses therefore understanding transient behaviours and the mechanisms under which transient oscillations occur provides a foundation for precisely achieving both conservation and fisheries goals in fisheries management indeed it has been demonstrated that life histories such as age at maturity and natural mortality can effectively regulate transient variation in population abundance and that transient oscillations will increase in populations of species with old age at maturity and a low natural mortality rate white et al 2013 since fisheries yields are usually influenced by population abundance the effective influence of life histories on population abundance makes it reasonable to conjecture that life histories can have effects on the transient behaviour of fisheries yields to explore the transient phenomena in fisheries management under the persistence of bycatch species and test the hypothesis that transient fisheries yields can be related to life histories we develop theoretical frameworks consisting of reserve only and no reserve models which are derived from two extreme cases considered in previous models hastings et al 2017 we then extend the models to high dimensions by adding age structure which is used to investigate the transient behaviour of the target fish species which persist even under fishing stress and the persistence of bycatch species which have high risks of going extinct based on the following assumptions first we assume that the transient dynamics of the target species are independent of the dynamics of the bycatch species i e no ecological connections exist between two species chen 2020 second we assume that the movement abilities of the fish differ in the adult and larval stages adults tend to be sedentary while larvae can disperse everywhere third we assume that the proportions of fish individuals subject to reserve protection in the reserve only model are the same for both target and bycatch species and that the fractions of fish stocks that are unharvested i e escapement rate in the no reserve model are the same for the two species this is plausible in the real world given the relatively high cost of selective fishing gear with these assumptions we compare the yields measured by both number and weight under two different fisheries management strategies and explore the mechanisms causing the variation in the relative advantages of these strategies we then investigate the effects of life histories on transient metrics on the basis of these analyses we aim to answer three questions i in transient time scales whether and when the reserve only policy can achieve advantages of fisheries yields under bycatch species persistence relative to no reserve policy in fisheries management ii whether transient fisheries management strategies depend on the metric used for yield measurement i e number vs weight iii based on transient dynamics how the life histories of both target fish species and bycatch species regulate the relative yield advantages between two fisheries management strategies 2 mathematical model 2 1 model overview based on previous methods and frameworks hastings and botsford 1999 hastings et al 2017 we use a two species system considering reserve only and no reserve scenarios see details below to make a comparison between different fisheries management strategies the two species are a target species with a strong stock and life history characteristics such as high fecundity that allow it to easily persist and a bycatch species with a weak stock and unfavourable life history characteristics that could lead to population collapse we consider the age structure results without the age structure are shown in fig s1 in appendix a of the target species while ignoring the age structure of the bycatch species to simplify the framework and focus on the central issue in this study in addition to the age increasing of all adults each year the age structure of the target species is based on two major considerations i all the youngest adults are obtained from larval recruitment in one year and ii all the oldest adults i e those that reach the maximum age will die next year across the different age classes we assume that older mature individuals have higher fecundity than younger individuals as shown in the schematic in fig 1 the per capita fecundity in each age class is expressed as a column vector m m 1 m 2 m n t and the corresponding weight per individual is the column vector b b 1 b 2 b n t where n is the number of age classes we denote a m as the age at maturity fecundity is zero when an individual s age is smaller than the threshold a m and fecundity expressed as a function of length is m a q l m 1 e k a a 0 d when an individual s age surpasses the threshold of maturity white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 where a is the fish individual s age l m is the individual s asymptotic maximum length k is the growth rate q and d are constants and a 0 is the age at length zero an individual s weight at age a is expressed as b a p l m 1 e k a a 0 w where p and w are constants kaplan et al 2019 lundström et al 2019 2 2 part 1 reserve only model the reserve only model considers fisheries management methods consisting of marine reserves rather than fixed harvesting rates an implicit assumption is that all adult fish outside marine reserves are harvested i e scorched earth assumption malvadkar and hastings 2008 edwards et al 2010 to maintain the persistence of the bycatch species the reserve size c should be no smaller than a critical value so that enough individuals are protected from harvesting according to previous research hastings et al 2017 the critical value of reserve size is 1 c 1 s w α w m w where s w α w and m w are the survival rate proliferation rate per generation and per capita fecundity for the bycatch species respectively the adult density considering the age structure at time t inside a marine reserve is defined as column vector n t r n 1 t r n 2 t r n n t r t thus the total number of larvae produced inside the reserve is the dot product of the adult density and fecundity multiplied by the reserve size in other words the number of larvae produced by adults of each age class equals the product of the reserve size the adult density and the corresponding fecundity of that age class the total number of larvae is the sum of all the larvae produced by the adults in each age class based on the well mixed assumption i e that the larval densities inside and outside reserves are the same as suggested in previous research hastings and botsford 1999 hart 2006 hopf et al 2019 the larval densities both inside and outside the marine reserve are c m n t r where means the dot product of two column vectors this value equals the total number of larvae because the total marine system size is scaled to 1 therefore the density of larvae that survive to adulthood at time t is 2 a t f c m n t 1 r where f is the beverton holt growth function we further define the natural survival rate of adults each year as the fixed value s note that all fish individuals will die the following year if they reach the maximum age see fig 1a according to simple derivations see section 1 in appendix a the age structured adult density inside the reserve at time t is 3 n t r a t s a t 1 s 2 a t 2 s n 1 a t n 1 t the fisheries yields measured by number can be expressed as 4 y t n r a t 1 c and the fisheries yields measured by weight can be expressed as 5 y t w r b 1 a t 1 c 2 3 part 2 no reserve model when using traditional methods with fixed harvesting rates and without marine reserves see fig 1b the escapement rate e should be no smaller than the critical value of e to maintain the persistence of the bycatch species based on previous research hastings et al 2017 we have 6 e 1 s w α w m w defining a e as the critical age at which fish are harvested the escapement rate is 1 when an individual s age is smaller than a e and the escapement rate is e when an individual s age is greater than a e following a general form we denote the escapement rate for the age structured target species as column vector e e 1 e 2 e n t and the population density at time t as column vector n t o n 1 t o n 2 t o n n t o t similar to the reserve only model the total larvae produced by all the adults are the dot product of the adult density and fecundity thus the density of larvae that survive to adulthood at time t is 7 a t f m n t 1 o the adult density of the age structured target species at time t is 8 n t o a t e 1 s e 2 a t 1 e 1 s n 1 j 1 n e j a t n 1 t and the specific derivation can be seen in section 1 in appendix a to obtain fisheries yields with concise form in the next step we show the density at time t before harvesting as 9 n t o t a t s e 1 a t 1 s n 1 a t n 1 j 1 n 1 e j t thus the fisheries yield measured by number of individuals can be expressed as 10 y t n o n t ot 1 e and the fisheries yield measured by weight can be expressed as 11 y t w o s u m b n t ot 1 e where denotes hadamard product among different vectors 2 4 model analyses to observe the dynamical properties of our theoretical frameworks we solve the analytical solutions of the system our analytical results suggest that population densities under each harvesting strategy i e reserve only and no reserve ones have two solutions including the zero solution and the non zero solution eq b 5 eq b 6 eq b 13 eq b 14 eq b 22 eq b 23 eq b 25 and eq b 26 in appendix b moreover the solution is global stable however the underlying conditions eq b 9 eq b10 eq b17 and eq b18 in appendix b indicate that the two solutions cannot be stable simultaneously which suggests that population can avoid the risk of collapse once marine reserve size or the escapement rate is large enough to surpass the threshold values of the constraint conditions with population density at equilibrium we achieve fisheries yields and analyses with derivative approach suggests that fisheries yields can increase or decrease in response to various parameters regardless of fisheries management strategies therefore fisheries yields harvested under reserve only strategy can be higher or lower than fisheries yields harvested under no reserve strategy section 2 in appendix b 3 materials and methods 3 1 initial conditions the system starts with the initial condition at a stable age distribution which is a suitable start point as suggested by previous research white et al 2013 to make a comparison the initial conditions are the same for both reserve only and no reserve models a stable age distribution suggests that older individuals are fewer in number because of mortality white et al 2013 supposing the number of the youngest adult individuals is r recruitment then the number of older individuals can be predicted according to adult survivorship and individual escapement rate from harvesting thus the initial individual density in each age class is calculated based on the discrete time formula n0 r se a where n0 is the initial density for both reserve only and no reserve strategies note that we use the critical escapement rate e here because of the necessity of considering the persistence of bycatch species with these initial conditions we can investigate the cases under which initial density is very low because the total system is heavily overfished prior to the implementation of either catch limits or establishing spatial closures such as marine reserves in the system to explore the generality of the system we also perform simulations under initial conditions with stochastic normal distribution using the function normrnd in matlab r2013b random initial density for both reserve only and no reserve strategies are produced by a normal distribution with mean of 500 and standard deviation of 2 3 2 parameter settings the parameter values for simulations come from previous researches hagerman 1952 hunter et al 1990 white et al 2013 hastings et al 2017 kaplan et al 2019 chen 2020 which are highly relevant to the target and bycatch species studied here we use the average values if these parameters are different between male and female individuals for example the maximum length is 43 7 cm for male individuals and 47 4 cm for female individuals hagerman 1952 hunter et al 1990 and thus the average value of maximum

of fish 8 to 12 years of age hagerman 1952 thus we set parameter values of minimum fishing age ae around the range of 8 to 12 years specifically we set ae 8 11 12 14 years respectively similarly a previous survey shows that dover sole longer than 40 0 cm approach maximum length l m 45 55 cm may be any age from 8 to 40 or 50 years hunter et al 1990 thus we set parameter values of age at maturity am as 8 17 18 20 21 25 years respectively to extend the parameter space extreme cases are considered in addition to the parameter range for most of the catch thus we study the extreme case that am 0 and ae 0 which suggests that fish individuals achieve maturity and are harvested in the first year parameter settings about the life histories of both target and bycatch species can be seen in table s1 in appendix a which derives from empirical data from the stock assessment of pacific coast groundfish fishery the pacific fishery management council 2016 these parameters are used to study the same target species but different bycatch species in fisheries management hastings et al 2017 to insight into different bycatch species seven situations are separated to be convenient we numbered them as situations 1 7 see table s1 in appendix a among which situations 1 3 are hypothetical cases and denote three situations under which the hypothetical target species are the same while the hypothetical bycatch species are different according to their life histories such as adult survivorship and fecundity situations 4 7 are empirical cases of the us west coast groundfish fishery and denote four situations under which they have the same target species dover sole microstomus pacificus but different bycatch species bocaccio situation 4 darkblotched rockfish situation 5 pacific ocean perch situation 6 and yelloweye rockfish situation 7 the beverton holt functional form is f n α β n β n chen 2020 where α and β denote the proliferation rate per generation and carrying capacity respectively the parameter values of α and β are estimated based on standard formulae see eq 18 and eq 19 in hastings et al 2017 and the relevant empirical data the pacific fishery management council 2016 subsequently with life history parameters the critical reserve size c and the critical escapement rate e are calculated based on eq 1 and eq 6 in addition parameter r is set as 500 to calculate initial density to be clear parameter values used in each figure and the relationships among figures can be seen in table s2 in appendix a in summary we use selected parameter combinations that guaranteed the persistence of the bycatch species to explore the life history parameter space for the target species under two different fisheries management strategies 3 3 simulations with both reserve only and no reserve models we first simulate the transient dynamics of the population density and fisheries yields of the target species second we explore the effect of life histories of both target and bycatch species on fisheries yields under different measurement metrics specifically for target species we directly explore the effect of age at maturity am minimum fishing age ae adult survivorship s for bycatch species we study the effect of critical reserve size c and critical escapement rate e which is used to predict the life histories of bycatch species so as to indirectly explore their effect on fisheries yields further we explore the effect of life histories on transient metric θ which determines the amplitude of transient oscillations and measures how close the initial system state is to the final equilibrium state white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 to calculate transient metric θ we transform both reserve only and no reserve models into identical cases so that population density at time t depends on matrix a and a in addition to the corresponding population density at time t 1 see details in section 2 in appendix a under reserve only strategy transient metric θ 1 is calculated based on the angle between initial population density inside the marine reserve n 0 r at time t 0 and the dominant right eigenvector w 1 of a 12 θ 1 arccos n 0 r w 1 n 0 r w 1 where the small dot means dot product and double vertical bars denote vector norms similarly transient metric θ 2 under no reserve strategy is calculated based on the angle between initial population density n 0 o and the dominant right eigenvector m1 of a 13 θ 2 arccos n 0 o m 1 n 0 o m 1 with eq 12 and eq 13 we perform sensitivity analyses with function norm and eig in matlab r2013b see details in the code in appendix d to achieve robust conclusions all the analyses are performed at different simulation time points to observe the robustness of our results we also use statistical methods to investigate the simulation results in response to different parameter spaces specifically we calculate the average values of fisheries yields as well as transient metric under different gradients of age at maturity am and minimum fishing age ae we then study the effect of each model parameter on these average values meanwhile we perform regression analysis to observe the relationships between influencing factors age at maturity minimum fishing age and fisheries yields harvested under critical reserve size and critical escapement rate to maintain bycatch species persistence for each gradient of age at maturity and minimum fishing age we calculate the mean and maximum values of fisheries yields among the variation range of critical reserve size and critical escapement rate regression analyses are performed with the function trendline in the r package basictrendline in addition to make a comparison and observe the effect of age structure we also simulate the transient dynamics of target species using models without age structure hastings et al 2017 the models without age structure derive from the two extreme cases in previous research hastings et al 2017 which denotes two different harvesting strategies i e reserve only and no reserve strategies we use the models without age structure to perform simulations with the same parameter values except for the value of reserve size and escapement rate and the same random initial conditions as that in previous research in transient analyses chen 2020 all simulation analyses are performed in matlab r2013b except for the regression analysis 4 results under the persistence of bycatch species our results show that transient oscillations can in some cases occur in population density fig 2 a d g fisheries yields measured by number fig 2b e h and fisheries yields measured by weight fig 2c f i furthermore if fisheries yields are measured by number the yields observed from the reserve only method are always higher than those from the no reserve method fig 2b e h however if fisheries yields are measured by weight fig 2c f i the yields produced in the reserve only model can be higher fig 2i or lower fig 2c than the yields produced in the no reserve model with appropriate empirical parameter settings moreover even with the same parameter settings in some cases it is difficult to determine which fisheries management method can achieve higher yields and ensure the persistence of bycatch species as the transient oscillations lead to higher and lower fisheries yields under reserve only management than under no reserve management at various times fig 2f the parameter values derive from a specific scenario of the empirical cases in the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa in which the bycatch species is yelloweye rockfish i e situation 7 in table s1 in appendix a however the yield comparison results that yields from reserve only approach can be higher or lower than that from no reserve approach are robust among other different bycatch species including bocaccio situation 4 darkblotched rockfish situation 5 and pacific ocean perch situation 6 fig s2 in appendix a the results are also robust when simulations are performed under stochastic initial conditions fig s1 in appendix c regardless of variations in influential life history characteristics e g age at maturity minimum fishing age and adult survivorship for the target species when yields are measured by the number of fish caught our model ensuring the persistence of bycatch species suggests that the reserve only management method results in higher fisheries yields than the no reserve method fig 3 a c however the advantages of the different management approaches vary according to the influencing factors if fisheries yields are measured on the basis of weight fig 3d f specifically for target species with a younger age at maturity younger minimum fishing age and higher adult survivorship higher yields are observed with the no reserve management method than with the reserve only management method in contrast higher fisheries yields are observed in the reserve only method than in the no reserve method when target species have the opposite life history characteristics these results that fisheries management strategies depend on both yield measurement metrics and life histories are robust among different bycatch species shown in different colours in fig 3 and at different simulation time points figs s3 and s4 in appendix a as well as different combinations of age at maturity and minimum fishing age figs s5 s8 in appendix a and the average value of fisheries yields among these parameter gradients fig s2 in appendix c our results ensuring the persistence of bycatch species also robustly show that critical reserve size and escapement rate can regulate fisheries yields of the target species with different management strategies fig 4 figs s9 s14 in appendix a fig s3 in appendix c for example the yields measured according to both number and weight are always higher with the no reserve method than with the reserve only method if the critical value of the reserve size for maintaining bycatch species persistence in the reserve only model is equal to the critical value of the escapement rate in the no reserve model when age at maturity am and minimum fishing age ae are young fig 4 however the fisheries yield is higher under reserve only management than under no reserve management in two cases i the critical reserve size is small but not too small say 0 1 and the critical escapement rate is very large say 0 95 ii age at maturity am and minimum fishing age ae are old fig 4 figs s9 s14 in appendix a figs s6 s7 in appendix c this finding suggests that in general the critical reserve size in the reserve only model and the critical escapement rate in the no reserve model can greatly influence the relative yield advantages of the two fisheries management methods i e they can determine which method can achieve higher fisheries yields this is important because the critical values of both reserve size and escapement rate are linked to the life history characteristics of the bycatch species that are associated with population persistence condition sensitivity analyses ensuring the persistence of bycatch species show that the transient metric θ generally oscillates and exhibits strong periodicity with variation in the influencing factors i e age at maturity minimum fishing age and adult survivorship fig 5 figs s15 s18 in appendix a fig s4 in appendix c this finding shows that the trajectories of the system are temporarily and periodically close to a stable state thus the amplitude of the oscillations in the population dynamics decreases or increases periodically based on the life history characteristics of the target species such as age at maturity minimum fishing age and adult survivorship in addition the critical reserve size generally does not affect transient metrics while critical escapement rate can greatly regulate transient metrics fig 6 figs s19 s21 in appendix a fig s5 in appendix c 5 discussion marine reserves are important in fisheries management mangel 2000 edgar et al 2014 herrera et al 2016 by ensuring the persistence of bycatch species and modeling the transient dynamics of two species systems rather than assuming an asymptotic equilibrium state our findings suggest that fisheries management strategies that rely only on the establishment of marine reserves without implementing fishing effort control cannot always be the optimal method to improve the fisheries yields of the target species as well as maintain bycatch species persistence whether management approaches involving the implementation of marine reserves result in higher fisheries yields of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species than those under traditional nonspatial strategies in which harvesting effort is controlled depends on the yield measurement metrics and the life history characteristics of both the target and bycatch species if fisheries yields of the target species are measured by fish individual numbers the establishment of a marine reserve could be a primary fisheries management strategy especially for the us west coast groundfish fishery hastings et al 2017 nickols et al 2019 chen 2020 if fisheries yields of the target species are instead measured by weight thus considering differences in both the fecundity and biomass of individuals of different ages in the theoretical framework kaplan et al 2019 traditional harvesting control strategies will not always be absolutely disadvantaged in fisheries management relative to strategies with the implementation of marine reserves to achieve the goals of both improving fisheries yields and maintaining species persistence the effect of the yield measurement method on fisheries management strategies is related to the age structure of the harvested individuals management strategies based on marine reserves allow for the harvesting of only relatively young adults each year because all the adult individuals in the harvested area originate from larvae that have dispersed from the marine reserve whereas those based on controlling harvesting efforts lead to the harvest of relatively old relatively heavy adults thus the use of the weight based measurement approach benefits traditional fisheries management strategies in terms of improving the yield of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species our results suggest that choosing appropriate measurement metrics results in correct estimations in the optimal harvesting strategies which has important implications in fisheries adaptive management ensuring the persistence of bycatch species for a natural system ensuring the persistence of bycatch species fisheries yields of the target species should be measured by weight to make the right decisions in fisheries management if the target species are long lived and have prominent age structures in such a case yield measurement metrics with weight could be applied to commercial fisheries in which much attention has been paid to fish biomass on the contrary fisheries yields of the target species should be measured by numbers when the target species in the given system have uniform body size and age and the effect of density on transient population dynamics overwhelms the effect of age structure in such a case yield measurement metrics with numbers could be applied to recreational fisheries which are often regulated through daily bag limits our findings also demonstrate that the increase in yield under the different fisheries management strategies ensuring the persistence of bycatch species depends on the life history characteristics of both the target and bycatch species first with our simulation analyses among different bycatch species shown in different colours in fig 3 and at different simulation time points figs s3 and s4 in appendix a as well as different combinations of age at maturity and minimum fishing age figs s5 s8 in appendix a we can achieve a general conclusion when reserves are not used higher yields will be observed if the target species have a young age at maturity or high adult survivorship than if they have an old age at maturity or low adult survivorship second the life history characteristics of the bycatch species can be used to predict the relative yield advantages of the two fisheries management strategies by establishing the critical reserve size and escapement rate to maintain bycatch species persistence the relationships between life history characteristics of bycatch species and critical reserve size and escapement rate can be shown in eq 1 and eq 6 for example if the critical reserve size is 0 1 and the critical escapement rate is 0 95 reserve only strategies can result in higher fisheries yields than no reserve strategies fig 4 figs s9 s14 in appendix a and the corresponding life history characteristics of the bycatch species can be predicted based on eq 1 and eq 6 when one life history parameter is fixed e g adult survivorship and fecundity can be determined by controlling the proliferation rate per generation in contrast solving eqs 1 and 6 with the assumption that the critical reserve size equals the critical escapement rate can predict bycatch species life history characteristics which lead to higher fisheries yields under the no reserve strategy than under the reserve only strategy on condition that both age at maturity and minimum fishing age are very young fig 4 in such a case even if the bycatch species are long lived and have low fecundity thus reflecting the advantages of marine reserves in an equilibrium state according to a previous model hastings et al 2017 reserves cannot ensure simultaneous benefits in fisheries production and conservation in transient time scales therefore the suggestions our results can provide in fisheries management are that optimal harvesting strategies considering the persistence of bycatch species in a given natural system should match the corresponding life histories of both the target and bycatch species in that system life history characteristics can also be used to predict the amplitude of the transient oscillations thus influencing the choice between the two fisheries management strategies in terms of yield of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species furthermore pronounced oscillations would result in fluctuations in yield that would complicate any attempt to make this choice and predictable decisions need transient oscillations that are low in amplitude the periodic relationship between the transient metric θ which influences the amplitude of transient oscillations white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 chen 2020 and life history parameters of both the target and bycatch species fig 5 suggests that our theoretical frameworks have important practical applications because they can be used to estimate whether we could achieve stable fisheries yields in a certain system in transient time scales based on the life histories which are parameters that relatively easy to achieve in empirical experiments by considering the effect of age structure our results show that it is misleading to either choose traditional fishing effort control or the implementation of marine reserve alone without catch limits as the exclusive fisheries management strategy ensuring the persistence of bycatch species under various situations such as different life histories and measurement methods when age structure is not considered our further transient analysis studying independently two fisheries strategies of catch limits and establishing marine reserves which means either marine reserve size or escapement rate is always zero of previous models which are used for equilibrium analyses in previous research hastings et al 2017 and for transient analyses of fisheries strategies with the combination of catch limits and establishing marine reserves in chen 2020 suggests that management strategies based on marine reserves can result in higher or lower fisheries yields than traditional fisheries strategies depending on different bycatch species fig s1b d f in appendix a especially when adult survivorship is very high the advantages of traditional management strategies i e those without reserves relative to strategies with establishing marine reserves are strengthened as shown in our analyses fig s1h j l and n in appendix a therefore in some cases the traditional no reserve approach can provide higher fisheries yields than that with reserve only approach however previous equilibrium studies emphasize the important role of marine reserves in improving fisheries yields hastings et al 2017 the underlying explainations for the different results are that the equilibrium analyses hastings et al 2017 make a comparison between fisheries strategy of traditional nonspatial approaches alone and fisheries strategy of establishing marine reserves with the appropriate choice of escapement outside the reserve therefore on one hand the equilibrium analyses show the necessity of establishing spatial closures in fisheries management on the other hand it suggests the joint effect of combining both spatial closure approach and traditional nonspatial approach however our results without age structure make a comparison between two fisheries strategies independently which does not have a joint effect in comparison with the age structured model we developed here results of models without age structure suggest that generally fisheries management strategies depend on life histories but do not depend on yield measurement metrics because the constant linear relationship between fisheries yields measured by weight and by number can cause the same variation trends in addition unlike our theoretical frameworks with age structure our results of the models without age structure generally did not show very obvious transient phenomena among different parameter settings fig s1 in appendix a which is consistent with previous conclusions that transient dynamics are difficult to observe in models without age structure white et al 2013 chen 2020 the underlying mechanism is that the inclusion of age structure often leads to high dimensional models which have been suggested to be the main mechanism associated with transient dynamics hastings et al 2018 morozov et al 2020 previous investigations of the transient dynamics of fish abundance following the establishment of marine reserves have indicated that the transient metric θ generally increases with increasing age at maturity and decreases with an increase in natural mortality white et al 2013 however our sensitivity analyses ensuring the persistence of bycatch species indicate that the transient metric θ generally increases and decreases periodically with variations in both age at maturity and adult survivorship fig 5 figs s15 s18 in appendix a this discrepancy should arise from the fact that in the previous study white et al 2013 the transient response of linear models was considered with leslie matrices while we use a nonlinear model thus in our study ensuring the persistence of bycatch species the eigenvalues of matrix a and a vary with population density section 2 in appendix a these results suggest that considering the nonlinear effect of larval survival to adults will increase the difficulty of investigating transient dynamics as predictability varies periodically in response to life history characteristics thus increasing the difficulty in determining which fisheries management strategy the reserve only vs no reserve approach is best our conclusions are suitable for fisheries management ensuring the persistence of bycatch species in the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa with the pacific coast groundfish fishery management plan fmp more than 100 stocks are managed the pacific fishery management council 2016 among which species including bocaccio darkblotched rockfish pacific ocean perch and yelloweye rockfish are overfished and face high extinction risk our results have shown that fisheries strategy in improving yields of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species depends on the life histories in general for specific species we studied both the target species dover sole and four bycatch species in the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa the adult survivorship is relatively high 0 8 see table s1 in appendix a and thus our results suggest that strategy without reserve for species we studied in the west coast groundfish fishery may achieve higher fisheries yields as well as ensure bycatch persistence if yield measurement metric is weight while strategy with reserve is better if yield measurement metric is number with a suitable choice of minimum fishing age fig 3 figs s3 s8 in appendix a to extend our theoretical frameworks to more general cases we performed further analyses with hypothetical parameter values suggested in previous studies hastings et al 2017 similar results that fisheries management strategies depend on yield measurement metrics as well as the life histories of both the target and bycatch species were observed in the hypothetical cases figs s22 30 in appendix a which supports the generality of our theoretical framework although generally similar trends were observed between the empirical and hypothetical cases the specific details differ for example in the empirical cases the effects of the life history characteristics of the target species on fisheries management methods are very similar among different weak species nevertheless in the hypothetical cases the effects of age at maturity and minimum fishing age on both kinds of fisheries yields measured by weight and by number are more complex among different weak species than those in the empirical cases that is fisheries yields achieved under the reserve only method may be higher or lower than those achieved under the no reserve method for different bycatch species figs s23 s25 in appendix a the differences between the hypothetical and empirical cases occur because adult survivorship in the hypothetical cases is very low while it is very high in the empirical cases as shown in the parameter settings hastings et al 2017 chen 2020 thus the age at maturity and minimum fishing age must be within certain limits in the hypothetical cases otherwise the target species cannot persist our study is based on the scorched earth assumption malvadkar and hastings 2008 edwards et al 2010 for fisheries management with reserve only strategy which does not consider the effects of economic costs on fisheries sanchirico et al 2006 white et al 2008 if the effects of economic costs are considered capturing all the adults in the harvesting area i e the scorched earth assumption can lead to high costs because catchability decreases with decreasing population density in natural systems in such a case the costs associated with reserve only management strategies will be relatively high and this approach may not be the best choice in addition we ignore the age structure of the bycatch species so that the persistence conditions are easy to achieve considering the age structure of the bycatch species can lead to high dimensional models and highly complex persistence conditions thus requiring new analytical and simulation approaches however if further new theoretical frameworks are still based on the assumption that there are no ecological connections between the target and bycatch species then similar conclusions may be obtained even when the effect of the age structure of the bycatch species is considered future studies should explore the different connections between the target and bycatch species e g predator prey or competitive relationships to greatly regulate the population density of both species frid and marliave 2010 aalto and baskett

24478,marine reserves can improve fisheries yields of target species while maintaining the persistence of bycatch species however the prevalent equilibrium analyses prevent our understandings in transient behaviours to achieve fisheries adaptive management by incorporating age structure we develop high dimensional theoretical frameworks including both target and bycatch species to compare the yields of target species under different fisheries management strategies with practical applications to the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa our research suggests that strategies with reserves can perform more benefits than traditional strategies without reserves in both conservation and fisheries aspects if target species have old ages at maturity and low adult survivorships in addition if fisheries yields are measured by weight fisheries management has multiple choices over short time scales which is contrary to the conclusions when yields are measured by numbers the generality of applying our theoretical frameworks to fisheries management is tested with hypothetical parameters our work can be used to choose suitable measurement metrics and design more precise optimal fisheries strategies for given natural systems with specific life histories keywords bycatch persistence fisheries yields life histories marine reserves transients 1 introduction a central problem in marine ecology is the need to improve fisheries yields while maintaining species persistence and conserving biodiversity to simultaneously meet these goals various management strategies have been proposed among which the most widely used are traditional fixed limited harvesting strategies and relatively newly proposed methods that rely on the design of marine protected areas mpas or marine reserves hastings and botsford 1999 gaines et al 2010 hastings et al 2017 hilborn 2017 given the frequent use of these management strategies it is necessary to determine which method is best for increasing fisheries yields without increasing the risk of species extinction because of overfishing although the debate is underway hilborn et al 2006 white and kendall 2007 de leo and micheli 2015 liu et al 2018 the role of marine reserves in fisheries management cannot be ignored one theoretical framework in which single species were considered suggests that the establishment of marine reserves is a better option than traditional fisheries management approaches based on controlling the harvesting effort each year for achieving equivalent fisheries yields while providing advantages in maintaining species persistence hastings and botsford 1999 however only considering single species prevents the development of more general predictions related to biodiversity such as those related to the possible effects of different management practices on sensitive species relative to those on target fisheries species through incorporating the incidental catch of unwanted species i e bycatch species aalto and baskett 2013 komoroske and lewison 2015 scales et al 2018 welch et al 2018 one extended two species model suggests that marine reserves can provide simultaneous conservation and fisheries benefits hastings et al 2017 however the reliance of these existing models on equilibrium conditions prevents investigations of how marine reserves influence fisheries yields of target species while maintaining bycatch persistence on relatively short time scales i e before an ecosystem achieves a stable equilibrium state therefore the requirements exist for insights into transient ecosystem dynamics hopf et al 2016 hastings et al 2018 morozov et al 2020 lundström et al 2019 which encompass dynamic behaviors on short time scales and differ from long term asymptotic behaviors hastings et al 2018 morozov et al 2020 francis et al 2021 understanding how the transient dynamics of fisheries yields and population density respond to different management strategies is essential for monitoring fisheries and making appropriate adaptive management decisions i e taking decisions iteratively based on the differences between empirical monitoring data and theoretical expectations as that is frequently employed to enforce the implementation of fisheries policies kaplan et al 2019 nickols et al 2019 it has been suggested that setting an expected timeline is necessary for adaptive management during the recovery of harvested populations kaplan et al 2019 because once marine reserves are established the abundance of fish species may vary greatly due to a variety of factors such as their life histories which leads to undetectability in fisheries white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 nickols et al 2019 this variation provides an important basis for comparing yields among different fisheries management strategies because if the transient oscillations in yield are too strong and the amplitude is sufficiently large fisheries yields under a reserve implementation policy will likely be higher at one moment but lower at another moment relative to the yields achieved using traditional limited harvesting approaches this issue may result in misleading assessments in the relative advantages of different fisheries management strategies for the existing models with equilibrium analyses therefore understanding transient behaviours and the mechanisms under which transient oscillations occur provides a foundation for precisely achieving both conservation and fisheries goals in fisheries management indeed it has been demonstrated that life histories such as age at maturity and natural mortality can effectively regulate transient variation in population abundance and that transient oscillations will increase in populations of species with old age at maturity and a low natural mortality rate white et al 2013 since fisheries yields are usually influenced by population abundance the effective influence of life histories on population abundance makes it reasonable to conjecture that life histories can have effects on the transient behaviour of fisheries yields to explore the transient phenomena in fisheries management under the persistence of bycatch species and test the hypothesis that transient fisheries yields can be related to life histories we develop theoretical frameworks consisting of reserve only and no reserve models which are derived from two extreme cases considered in previous models hastings et al 2017 we then extend the models to high dimensions by adding age structure which is used to investigate the transient behaviour of the target fish species which persist even under fishing stress and the persistence of bycatch species which have high risks of going extinct based on the following assumptions first we assume that the transient dynamics of the target species are independent of the dynamics of the bycatch species i e no ecological connections exist between two species chen 2020 second we assume that the movement abilities of the fish differ in the adult and larval stages adults tend to be sedentary while larvae can disperse everywhere third we assume that the proportions of fish individuals subject to reserve protection in the reserve only model are the same for both target and bycatch species and that the fractions of fish stocks that are unharvested i e escapement rate in the no reserve model are the same for the two species this is plausible in the real world given the relatively high cost of selective fishing gear with these assumptions we compare the yields measured by both number and weight under two different fisheries management strategies and explore the mechanisms causing the variation in the relative advantages of these strategies we then investigate the effects of life histories on transient metrics on the basis of these analyses we aim to answer three questions i in transient time scales whether and when the reserve only policy can achieve advantages of fisheries yields under bycatch species persistence relative to no reserve policy in fisheries management ii whether transient fisheries management strategies depend on the metric used for yield measurement i e number vs weight iii based on transient dynamics how the life histories of both target fish species and bycatch species regulate the relative yield advantages between two fisheries management strategies 2 mathematical model 2 1 model overview based on previous methods and frameworks hastings and botsford 1999 hastings et al 2017 we use a two species system considering reserve only and no reserve scenarios see details below to make a comparison between different fisheries management strategies the two species are a target species with a strong stock and life history characteristics such as high fecundity that allow it to easily persist and a bycatch species with a weak stock and unfavourable life history characteristics that could lead to population collapse we consider the age structure results without the age structure are shown in fig s1 in appendix a of the target species while ignoring the age structure of the bycatch species to simplify the framework and focus on the central issue in this study in addition to the age increasing of all adults each year the age structure of the target species is based on two major considerations i all the youngest adults are obtained from larval recruitment in one year and ii all the oldest adults i e those that reach the maximum age will die next year across the different age classes we assume that older mature individuals have higher fecundity than younger individuals as shown in the schematic in fig 1 the per capita fecundity in each age class is expressed as a column vector m m 1 m 2 m n t and the corresponding weight per individual is the column vector b b 1 b 2 b n t where n is the number of age classes we denote a m as the age at maturity fecundity is zero when an individual s age is smaller than the threshold a m and fecundity expressed as a function of length is m a q l m 1 e k a a 0 d when an individual s age surpasses the threshold of maturity white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 where a is the fish individual s age l m is the individual s asymptotic maximum length k is the growth rate q and d are constants and a 0 is the age at length zero an individual s weight at age a is expressed as b a p l m 1 e k a a 0 w where p and w are constants kaplan et al 2019 lundström et al 2019 2 2 part 1 reserve only model the reserve only model considers fisheries management methods consisting of marine reserves rather than fixed harvesting rates an implicit assumption is that all adult fish outside marine reserves are harvested i e scorched earth assumption malvadkar and hastings 2008 edwards et al 2010 to maintain the persistence of the bycatch species the reserve size c should be no smaller than a critical value so that enough individuals are protected from harvesting according to previous research hastings et al 2017 the critical value of reserve size is 1 c 1 s w α w m w where s w α w and m w are the survival rate proliferation rate per generation and per capita fecundity for the bycatch species respectively the adult density considering the age structure at time t inside a marine reserve is defined as column vector n t r n 1 t r n 2 t r n n t r t thus the total number of larvae produced inside the reserve is the dot product of the adult density and fecundity multiplied by the reserve size in other words the number of larvae produced by adults of each age class equals the product of the reserve size the adult density and the corresponding fecundity of that age class the total number of larvae is the sum of all the larvae produced by the adults in each age class based on the well mixed assumption i e that the larval densities inside and outside reserves are the same as suggested in previous research hastings and botsford 1999 hart 2006 hopf et al 2019 the larval densities both inside and outside the marine reserve are c m n t r where means the dot product of two column vectors this value equals the total number of larvae because the total marine system size is scaled to 1 therefore the density of larvae that survive to adulthood at time t is 2 a t f c m n t 1 r where f is the beverton holt growth function we further define the natural survival rate of adults each year as the fixed value s note that all fish individuals will die the following year if they reach the maximum age see fig 1a according to simple derivations see section 1 in appendix a the age structured adult density inside the reserve at time t is 3 n t r a t s a t 1 s 2 a t 2 s n 1 a t n 1 t the fisheries yields measured by number can be expressed as 4 y t n r a t 1 c and the fisheries yields measured by weight can be expressed as 5 y t w r b 1 a t 1 c 2 3 part 2 no reserve model when using traditional methods with fixed harvesting rates and without marine reserves see fig 1b the escapement rate e should be no smaller than the critical value of e to maintain the persistence of the bycatch species based on previous research hastings et al 2017 we have 6 e 1 s w α w m w defining a e as the critical age at which fish are harvested the escapement rate is 1 when an individual s age is smaller than a e and the escapement rate is e when an individual s age is greater than a e following a general form we denote the escapement rate for the age structured target species as column vector e e 1 e 2 e n t and the population density at time t as column vector n t o n 1 t o n 2 t o n n t o t similar to the reserve only model the total larvae produced by all the adults are the dot product of the adult density and fecundity thus the density of larvae that survive to adulthood at time t is 7 a t f m n t 1 o the adult density of the age structured target species at time t is 8 n t o a t e 1 s e 2 a t 1 e 1 s n 1 j 1 n e j a t n 1 t and the specific derivation can be seen in section 1 in appendix a to obtain fisheries yields with concise form in the next step we show the density at time t before harvesting as 9 n t o t a t s e 1 a t 1 s n 1 a t n 1 j 1 n 1 e j t thus the fisheries yield measured by number of individuals can be expressed as 10 y t n o n t ot 1 e and the fisheries yield measured by weight can be expressed as 11 y t w o s u m b n t ot 1 e where denotes hadamard product among different vectors 2 4 model analyses to observe the dynamical properties of our theoretical frameworks we solve the analytical solutions of the system our analytical results suggest that population densities under each harvesting strategy i e reserve only and no reserve ones have two solutions including the zero solution and the non zero solution eq b 5 eq b 6 eq b 13 eq b 14 eq b 22 eq b 23 eq b 25 and eq b 26 in appendix b moreover the solution is global stable however the underlying conditions eq b 9 eq b10 eq b17 and eq b18 in appendix b indicate that the two solutions cannot be stable simultaneously which suggests that population can avoid the risk of collapse once marine reserve size or the escapement rate is large enough to surpass the threshold values of the constraint conditions with population density at equilibrium we achieve fisheries yields and analyses with derivative approach suggests that fisheries yields can increase or decrease in response to various parameters regardless of fisheries management strategies therefore fisheries yields harvested under reserve only strategy can be higher or lower than fisheries yields harvested under no reserve strategy section 2 in appendix b 3 materials and methods 3 1 initial conditions the system starts with the initial condition at a stable age distribution which is a suitable start point as suggested by previous research white et al 2013 to make a comparison the initial conditions are the same for both reserve only and no reserve models a stable age distribution suggests that older individuals are fewer in number because of mortality white et al 2013 supposing the number of the youngest adult individuals is r recruitment then the number of older individuals can be predicted according to adult survivorship and individual escapement rate from harvesting thus the initial individual density in each age class is calculated based on the discrete time formula n0 r se a where n0 is the initial density for both reserve only and no reserve strategies note that we use the critical escapement rate e here because of the necessity of considering the persistence of bycatch species with these initial conditions we can investigate the cases under which initial density is very low because the total system is heavily overfished prior to the implementation of either catch limits or establishing spatial closures such as marine reserves in the system to explore the generality of the system we also perform simulations under initial conditions with stochastic normal distribution using the function normrnd in matlab r2013b random initial density for both reserve only and no reserve strategies are produced by a normal distribution with mean of 500 and standard deviation of 2 3 2 parameter settings the parameter values for simulations come from previous researches hagerman 1952 hunter et al 1990 white et al 2013 hastings et al 2017 kaplan et al 2019 chen 2020 which are highly relevant to the target and bycatch species studied here we use the average values if these parameters are different between male and female individuals for example the maximum length is 43 7 cm for male individuals and 47 4 cm for female individuals hagerman 1952 hunter et al 1990 and thus the average value of maximum length l m is 43 7 47 4 2 45 55 cm likewise a 0 5 10 years male 4 7 years female 5 5 years d 2 96 male 2 95 female 2 97 p 2 41 10 4 male 0 000244 female 0 0002389 w 2 96 male 2 95 female 2 97 k 0 087 male 0 089 female 0 085 and the maximum age is 50 years coefficient q is regulated to maintain a positive growth rate research on the fisheries of dover sole shows that most of the catch is composed of fish 8 to 12 years of age hagerman 1952 thus we set parameter values of minimum fishing age ae around the range of 8 to 12 years specifically we set ae 8 11 12 14 years respectively similarly a previous survey shows that dover sole longer than 40 0 cm approach maximum length l m 45 55 cm may be any age from 8 to 40 or 50 years hunter et al 1990 thus we set parameter values of age at maturity am as 8 17 18 20 21 25 years respectively to extend the parameter space extreme cases are considered in addition to the parameter range for most of the catch thus we study the extreme case that am 0 and ae 0 which suggests that fish individuals achieve maturity and are harvested in the first year parameter settings about the life histories of both target and bycatch species can be seen in table s1 in appendix a which derives from empirical data from the stock assessment of pacific coast groundfish fishery the pacific fishery management council 2016 these parameters are used to study the same target species but different bycatch species in fisheries management hastings et al 2017 to insight into different bycatch species seven situations are separated to be convenient we numbered them as situations 1 7 see table s1 in appendix a among which situations 1 3 are hypothetical cases and denote three situations under which the hypothetical target species are the same while the hypothetical bycatch species are different according to their life histories such as adult survivorship and fecundity situations 4 7 are empirical cases of the us west coast groundfish fishery and denote four situations under which they have the same target species dover sole microstomus pacificus but different bycatch species bocaccio situation 4 darkblotched rockfish situation 5 pacific ocean perch situation 6 and yelloweye rockfish situation 7 the beverton holt functional form is f n α β n β n chen 2020 where α and β denote the proliferation rate per generation and carrying capacity respectively the parameter values of α and β are estimated based on standard formulae see eq 18 and eq 19 in hastings et al 2017 and the relevant empirical data the pacific fishery management council 2016 subsequently with life history parameters the critical reserve size c and the critical escapement rate e are calculated based on eq 1 and eq 6 in addition parameter r is set as 500 to calculate initial density to be clear parameter values used in each figure and the relationships among figures can be seen in table s2 in appendix a in summary we use selected parameter combinations that guaranteed the persistence of the bycatch species to explore the life history parameter space for the target species under two different fisheries management strategies 3 3 simulations with both reserve only and no reserve models we first simulate the transient dynamics of the population density and fisheries yields of the target species second we explore the effect of life histories of both target and bycatch species on fisheries yields under different measurement metrics specifically for target species we directly explore the effect of age at maturity am minimum fishing age ae adult survivorship s for bycatch species we study the effect of critical reserve size c and critical escapement rate e which is used to predict the life histories of bycatch species so as to indirectly explore their effect on fisheries yields further we explore the effect of life histories on transient metric θ which determines the amplitude of transient oscillations and measures how close the initial system state is to the final equilibrium state white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 to calculate transient metric θ we transform both reserve only and no reserve models into identical cases so that population density at time t depends on matrix a and a in addition to the corresponding population density at time t 1 see details in section 2 in appendix a under reserve only strategy transient metric θ 1 is calculated based on the angle between initial population density inside the marine reserve n 0 r at time t 0 and the dominant right eigenvector w 1 of a 12 θ 1 arccos n 0 r w 1 n 0 r w 1 where the small dot means dot product and double vertical bars denote vector norms similarly transient metric θ 2 under no reserve strategy is calculated based on the angle between initial population density n 0 o and the dominant right eigenvector m1 of a 13 θ 2 arccos n 0 o m 1 n 0 o m 1 with eq 12 and eq 13 we perform sensitivity analyses with function norm and eig in matlab r2013b see details in the code in appendix d to achieve robust conclusions all the analyses are performed at different simulation time points to observe the robustness of our results we also use statistical methods to investigate the simulation results in response to different parameter spaces specifically we calculate the average values of fisheries yields as well as transient metric under different gradients of age at maturity am and minimum fishing age ae we then study the effect of each model parameter on these average values meanwhile we perform regression analysis to observe the relationships between influencing factors age at maturity minimum fishing age and fisheries yields harvested under critical reserve size and critical escapement rate to maintain bycatch species persistence for each gradient of age at maturity and minimum fishing age we calculate the mean and maximum values of fisheries yields among the variation range of critical reserve size and critical escapement rate regression analyses are performed with the function trendline in the r package basictrendline in addition to make a comparison and observe the effect of age structure we also simulate the transient dynamics of target species using models without age structure hastings et al 2017 the models without age structure derive from the two extreme cases in previous research hastings et al 2017 which denotes two different harvesting strategies i e reserve only and no reserve strategies we use the models without age structure to perform simulations with the same parameter values except for the value of reserve size and escapement rate and the same random initial conditions as that in previous research in transient analyses chen 2020 all simulation analyses are performed in matlab r2013b except for the regression analysis 4 results under the persistence of bycatch species our results show that transient oscillations can in some cases occur in population density fig 2 a d g fisheries yields measured by number fig 2b e h and fisheries yields measured by weight fig 2c f i furthermore if fisheries yields are measured by number the yields observed from the reserve only method are always higher than those from the no reserve method fig 2b e h however if fisheries yields are measured by weight fig 2c f i the yields produced in the reserve only model can be higher fig 2i or lower fig 2c than the yields produced in the no reserve model with appropriate empirical parameter settings moreover even with the same parameter settings in some cases it is difficult to determine which fisheries management method can achieve higher yields and ensure the persistence of bycatch species as the transient oscillations lead to higher and lower fisheries yields under reserve only management than under no reserve management at various times fig 2f the parameter values derive from a specific scenario of the empirical cases in the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa in which the bycatch species is yelloweye rockfish i e situation 7 in table s1 in appendix a however the yield comparison results that yields from reserve only approach can be higher or lower than that from no reserve approach are robust among other different bycatch species including bocaccio situation 4 darkblotched rockfish situation 5 and pacific ocean perch situation 6 fig s2 in appendix a the results are also robust when simulations are performed under stochastic initial conditions fig s1 in appendix c regardless of variations in influential life history characteristics e g age at maturity minimum fishing age and adult survivorship for the target species when yields are measured by the number of fish caught our model ensuring the persistence of bycatch species suggests that the reserve only management method results in higher fisheries yields than the no reserve method fig 3 a c however the advantages of the different management approaches vary according to the influencing factors if fisheries yields are measured on the basis of weight fig 3d f specifically for target species with a younger age at maturity younger minimum fishing age and higher adult survivorship higher yields are observed with the no reserve management method than with the reserve only management method in contrast higher fisheries yields are observed in the reserve only method than in the no reserve method when target species have the opposite life history characteristics these results that fisheries management strategies depend on both yield measurement metrics and life histories are robust among different bycatch species shown in different colours in fig 3 and at different simulation time points figs s3 and s4 in appendix a as well as different combinations of age at maturity and minimum fishing age figs s5 s8 in appendix a and the average value of fisheries yields among these parameter gradients fig s2 in appendix c our results ensuring the persistence of bycatch species also robustly show that critical reserve size and escapement rate can regulate fisheries yields of the target species with different management strategies fig 4 figs s9 s14 in appendix a fig s3 in appendix c for example the yields measured according to both number and weight are always higher with the no reserve method than with the reserve only method if the critical value of the reserve size for maintaining bycatch species persistence in the reserve only model is equal to the critical value of the escapement rate in the no reserve model when age at maturity am and minimum fishing age ae are young fig 4 however the fisheries yield is higher under reserve only management than under no reserve management in two cases i the critical reserve size is small but not too small say 0 1 and the critical escapement rate is very large say 0 95 ii age at maturity am and minimum fishing age ae are old fig 4 figs s9 s14 in appendix a figs s6 s7 in appendix c this finding suggests that in general the critical reserve size in the reserve only model and the critical escapement rate in the no reserve model can greatly influence the relative yield advantages of the two fisheries management methods i e they can determine which method can achieve higher fisheries yields this is important because the critical values of both reserve size and escapement rate are linked to the life history characteristics of the bycatch species that are associated with population persistence condition sensitivity analyses ensuring the persistence of bycatch species show that the transient metric θ generally oscillates and exhibits strong periodicity with variation in the influencing factors i e age at maturity minimum fishing age and adult survivorship fig 5 figs s15 s18 in appendix a fig s4 in appendix c this finding shows that the trajectories of the system are temporarily and periodically close to a stable state thus the amplitude of the oscillations in the population dynamics decreases or increases periodically based on the life history characteristics of the target species such as age at maturity minimum fishing age and adult survivorship in addition the critical reserve size generally does not affect transient metrics while critical escapement rate can greatly regulate transient metrics fig 6 figs s19 s21 in appendix a fig s5 in appendix c 5 discussion marine reserves are important in fisheries management mangel 2000 edgar et al 2014 herrera et al 2016 by ensuring the persistence of bycatch species and modeling the transient dynamics of two species systems rather than assuming an asymptotic equilibrium state our findings suggest that fisheries management strategies that rely only on the establishment of marine reserves without implementing fishing effort control cannot always be the optimal method to improve the fisheries yields of the target species as well as maintain bycatch species persistence whether management approaches involving the implementation of marine reserves result in higher fisheries yields of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species than those under traditional nonspatial strategies in which harvesting effort is controlled depends on the yield measurement metrics and the life history characteristics of both the target and bycatch species if fisheries yields of the target species are measured by fish individual numbers the establishment of a marine reserve could be a primary fisheries management strategy especially for the us west coast groundfish fishery hastings et al 2017 nickols et al 2019 chen 2020 if fisheries yields of the target species are instead measured by weight thus considering differences in both the fecundity and biomass of individuals of different ages in the theoretical framework kaplan et al 2019 traditional harvesting control strategies will not always be absolutely disadvantaged in fisheries management relative to strategies with the implementation of marine reserves to achieve the goals of both improving fisheries yields and maintaining species persistence the effect of the yield measurement method on fisheries management strategies is related to the age structure of the harvested individuals management strategies based on marine reserves allow for the harvesting of only relatively young adults each year because all the adult individuals in the harvested area originate from larvae that have dispersed from the marine reserve whereas those based on controlling harvesting efforts lead to the harvest of relatively old relatively heavy adults thus the use of the weight based measurement approach benefits traditional fisheries management strategies in terms of improving the yield of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species our results suggest that choosing appropriate measurement metrics results in correct estimations in the optimal harvesting strategies which has important implications in fisheries adaptive management ensuring the persistence of bycatch species for a natural system ensuring the persistence of bycatch species fisheries yields of the target species should be measured by weight to make the right decisions in fisheries management if the target species are long lived and have prominent age structures in such a case yield measurement metrics with weight could be applied to commercial fisheries in which much attention has been paid to fish biomass on the contrary fisheries yields of the target species should be measured by numbers when the target species in the given system have uniform body size and age and the effect of density on transient population dynamics overwhelms the effect of age structure in such a case yield measurement metrics with numbers could be applied to recreational fisheries which are often regulated through daily bag limits our findings also demonstrate that the increase in yield under the different fisheries management strategies ensuring the persistence of bycatch species depends on the life history characteristics of both the target and bycatch species first with our simulation analyses among different bycatch species shown in different colours in fig 3 and at different simulation time points figs s3 and s4 in appendix a as well as different combinations of age at maturity and minimum fishing age figs s5 s8 in appendix a we can achieve a general conclusion when reserves are not used higher yields will be observed if the target species have a young age at maturity or high adult survivorship than if they have an old age at maturity or low adult survivorship second the life history characteristics of the bycatch species can be used to predict the relative yield advantages of the two fisheries management strategies by establishing the critical reserve size and escapement rate to maintain bycatch species persistence the relationships between life history characteristics of bycatch species and critical reserve size and escapement rate can be shown in eq 1 and eq 6 for example if the critical reserve size is 0 1 and the critical escapement rate is 0 95 reserve only strategies can result in higher fisheries yields than no reserve strategies fig 4 figs s9 s14 in appendix a and the corresponding life history characteristics of the bycatch species can be predicted based on eq 1 and eq 6 when one life history parameter is fixed e g adult survivorship and fecundity can be determined by controlling the proliferation rate per generation in contrast solving eqs 1 and 6 with the assumption that the critical reserve size equals the critical escapement rate can predict bycatch species life history characteristics which lead to higher fisheries yields under the no reserve strategy than under the reserve only strategy on condition that both age at maturity and minimum fishing age are very young fig 4 in such a case even if the bycatch species are long lived and have low fecundity thus reflecting the advantages of marine reserves in an equilibrium state according to a previous model hastings et al 2017 reserves cannot ensure simultaneous benefits in fisheries production and conservation in transient time scales therefore the suggestions our results can provide in fisheries management are that optimal harvesting strategies considering the persistence of bycatch species in a given natural system should match the corresponding life histories of both the target and bycatch species in that system life history characteristics can also be used to predict the amplitude of the transient oscillations thus influencing the choice between the two fisheries management strategies in terms of yield of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species furthermore pronounced oscillations would result in fluctuations in yield that would complicate any attempt to make this choice and predictable decisions need transient oscillations that are low in amplitude the periodic relationship between the transient metric θ which influences the amplitude of transient oscillations white et al 2013 kaplan et al 2019 chen 2020 and life history parameters of both the target and bycatch species fig 5 suggests that our theoretical frameworks have important practical applications because they can be used to estimate whether we could achieve stable fisheries yields in a certain system in transient time scales based on the life histories which are parameters that relatively easy to achieve in empirical experiments by considering the effect of age structure our results show that it is misleading to either choose traditional fishing effort control or the implementation of marine reserve alone without catch limits as the exclusive fisheries management strategy ensuring the persistence of bycatch species under various situations such as different life histories and measurement methods when age structure is not considered our further transient analysis studying independently two fisheries strategies of catch limits and establishing marine reserves which means either marine reserve size or escapement rate is always zero of previous models which are used for equilibrium analyses in previous research hastings et al 2017 and for transient analyses of fisheries strategies with the combination of catch limits and establishing marine reserves in chen 2020 suggests that management strategies based on marine reserves can result in higher or lower fisheries yields than traditional fisheries strategies depending on different bycatch species fig s1b d f in appendix a especially when adult survivorship is very high the advantages of traditional management strategies i e those without reserves relative to strategies with establishing marine reserves are strengthened as shown in our analyses fig s1h j l and n in appendix a therefore in some cases the traditional no reserve approach can provide higher fisheries yields than that with reserve only approach however previous equilibrium studies emphasize the important role of marine reserves in improving fisheries yields hastings et al 2017 the underlying explainations for the different results are that the equilibrium analyses hastings et al 2017 make a comparison between fisheries strategy of traditional nonspatial approaches alone and fisheries strategy of establishing marine reserves with the appropriate choice of escapement outside the reserve therefore on one hand the equilibrium analyses show the necessity of establishing spatial closures in fisheries management on the other hand it suggests the joint effect of combining both spatial closure approach and traditional nonspatial approach however our results without age structure make a comparison between two fisheries strategies independently which does not have a joint effect in comparison with the age structured model we developed here results of models without age structure suggest that generally fisheries management strategies depend on life histories but do not depend on yield measurement metrics because the constant linear relationship between fisheries yields measured by weight and by number can cause the same variation trends in addition unlike our theoretical frameworks with age structure our results of the models without age structure generally did not show very obvious transient phenomena among different parameter settings fig s1 in appendix a which is consistent with previous conclusions that transient dynamics are difficult to observe in models without age structure white et al 2013 chen 2020 the underlying mechanism is that the inclusion of age structure often leads to high dimensional models which have been suggested to be the main mechanism associated with transient dynamics hastings et al 2018 morozov et al 2020 previous investigations of the transient dynamics of fish abundance following the establishment of marine reserves have indicated that the transient metric θ generally increases with increasing age at maturity and decreases with an increase in natural mortality white et al 2013 however our sensitivity analyses ensuring the persistence of bycatch species indicate that the transient metric θ generally increases and decreases periodically with variations in both age at maturity and adult survivorship fig 5 figs s15 s18 in appendix a this discrepancy should arise from the fact that in the previous study white et al 2013 the transient response of linear models was considered with leslie matrices while we use a nonlinear model thus in our study ensuring the persistence of bycatch species the eigenvalues of matrix a and a vary with population density section 2 in appendix a these results suggest that considering the nonlinear effect of larval survival to adults will increase the difficulty of investigating transient dynamics as predictability varies periodically in response to life history characteristics thus increasing the difficulty in determining which fisheries management strategy the reserve only vs no reserve approach is best our conclusions are suitable for fisheries management ensuring the persistence of bycatch species in the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa with the pacific coast groundfish fishery management plan fmp more than 100 stocks are managed the pacific fishery management council 2016 among which species including bocaccio darkblotched rockfish pacific ocean perch and yelloweye rockfish are overfished and face high extinction risk our results have shown that fisheries strategy in improving yields of the target species and ensuring the persistence of bycatch species depends on the life histories in general for specific species we studied both the target species dover sole and four bycatch species in the west coast groundfish fishery in the usa the adult survivorship is relatively high 0 8 see table s1 in appendix a and thus our results suggest that strategy without reserve for species we studied in the west coast groundfish fishery may achieve higher fisheries yields as well as ensure bycatch persistence if yield measurement metric is weight while strategy with reserve is better if yield measurement metric is number with a suitable choice of minimum fishing age fig 3 figs s3 s8 in appendix a to extend our theoretical frameworks to more general cases we performed further analyses with hypothetical parameter values suggested in previous studies hastings et al 2017 similar results that fisheries management strategies depend on yield measurement metrics as well as the life histories of both the target and bycatch species were observed in the hypothetical cases figs s22 30 in appendix a which supports the generality of our theoretical framework although generally similar trends were observed between the empirical and hypothetical cases the specific details differ for example in the empirical cases the effects of the life history characteristics of the target species on fisheries management methods are very similar among different weak species nevertheless in the hypothetical cases the effects of age at maturity and minimum fishing age on both kinds of fisheries yields measured by weight and by number are more complex among different weak species than those in the empirical cases that is fisheries yields achieved under the reserve only method may be higher or lower than those achieved under the no reserve method for different bycatch species figs s23 s25 in appendix a the differences between the hypothetical and empirical cases occur because adult survivorship in the hypothetical cases is very low while it is very high in the empirical cases as shown in the parameter settings hastings et al 2017 chen 2020 thus the age at maturity and minimum fishing age must be within certain limits in the hypothetical cases otherwise the target species cannot persist our study is based on the scorched earth assumption malvadkar and hastings 2008 edwards et al 2010 for fisheries management with reserve only strategy which does not consider the effects of economic costs on fisheries sanchirico et al 2006 white et al 2008 if the effects of economic costs are considered capturing all the adults in the harvesting area i e the scorched earth assumption can lead to high costs because catchability decreases with decreasing population density in natural systems in such a case the costs associated with reserve only management strategies will be relatively high and this approach may not be the best choice in addition we ignore the age structure of the bycatch species so that the persistence conditions are easy to achieve considering the age structure of the bycatch species can lead to high dimensional models and highly complex persistence conditions thus requiring new analytical and simulation approaches however if further new theoretical frameworks are still based on the assumption that there are no ecological connections between the target and bycatch species then similar conclusions may be obtained even when the effect of the age structure of the bycatch species is considered future studies should explore the different connections between the target and bycatch species e g predator prey or competitive relationships to greatly regulate the population density of both species frid and marliave 2010 aalto and baskett 2013 which will help us in predicting higher fisheries yields under different fisheries management strategies while maintaining bycatch species persistent at transient timescales table 1 author

24479,the patagonian fjords of southern chile are one of the largest and least studied estuarine regions in the world its water bodies display a wide range in hydrodynamic and biogeochemical behavior a function of diverse morphology bathymetry and range of inputs from continental runoff numerical models which are an essential tool in understanding the potential impacts of human or climate driven perturbations on complex ecosystems have not been applied in this zone we present a novel model for simulating ecological processes in data sparse marine water bodies as a trade off between model complexity and parsimony based on a two layer description of the water column the upper layer represents the euphotic zone where a npzd model nutrients phytoplankton zooplankton detritus is used to simulate the dynamics of a mass conserving pelagic food web intense wind driven water column mixing inducing an upward flux of nutrients that boosts high rates of primary production is described by a time dependent gaussian pulse mass losses due to detritus sinking are also included the ecosystem dynamics are represented by an externally forced non autonomous system of ordinary differential equations characterized by strictly positive trajectories this system is no longer mass conserving therefore a structure preserving time integrator based on a splitting composition technique was customized for solving the system s equations it is cast as a three step algorithm and provides an exact estimation of biomass fluxes in the first step a modified patankar runge kutta scheme burchard et al 2003 is used to solve the unforced npzd system the second and third steps consider the effects of nutrient pulse and sinking detritus finally genetic algorithms are used for model calibration with the proposed model applied to previous published observations on an unusual winter bloom of dinoflagellates in an austral fjord montero et al 2017 optimal parameters characterizing the biomass fluxes during the bloom were determined as well as the time scales and mass volume associated with primary production to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to model

stratification of the water column schneider et al 2014 into two basic layers i a lower salinity 11 31 psu upper layer 5 10 m depth sievers 2008 and ii a lower layer of nutrient rich waters presenting a more uniform salinity pérez santos et al 2014 despite their common characteristics every water body displays a unique hydrodynamic behavior castillo and valenzuela 2008 ross et al 2015 determined by the local environmental conditions which has enormous effects on the ecosystem dynamics castro et al 2011 from the biogeochemical point of view pfa remains one of the least studied zones of the world strub et al 1998 escribano et al 2003 it represents a highly complex marine terrestrial atmospheric interactions that may result in high biological production iriarte et al 2007 involving the exchange of large amounts of matter and energy between terrestrial and maritime ecosystems castillo et al 2016 the pfa is also a crucial source of ecosystem services in particular a world class industry of aquaculture has developed in some areas becoming the key promoter of social and economic development outeiro and villasante 2013 ensuring the sustainability of aquaculture has become a worldwide issue barton and flysand 2010 since the industry ecosystem interactions are poorly known paving the way for public policies that sometimes underestimate the environmental effects of human activities hosono et al 2016 buschmann et al 2009 moreover the current climate change scenario has become an extra source of uncertainty for understanding pfa ecosystem dynamics iriarte et al 2014 torres et al 2014 lafon et al 2014 only recently has the chilean government developed a research program in the area silva and palma 2008 although data collected to date have provided valuable information a knowledge gap about the ecosystem dynamics of fjords and channels remains a major obstacle for the ecosystem based management of the zone iriarte et al 2010 mathematical modeling offers a way to synthesize our understanding of the fjords ecosystem dynamics and to study its changes under human or climate related perturbations tett et al 2011 it necessitates the integration of physics chemistry and biology on the one hand specific computer codes have been developed for the ecosystem s hydrodynamic component see for example delandmeter et al 2015 gillibrand et al 2013 dalsøren et al 2020 uriarte et al 2014 to name a few applications on the other hand the biogeochemical component of the dynamics has been represented via the food web some models may be used as stand alone tools or may be coupled to hydrodynamic codes portilla et al 2009 burchard et al 2006 fennel and neumann 2004 tett et al 2003 numerical models depend on a set of parameters that need to be calibrated to fit experimental data fennel et al 2001 the calibration process is a complex task rückelt et al 2010 since very often the parametric space presents multiple sub optimal regions charbonneau and knapp 1995 and the dynamics turn out to be highly sensitive to small perturbations of select parameters heinle and slawig 2013a oschlies and garçon 1999 several methodologies have been developed for parameter optimization heinle and slawig 2013c such as genetic algorithms sivanandam and deepa 2008 bayesian methods arhonditsis et al 2007 and analytical methods schartau et al 2017 the numerical methods chosen to solve the model s equations also play a fundamental role in reproducing as many as possible of the ecosystem s specific features a modern perspective requires the methods to be capable of reproducing the so called dynamical invariants of the system hairer et al 2006 iv along with the geometric structure of the solution trajectories such as being strictly positive heinle and slawig 2013b zhang and wang 2012 methods of this type are called structure preserving and some examples can be found in e g broekhuizen et al 2008 edwards 2006 kopecz and meister 2018 schippmann and burchard 2011 and burchard et al 2005 the application of computational tools for simulating the dynamics of pfa s ecosystems represents both a research challenge and opportunity the main goal of this article is to develop a mathematical model and a structure preserving numerical method for computer simulation of biogeochemical processes in the euphotic zone of semi enclosed marine water bodies the proposed model represents a tradeoff between complexity and applicability since the sparsity of field data is an impediment to the development of more sophisticated models in the pfa the structure preserving properties of the model allow the formulation of a robust methodology for the parameters calibration in a wide variety of ecological scenarios the model is based on a two layer description of a representative volume of the marine environment where an embedded biogeochemical model of npzd type 1 1 a biogeochemical model of npzd type considers four functional groups nutrients n phytoplankton p zooplankton z and detritus d fennel and neumann 2004 fasham et al 1990 heinle and slawig 2013b oschlies and garçon 1999 is used to represent the trophic web an upward flux of nutrients influences primary production while mass losses are considered through detrital rain despite its relative simplicity a careful design of the time integration method ensures that the discrete approximations to the solution trajectories are strictly positive as are their continuous counterparts moreover the method produces precise estimations of biomass flux additionally the model was coupled to a genetic algorithm to develop a robust parameter estimation procedure it is worth mentioning that the proposed model could be easily adapted to represent other trophic webs and that may be potentially applied to more general marine or lake areas finally the proposed model is applied to an unusual and intense bloom of dinoflagellates documented in the puyuhuapi channel during the winter of 2015 located in the northern zone of the pfa montero et al 2017 see fig 1 b and c among other consequences algal blooms threaten the sustainability of the aquaculture industry díaz et al 2019 experimental data is used to define both the physical forcing factors and model initial conditions the model calibration is carried out with a genetic algorithm that provides optimal parameters characterizing the biomass fluxes through the food web during the algal bloom the calibrated model was employed to identify the time scales associated with primary production during the bloom and to assess the level of biomass introduced in the marine environment to the best of the authors knowledge this case study constitutes the first attempt to model biogeochemical processes in marine ecosystems of this region 2 model formulation this section is devoted to the formulation of a mathematical model capable of describing basic ecological processes in the water bodies of the pfa it is based on the photosynthetic conversion of a nutrient pulse into biomass in the euphotic zone and its subsequent transfer of biomass to higher trophic levels within a simplified food web mass losses due to sinking are also considered 2 1 conceptual model we consider a box model composed of two layers the first layer l 1 represents 1 m 2 of the sea surface with a depth corresponding to that of the euphotic zone at the location of interest we assume that all the biogeochemical processes affecting primary production as well as biomass fluxes through the food web occur in this layer the second layer l 2 is considerably deeper and its physical and biological properties remain constant the influence of temperature or salinity is considered negligible see fig 2 and section 5 for an application example the first layer is characterized by an initial concentration of nitrate no 3 that is measured in mmol n m 3 and is denoted by n 0 it corresponds to the nutrient content at time t 0 the deeper layer is assumed to have a nutrient content n 2 0 n 0 yielding a stratified configuration typically observed in estuarine systems see fig 2 a buoyancy forces associated with stratification tend to compete with turbulent diffusion creating a barrier for the upward input of nutrients from l 2 into l 1 burchard and hofmeister 2008 intense fluctuations of environmental factors such as wind contribute decisively to the water column mixing introducing nutrient pulses into the euphotic zone and under appropriate conditions of light availability boosting the phytoplankton production p montero et al 2017 see fig 2 b in this way a detailed description of the hydrodynamics is avoided moreover we assume that primary production does not depend on other limiting factors such as silicate or phosphorus later on the stratified configuration is recovered due to freshwater discharges as shown in fig 2 c increases in zooplankton biomass z occur due to grazing of p evidencing the flow of biomass through the food web both functional groups comprise a huge number of different species belonging to a wide range of morphological scales along with complex interactions among them ward et al 2014 we attempt to simplify such complexity reducing those interactions to a biomass flux among p and z moreover both p and z experience losses due to mortality contributing to the accumulation of dissolved d o m and particulate p o m organic matter which is treated here as detritus d the following fluxes complete the biogeochemical cycle in l 1 i the conversion of z to d due to excretion ii the conversion of d to n due to remineralization and iii the vertical sinking of d to l 2 some noteworthy properties of the model are as follows 1 mass balance initially the total biomass in the upper layer is equal to the sum of n 0 p 0 z 0 and d 0 measured in equivalent units see e g section 5 2 4 this quantity remains invariant for isolated systems on the contrary under external forcing the total biomass is going to depend on the balance between nutrient inputs minus detritus losses due to sinking 2 positive system we identify the time evolution of the four functional groups with time dependent functions describing the ecosystem dynamics thus it is clear that n t n t p t z t and d t must remain greater or equal to zero for any t r 0 since negative values are unrealistic systems with this property are called positive systems or positively preserving systems burchard et al 2003 2 2 mathematical model we built a mathematical model as an adaptation of the n p z d model oschlies and garçon 1999 oschlies et al 2000 heinle and slawig 2013c b by assuming that under no external forcing the dynamics in l 1 are given by the solution to an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations odes describing the conversion of nutrients into phytoplankton and the subsequent flow of biomass through the food web fig 3 the input of nutrients into l 1 is considered as a time dependent function added to the right hand side r h s of the balance equation for n therefore the new system of odes becomes non autonomous i e time dependent the detritus sinking to l 2 is taken into account through an extra function on the r h s of the balance equation for d following are detailed explanations then the time evolution of the ecosystem is represented by a trajectory of the form 1 z 0 t r 4 where the vector of state variables is given by z t n t p t z t d t for any time t belonging to the time interval of interest 0 t for sake of consistency all the state variables are expressed in mmol n m 3 specific methods to convert p z and d to the nutrient unit are given in section 5 2 2 1 autonomous npzd system first we consider i n t 0 and i d t 0 in fig 3 in this case the dynamics in l 1 are described by the following system of odes 2a d z t d t f a z t θ subjected to initial conditions z 0 n 0 p 0 z 0 d 0 in the above equation the four components of the flux vector f a are given by 2b f a i z θ j 1 4 p i j z θ d i j z θ i 1 4 where p z θ and d p t are the so called production and destruction matrices respectively and θ is a vector collecting the model parameters as explained below even though the format used in eqs 2a and 2b is unusual it adheres to practical considerations production destruction systems encompass a wide range of positive systems in several areas of science burchard et al 2003 all of them can be expressed in the above format allowing the model to be applied to other trophic web representations moreover structure preserving methods for such systems have received considerable attention in recent literature kopecz and meister 2018 in this work we consider 2c p z θ 0 0 ϕ z z γ m d j n i p 0 0 0 0 g ε g p z 0 0 0 ϕ p p 1 β g ε g p z ϕ z z 2 0 where the growth rate of phytoplankton is given by j n i μ m n k n n i k i i i is the light availability that is further explained in section 5 2 and μ m is a growth factor that imposes an upper bound on the rate of conversion of n into p moreover in 2c a holling type iii function fasham et al 1990 is used for the zooplankton grazing ratio g ε g p according to 2d g ε g p g ε p 2 g ε p 2 where ε and g are positive constants the other parameters appearing in 2c are summarized in table 1 where their definitions units of measure and range of admissible values are specified we collect them in the following vector 2e θ k n k i μ m ϕ z ϕ z ϕ p γ m β ε g κ the behavior of the model strongly depends on the values in θ heinle and slawig 2013a and section 4 is devoted to its calibration regarding the geometric structure of solutions the mathematical model inherits the conservation properties of its conceptual counterpart namely 1 mass conservation the total mass of the system remains invariant since 2f 0 d n d t d p d t d z d t d d d t where eqs 2b and 2c have been taken into account 2 positive system this property means that if system 2a is subjected to positive initial conditions then n t 0 p t 0 z t 0 and d t 0 for all t 0 t a proof of this property for dynamical systems in production destruction form can be found in burchard et al 2003 1 the numerical method proposed in section 3 is designed to exactly preserve these properties 2 2 2 nutrient input the nutrient input in l 1 is considered by modifying the balance equation for n in 2a according to 3a d n d t j n i p ϕ z z γ m d i n t where the pulse of nutrients i n t is given by the gaussian function 3b i n t a exp t b 2 2 c 2 and a b c are positive scalars controlling the pulse amplitude position and width respectively guidelines for their estimation are given in section 5 2 2 2 3 detritus sinking following heinle and slawig 2013c we consider the precipitation of d from l 1 to l 2 this process is particularly important if a long term characterization of the ecosystem dynamics is required then the r h s of the balance equation for d is modified according to 4a d d d t ϕ p p 1 β g ε g p z ϕ z z 2 γ m d i d z θ where 4b i d z t θ κ d t d if d t d 0 otherwise is a flux term that governs detritus sinking in the above equation d provides a lower bound for detritus concentration and κ 0 is an extra parameter appropriate values for d and κ are problem dependent as discussed in section 5 2 2 2 4 conservation properties in summary the dynamics of the externally forced two layer model is given by 5a d z t d t f a z t θ f b t f c z t θ where f a was given in 2b 2c and f b and f c correspond to 5b f b t i n t 0 0 0 and f c z t θ 0 0 0 i d z t θ the geometric properties of the flow are as follows 1 positive system assuming d 0 two situations arise i if d t d then n t 0 for all t since 3b shows that i n t 0 thus 3a holds and ii if d t d 4b shows that an exponential decay of detritus occurs until 0 d t d therefore both i n and i d preserve the positive character of the solutions 2 mass balance repeating 2f for 5a it is possible to see that 5c d n d t d p d t d z d t d d d t i n t if d t d i n t κ d t d otherwise which shows that total mass is no longer invariant but instead it can be computed from the balance between nutrient input and detritus sinking 3 numerical method structure preserving methods have gained considerable attention in computational biogeochemistry because of their superior performance in numerical simulations burchard et al 2003 kopecz and meister 2018 in our case it is reduced to constructing a method capable of ensuring positive solutions along with the exact balance of mass 5c to this end we consider a partition of 0 t characterized by an integer n 1 and a sequence t n n 0 n of real numbers such that 0 t 0 t n t n t and where h t n 1 t n is a constant time step then we apply an operator splitting method hairer et al 2006 the splitting technique treats mass conserving processes separately from those that are not the system 5a is split into the following simpler systems 6a d z d t f a d z d t f b d z d t f c the first system corresponds to an autonomous mass conserving npzd system see 2a and 2b the second one takes into account the nutrient input from l 2 into l 1 and the third system considers biomass losses due to detritus sinking next we assume we know the maps φ a φ b φ c r 4 r 4 where φ a is a method that approximates the exact solution of the first system in 6a and the same applies to φ b and φ c according to hairer et al 2006 given an initial condition z 0 we find that 6b φ z 0 φ c φ b φ a z 0 is a first order approximation to the solution of 5a at time t h or in other words φ z 0 z h o h 2 in the above equation φ b φ a stands for the composition of maps higher order methods can be formulated as described in strang 1969 in the following we provide explicit expressions for the methods φ a φ b and φ c 3 1 autonomous npzd system φ a the modified patankar runge kutta mprk method is applied to approximate the solutions of the first system in 6a it is a second order unconditionally positive and conservative time integrator that belongs to a large class of methods originally presented in burchard et al 2003 and generalized in kopecz and meister 2018 given z n z t n the mprk method determines z n 1 z t n 1 in two steps 7a z p ω z n 1 z n 7b z n 1 m z n z p 1 z n the solution procedure requires solving two linear systems thus avoiding iterative methods the values of ω z n are given by ω i i z 1 h z i j 1 4 d i j z i 1 4 ω i j z h z j p i j z i j 1 4 i j and m z n z p 1 2 ω z n ω z p the mprk method guarantees that for h 0 the following properties hold i if z k 0 then z k 1 0 this is a discrete version of positivity and ii for all k n 7c i 1 4 z i n 1 z i n 0 which corresponds to the discrete counterpart of the mass conservation formal proofs can be found in kopecz and meister 2018 3 2 nutrient pulse φ b the second system in 6a produces an exact solution due to the simple form of f b in 5b thus φ b maps p k to p k 1 p k z k to z k 1 z k d k to d k 1 d k and n k to 8 n t k 1 n k t k t k 1 i n s d s n k a c π 2 erf t k 1 b 2 c erf t k b 2 c where erf r 1 1 is the gauss error function 3 3 detritus sinking φ c the third system in 6a also produces an exact solution therefore in this case φ c maps n k to n k 1 n k p k to p k 1 p k z k to z k 1 z k and d k to 9 d k 1 d exp κ h d k d if d k d d k otherwise then at each time step the biomass loss due to detritus sinking is computed as d k d k 1 0 3 4 geometric properties of φ the geometric properties of the discrete flow generated by φ are as follows i discrete trajectories are strictly positive this property can be verified from the fact that φ φ c φ b φ a on the one hand φ a is strictly positive since it corresponds to the mprk method moreover the composition φ b φ a retains this property since φ b only adds a positive term to n k in 8 on the other hand the subsequent composition with φ c adds a positive term to d k in 9 only if d k d 0 ii mass balance the mprk method ensures the exact conservation of the total mass as indicated in 7c however the subsequent composition with φ b and φ c modifies this property according to 10 i 1 4 z i n 1 z i n d k d 1 e κ h 1 υ t k t k 1 if d k d υ t k t k 1 otherwise where υ t k t k 1 0 corresponds to the second term on the r h s of 8 the above expression provides a discrete version of the biomass balance it is exact since the terms appearing on the r h s of 10 are exactly computed in 8 and 9 4 model calibration as mentioned in section 2 2 1 the parameters collected in θ 2e determine the model behavior the ranges of their values are given in table 1 therefore any admissible θ belongs to the parameter space s r 7 0 1 r 3 finding θ s such that the model s output fits experimental data up to a certain precision is a non trivial task rückelt et al 2010 since s may be a large space involving multiple sub optimal regions sometimes intrinsic limitations in the model s ability to simulate the ecological processes explain the discrepancies with experimental observations additionally the model s behavior may be highly sensible to perturbations in some parameters in this section we introduce the so called genetic algorithms ga sivanandam and deepa 2008 for model calibration in the following we formally pose the optimization problem and then describe the ga methodology used in section 5 2 for an application problem of ecological significance in marine sciences 4 1 optimization problem given a set of observational data z t l l 1 l where z 1 t 1 corresponds to the nutrient content in l 1 measured experimentally at time t 1 and the same applies to the other components of z t at time instants t l l 1 l the model calibration is equivalent to finding θ s solving the following optimization problem 11a arg max θ s γ θ i 1 4 w i l 1 l z i t l z i l θ 2 where γ θ is the so called cost function and z l θ l 1 l corresponds to the numerical solution of 11b d z t d t f a z t θ f b t θ f c z t θ 11c z 0 z 0 using the method given in section 3 in the above equations z 0 is a vector with appropriate initial values of the state variables and w w j j 1 4 are positive scalars that take into account the relative weight of each component of z in the construction of the cost function we consider the condition i 1 4 w i 1 note that 1 γ θ in 11a is designed as the weighted sum of the differences between observed and computed data for each component in z for example w 0 3 0 5 0 1 0 1 will result in a set of parameters θ that provides reasonably good matches for n and p but not necessarily for z or d other options will unfortunately change θ therefore w needs to be specified based on a combination of knowledge and research goals kriest et al 2020 2 in general finding satisfactory parameters for marine ecological processes remains an open problem and only partial solutions are available in general θ will depend on the form of γ θ and even on hydrodynamics see e g kriest 2017 kriest et al 2017 mcdonald et al 2012 and vichi et al 2003 in sauerland et al 2019 the authors propose a multi objective optimization method that provides a set of compromise solutions addressing different research questions this approach could be applied in combination with ga by noting that γ θ r 1 4 γ r θ in 11a 3 the model reliability can be improved by restricting some of the θ i s according to θ i m i n θ i θ i m a x based on information coming from previous works heinle and slawig 2013c fennel et al 2001 or data from mesocosm experiments raveh et al 2019 gossiaux et al 2020 such a restrictions must be added to 11c in order to reduce uncertainty moreover specific methods are required to solve constrained optimization problems with genetic algorithms michalewicz and schoenauer 1996 coello 2002 4 2 genetic algorithm genetic algorithms for parameter optimization are heuristic search methods that mimic natural selection in the process the most fit individuals i e individuals better adapted to the environment are selected for producing offspring for the next generation of a breeding population evolution also requires the offspring to inherit at least some of the parent s superior characteristics heredity along with the existence of a fitness spectrum among population members variability see e g charbonneau and knapp 1995 and sivanandam and deepa 2008 for a thorough account of the subject the computer implementation of a ga requires defining i a cost function for optimization which corresponds to γ θ in 11a ii a population of individuals initially the set θ r r 1 n p is obtained from a random sampling of s every parameter vector θ p is encoded into x p using a 1 digit base 10 integers see charbonneau and knapp 1995 for details therefore the set x r r 1 n p corresponds with the initial population and every x r to an individual we denote the encoding of θ as x en θ the inverse operation i e the decoding of x as θ en 1 x iii a mechanism to select which individuals will reproduce essentially this process entails creating a ranking of individuals x 1 x n p based on their fitness γ en 1 x 1 γ en 1 x n p and assigning a mating probability p m j n p j 1 n p to x j individuals with a higher value of p m are more likely to be selected for reproduction iv a crossover procedure to produce the next generation of individuals this operation entails a stochastic procedure for determining which individual segments will be swapped during mating see sivanandam and deepa 2008 this procedure is applied only if a randomly generated number is less than the crossover rate p c r o s s 0 0 1 0 v a procedure to enforce the random mutation of some individuals in a new generation this procedure may modify the value of some entries in every x p of the population if a randomly generated number is less than the mutation rate p m u t 0 0 1 0 this value may be modified during the optimization vi a reproduction plan that determines which newly bred individuals are to be incorporated into the population we consider that the least fit individual x n p never survives for the next generation vii appropriate tolerances for convergence checking during the iterative computations a typical flowchart for ga algorithms appears in fig 4 among the advantages of ga are i they work well for both continuous and discrete cost functions ii they avoid computing derivatives iii they are reasonably efficient and fast iv their algorithmic structure allows both serial and parallel implementations v they provide approximate solutions even in the case of large parameter spaces however ga also suffer from some shortcomings i the cost function is frequently evaluated thus increasing the computational cost ii due to the probabilistic nature of the selection crossover and mutation processes the computation of a global optimum is not guaranteed and iii in some problems involving intricate parameter spaces the algorithm might stay iterating around local optima 5 numerical studies in this section the structure preserving properties of the proposed model are verified numerically moreover we tested the model s ability to simulate an unusual winter bloom of dinoflagellates that occurred in a semi enclosed channel of the pfa in 2015 montero et al 2017 those blooms have been reported as one of the possible consequences of climate change in the zone to this end a ga based calibration of the model is carried out considering in situ observational data additionally it is used to estimate the level of primary production and phytoplankton grazing rates along with the time scales associated with the biomass fluxes through the food web 5 1 model properties in sections 2 2 4 and 3 4 we show that the method generates positive trajectories and an exact mass balance in the following we verify numerically the second property since the first is an algebraic feature of the method initial conditions are given in the first column of table 2 the depth of the first layer is equal to 5 m and the function of light availability is explained in section 5 2 2 with model parameters shown in the second row of tables 3 and 4 two cases are considered i a set of nutrient pulses specified through the parameters a i i 1 4 15 0 18 0 21 0 24 0 b 0 5 and c 0 424 see 3b along with a sinking constant κ 0 0 and ii a single pulse a 21 0 b 0 5 and c 0 424 along with κ i i 1 4 0 000 0 025 0 050 0 100 the time evolution of the total biomass per unit volume is shown in fig 5 a and b for both cases in the first case we note that a i 1 a i 3 therefore the difference in total biomass per unit volume when the system is subjected to pulses characterized by a i 1 and a i is given by 12 δ n i n i 1 s i n i s d s a i 1 a i c 2 π 3 64 mmol n m 3 where the superscript i in i n i s denotes the dependence of the nutrient pulse on a i additionally since κ 0 no mass losses are expected to occur this behavior is shown in fig 5 a fig 5 b shows that the total biomass is exactly conserved for κ 0 0 however as κ increases higher rates of biomass loss are obtained due to detritus sinking 5 2 case study a winter bloom of dinoflagellates high rates of gross primary production and chlorophyll a concentration associated with an unusual winter bloom of dinoflagellates were reported at a fixed station in the puyuhuapi channel chilean patagonia 44 35 30 s 72 43 60 w in july 2015 montero et al 2017 see fig 1 the same study provides a detailed description of a winter sampling campaign july 10 16 2015 including hydrographic profiles and water samples from different depths additionally a nearby buoy was used to continuously record oceanographic and meteorological data according to montero et al 2017 4 the bloom was induced by intense winds that triggered the input of nutrients from deeper levels into the euphotic zone due to vertical mixing then the water column re stratified due to the freshwater discharges coming from the cisnes river in this scenario and despite the low levels of surface irradiance that characterize the austral winter an algal bloom was recorded a hypothetical explanation links the superior swimming of dinoflagellates 2 2 heterocapsa triquetra montero et al 2017 which allows them to move to more suitable zones in the water column with a warmer temperature of the seawater both factors could have provided appropriate conditions for the bloom in the following we describe step by step the procedure used to apply the proposed model to simulate this unusual algal bloom 5 2 1 two layer model the first step consists of determining the depth of the euphotic zone l 1 in fig 2 as follows i a mean vertical profile of light attenuation with depth was constructed by computing the time averaged values of four experimentally obtained vertical profiles of underwater irradiance measured in terms of photo synthetically active radiation par see fig 6 a ii a fitting curve for the mean vertical profile is given by 13a υ d 87 56 exp 4 881 d 19 31 exp 0 3952 d where d 16 0 0 0 is a vertical coordinate for the depth iii we assume that the euphotic zone extends from the sea surface d 0 until a depth d at which the following condition holds 13b υ d υ 0 0 025 a simple calculation shows that d 5 m therefore the depth of l 1 corresponds to that at which 2 5 of the surface s par remains active 5 2 2 light availability here we compute an analytical expression for the light availability in the first layer to this end we note that the mean value of photo synthetically available radiation in l 1 at t 0 46 d 11 a m is given by 14a a 1 d d 0 υ s d s 12 0 μ em 2 s 1 moreover based on meteorological data we state that the solar irradiance at the sea surface is described by 14b i t s 2 sin 100 π t 21 2 π 1 if 0 31 t 0 73 d 0 otherwise where s 100 μ em 2 s 1 thus we assume that the time evolution of the mean par in l 1 follows 14b but replacing s 100 by s 15 5586 12 0 i 0 4600 see fig 6 b 5 2 3 nutrient input the nutrient input due to vertical mixing of the water column is represented by i n t in 3b its shape is controlled by the scalars a b and c we consider a one day mixing process that reaches its peak intensity during the first half of the day thus we take b 0 5 to determine c we assume a full duration at half maximum f c equal to 1 0 d along with the identity f c 2 2 ln 2 c 1 from which we get c 0 424 additionally a is computed from 15a a c 2 π i n s d s n where n denotes the total nutrient increment in l 1 due to vertical mixing taking n 16 00 yields a 15 00 fig 6 c shows i n t along with the curve 15b n t t i n s d s which corresponds to the time evolution of the total nutrient input into the first layer 5 2 4 biogeochemical data as has been anticipated in section 2 2 all the state variables are expressed in nitrogen content per unit volume mmol n m 3 the procedure used to convert the field data obtained during the campaign of july 10 to 16 2015 is as follows i nutrient nitrate no 3 is assumed to be the unique source of nutrients discrete observations were obtained at three depths 2 5 and 15 m ii phytoplankton the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a was used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass two sources of information were available i surface chl a recorded using a multi parameter water quality data collection system and ii vertical profiles constructed from chl a samples taken at three depths 2 5 and 15 m following bode et al 1997 chl a to carbon conversion was carried out with a c chl a ratio of 50 and a c n ratio of 7 6 was used to convert carbon content to nitrogen content iii zooplankton plankton abundance was taken from observations at three depths 2 5 and 15 m the carbon content associated with zooplankton abundance was estimated by assuming an average value of 56 μ g c for each individual escribano and rodríguez 1995 then a c n ratio of 8 6 was applied to compute the nitrogen content gismervik 1997 iv detritus as explained in section 2 1 this variable considers the sum of the contents of pom plus dom however in marine environments dom plays a dominant role in ecosystem dynamics thornton 2014 in this work dissolved organic carbon doc was used as a proxy for autochthonous dom harvey et al 2015 there was no data available for the pom additionally a doc don ratio equal to 10 4 was employed markager et al 2011 since no data was collected on july 8 the surface concentration of chl a was obtained by extrapolation from data collected from july 10 to 16 the nitrogen content was calculated using previous winter measurements no data was available for neither zooplankton nor doc by this date finally the mean values of the state variables in l 1 were estimated according to 14a by replacing υ d with an appropriate polynomial see table 2 fig 7 shows the mean values of n p and z along with their interpolation polynomials we assume a constant average value of d 20 631 mmol n m 3 5 2 5 model calibration the model is calibrated considering the cost function 11a along with the weighting factors 16 w i i 1 4 0 10 0 40 0 49 0 01 the above values are appropriate to accurately simulate the observed nutrient uptake and high rates of primary production the time interval of interest was 0 0 9 0 d and 100 time steps were used during the simulations model calibration was carried out with a fortran 2003 code that included an object oriented 3 3 download site https github com jacobwilliams pikaia version of the open source ga based optimization subroutine pikaia charbonneau and knapp 1995 the simulations considered i an initial population composed of 4000 individuals randomly sampled on s encoding different values of θ 2e ii the evolutionary process evolves until a convergence tolerance of 10 6 or a maximum of 10 000 generations is attained iii a cross over probability equal to p c r o s s 0 95 iv an initial value for the mutation rate equal to p m u t 0 005 adjustable depending on fitness and v a reproduction plan where the least fit individual is always replaced see charbonneau and knapp 1995 and sivanandam and deepa 2008 for more details about ga based algorithms since there are no fixed rules to perform the calibration several tests were carried out revealing that some of the model parameters are sensitive to variations in both ga parameters initial population size maximum number of iterations convergence tolerance p c r o s s p m u t etc and forcing factors pulse parameters analytical form of light availability function etc we defined four cases i tllz this case considers the light availability function of 14b and a linear zooplankton loss rate ϕ z 0 ii tlqz light availability according to 14b and a quadratic zooplankton loss rate ϕ z 0 iii mllz the available light is constant and equal to 0 1 i s d s 3 27 μ e m 2s 1 and ϕ z 0 iv mlqz available light equal to 3 27 μ e m 2s 1 and ϕ z 0 tables 3 and 4 summarize the optimal parameters for every case along with the corresponding value of γ θ figs 8 and 9 show that a better agreement between experimental data and simulations is obtained for tlqz γ 46 30 when compared with tllz γ 68 90 the same applies to mlqz γ 38 86 when compared with mllz γ 59 07 these results indicate that including the quadratic term ϕ z z 2 improves the model s ability to represent the system s dynamics in a broader context the best fitting is obtained for mlqz indicating that a smoothed representation of the external forcing factors is beneficial for the model s reliability the following observations are also noted i the parameter space s shows multiple local maxima the model calibration confirms this feature since the inclusion of a quadratic term in tllz to obtain tlqz yields significant variations in some parameters e g k n 0 0060 0 4030 ϕ p 0 1726 0 0800 ϕ z 0 334 0 119 the same applies to mllz and mlqz we hypothesize that this behavior is related to the size of the initial population a simple calculation shows that if we admit ten possible values for every parameter a total of 1 0 10 admissible solutions will be obtained thus a relatively small initial sampling of s could confine the search to some local maxima several tests using larger initial populations produced similar results ii the form adopted for the external forcing factors strongly influences the calibration this is evidenced by comparing the optimal parameters for tllz and mllz e g k i 0 041 4 725 the same applies to tlqz and mlqz as well e g k i 0 031 4 415 γ m 0 00001 0 00451 iii the values of μ m ε g β and ϕ z remain remarkably stable in the four cases this situation is in good agreement with 16 since μ m provides an upper bound for the growth rate of phytoplankton ε and g determine the zooplankton grazing ratio and the model calibration was oriented to accurately simulate the observed nutrient uptake and high rates of primary production the quadratic term ϕ z 2 provides extra flexibility to model zooplankton excretion despite the above mentioned differences a reasonable agreement between the model outputs and experimental data is observed in all cases see figs 8 and 9 another way to validate the sets of parameters in tables 3 and 4 consists of comparing them with published data to this end we consider the values reported in heinle and slawig 2013b denman and peña 1999 oschlies and garçon 1999 fennel and neumann 2004 and spitz et al 2003 losa et al 2006 summarized in table 5 in all those works k i is not considered since other formulations are preferred for describing the light limitation we see that the average value of the half saturation factor for nutrient uptake k n 0 1168 belongs to the published range 0 1 1 0 the same applies to μ m 0 978 0 27 6 40 ϕ z 0 242 0 01 0 25 β 0 9936 0 3 1 0 and ϕ z 0 060 0 05 0 34 the value of ϕ p 0 1391 is slightly higher than the maximum published of 0 1 in general most of the model parameters show good agreement with published data however γ m g and ε diverge from the values in table 5 the difference in γ m could be explained by the criteria used to define w in 16 the other two parameters correspond to the maximum grazing and encounter rates respectively at first glance both values appear to be unrealistic fig 10 a shows the co domain of the zooplankton grazing ratio g ε g p from this figure it is possible to see the behavior of this curve differs from those appearing in previous works although the obtained values remain in the range of reported ratios the differences with literature could be associated with the fact that we are simulating a brief winter bloom of a particular member of the dinoflagellates family instead of the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton composed of multiple species some extra calibration experiments were conducted to test if other combinations of ε and g closer to previously reported values could produce an acceptable grazing ratio curve unfortunately all the experiments yielded higher values for the cost function γ θ an alternative way for parameter validation consists of comparing the values of the annual fluxes of biomass among the trophic levels with existing information see e g denman and peña 1999 we do not pursue that approach here since this application example is focused on a short term ecological process 5 2 6 ecosystem response to a sequence of nutrient pulses this example focuses on studying a sequence of primary production peaks associated with a winter algal bloom driven by several nutrient pulses except for γ m 1 1 0 4 and β 0 75 the model s parameters are those of the case tlqz fig 11 shows the nutrient pulses and the corresponding time evolution of the state variables n p and z every nutrient pulse triggers a phytoplankton peak in the euphotic zone after approximately three days a zooplankton peak occurs one day later this sequence of maxima accounts for the biomass flow through the trophic web a decrease in nutrients and plankton follows after every pulse episode due to their conversion to detritus which acts as a long term reservoir of organic carbon see fig 11 b therefore the model is capable of simulating the transient dynamics that a sequence of nutrient pulses boosts in the euphotic zone both numerical and experimental montero et al 2017 evidence shows that the fjord ecosystem possesses internal mechanisms that allow it to recover its initial configuration after processing unusual pulses of primary production in the winter period see fig 11 b and table 2 the primary production at time t 0 0 25 0 in l 1 p p t is given by 17a p p t 0 t j n s i s p s d s which is approximated by the trapezoidal rule according to 17b p p k h 2 i 2 k j n i 1 i t i 1 p i 1 j n i i t i p i p p t k the same procedure is used to estimate the net value of phytoplankton loss due to grazing but j n i p needs to be replaced by g ε g p z in 17a the time integral of any other flux of those shown in fig 3 provides the corresponding net transfer of biomass between functional groups shown in fig 12 the annual fluxes of biomass are frequently used to characterize marine ecosystems once they are validated against observations see e g denman and peña 1999 unfortunately the pfa s data scarcity prevents us from making comparisons fig 13 a shows the time evolution of the primary production rate j n i p pp rate and the rate of phytoplankton loss due to grazing g ε g p z gp rate the pp rate curve shows that primary production is active during the daylight hours in agreement with the function proposed in 14b thus a sequence of intermittent active and passive periods is simulated for the time interval of interest 0 25 d the corresponding envelope curve presents three peaks associated with the maxima in phytoplankton content the curve of gp rate also presents three peaks associated with the maxima in zooplankton production fig 13 b depicts the time history of the zooplankton to detritus conversion rate 1 β g ε g p z ϕ z z 2 zd rate phytoplankton mortality rate ϕ p p and zooplankton excretion rate ϕ z z in all these cases a three peak curve can be identified moreover it is possible to see that the zd rate dominates the detritus production fig 13 c presents the curves of primary production and the net loss of phytoplankton due to grazing 17b in terms of applications the pp curve enables estimations of biomass production in a marine water body for example assuming the above results represent the average behavior in a 1 km2 area the value of phytoplankton production by day 25 is 24 4 5 1 0 6 122 1 0 6 mmol n conversion factors may be used to express it in other e g carbon units regarding other environmental changes occurring during blooms a principal component analysis pca härdle and simar 2014 was performed in montero et al 2017 to transform the observational data chl a no 3 po 4 temperature salinity o 2 content par phytoplankton abundance into a new coordinate system with greatest variance projected onto the first coordinate pc 1 64 9 of total variance followed by coordinate pc 2 13 9 pc 1 was positively loaded with salinity temperature inorganic phosphate po 4 and nitrate no 3 while negatively to plankton content chl a and o 2 a graphical representation of the pca data can be consulted in montero et al 2017 fig 5 this analysis provided additional support for the hypothesis that the winter algal blooms are related to the superior skills of dinoflagellates to swim toward the upper levels in l 1 it also showed that significant increments in the o 2 concentration 8 0 15 0 ml l and in the ph values 8 0 9 0 were coincident with the peaks in phytoplankton content see fig 10 b a hypothetical explanation for those changes is as follows the dissolved o 2 increases due to the photosynthesis is associated with high rates of primary production and simultaneous consumption of dissolved inorganic matter producing co 2 depletion and consequently increasing the ph after bloom the original values of o 2 and ph are recovered due to community respiration a numerical model for the dynamics of o 2 and ph variations can be reviewed in e g petrovskii et al 2017 and hofmann et al 2008 their potential applications range from hypoxia studies in marine systems to ocean acidification including those aspects of the ecosystem dynamics in the current model is left for forthcoming work since it requires considering a more detailed description of the food web including bacteria doc and don along with additional observational data however it is worth noting that the current framework for structure preserving time integration and model calibration with ga can be used for models of arbitrary complexity 6 conclusions and further research we propose a numerical model for ecological processes occurring in semi enclosed marine water bodies characterized by sparse field data together with a robust methodology for its calibration the model is based on a two layer description of the water column the first layer corresponds to the euphotic zone where a biogeochemical model of npzd type simulates a mass conserving trophic web the mixing of the water column triggers primary production events zooplankton grazing boosts the flow of biomass through the food web while detritus content increases due to mortality and excretion biomass losses are taken into account through detritus sinking subsequently the ecosystem dynamics are described by strictly positive trajectories that correspond to the solution of an externally forced non autonomous system of odes a three stage time integration method based on the so called splitting composition techniques was formulated to solve the system the proposed algorithm produces discrete trajectories that are strictly positive along with providing exact estimations of the biomass balance the model is calibrated with a genetic algorithm based optimization procedure the model parameters are fine tuned using an evolutionary technique for assimilating field data with a focus on realistic primary production modeling among the model s advantages are i versatile design allowing it to accommodate other food webs without modifying the method used to solve the system while maintaining the trajectories structure preserving properties ii the positive character of the solutions enables a robust integration with genetic algorithms as base tools for calibration case studies since non realistic values for the state variables are automatically avoided and iii the resulting algorithm entails only explicit calculations circumventing time consuming tasks associated with iterative schemes thus resulting in a fast and efficient computer simulation tool the model was used to study of a winter bloom of dinoflagellates in an austral fjord 2015 montero et al 2017 the model s properties were determined using field observations and data from an oceanographic buoy the calibration procedure considered a relatively large number parameters 10 the ga based optimization searches revealed a parameter space involving multiple local maxima hindering the obtaining of a single set of optimal parameters sensitivity analysis identified the most stable parameters finally the model was applied to simulate the time history response of the ecosystem subjected to a sequence of three wind induced nutrient pulses the numerical simulations reproduced the primary production peaks along with biomass flow through the food web it was also possible to assess areal biomass production per km 2 during algal blooms future research should focus on acquiring higher quality field data to improve the model calibration and in particular to better characterize zooplankton grazing rate we recommend that the food web description be improved by including a temperature dependent rate of nutrient uptake along with specific state variables for the time evolution of o 2 content and ph variation with such improvements it should be possible to apply the model to study the seasonal cycle of primary production in general marine water bodies finally the proposed model could be used for studying the dynamic stability of the pfa s ecosystems under scenarios of

24479,the patagonian fjords of southern chile are one of the largest and least studied estuarine regions in the world its water bodies display a wide range in hydrodynamic and biogeochemical behavior a function of diverse morphology bathymetry and range of inputs from continental runoff numerical models which are an essential tool in understanding the potential impacts of human or climate driven perturbations on complex ecosystems have not been applied in this zone we present a novel model for simulating ecological processes in data sparse marine water bodies as a trade off between model complexity and parsimony based on a two layer description of the water column the upper layer represents the euphotic zone where a npzd model nutrients phytoplankton zooplankton detritus is used to simulate the dynamics of a mass conserving pelagic food web intense wind driven water column mixing inducing an upward flux of nutrients that boosts high rates of primary production is described by a time dependent gaussian pulse mass losses due to detritus sinking are also included the ecosystem dynamics are represented by an externally forced non autonomous system of ordinary differential equations characterized by strictly positive trajectories this system is no longer mass conserving therefore a structure preserving time integrator based on a splitting composition technique was customized for solving the system s equations it is cast as a three step algorithm and provides an exact estimation of biomass fluxes in the first step a modified patankar runge kutta scheme burchard et al 2003 is used to solve the unforced npzd system the second and third steps consider the effects of nutrient pulse and sinking detritus finally genetic algorithms are used for model calibration with the proposed model applied to previous published observations on an unusual winter bloom of dinoflagellates in an austral fjord montero et al 2017 optimal parameters characterizing the biomass fluxes during the bloom were determined as well as the time scales and mass volume associated with primary production to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to model biogeochemical processes in the fjords of this region keywords npzd model algal bloom fjord ecosystem patankar scheme genetic algorithm 1 introduction the patagonian fjords area pfa is formed by a complex network of interconnected semi enclosed water bodies located on the southern coast of chile 41 5 s to 56 s and constitutes one of the largest estuarine regions of the world iriarte et al 2010 pickard 1971 silva and vargas 2014 see fig 1 a pfa s fjords and channels frequently receive freshwater discharges coming from local rivers surface runoff and ground water flows fed by high rainfall neshyba and fonseca 1980 and glacier ablation moffat 2014 pantoja et al 2011 freshwater inputs are responsible for an estuarine circulation stigebrandt 1981 which generates a characteristic stratification of the water column schneider et al 2014 into two basic layers i a lower salinity 11 31 psu upper layer 5 10 m depth sievers 2008 and ii a lower layer of nutrient rich waters presenting a more uniform salinity pérez santos et al 2014 despite their common characteristics every water body displays a unique hydrodynamic behavior castillo and valenzuela 2008 ross et al 2015 determined by the local environmental conditions which has enormous effects on the ecosystem dynamics castro et al 2011 from the biogeochemical point of view pfa remains one of the least studied zones of the world strub et al 1998 escribano et al 2003 it represents a highly complex marine terrestrial atmospheric interactions that may result in high biological production iriarte et al 2007 involving the exchange of large amounts of matter and energy between terrestrial and maritime ecosystems castillo et al 2016 the pfa is also a crucial source of ecosystem services in particular a world class industry of aquaculture has developed in some areas becoming the key promoter of social and economic development outeiro and villasante 2013 ensuring the sustainability of aquaculture has become a worldwide issue barton and flysand 2010 since the industry ecosystem interactions are poorly known paving the way for public policies that sometimes underestimate the environmental effects of human activities hosono et al 2016 buschmann et al 2009 moreover the current climate change scenario has become an extra source of uncertainty for understanding pfa ecosystem dynamics iriarte et al 2014 torres et al 2014 lafon et al 2014 only recently has the chilean government developed a research program in the area silva and palma 2008 although data collected to date have provided valuable information a knowledge gap about the ecosystem dynamics of fjords and channels remains a major obstacle for the ecosystem based management of the zone iriarte et al 2010 mathematical modeling offers a way to synthesize our understanding of the fjords ecosystem dynamics and to study its changes under human or climate related perturbations tett et al 2011 it necessitates the integration of physics chemistry and biology on the one hand specific computer codes have been developed for the ecosystem s hydrodynamic component see for example delandmeter et al 2015 gillibrand et al 2013 dalsøren et al 2020 uriarte et al 2014 to name a few applications on the other hand the biogeochemical component of the dynamics has been represented via the food web some models may be used as stand alone tools or may be coupled to hydrodynamic codes portilla et al 2009 burchard et al 2006 fennel and neumann 2004 tett et al 2003 numerical models depend on a set of parameters that need to be calibrated to fit experimental data fennel et al 2001 the calibration process is a complex task rückelt et al 2010 since very often the parametric space presents multiple sub optimal regions charbonneau and knapp 1995 and the dynamics turn out to be highly sensitive to small perturbations of select parameters heinle and slawig 2013a oschlies and garçon 1999 several methodologies have been developed for parameter optimization heinle and slawig 2013c such as genetic algorithms sivanandam and deepa 2008 bayesian methods arhonditsis et al 2007 and analytical methods schartau et al 2017 the numerical methods chosen to solve the model s equations also play a fundamental role in reproducing as many as possible of the ecosystem s specific features a modern perspective requires the methods to be capable of reproducing the so called dynamical invariants of the system hairer et al 2006 iv along with the geometric structure of the solution trajectories such as being strictly positive heinle and slawig 2013b zhang and wang 2012 methods of this type are called structure preserving and some examples can be found in e g broekhuizen et al 2008 edwards 2006 kopecz and meister 2018 schippmann and burchard 2011 and burchard et al 2005 the application of computational tools for simulating the dynamics of pfa s ecosystems represents both a research challenge and opportunity the main goal of this article is to develop a mathematical model and a structure preserving numerical method for computer simulation of biogeochemical processes in the euphotic zone of semi enclosed marine water bodies the proposed model represents a tradeoff between complexity and applicability since the sparsity of field data is an impediment to the development of more sophisticated models in the pfa the structure preserving properties of the model allow the formulation of a robust methodology for the parameters calibration in a wide variety of ecological scenarios the model is based on a two layer description of a representative volume of the marine environment where an embedded biogeochemical model of npzd type 1 1 a biogeochemical model of npzd type considers four functional groups nutrients n phytoplankton p zooplankton z and detritus d fennel and neumann 2004 fasham et al 1990 heinle and slawig 2013b oschlies and garçon 1999 is used to represent the trophic web an upward flux of nutrients influences primary production while mass losses are considered through detrital rain despite its relative simplicity a careful design of the time integration method ensures that the discrete approximations to the solution trajectories are strictly positive as are their continuous counterparts moreover the method produces precise estimations of biomass flux additionally the model was coupled to a genetic algorithm to develop a robust parameter estimation procedure it is worth mentioning that the proposed model could be easily adapted to represent other trophic webs and that may be potentially applied to more general marine or lake areas finally the proposed model is applied to an unusual and intense bloom of dinoflagellates documented in the puyuhuapi channel during the winter of 2015 located in the northern zone of the pfa montero et al 2017 see fig 1 b and c among other consequences algal blooms threaten the sustainability of the aquaculture industry díaz et al 2019 experimental data is used to define both the physical forcing factors and model initial conditions the model calibration is carried out with a genetic algorithm that provides optimal parameters characterizing the biomass fluxes through the food web during the algal bloom the calibrated model was employed to identify the time scales associated with primary production during the bloom and to assess the level of biomass introduced in the marine environment to the best of the authors knowledge this case study constitutes the first attempt to model biogeochemical processes in marine ecosystems of this region 2 model formulation this section is devoted to the formulation of a mathematical model capable of describing basic ecological processes in the water bodies of the pfa it is based on the photosynthetic conversion of a nutrient pulse into biomass in the euphotic zone and its subsequent transfer of biomass to higher trophic levels within a simplified food web mass losses due to sinking are also considered 2 1 conceptual model we consider a box model composed of two layers the first layer l 1 represents 1 m 2 of the sea surface with a depth corresponding to that of the euphotic zone at the location of interest we assume that all the biogeochemical processes affecting primary production as well as biomass fluxes through the food web occur in this layer the second layer l 2 is considerably deeper and its physical and biological properties remain constant the influence of temperature or salinity is considered negligible see fig 2 and section 5 for an application example the first layer is characterized by an initial concentration of nitrate no 3 that is measured in mmol n m 3 and is denoted by n 0 it corresponds to the nutrient content at time t 0 the deeper layer is assumed to have a nutrient content n 2 0 n 0 yielding a stratified configuration typically observed in estuarine systems see fig 2 a buoyancy forces associated with stratification tend to compete with turbulent diffusion creating a barrier for the upward input of nutrients from l 2 into l 1 burchard and hofmeister 2008 intense fluctuations of environmental factors such as wind contribute decisively to the water column mixing introducing nutrient pulses into the euphotic zone and under appropriate conditions of light availability boosting the phytoplankton production p montero et al 2017 see fig 2 b in this way a detailed description of the hydrodynamics is avoided moreover we assume that primary production does not depend on other limiting factors such as silicate or phosphorus later on the stratified configuration is recovered due to freshwater discharges as shown in fig 2 c increases in zooplankton biomass z occur due to grazing of p evidencing the flow of biomass through the food web both functional groups comprise a huge number of different species belonging to a wide range of morphological scales along with complex interactions among them ward et al 2014 we attempt to simplify such complexity reducing those interactions to a biomass flux among p and z moreover both p and z experience losses due to mortality contributing to the accumulation of dissolved d o m and particulate p o m organic matter which is treated here as detritus d the following fluxes complete the biogeochemical cycle in l 1 i the conversion of z to d due to excretion ii the conversion of d to n due to remineralization and iii the vertical sinking of d to l 2 some noteworthy properties of the model are as follows 1 mass balance initially the total biomass in the upper layer is equal to the sum of n 0 p 0 z 0 and d 0 measured in equivalent units see e g section 5 2 4 this quantity remains invariant for isolated systems on the contrary under external forcing the total biomass is going to depend on the balance between nutrient inputs minus detritus losses due to sinking 2 positive system we identify the time evolution of the four functional groups with time dependent functions describing the ecosystem dynamics thus it is clear that n t n t p t z t and d t must remain greater or equal to zero for any t r 0 since negative values are unrealistic systems with this property are called positive systems or positively preserving systems burchard et al 2003 2 2 mathematical model we built a mathematical model as an adaptation of the n p z d model oschlies and garçon 1999 oschlies et al 2000 heinle and slawig 2013c b by assuming that under no external forcing the dynamics in l 1 are given by the solution to an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations odes describing the conversion of nutrients into phytoplankton and the subsequent flow of biomass through the food web fig 3 the input of nutrients into l 1 is considered as a time dependent function added to the right hand side r h s of the balance equation for n therefore the new system of odes becomes non autonomous i e time dependent the detritus sinking to l 2 is taken into account through an extra function on the r h s of the balance equation for d following are detailed explanations then the time evolution of the ecosystem is represented by a trajectory of the form 1 z 0 t r 4 where the vector of state variables is given by z t n t p t z t d t for any time t belonging to the time interval of interest 0 t for sake of consistency all the state variables are expressed in mmol n m 3 specific methods to convert p z and d to the nutrient unit are given in section 5 2 2 1 autonomous npzd system first we consider i n t 0 and i d t 0 in fig 3 in this case the dynamics in l 1 are described by the following system of odes 2a d z t d t f a z t θ subjected to initial conditions z 0 n 0 p 0 z 0 d 0 in the above equation the four components of the flux vector f a are given by 2b f a i z θ j 1 4 p i j z θ d i j z θ i 1 4 where p z θ and d p t are the so called production and destruction matrices respectively and θ is a vector collecting the model parameters as explained below even though the format used in eqs 2a and 2b is unusual it adheres to practical considerations production destruction systems encompass a wide range of positive systems in several areas of science burchard et al 2003 all of them can be expressed in the above format allowing the model to be applied to other trophic web representations moreover structure preserving methods for such systems have received considerable attention in recent literature kopecz and meister 2018 in this work we consider 2c p z θ 0 0 ϕ z z γ m d j n i p 0 0 0 0 g ε g p z 0 0 0 ϕ p p 1 β g ε g p z ϕ z z 2 0 where the growth rate of phytoplankton is given by j n i μ m n k n n i k i i i is the light availability that is further explained in section 5 2 and μ m is a growth factor that imposes an upper bound on the rate of conversion of n into p moreover in 2c a holling type iii function fasham et al 1990 is used for the zooplankton grazing ratio g ε g p according to 2d g ε g p g ε p 2 g ε p 2 where ε and g are positive constants the other parameters appearing in 2c are summarized in table 1 where their definitions units of measure and range of admissible values are specified we collect them in the following vector 2e θ k n k i μ m ϕ z ϕ z ϕ p γ m β ε g κ the behavior of the model strongly depends on the values in θ heinle and slawig 2013a and section 4 is devoted to its calibration regarding the geometric structure of solutions the mathematical model inherits the conservation properties of its conceptual counterpart namely 1 mass conservation the total mass of the system remains invariant since 2f 0 d n d t d p d t d z d t d d d t where eqs 2b and 2c have been taken into account 2 positive system this property means that if system 2a is subjected to positive initial conditions then n t 0 p t 0 z t 0 and d t 0 for all t 0 t a proof of this property for dynamical systems in production destruction form can be found in burchard et al 2003 1 the numerical method proposed in section 3 is designed to exactly preserve these properties 2 2 2 nutrient input the nutrient input in l 1 is considered by modifying the balance equation for n in 2a according to 3a d n d t j n i p ϕ z z γ m d i n t where the pulse of nutrients i n t is given by the gaussian function 3b i n t a exp t b 2 2 c 2 and a b c are positive scalars controlling the pulse amplitude position and width respectively guidelines for their estimation are given in section 5 2 2 2 3 detritus sinking following heinle and slawig 2013c we consider the precipitation of d from l 1 to l 2 this process is particularly important if a long term characterization of the ecosystem dynamics is required then the r h s of the balance equation for d is modified according to 4a d d d t ϕ p p 1 β g ε g p z ϕ z z 2 γ m d i d z θ where 4b i d z t θ κ d t d if d t d 0 otherwise is a flux term that governs detritus sinking in the above equation d provides a lower bound for detritus concentration and κ 0 is an extra parameter appropriate values for d and κ are problem dependent as discussed in section 5 2 2 2 4 conservation properties in summary the dynamics of the externally forced two layer model is given by 5a d z t d t f a z t θ f b t f c z t θ where f a was given in 2b 2c and f b and f c correspond to 5b f b t i n t 0 0 0 and f c z t θ 0 0 0 i d z t θ the geometric properties of the flow are as follows 1 positive system assuming d 0 two situations arise i if d t d then n t 0 for all t since 3b shows that i n t 0 thus 3a holds and ii if d t d 4b shows that an exponential decay of detritus occurs until 0 d t d therefore both i n and i d preserve the positive character of the solutions 2 mass balance repeating 2f for 5a it is possible to see that 5c d n d t d p d t d z d t d d d t i n t if d t d i n t κ d t d otherwise which shows that total mass is no longer invariant but instead it can be computed from the balance between nutrient input and detritus sinking 3 numerical method structure preserving methods have gained considerable attention in computational biogeochemistry because of their superior performance in numerical simulations burchard et al 2003 kopecz and meister 2018 in our case it is reduced to constructing a method capable of ensuring positive solutions along with the exact balance of mass 5c to this end we consider a partition of 0 t characterized by an integer n 1 and a sequence t n n 0 n of real numbers such that 0 t 0 t n t n t and where h t n 1 t n is a constant time step then we apply an operator splitting method hairer et al 2006 the splitting technique treats mass conserving processes separately from those that are not the system 5a is split into the following simpler systems 6a d z d t f a d z d t f b d z d t f c the first system corresponds to an autonomous mass conserving npzd system see 2a and 2b the second one takes into account the nutrient input from l 2 into l 1 and the third system considers biomass losses due to detritus sinking next we assume we know the maps φ a φ b φ c r 4 r 4 where φ a is a method that approximates the exact solution of the first system in 6a and the same applies to φ b and φ c according to hairer et al 2006 given an initial condition z 0 we find that 6b φ z 0 φ c φ b φ a z 0 is a first order approximation to the solution of 5a at time t h or in other words φ z 0 z h o h 2 in the above equation φ b φ a stands for the composition of maps higher order methods can be formulated as described in strang 1969 in the following we provide explicit expressions for the methods φ a φ b and φ c 3 1 autonomous npzd system φ a the modified patankar runge kutta mprk method is applied to approximate the solutions of the first system in 6a it is a second order unconditionally positive and conservative time integrator that belongs to a large class of methods originally presented in burchard et al 2003 and generalized in kopecz and meister 2018 given z n z t n the mprk method determines z n 1 z t n 1 in two steps 7a z p ω z n 1 z n 7b z n 1 m z n z p 1 z n the solution procedure requires solving two linear systems thus avoiding iterative methods the values of ω z n are given by ω i i z 1 h z i j 1 4 d i j z i 1 4 ω i j z h z j p i j z i j 1 4 i j and m z n z p 1 2 ω z n ω z p the mprk method guarantees that for h 0 the following properties hold i if z k 0 then z k 1 0 this is a discrete version of positivity and ii for all k n 7c i 1 4 z i n 1 z i n 0 which corresponds to the discrete counterpart of the mass conservation formal proofs can be found in kopecz and meister 2018 3 2 nutrient pulse φ b the second system in 6a produces an exact solution due to the simple form of f b in 5b thus φ b maps p k to p k 1 p k z k to z k 1 z k d k to d k 1 d k and n k to 8 n t k 1 n k t k t k 1 i n s d s n k a c π 2 erf t k 1 b 2 c erf t k b 2 c where erf r 1 1 is the gauss error function 3 3 detritus sinking φ c the third system in 6a also produces an exact solution therefore in this case φ c maps n k to n k 1 n k p k to p k 1 p k z k to z k 1 z k and d k to 9 d k 1 d exp κ h d k d if d k d d k otherwise then at each time step the biomass loss due to detritus sinking is computed as d k d k 1 0 3 4 geometric properties of φ the geometric properties of the discrete flow generated by φ are as follows i discrete trajectories are strictly positive this property can be verified from the fact that φ φ c φ b φ a on the one hand φ a is strictly positive since it corresponds to the mprk method moreover the composition φ b φ a retains this property since φ b only adds a positive term to n k in 8 on the other hand the subsequent composition with φ c adds a positive term to d k in 9 only if d k d 0 ii mass balance the mprk method ensures the exact conservation of the total mass as indicated in 7c however the subsequent composition with φ b and φ c modifies this property according to 10 i 1 4 z i n 1 z i n d k d 1 e κ h 1 υ t k t k 1 if d k d υ t k t k 1 otherwise where υ t k t k 1 0 corresponds to the second term on the r h s of 8 the above expression provides a discrete version of the biomass balance it is exact since the terms appearing on the r h s of 10 are exactly computed in 8 and 9 4 model calibration as mentioned in section 2 2 1 the parameters collected in θ 2e determine the model behavior the ranges of their values are given in table 1 therefore any admissible θ belongs to the parameter space s r 7 0 1 r 3 finding θ s such that the model s output fits experimental data up to a certain precision is a non trivial task rückelt et al 2010 since s may be a large space involving multiple sub optimal regions sometimes intrinsic limitations in the model s ability to simulate the ecological processes explain the discrepancies with experimental observations additionally the model s behavior may be highly sensible to perturbations in some parameters in this section we introduce the so called genetic algorithms ga sivanandam and deepa 2008 for model calibration in the following we formally pose the optimization problem and then describe the ga methodology used in section 5 2 for an application problem of ecological significance in marine sciences 4 1 optimization problem given a set of observational data z t l l 1 l where z 1 t 1 corresponds to the nutrient content in l 1 measured experimentally at time t 1 and the same applies to the other components of z t at time instants t l l 1 l the model calibration is equivalent to finding θ s solving the following optimization problem 11a arg max θ s γ θ i 1 4 w i l 1 l z i t l z i l θ 2 where γ θ is the so called cost function and z l θ l 1 l corresponds to the numerical solution of 11b d z t d t f a z t θ f b t θ f c z t θ 11c z 0 z 0 using the method given in section 3 in the above equations z 0 is a vector with appropriate initial values of the state variables and w w j j 1 4 are positive scalars that take into account the relative weight of each component of z in the construction of the cost function we consider the condition i 1 4 w i 1 note that 1 γ θ in 11a is designed as the weighted sum of the differences between observed and computed data for each component in z for example w 0 3 0 5 0 1 0 1 will result in a set of parameters θ that provides reasonably good matches for n and p but not necessarily for z or d other options will unfortunately change θ therefore w needs to be specified based on a combination of knowledge and research goals kriest et al 2020 2 in general finding satisfactory parameters for marine ecological processes remains an open problem and only partial solutions are available in general θ will depend on the form of γ θ and even on hydrodynamics see e g kriest 2017 kriest et al 2017 mcdonald et al 2012 and vichi et al 2003 in sauerland et al 2019 the authors propose a multi objective optimization method that provides a set of compromise solutions addressing different research questions this approach could be applied in combination with ga by noting that γ θ r 1 4 γ r θ in 11a 3 the model reliability can be improved by restricting some of the θ i s according to θ i m i n θ i θ i m a x based on information coming from previous works heinle and slawig 2013c fennel et al 2001 or data from mesocosm experiments raveh et al 2019 gossiaux et al 2020 such a restrictions must be added to 11c in order to reduce uncertainty moreover specific methods are required to solve constrained optimization problems with genetic algorithms michalewicz and schoenauer 1996 coello 2002 4 2 genetic algorithm genetic algorithms for parameter optimization are heuristic search methods that mimic natural selection in the process the most fit individuals i e individuals better adapted to the environment are selected for producing offspring for the next generation of a breeding population evolution also requires the offspring to inherit at least some of the parent s superior characteristics heredity along with the existence of a fitness spectrum among population members variability see e g charbonneau and knapp 1995 and sivanandam and deepa 2008 for a thorough account of the subject the computer implementation of a ga requires defining i a cost function for optimization which corresponds to γ θ in 11a ii a population of individuals initially the set θ r r 1 n p is obtained from a random sampling of s every parameter vector θ p is encoded into x p using a 1 digit base 10 integers see charbonneau and knapp 1995 for details therefore the set x r r 1 n p corresponds with the initial population and every x r to an individual we denote the encoding of θ as x en θ the inverse operation i e the decoding of x as θ en 1 x iii a mechanism to select which individuals will reproduce essentially this process entails creating a ranking of individuals x 1 x n p based on their fitness γ en 1 x 1 γ en 1 x n p and assigning a mating probability p m j n p j 1 n p to x j individuals with a higher value of p m are more likely to be selected for reproduction iv a crossover procedure to produce the next generation of individuals this operation entails a stochastic procedure for determining which individual segments will be swapped during mating see sivanandam and deepa 2008 this procedure is applied only if a randomly generated number is less than the crossover rate p c r o s s 0 0 1 0 v a procedure to enforce the random mutation of some individuals in a new generation this procedure may modify the value of some entries in every x p of the population if a randomly generated number is less than the mutation rate p m u t 0 0 1 0 this value may be modified during the optimization vi a reproduction plan that determines which newly bred individuals are to be incorporated into the population we consider that the least fit individual x n p never survives for the next generation vii appropriate tolerances for convergence checking during the iterative computations a typical flowchart for ga algorithms appears in fig 4 among the advantages of ga are i they work well for both continuous and discrete cost functions ii they avoid computing derivatives iii they are reasonably efficient and fast iv their algorithmic structure allows both serial and parallel implementations v they provide approximate solutions even in the case of large parameter spaces however ga also suffer from some shortcomings i the cost function is frequently evaluated thus increasing the computational cost ii due to the probabilistic nature of the selection crossover and mutation processes the computation of a global optimum is not guaranteed and iii in some problems involving intricate parameter spaces the algorithm might stay iterating around local optima 5 numerical studies in this section the structure preserving properties of the proposed model are verified numerically moreover we tested the model s ability to simulate an unusual winter bloom of dinoflagellates that occurred in a semi enclosed channel of the pfa in 2015 montero et al 2017 those blooms have been reported as one of the possible consequences of climate change in the zone to this end a ga based calibration of the model is carried out considering in situ observational data additionally it is used to estimate the level of primary production and phytoplankton grazing rates along with the time scales associated with the biomass fluxes through the food web 5 1 model properties in sections 2 2 4 and 3 4 we show that the method generates positive trajectories and an exact mass balance in the following we verify numerically the second property since the first is an algebraic feature of the method initial conditions are given in the first column of table 2 the depth of the first layer is equal to 5 m and the function of light availability is explained in section 5 2 2 with model parameters shown in the second row of tables 3 and 4 two cases are considered i a set of nutrient pulses specified through the parameters a i i 1 4 15 0 18 0 21 0 24 0 b 0 5 and c 0 424 see 3b along with a sinking constant κ 0 0 and ii a single pulse a 21 0 b 0 5 and c 0 424 along with κ i i 1 4 0 000 0 025 0 050 0 100 the time evolution of the total biomass per unit volume is shown in fig 5 a and b for both cases in the first case we note that a i 1 a i 3 therefore the difference in total biomass per unit volume when the system is subjected to pulses characterized by a i 1 and a i is given by 12 δ n i n i 1 s i n i s d s a i 1 a i c 2 π 3 64 mmol n m 3 where the superscript i in i n i s denotes the dependence of the nutrient pulse on a i additionally since κ 0 no mass losses are expected to occur this behavior is shown in fig 5 a fig 5 b shows that the total biomass is exactly conserved for κ 0 0 however as κ increases higher rates of biomass loss are obtained due to detritus sinking 5 2 case study a winter bloom of dinoflagellates high rates of gross primary production and chlorophyll a concentration associated with an unusual winter bloom of dinoflagellates were reported at a fixed station in the puyuhuapi channel chilean patagonia 44 35 30 s 72 43 60 w in july 2015 montero et al 2017 see fig 1 the same study provides a detailed description of a winter sampling campaign july 10 16 2015 including hydrographic profiles and water samples from different depths additionally a nearby buoy was used to continuously record oceanographic and meteorological data according to montero et al 2017 4 the bloom was induced by intense winds that triggered the input of nutrients from deeper levels into the euphotic zone due to vertical mixing then the water column re stratified due to the freshwater discharges coming from the cisnes river in this scenario and despite the low levels of surface irradiance that characterize the austral winter an algal bloom was recorded a hypothetical explanation links the superior swimming of dinoflagellates 2 2 heterocapsa triquetra montero et al 2017 which allows them to move to more suitable zones in the water column with a warmer temperature of the seawater both factors could have provided appropriate conditions for the bloom in the following we describe step by step the procedure used to apply the proposed model to simulate this unusual algal bloom 5 2 1 two layer model the first step consists of determining the depth of the euphotic zone l 1 in fig 2 as follows i a mean vertical profile of light attenuation with depth was constructed by computing the time averaged values of four experimentally obtained vertical profiles of underwater irradiance measured in terms of photo synthetically active radiation par see fig 6 a ii a fitting curve for the mean vertical profile is given by 13a υ d 87 56 exp 4 881 d 19 31 exp 0 3952 d where d 16 0 0 0 is a vertical coordinate for the depth iii we assume that the euphotic zone extends from the sea surface d 0 until a depth d at which the following condition holds 13b υ d υ 0 0 025 a simple calculation shows that d 5 m therefore the depth of l 1 corresponds to that at which 2 5 of the surface s par remains active 5 2 2 light availability here we compute an analytical expression for the light availability in the first layer to this end we note that the mean value of photo synthetically available radiation in l 1 at t 0 46 d 11 a m is given by 14a a 1 d d 0 υ s d s 12 0 μ em 2 s 1 moreover based on meteorological data we state that the solar irradiance at the sea surface is described by 14b i t s 2 sin 100 π t 21 2 π 1 if 0 31 t 0 73 d 0 otherwise where s 100 μ em 2 s 1 thus we assume that the time evolution of the mean par in l 1 follows 14b but replacing s 100 by s 15 5586 12 0 i 0 4600 see fig 6 b 5 2 3 nutrient input the nutrient input due to vertical mixing of the water column is represented by i n t in 3b its shape is controlled by the scalars a b and c we consider a one day mixing process that reaches its peak intensity during the first half of the day thus we take b 0 5 to determine c we assume a full duration at half maximum f c equal to 1 0 d along with the identity f c 2 2 ln 2 c 1 from which we get c 0 424 additionally a is computed from 15a a c 2 π i n s d s n where n denotes the total nutrient increment in l 1 due to vertical mixing taking n 16 00 yields a 15 00 fig 6 c shows i n t along with the curve 15b n t t i n s d s which corresponds to the time evolution of the total nutrient input into the first layer 5 2 4 biogeochemical data as has been anticipated in section 2 2 all the state variables are expressed in nitrogen content per unit volume mmol n m 3 the procedure used to convert the field data obtained during the campaign of july 10 to 16 2015 is as follows i nutrient nitrate no 3 is assumed to be the unique source of nutrients discrete observations were obtained at three depths 2 5 and 15 m ii phytoplankton the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a was used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass two sources of information were available i surface chl a recorded using a multi parameter water quality data collection system and ii vertical profiles constructed from chl a samples taken at three depths 2 5 and 15 m following bode et al 1997 chl a to carbon conversion was carried out with a c chl a ratio of 50 and a c n ratio of 7 6 was used to convert carbon content to nitrogen content iii zooplankton plankton abundance was taken from observations at three depths 2 5 and 15 m the carbon content associated with zooplankton abundance was estimated by assuming an average value of 56 μ g c for each individual escribano and rodríguez 1995 then a c n ratio of 8 6 was applied to compute the nitrogen content gismervik 1997 iv detritus as explained in section 2 1 this variable considers the sum of the contents of pom plus dom however in marine environments dom plays a dominant role in ecosystem dynamics thornton 2014 in this work dissolved organic carbon doc was used as a proxy for autochthonous dom harvey et al 2015 there was no data available for the pom additionally a doc don ratio equal to 10 4 was employed markager et al 2011 since no data was collected on july 8 the surface concentration of chl a was obtained by extrapolation from data collected from july 10 to 16 the nitrogen content was calculated using previous winter measurements no data was available for neither zooplankton nor doc by this date finally the mean values of the state variables in l 1 were estimated according to 14a by replacing υ d with an appropriate polynomial see table 2 fig 7 shows the mean values of n p and z along with their interpolation polynomials we assume a constant average value of d 20 631 mmol n m 3 5 2 5 model calibration the model is calibrated considering the cost function 11a along with the weighting factors 16 w i i 1 4 0 10 0 40 0 49 0 01 the above values are appropriate to accurately simulate the observed nutrient uptake and high rates of primary production the time interval of interest was 0 0 9 0 d and 100 time steps were used during the simulations model calibration was carried out with a fortran 2003 code that included an object oriented 3 3 download site https github com jacobwilliams pikaia version of the open source ga based optimization subroutine pikaia charbonneau and knapp 1995 the simulations considered i an initial population composed of 4000 individuals randomly sampled on s encoding different values of θ 2e ii the evolutionary process evolves until a convergence tolerance of 10 6 or a maximum of 10 000 generations is attained iii a cross over probability equal to p c r o s s 0 95 iv an initial value for the mutation rate equal to p m u t 0 005 adjustable depending on fitness and v a reproduction plan where the least fit individual is always replaced see charbonneau and knapp 1995 and sivanandam and deepa 2008 for more details about ga based algorithms since there are no fixed rules to perform the calibration several tests were carried out revealing that some of the model parameters are sensitive to variations in both ga parameters initial population size maximum number of iterations convergence tolerance p c r o s s p m u t etc and forcing factors pulse parameters analytical form of light availability function etc we defined four cases i tllz this case considers the light availability function of 14b and a linear zooplankton loss rate ϕ z 0 ii tlqz light availability according to 14b and a quadratic zooplankton loss rate ϕ z 0 iii mllz the available light is constant and equal to 0 1 i s d s 3 27 μ e m 2s 1 and ϕ z 0 iv mlqz available light equal to 3 27 μ e m 2s 1 and ϕ z 0 tables 3 and 4 summarize the optimal parameters for every case along with the corresponding value of γ θ figs 8 and 9 show that a better agreement between experimental data and simulations is obtained for tlqz γ 46 30 when compared with tllz γ 68 90 the same applies to mlqz γ 38 86 when compared with mllz γ 59 07 these results indicate that including the quadratic term ϕ z z 2 improves the model s ability to represent the system s dynamics in a broader context the best fitting is obtained for mlqz indicating that a smoothed representation of the external forcing factors is beneficial for the model s reliability the following observations are also noted i the parameter space s shows multiple local maxima the model calibration confirms this feature since the inclusion of a quadratic term in tllz to obtain tlqz yields significant variations in some parameters e g k n 0 0060 0 4030 ϕ p 0 1726 0 0800 ϕ z 0 334 0 119 the same applies to mllz and mlqz we hypothesize that this behavior is related to the size of the initial population a simple calculation shows that if we admit ten possible values for every parameter a total of 1 0 10 admissible solutions will be obtained thus a relatively small initial sampling of s could confine the search to some local maxima several tests using larger initial populations produced similar results ii the form adopted for the external forcing factors strongly influences the calibration this is evidenced by comparing the optimal parameters for tllz and mllz e g k i 0 041 4 725 the same applies to tlqz and mlqz as well e g k i 0 031 4 415 γ m 0 00001 0 00451 iii the values of μ m ε g β and ϕ z remain remarkably stable in the four cases this situation is in good agreement with 16 since μ m provides an upper bound for the growth rate of phytoplankton ε and g determine the zooplankton grazing ratio and the model calibration was oriented to accurately simulate the observed nutrient uptake and high rates of primary production the quadratic term ϕ z 2 provides extra flexibility to model zooplankton excretion despite the above mentioned differences a reasonable agreement between the model outputs and experimental data is observed in all cases see figs 8 and 9 another way to validate the sets of parameters in tables 3 and 4 consists of comparing them with published data to this end we consider the values reported in heinle and slawig 2013b denman and peña 1999 oschlies and garçon 1999 fennel and neumann 2004 and spitz et al 2003 losa et al 2006 summarized in table 5 in all those works k i is not considered since other formulations are preferred for describing the light limitation we see that the average value of the half saturation factor for nutrient uptake k n 0 1168 belongs to the published range 0 1 1 0 the same applies to μ m 0 978 0 27 6 40 ϕ z 0 242 0 01 0 25 β 0 9936 0 3 1 0 and ϕ z 0 060 0 05 0 34 the value of ϕ p 0 1391 is slightly higher than the maximum published of 0 1 in general most of the model parameters show good agreement with published data however γ m g and ε diverge from the values in table 5 the difference in γ m could be explained by the criteria used to define w in 16 the other two parameters correspond to the maximum grazing and encounter rates respectively at first glance both values appear to be unrealistic fig 10 a shows the co domain of the zooplankton grazing ratio g ε g p from this figure it is possible to see the behavior of this curve differs from those appearing in previous works although the obtained values remain in the range of reported ratios the differences with literature could be associated with the fact that we are simulating a brief winter bloom of a particular member of the dinoflagellates family instead of the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton composed of multiple species some extra calibration experiments were conducted to test if other combinations of ε and g closer to previously reported values could produce an acceptable grazing ratio curve unfortunately all the experiments yielded higher values for the cost function γ θ an alternative way for parameter validation consists of comparing the values of the annual fluxes of biomass among the trophic levels with existing information see e g denman and peña 1999 we do not pursue that approach here since this application example is focused on a short term ecological process 5 2 6 ecosystem response to a sequence of nutrient pulses this example focuses on studying a sequence of primary production peaks associated with a winter algal bloom driven by several nutrient pulses except for γ m 1 1 0 4 and β 0 75 the model s parameters are those of the case tlqz fig 11 shows the nutrient pulses and the corresponding time evolution of the state variables n p and z every nutrient pulse triggers a phytoplankton peak in the euphotic zone after approximately three days a zooplankton peak occurs one day later this sequence of maxima accounts for the biomass flow through the trophic web a decrease in nutrients and plankton follows after every pulse episode due to their conversion to detritus which acts as a long term reservoir of organic carbon see fig 11 b therefore the model is capable of simulating the transient dynamics that a sequence of nutrient pulses boosts in the euphotic zone both numerical and experimental montero et al 2017 evidence shows that the fjord ecosystem possesses internal mechanisms that allow it to recover its initial configuration after processing unusual pulses of primary production in the winter period see fig 11 b and table 2 the primary production at time t 0 0 25 0 in l 1 p p t is given by 17a p p t 0 t j n s i s p s d s which is approximated by the trapezoidal rule according to 17b p p k h 2 i 2 k j n i 1 i t i 1 p i 1 j n i i t i p i p p t k the same procedure is used to estimate the net value of phytoplankton loss due to grazing but j n i p needs to be replaced by g ε g p z in 17a the time integral of any other flux of those shown in fig 3 provides the corresponding net transfer of biomass between functional groups shown in fig 12 the annual fluxes of biomass are frequently used to characterize marine ecosystems once they are validated against observations see e g denman and peña 1999 unfortunately the pfa s data scarcity prevents us from making comparisons fig 13 a shows the time evolution of the primary production rate j n i p pp rate and the rate of phytoplankton loss due to grazing g ε g p z gp rate the pp rate curve shows that primary production is active during the daylight hours in agreement with the function proposed in 14b thus a sequence of intermittent active and passive periods is simulated for the time interval of interest 0 25 d the corresponding envelope curve presents three peaks associated with the maxima in phytoplankton content the curve of gp rate also presents three peaks associated with the maxima in zooplankton production fig 13 b depicts the time history of the zooplankton to detritus conversion rate 1 β g ε g p z ϕ z z 2 zd rate phytoplankton mortality rate ϕ p p and zooplankton excretion rate ϕ z z in all these cases a three peak curve can be identified moreover it is possible to see that the zd rate dominates the detritus production fig 13 c presents the curves of primary production and the net loss of phytoplankton due to grazing 17b in terms of applications the pp curve enables estimations of biomass production in a marine water body for example assuming the above results represent the average behavior in a 1 km2 area the value of phytoplankton production by day 25 is 24 4 5 1 0 6 122 1 0 6 mmol n conversion factors may be used to express it in other e g carbon units regarding other environmental changes occurring during blooms a principal component analysis pca härdle and simar 2014 was performed in montero et al 2017 to transform the observational data chl a no 3 po 4 temperature salinity o 2 content par phytoplankton abundance into a new coordinate system with greatest variance projected onto the first coordinate pc 1 64 9 of total variance followed by coordinate pc 2 13 9 pc 1 was positively loaded with salinity temperature inorganic phosphate po 4 and nitrate no 3 while negatively to plankton content chl a and o 2 a graphical representation of the pca data can be consulted in montero et al 2017 fig 5 this analysis provided additional support for the hypothesis that the winter algal blooms are related to the superior skills of dinoflagellates to swim toward the upper levels in l 1 it also showed that significant increments in the o 2 concentration 8 0 15 0 ml l and in the ph values 8 0 9 0 were coincident with the peaks in phytoplankton content see fig 10 b a hypothetical explanation for those changes is as follows the dissolved o 2 increases due to the photosynthesis is associated with high rates of primary production and simultaneous consumption of dissolved inorganic matter producing co 2 depletion and consequently increasing the ph after bloom the original values of o 2 and ph are recovered due to community respiration a numerical model for the dynamics of o 2 and ph variations can be reviewed in e g petrovskii et al 2017 and hofmann et al 2008 their potential applications range from hypoxia studies in marine systems to ocean acidification including those aspects of the ecosystem dynamics in the current model is left for forthcoming work since it requires considering a more detailed description of the food web including bacteria doc and don along with additional observational data however it is worth noting that the current framework for structure preserving time integration and model calibration with ga can be used for models of arbitrary complexity 6 conclusions and further research we propose a numerical model for ecological processes occurring in semi enclosed marine water bodies characterized by sparse field data together with a robust methodology for its calibration the model is based on a two layer description of the water column the first layer corresponds to the euphotic zone where a biogeochemical model of npzd type simulates a mass conserving trophic web the mixing of the water column triggers primary production events zooplankton grazing boosts the flow of biomass through the food web while detritus content increases due to mortality and excretion biomass losses are taken into account through detritus sinking subsequently the ecosystem dynamics are described by strictly positive trajectories that correspond to the solution of an externally forced non autonomous system of odes a three stage time integration method based on the so called splitting composition techniques was formulated to solve the system the proposed algorithm produces discrete trajectories that are strictly positive along with providing exact estimations of the biomass balance the model is calibrated with a genetic algorithm based optimization procedure the model parameters are fine tuned using an evolutionary technique for assimilating field data with a focus on realistic primary production modeling among the model s advantages are i versatile design allowing it to accommodate other food webs without modifying the method used to solve the system while maintaining the trajectories structure preserving properties ii the positive character of the solutions enables a robust integration with genetic algorithms as base tools for calibration case studies since non realistic values for the state variables are automatically avoided and iii the resulting algorithm entails only explicit calculations circumventing time consuming tasks associated with iterative schemes thus resulting in a fast and efficient computer simulation tool the model was used to study of a winter bloom of dinoflagellates in an austral fjord 2015 montero et al 2017 the model s properties were determined using field observations and data from an oceanographic buoy the calibration procedure considered a relatively large number parameters 10 the ga based optimization searches revealed a parameter space involving multiple local maxima hindering the obtaining of a single set of optimal parameters sensitivity analysis identified the most stable parameters finally the model was applied to simulate the time history response of the ecosystem subjected to a sequence of three wind induced nutrient pulses the numerical simulations reproduced the primary production peaks along with biomass flow through the food web it was also possible to assess areal biomass production per km 2 during algal blooms future research should focus on acquiring higher quality field data to improve the model calibration and in particular to better characterize zooplankton grazing rate we recommend that the food web description be improved by including a temperature dependent rate of nutrient uptake along with specific state variables for the time evolution of o 2 content and ph variation with such improvements it should be possible to apply the model to study the seasonal cycle of primary production in general marine water bodies finally the proposed model could be used for studying the dynamic stability of the pfa s ecosystems under scenarios of
