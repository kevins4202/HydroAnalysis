6335,this study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in south america at multiple scales using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets terrestrial water storage changes from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and discharge measurements the remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep whilst the et constituents included the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam uncertainties in precipitation and et were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites respectively the water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003 2014 at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions overall mswep precipitation and gleam et provided fewer uncertainties whilst trmm and mod16 yielded greater bias and more errors better agreements between the twsc from grace and the water balance were found in the large and medium sized basins with a root mean squared error rmse of about 42 whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates where precipitation did not present strong seasonality had a rmse around 130 indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure the twsc from grace and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins mainly those located in tropical climate regions greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi arid basins with low runoff coefficients despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation et and twsc our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales keywords evapotranspiration precipitation terrestrial water storage validation water balance 1 introduction knowledge of the earth s surface and the atmosphere is essential for understanding how anthropogenic changes are affecting climate as well as their potential to impact the water cycle one of the possibilities for assessing such dynamics is the quantification of water and energy cycles estimates of the water balance enable us to understand water basins dynamics in relation to the changes they experience which is crucial in terms of water availability extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods and water resources management reichert et al 2017 sahoo et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 overall the in situ measurements of hydrological cycle components are not dense enough to cover the large spatial scales that represent surface heterogeneity or to provide an understanding of the dynamics of the water balance at larger spatial scales due to this particularly in developing countries large scale water balance estimation using in situ measurements is still a challenge gao et al 2010 sheffield et al 2009 to overcome this challenge remote sensing is a promising possibility for achieving water cycle component estimates at different spatial and temporal resolutions with the potential to provide data for regions with low density in situ measurements around the globe for example the number of available rain gauges and eddy covariance ec sites are not enough to reflect the surface and atmospheric heterogeneity remote sensing has the advantage of being able to provide observations of the earth s surface and atmosphere enabling analysis of the scenarios that account for natural variability land cover or climate changes gao et al 2010 since the launch of the twin satellites of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace in 2002 it has been possible to use remote sensing data for water balance estimations several studies have analyzed the water balance from remote sensing data in basins around the world azarderakhsh et al 2011 long et al 2014 maeda et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 2011 sahoo et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 swann and koven 2017 zhang et al 2018 sheffield et al 2009 presented one of the first attempts to apply remote sensing data to water balance estimation concluding that the water balance closure still could not be purely calculated using remote sensing estimations mainly due to problems with the overestimation of precipitation and uncertainties in the grace terrestrial water storage changes twsc data other studies have also been devoted to water balance estimations using remote sensing but most have acknowledged that uncertainties in the hydrological datasets are still a challenge for water balance assessment azarderakhsh et al 2011 gao et al 2010 oliveira et al 2014 sheffield et al 2009 however they have also agreed that such estimates offer significant information on water cycles and can be useful for studying climate change and extreme events in relation to water resources management particularly in regions where water is a limiting resource azarderakhsh et al 2011 sahoo et al 2011 some of these studies have highlighted gaps that demand further examination one of these is the water balance closure gao et al 2010 sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 sahoo et al 2011 and zhang et al 2018 proposed some data assimilation methods from various sources remote sensing in situ measurements reanalysis and land surface models for the purpose of evaluating the water balance closure a dataset combining water cycle variables from multiple sources with the climate data record on a monthly scale with a spatial resolution of 0 5 was developed by zhang et al 2018 aimed at providing spatially and temporally consistent water cycle variables which can help the scientific community to understand climate variability through water balance estimates understanding the origin of uncertainties in remote sensing products and their spatial variability is another critical issue that deserves further study investigation of the errors that can exist in these products is important for achieving future water cycle observation missions with fewer errors regarding water balance closure gao et al 2010 penatti et al 2015 sahoo et al 2011 there is also a need for studies to evaluate remote sensing products in different climatic regions and at different temporal scales since most studies have evaluated basins in the northern hemisphere long et al 2014 rodell et al 2004 senay et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 some basins have been studied in south america including the amazon basin azarderakhsh et al 2011 swann and koven 2017 and in the cerrado brazilian savanna and pantanal brazilian tropical wetland oliveira et al 2014 penatti et al 2015 biomes south america is a freshwater abundant continent with several large scale basins such as the amazon and the la plata the discharge from the amazon river contributes about 15 20 of the world s total discharge of fresh water to the ocean davidson and artaxo 2004 salati and vose 1984 whilst the la plata basins play an important role in south american agriculture and hydroelectricity production chen et al 2010 popescu et al 2012 tundisi et al 1998 on the other hand this region has been affected by hydrological extremes in recent years such as the occurrence of droughts 2005 and 2010 and floods 2009 and 2012 in the amazon and multiyear droughts in northeastern 2012 2015 and southeastern 2014 2015 brazil which had significant effects on the water supply marengo 2014 marengo et al 2016 nobre et al 2016 future projections by the intergovernmental panel on climate change suggest more numerous occurrences of extreme hydrological events that will mainly affect the amazon and northeastern regions with a greater frequency intensity and duration of dry seasons and the occurrence of heavy rains in the southern region of brazil marengo 2014 fischer et al 2017 in this context remote sensing estimations of the terrestrial water cycle become important tools for comprehensively understanding the water dynamics in south america in this regard we aimed to analyze the water balance accuracy through different remote sensing datasets at multiple basin scales across south america covering a wide range of biomes and climatic conditions the following scientific questions helped shape the development of this research 1 how consistent are precipitation and et remote sensing estimations over south america 2 do current remote sensing products provide advances in twsc and discharge derived from the water balance 3 how does scale effect can influence of the water balance closure accuracy our methodology included an evaluation of each remote sensing dataset against observed measurements we then used the remote sensing estimations to calculate the twsc as a residual of the simplified water balance equation from small to large basins in south america including as yet unevaluated basins most of the previous studies cover well monitored basins in the northern hemisphere or only large basins in south america finally to understand the potential of remote sensing for evaluating the terrestrial water cycle we assessed the uncertainties in the water balance using estimated errors for each independent hydrological variable 2 dataset descriptions and methodological analysis 2 1 study area the water balance was evaluated in south america on a monthly time scale in 50 wide basins under a range of climatic regimes for 2003 through 2014 the discharge stations of brazilian water agency ana and the argentina hydrological network bdhi the basin areas ec sites used in the study and land cover type for south america are presented in fig 1 further information about the size location biome and climatic conditions of the basins are presented in supplementary information table si1 the largest basins are concentrated in the amazon region the largest tropical rainforest in the world at around 7 million km2 and covering about 40 of south america these experiences significant influence from the local to global climate due to the exchange between the surface and the atmosphere cohen et al 2007 recently the amazon basin was affected by extreme droughts in 2005 and 2010 lewis et al 2011 marengo 2008 and floods in 2009 2012 and 2014 which caused enormous social and economic losses azarderakhsh et al 2011 marengo et al 2012 marengo 2014 sena et al 2012 some of the basins are located at the heart of south america in the cerrado biome the cerrado is the second largest biome in south america covering about 22 of brazil and is extremely important for water resources availability because it is the source area of several large basins in brazil i e the são francisco which carries water to the semi arid region of northeastern brazil the cerrado also has great relevance in regard to groundwater with a large area of the guarani aquifer system located in this biome oliveira et al 2014 furthermore it is considered to be a hotspot of biodiversity with many endemic species of fauna and flora hunke et al 2015 oliveira et al 2014 sano et al 2010 tropical and subtropical basins are located in the la plata basin the second largest basin in south america after the amazon which covers brazil argentina paraguay bolivia and uruguay this basin is highly populated and has great economic importance due to the intensive agriculture and hydropower generation that occurs there however it has recurrent problems with droughts floods and intensive water use chen et al 2010 the drought and flood events have caused severe economic and social losses here cavalcanti et al 2015 pasquini and depetris 2007 such as the droughts that occurred in 1999 2000 2006 chen et al 2010 and 2009 abelen et al 2015 and the floods in 1982 1983 1992 1997 1998 2002 2003 2007 cavalcanti et al 2015 chen et al 2010 and 2009 2010 abelen et al 2015 one of the largest hydropower plants in the world the itaipu plant in terms of power generation is located in this basin having a capacity of 14 000 mw being responsible for 20 of the hydropower energy consumed in brazil and supplying 80 of the electricity consumed in paraguay nóbregaet al 2011 von sperling 2012 in southern southeastern and eastern brazil the available water resources are essential for irrigation urban water supply and for hydropower generation extensive crops of irrigated rice are in the uruguay and south atlantic basins representing around 70 of brazil s production 12 4 of brazil s total area lies in the south atlantic and 7 9 in the uruguay basins these have a high demand for water ana 2015 conab 2015 thus the largest consumption in these basins is for irrigation 66 in the south atlantic and 82 in the uruguay basin 2 2 remote sensing dataset descriptions precipitation and et datasets that were based on remote sensing estimations that were commonly used well validated and available at the global scale were selected to assess water balance in this study for precipitation we used the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep datasets and for et we used modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 and global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam we also used terrestrial water storage changes from grace available from 2002 present a basin average for each remote sensing dataset was used to evaluate the terrestrial water balance in south america 2 2 1 precipitation we used two different satellite based precipitation products trmm3b43 version 7 huffman et al 2007 and mswep version 2 1 beck et al 2017a the first precipitation dataset used was that of the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa used to estimate tropical and subtropical rainfall the tmpa datasets combine multiple satellite precipitation estimates and rain gauge measurements with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 3 hourly daily and monthly temporal resolutions the trmm 3b43 dataset extended from 50 n to 50 s and covered the period from january 1998 to the present huffman et al 2010 2007 mswep a global dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and 3 hourly daily and monthly temporal resolution was specifically designed for hydrological modeling beck et al 2017a the time series extends from january 1979 to december 2016 the mswep dataset merges several high quality precipitation datasets including rain gauge measurements satellite observations and reanalysis data as a function of timescale and location beck et al 2017a 2 2 2 evapotranspiration two global terrestrial et datasets were used mod16 version 5 mu et al 2011 and gleam version 3 2 martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011a both et estimations were based on 8 day averages for computing uncertainties and on monthly time scale for computing the water balance the mod16 and gleam et datasets are global and combine remote sensing images and meteorological reanalysis data the mod16 algorithm mu et al 2011 is based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 penman 1948 and considers both the surface energy partitioning and atmospheric drivers on et to estimate et at the 8 day and monthly time scales at a spatial resolution ranging from 500 m to 0 05 the inputs include remote sensing and global meteorological reanalysis data the remote sensing inputs are derived from modis and include the land cover classification leaf area index lai fraction of photosynthetically active radiation and albedo the daily meteorological inputs include shortwave incident radiation air temperature and specific humidity from the global modeling and assimilation office gmao modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra reanalysis datasets which have a spatial resolution of 0 5 x 0 6 the gleam algorithms are based on the priestley taylor equation and were developed to estimate terrestrial evaporative fluxes at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a daily temporal scale the gleam separates the terrestrial components of et into canopy transpiration soil and open water evaporation interception loss and sublimation each grid cell consists of four different fractions of land cover bare soil sparse vegetation dense vegetation and open water the evaporative flux is computed separately for each cover fraction and then aggregated at the pixel scale the priestley taylor equation is used to calculate the potential et and then convert this to actual et according to the land cover and an evaporative stress factor the latter estimated from the root zone soil moisture and vegetation water content martens et al 2016 2017 miralles et al 2011a 2014 2 2 3 terrestrial water storage the grace mission was launched in 2002 with the main purpose of mapping variations in the earth s gravitational field by measuring the distance between two orbiting satellites landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 tapley et al 2004 the available grace data are anomalies relative to a time mean baseline and so twsc can be obtained as the time derivative of the anomalies long et al 2014 three different research centers process grace data the geoforschungszentrum gfz the center of space research csr university of texas and nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl we used a simple average of the three different solutions gfz csr and jpl to reduce the noise in the gravity field grace solutions sakumura et al 2014 a summary of the remote sensing dataset used to assess the terrestrial water balance in south america is presented in table 1 2 3 surface observations 2 3 1 river discharge measurements to evaluate the water balance across 50 wide basins located in south america we used daily discharge measurements from the ana and bdhi networks for 2003 to 2014 we selected discharge stations with minimal failures during the period of study since we did not gap fill the data the respective datasets are available at http hidroweb ana gov br and at http bdhi hidricosargentina gob ar 2 3 2 precipitation measurements we also used monthly precipitation measurements from 265 and 42 rain gauges from the brazilian national institute of meteorology and bdhi network respectively to evaluate the accuracy of the remote sensing precipitation estimations trmm and mswep as in discharge measurements we did not gap fill in rain gauges since we used a monthly temporal data provided by agencies with minimal failure for 2003 2014 the respective datasets are available at http www inmet gov br projetos rede pesquisa and at http bdhi hidricosargentina gob ar 2 3 3 evapotranspiration measurements the et uncertainties mod16 and gleam were evaluated using 16 ec site measurements covering a wide range of land use and climatic conditions in brazil the ec monitoring sites used are part of the large scale biosphere and atmosphere experiment in the amazon lba davidson and artaxo 2004 gonçalveset al 2013 keller et al 2004 and the south brazilian network of surface fluxes and climate change sulflux roberti et al 2012 the lba is an international program that was created in 1993 and is a pioneer in studies of interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere in a region of great human and natural complexity important results from the program have been summarized by davidson et al 2012 and keller et al 2009 the sulflux network is a scientific and interinstitutional cooperation created in 2008 with the goal of establishing a network for the continuous and extended period measurement of water energy and carbon dioxide flux involved with interactions between the surface and atmosphere in the ecosystems of southern brazil based on several experimental sites located in different land use and land cover sites roberti et al 2012 the ec sites have been extensively described see references in table 2 in terms of their environmental characteristics the equipment used the measurement procedures gap filling methods and data validation we used 30 minute and daily measured latent heat le to evaluate the et estimations of the lba and sulflux datasets respectively for the lba datasets we used data with quality control and analysis for sulflux the datasets were filtered to remove spurious values considering only the measurements 50 le 650 w m 2 for sites prs and cas 40 le 650 w m 2 for sites sma and pas and 50 le 700 w m 2 for site cra site we excluded data for global radiation 10 and le 100 w m 2 at night and during the occurrence of precipitation for both datasets we did not gap fill the data to close the energy balance in order to avoid circularity in the model assessment to convert measured le w m 2 to et mm we used eq 1 to compute the daily and 8 day average et we used a maximum gap of 25 following fisher et al 2009 when the number of missing data exceeded 25 we excluded the daily and 8 day average 1 et le λ where λ mj kg 1 is the le of vaporization for liquid water

balance and uncertainty analysis to evaluate the water balance eq 6 from 2003 to 2014 in south america we used the monthly average between two observation periods getirana et al 2014 oliveira et al 2014 rodell et al 2004 2011 sheffield et al 2009 6 ds dt p t 1 p t 2 et t 1 et t 2 q t 1 q t 2 where s is the terrestrial water storage p is precipitation and q is the basin discharge with all variables in mm month 1 each variable was cumulated at time t as remote sensing inputs for precipitation we used the trmm and mswep datasets whilst for et we used mod16 and gleam considering that grace terrestrial water storage tws anomalies were given at irregularly timed intervals we computed these changes as the difference between two grace points representing the average change in terrestrial water storage long et al 2014 oliveira et al 2014 eq 7 7 ds dt tws dt tw s t 1 t w s t δ t uncertainties in the monthly estimates of the water balance were assessed by combining the individual uncertainties for precipitation et and discharge assuming that the errors in these variables are independent and normally distributed the relative uncertainty was given by the quadrature sum of errors of each variable equation 8 long et al 2014 rodell et al 2004 2011 senay et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 8 υ dsdt υ p 2 p 2 υ et 2 et 2 υ q 2 q 2 p e t q where υ is the relative uncertainty for each component of the water balance the water balance uncertainty was computed at the 95 confidence interval as υ dsdt the uncertainties in each component of the precipitation and et estimations were assessed as the standard deviations of the differences between observed and estimated data at the 307 rain gauges and 16 ec sites respectively at the basin level the precipitation uncertainties were averaged using rain gauge stations that were located in each basin whilst for et we computed the uncertainties for each land cover and then averaged for each basin according to the percentage of area occupied by the land cover class we used mcd12q1 for 2008 as the reference for assessing land use and land cover for discharge we considered an uncertainty of 10 as used by rodell et al 2011 and double of the uncertainty as used by rodell et al 2004 some studies have considered a 10 15 uncertainty approximation for discharge measurements to be reasonable bjerklie et al 2003 coe et al 2002 we also computed the grace uncertainties for each basin the grace anomalies data have measurement and leakage errors measurement errors are associated with instrument and loss signal retrieval errors whilst leakage errors are related to the filtering process landerer and swenson 2012 rodell et al 2011 eq 9 9 total e r r o r leakage e r r o r 2 measurement e r r o r 2 since grace errors are correlated in nearby pixels we computed the covariance as specified at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land maeda et al 2017 rodell et al 2011 then to compute errors in the twsc we multiplied the errors by 2 rodell et al 2004 2011 to evaluate the water balance under distinct climatic conditions we computed the runoff coefficient qcoeff for each basin this is a dimensionless coefficient that relates the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received guimberteau et al 2013 eq 10 10 q coeff q p where q and p are average discharge and precipitation for 2003 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainties in precipitation and et estimations we assessed the individual uncertainties of the precipitation and et remote sensing estimations to compute the water balance uncertainties but due to the spatial distribution of the rain gauges and ec sites we only evaluated the water balance uncertainties for 24 basins 3 1 1 uncertainties in precipitation fig 2 shows the statistical metrics between the rain gauges and mswep and trmm the mswep precipitation yielded a slightly higher accuracy 71 of rain gauges r 0 90 than the trmm estimations around 60 for the rmse both precipitation dataset generally presented more errors in the brazilian northeast 40 60 for trmm errors between 20 and 40 were verified in most rain gauges whilst for mswep fewer errors 0 20 were shown for the amazon and southern brazil mswep presented underestimations for 74 of the rain gauges mainly in southern and northeastern coastal brazil in contrast about 66 of the rain gauges assessed against trmm presented overestimations southern southeastern and northeastern brazil whilst on the northeastern coast of brazil trmm underestimated the precipitation these results agree with oliveira et al 2014 who assessed the water balance in the brazilian cerrado using precipitation from trmm 3b42 versions 6 and 7 and found overestimations mainly in the southern and underestimations in the northeastern brazilian cerrado with a lower bias for trmm version 7 rozante et al 2010 also verified underestimates on the east coast of the northeastern region of brazil attributing this to the occurrence of warm clouds and overestimates at the borders between argentina paraguay and brazil due cold top clouds the precipitation uncertainties in mswep and trmm presented similar results fig 3 with more than half of the rain gauges showing uncertainties of between 0 and 40 overall mswep yielded a mean uncertainty of about 37 whilst for trmm this value was 39 more uncertainties were observed mainly in northeastern brazil downstream of the paraná river and in all the rain gauges in argentina for both precipitation datasets our results agree with those of salio et al 2015 who reported that rainfall estimates that included microwave and infrared information that gave remarkable results improved by the incorporation of measured rainfall data into their calibration algorithms and also with those of beck et al 2017b who assessed 22 precipitation datasets for the entire world and verified that mswep version 2 0 demonstrated higher accuracy for all climate conditions when compared to other datasets with a higher performance mainly attributed to the incorporation of a daily rain gauge correction scheme whilst the datasets that incorporated monthly rain gauge data presented inferior performance a full statistical validation of mswep and trmm are presented in supplementary information tables si2 and si3 3 1 2 uncertainties in evapotranspiration in contrast to other studies that have evaluated et uncertainty using theoretical values or et model estimations azarderakhsh et al 2011 oliveira et al 2014 we used 16 ec measurements from different land use and land cover conditions for each land cover type we computed the standard deviation of the difference between et remote sensing estimations and ec measurements allowing the association of these uncertainties in 37 basins table 3 and fig 4 show the et uncertainties at all ec sites and in selected basins overall the gleam et presented lower uncertainties for mostly ec sites than mod16 for gleam et a range of between 16 and 33 was observed yielding higher accuracy for ec sites located on grassland 15 61 followed by savanna and forest 18 54 and 18 67 respectively whilst lower accuracy was found in the ec sites covered by cropland pasture located in amazon and pampa biomes 32 72 and 23 48 respectively for the mod16 et higher performance was verified over forest and savanna 22 14 and 24 78 respectively with lower accuracy for ec sites located on cropland pasture and grassland for all evaluated biomes ranging from 30 22 to 55 93 our results are comparable to those of michel et al 2016 and khan et al 2018 who evaluated et estimations including mod16 and gleam using ec measurements and of liu et al 2016 who compared different et products against the annual water balance et estimates verifying a superior performance of gleam et estimates although they did not find significant discrepancies between the et models evaluated overall these studies have emphasized that mod16 underestimates et and gleam performs relatively better than the other models including mod16 mainly due to the detailed parameterization of interception losses in tall and short vegetation and the use of microwave information as presented by miralles et al 2011a b and martens et al 2017 fig 5 presents the statistical metrics between observed and estimated et for all ec sites the results indicate a higher correlation coefficient and lower rmse and negative bias mostly for the gleam et indicating that the model is closer to the tower measured et even with a spatial resolution of 0 25 the superior gleam performance compared to that of mod16 may be associated with its grounding in the priestley taylor equation with a small number of inputs particularly considering the use of datasets based on satellite observations from various well validated sources thus minimizing the use of modeled data and parameterizations in addition the model has a minimal dependence on static data which avoids the need for parameter adjustments enabling the et estimations to rely on the accuracy of the remote sensing data used as input miralles et al 2011b 2016 different performances of the et models may be associated with the respective input data and algorithms used as observed by khan et al 2018 and xue et al 2013 mod16 may present low performance due to uncertainties in the input data such as the land cover and use map mcd12q1 product and lai mod15a2 product which uses a simplified version of the land cover and use map for its estimations and meteorological reanalysis data from gmao merra therefore such uncertainties may imply less accuracy in the parameters used in the mod16 algorithm and consequently of the et estimate khan et al 2018 ruhoff et al 2013 it is also important to consider the mismatch between the ec footprint and the et estimations based on remote sensing usually footprint peaks range from a few times the measurement height to a few dozen times for unstable and stable atmospheric conditions respectively aubinet et al 2012 whilst the remote sensing inputs used to estimate et present moderate to low spatial resolution thus much of the surface fluxes are lost in remote sensing models when the spatial resolution is degraded resulting in an increased likelihood of discrepancies in the ec measurements li et al 2008 despite the different spatial resolutions between mod16 and gleam to assess mod16 we used a 3x3 pixels window 500 m et mod16 and for gleam a radius of 25 km surrounding each flux tower to compute average et our results are consistent with those of previous studies which evaluated these et models using ec measurements and verified their good agreement with the in situ measurements khan et al 2018 miralles et al 2011a mu et al 2011 in addition inaccuracies in the ec measurements referred to as the energy balance non closure problem can also be a source of uncertainty several studies have reported on the energy balance closure problem which generally underestimates the turbulent fluxes sum of latent and sensible heat over the available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux araújo 2002 borma et al 2009 foken et al 2006 da rocha et al 2009 wilson 2002 for the ec sites located in the brazilian amazon and cerrado as used in this study da rocha et al 2009 reported an energy balance imbalance between of 0 70 and 1 05 a full statistical assessment between the observed and estimated from the mod16 and gleam et are presented in supplementary information table si4 3 2 uncertainties in the terrestrial water balance the uncertainties in the twsc and discharge for all combinations of the precipitation and et remote sensing datasets are presented in fig 6 for the twsc our results indicate uncertainties ranging between 44 and 96 mm month 1 and medians of between 43 and 22 mm month 1 for the combinations of mswep precipitation and gleam et for most basins on the other hand the combination of trmm precipitation and mod16 et presented higher medians ranging between 44 and 50 mm month 1 and uncertainties of between 38 to 112 mm month 1 overall for mswep precipitation and gleam et the median of the uncertainties ranged from 9 to 22 mm month 1 in the tocantins são francisco paraná northeastern and eastern atlantic basins in the amazon uruguay and south atlantic basins the median of uncertainties ranged between 60 and 21 mm month 1 the results also showed that the lowest uncertainties in discharge were observed for the combination of mswep precipitation and gleam et presenting a lower median and amplitude followed by the combinations trmm gleam mswep mod16 and trmm mod16 for instance at the óbidos station amazon basin the median uncertainty was 55 mm month 1 ranging between 39 and 72 mm month 1 using the combination of mswep gleam combination whilst for trmm mod16 the median uncertainty was around 65 mm month 1 ranging between 49 and 86 mm month 1 these results demonstrate close agreement with the mswep and gleam accuracy assessment when compared to the measured rainfall and et respectively in different climatic conditions and land use cover several studies have analyzed the uncertainties of discharge and et estimates from the water balance perspective and the results are summarized in table 4 azarderakhsh et al 2011 long et al 2014 oliveira et al 2014 rodell et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 those references adopted discharge uncertainties ranging between 5 and 10 and estimated the twsc uncertainties in a similar way to the way we estimated ours however for the precipitation and et uncertainties different methodologies were adopted some studies computed the uncertainties in precipitation and et through the difference between remote sensing estimations and modeled data rodell et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 or used uncertainties based on the literature azarderakhsh et al 2011 maeda et al 2017 we adopted the standard deviation of the difference between the remote sensing estimations and the measured data for et the uncertainty assessments were mostly based on the literature references azarderakhsh et al 2011 oliveira et al 2014 or were calculated using multiple et datasets long et al 2014 there is no agreement yet about the methodology for determining et uncertainties because it is still a challenge to obtain measured et data at consistent spatial and temporal scales the results found in this study for the basins located in the cerrado tocantins paraná and são francisco are similar to the results presented by oliveira et al 2014 and rodell et al 2011 for the combination mswep gleam we found lower discharge uncertainties 36 91 29 40 and 26 54 mm month 1 than in oliveira et al 2014 with the use of trmm mod16 they found 600 600 and 450 mm year 1 in the tocantins paraná and são francisco basins respectively similar results were also observed the for et uncertainty in the tocantins basin where the combination trmm mod16 and mswep gleam resulted in lower uncertainties 53 55 and 49 31 mm month 1 respectively than those found by rodell et al 2011 about 2 mm day 1 azarderakhsh et al 2011 evaluated different combinations of water balance by remote sensing in 14 sub basins in the amazon basin and found lower discharge uncertainties for the combinations trmm mod16 uncertainties of 23 and global precipitation climatology project gpcp mod16 uncertainties of 15 in the óbidos station amazon basin for the combination gpcp mod16 azarderakhsh et al 2011 found discharge uncertainties of 1 17 mmm day 1 or 35 1 mm month 1 whilst we found uncertainties of 45 45 mm month 1 using the combination mswep gleam compared to other studies our results demonstrate that the evaluation of water balance uncertainties derives a strong influence from estimations of the individual uncertainties of the inputs used in this context the establishment of methods for estimating uncertainties is of the utmost importance for improving our understanding of the terrestrial water cycle as reported in other studies gao et al 2010 maeda et al 2017 oliveira et al 2014 rodell et al 2011 sahoo et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 we have verified that precipitation and twsc are the main contributors to water balance total errors but overall the highest errors are from the precipitation datasets the precipitation data presented higher uncertainties than for et with the average ranging between 23 and 46 for trmm and 20 to 45 for mswep the uncertainties calculated against the ec measurements for the two et models were between 22 and 33 for the mod16 values and less for gleam with values ranging between 19 and 22 for the twsc based on grace the uncertainties are also lower than for precipitation ranging from 23 to 89 mm month 1 for all evaluated basins in addition higher uncertainties in precipitation were observed during the wet season in agreement with maeda et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 which verifies that the highest precipitation uncertainties are mainly due to the lack of in situ gauges in the region such as in the amazon basin and to an increase in precipitation measurement errors by remote sensing products during the rainy season we calculated the imbalance as the difference between the twsc from the water balance and from grace as presented in fig 7 a higher mean negative imbalance was found in the amazon basins where there are high et and discharge rates that are equivalent to or greater than the precipitation when summed in the tocantins and são francisco basins similar imbalance values were verified with the median being close to 10 mm month 1 although the water balance closure has yet to be achieved using the current remote sensing datasets we verified a close agreement with previous studies that merged multiple sources to close the water balance for example sahoo et al 2011 merged precipitation and et from multiple remote sensing datasets and found an imbalance of between 70 and 50 mm month 1 in the amazon basin using a similar methodology pan et al 2012 found mean imbalances close to zero with values ranging seasonally in the amazon basin whilst zhang et al 2018 using data assimilation techniques found a non closure of 46 mm year 1 for the amazon and 47 mm year 1 for the paraná basins 3 3 assessment of water balance dynamics considering the multiple basins in south america under different climatic conditions and at different spatial scales we evaluated whether the water balance accuracy and dynamics would change as a result of a basin scale effect fig 8 shows a scatterplot of the twsc from grace and the remote sensing based water balance grouped into small 100 000 km2 medium sized 100 000 500 000 km2 and large 500 000 km2 basins in the largest basins we found the highest correlation coefficients r 0 85 and 0 89 and rmses of around 58 and 42 for the medium sized and large basins respectively on the other hand basins with areas of less than 100 000 km2 presented a correlation coefficient of about 0 64 and a rmse of 130 the results for small basins can be explained by the growth grace errors inversely proportional to area size and this way higher errors will be more pronounced in small basins landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 our results agree with rodell et al 2011 that evaluated et from water balance in some global basins verified higher errors in water balance estimates over smaller basins and suggested that this fact can be primarily explained by the growth of grace errors in small area however we also found a good performance in the small basins predominantly under tropical wet dry and tropical monsoon climates bacabal 25 500 km2 downstream mearim river cantanhede 49 900 km2 downstream itapecuru river and peixe gordo 47 800 km2 downstream jaguaribe river presented more accurate results for water balance showing a correlation coefficients of about 0 88 and rmse of 62 close to those verified for medium sized basins in addition medium sized basins located in regions with moist climates in southern of brazil garruchos 116 000 km2 upstream uruguay river uruguaiana 190 000 km2 downstream uruguay river yielded correlation coefficients of 0 56 and rmse of 168 with results similar to those found for the small basins although the results have shown better performance in larger basins they also show that a basin s climatic conditions can influence the water balance accuracy because medium sized under subtropical climates with weak seasonal precipitation had higher errors than small basins in tropical climate in this context we also evaluated which hydrological conditions yielded more accurate results between measured discharge and that derived from the water balance fig 9 presents scatterplots of the runoff coefficient rmse and correlation coefficient for discharge from the water balance in the amazon basins we found higher qcoeff ranging from 0 55 to 0 72 mainly in the western northwestern and mainstream regions with a rmse in the discharge of 39 except for some basins located in the southeastern region where the rmse was 99 in the tocantins and high são francisco basins we found qcoeff of 0 27 and 0 25 and rmses of 132 and 194 respectively whilst for the medium and low são francisco basins characterized by semi arid climates qcoeff decresed to 0 15 and the rmse increased to 420 for the other basins influenced by in semi arid and arid climates such as the northeastern atlantic basin in brazil and the salado river basin in argentina with a qcoef 0 06 we found a rmse of more than 364 these results indicate that in semi arid basins discharge derived from the remote sensing water balance presented low accuracy whilst in the other basins influenced mainly by tropical and subtropical climates such as the amazon paraná and uruguay basins high accuracy between the water balance and measured discharge were observed overall satisfactory water balance results were obtained for most of the evaluated basins 76 where both the grace twsc and remote sensing based water balance showed the same seasonal pattern of twsc fig 10 basins with large areas predominantly tropical climatic regions with seasonal precipitation yielded correlation coefficients of around 0 89 and a rmse 48 on the other hand smaller basins mainly located in subtropical climatic regions showed results with an average correlation coefficient of about 0 52 and a rmse of 164 a high accuracy between the remote sensing based water balance and the grace twsc was found in the amazon basin and sub basins that have predominantly tropical humid climates and high water and energy available throughout the year the average precipitation was around 123 249 mm month 1 with pronounced seasonal cycles related to the occurrence of the monsoon system and a water discharge of around 45 168 mm month 1 regarding et the remote sensing estimations showed weak seasonal cycles with values about 95 139 mm month 1 recently maeda et al 2017 evaluated et seasonality across the amazon basin and observed variations in average et values among five sub basins in the solimões basin the highest et values were determined in the drier months september and october whilst in the southern basins purus madeira and tapajós the highest et rates were found in the months with higher precipitation rates november january and november respectively according to this study the maximum et rates did not correspond to the maximum precipitation rates nor to the maximum radiation thus supporting the assumption that et in the amazon is regulated by a balance of radiation precipitation and vegetation physiological control rather than being exclusively limited by one of these factors restrepo coupe et al 2013 the tocantins são francisco and paraná basins are mainly in the cerrado biome with a coverage of semi decidual and decidual forests and seasonal precipitation and et rates reboita et al 2010 da rocha et al 2009 found higher values during the rainy season and lower values during the dry season in transitional forests floodplains and in the cerrado woodlands due to the decline of photosynthesis and a strong seasonality in lai with the et patterns probably being driven by soil moisture availability in these basins a moderate accuracy between the remote sensing based and grace twsc was found average values for basins tocantins r 0 92 rmse 41 são francisco r 0 87 rmse 50 paraná r 0 73 rmse 120 agreeing with oliveira et al 2014 tocantins r 0 93 são francisco r 0 91 paraná r 0 87 indicating that the grace estimations are capable of representing water storage change in the cerrado basins providing information on the seasonality dynamics of the water balance in these basins sun et al 2016 analyzed drought events in the são francisco basin and showed that the tws might be a good indicator of extreme water conditions such as droughts and floods events in this context our results support those of previous studies oliveira et al 2014 sheffield et al 2009 sun et al 2016 which demonstrated the good grace twsc agreement with the remote sensing based water balance our results on basins of the cerrado biome demonstrate a precipitation decrease in the são francisco basin at traipu station of around 21 and 20 in 2007 and 2012 2014 respectively when droughts were recorded in the region paredes trejo et al 2016 sun et al 2016 in the uruguay basin at the uruguaiana station and also other basins in humid subtropical climates we found the smallest correlation coefficients around 0 50 between the twsc from grace and the remote sensing based water balance with a rmse of around 160 in this region precipitation was less seasonal with the highest values associated with cold frontal systems do nascimento et al 2016 reboita et al 2010 as observed by do nascimento et al 2016 in these basins the highest et values are not related to higher water availability as in the cerrado basins here precipitation is well distributed throughout the year with higher et rates being related to higher energy availability during the summer months december to march the grace twsc presented a less significant relation with the remote sensing based water balance in these basins compared to those in the amazon tocantins and the northern northeastern atlantic basins one explanation for this may be basin size these being generally small 56 000 km2 on average compared to those in other regions with higher correlation coefficients areas of 664 000 km2 and even 5 million km2 basins since grace errors are inversely proportional to area and the highest uncertainties are more pronounced in small basins landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 4 conclusions the results of this research demonstrate that trmm and mswep precipitation present a similar seasonal pattern in south american basins with mswep yielding higher accuracy and lower uncertainty values than trmm for et uncertainty we verified higher correlation coefficients and lower rmse for gleam et for most ec sites then we found that the lowest uncertainties for precipitation were observed for the combination of mswep precipitation and gleam et estimations we found imbalances in the water balance for all these basins which resulted from individual errors in the remote sensing datasets even though we verified that the water balance closure has yet to be achieved our results demonstrate agreement with previous studies that used merging techniques for multiple variable sources in situ observation satellite remote sensing land surface model and reanalysis better agreements between the twsc from grace and the remote sensing water balance were found for medium 100 000 to 500 000 km2 and large basins 500 000 km2 however the climatic conditions are also important since we found good results in small basins mainly influenced by tropical climates and worse results in medium sized basins that experienced subtropical humid climates basins in semi arid regions presented the lowest runoff coefficients and the highest discharge rmse indicating that high errors can be found for discharge calculated from the water balance in basins under semi arid conditions in south america finally the water balance performance demonstrated satisfactory results for more than half of the basins where nearly 76 presented correlation coefficients of 0 89 and rmse of 48 between the twsc from grace and the water balance less accurate agreements were found in the southern brazil basins under a predominantly humid subtropical climate this region presents high precipitation rates through the year with no defined dry or wet seasons this feature was evaluated and we determined that basins with higher rates of precipitation and seasonality yield better agreements between the twsc from the water balance and from grace showing that is necessary to advance the understanding of water balance dynamics under humid subtropical climate to understand limitations on grace data use and water balance using on remote sensing in these regions although water balance closure using current remote sensing data has not been achieved yet this study underscores some important information about water balance cycle dynamics related to the basin scale and climatic conditions for multiple basins in south america these results reinforce the great potential of remote sensing data in hydrological studies declaration of

6335,this study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in south america at multiple scales using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets terrestrial water storage changes from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and discharge measurements the remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep whilst the et constituents included the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam uncertainties in precipitation and et were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites respectively the water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003 2014 at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions overall mswep precipitation and gleam et provided fewer uncertainties whilst trmm and mod16 yielded greater bias and more errors better agreements between the twsc from grace and the water balance were found in the large and medium sized basins with a root mean squared error rmse of about 42 whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates where precipitation did not present strong seasonality had a rmse around 130 indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure the twsc from grace and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins mainly those located in tropical climate regions greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi arid basins with low runoff coefficients despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation et and twsc our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales keywords evapotranspiration precipitation terrestrial water storage validation water balance 1 introduction knowledge of the earth s surface and the atmosphere is essential for understanding how anthropogenic changes are affecting climate as well as their potential to impact the water cycle one of the possibilities for assessing such dynamics is the quantification of water and energy cycles estimates of the water balance enable us to understand water basins dynamics in relation to the changes they experience which is crucial in terms of water availability extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods and water resources management reichert et al 2017 sahoo et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 overall the in situ measurements of hydrological cycle components are not dense enough to cover the large spatial scales that represent surface heterogeneity or to provide an understanding of the dynamics of the water balance at larger spatial scales due to this particularly in developing countries large scale water balance estimation using in situ measurements is still a challenge gao et al 2010 sheffield et al 2009 to overcome this challenge remote sensing is a promising possibility for achieving water cycle component estimates at different spatial and temporal resolutions with the potential to provide data for regions with low density in situ measurements around the globe for example the number of available rain gauges and eddy covariance ec sites are not enough to reflect the surface and atmospheric heterogeneity remote sensing has the advantage of being able to provide observations of the earth s surface and atmosphere enabling analysis of the scenarios that account for natural variability land cover or climate changes gao et al 2010 since the launch of the twin satellites of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace in 2002 it has been possible to use remote sensing data for water balance estimations several studies have analyzed the water balance from remote sensing data in basins around the world azarderakhsh et al 2011 long et al 2014 maeda et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 2011 sahoo et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 swann and koven 2017 zhang et al 2018 sheffield et al 2009 presented one of the first attempts to apply remote sensing data to water balance estimation concluding that the water balance closure still could not be purely calculated using remote sensing estimations mainly due to problems with the overestimation of precipitation and uncertainties in the grace terrestrial water storage changes twsc data other studies have also been devoted to water balance estimations using remote sensing but most have acknowledged that uncertainties in the hydrological datasets are still a challenge for water balance assessment azarderakhsh et al 2011 gao et al 2010 oliveira et al 2014 sheffield et al 2009 however they have also agreed that such estimates offer significant information on water cycles and can be useful for studying climate change and extreme events in relation to water resources management particularly in regions where water is a limiting resource azarderakhsh et al 2011 sahoo et al 2011 some of these studies have highlighted gaps that demand further examination one of these is the water balance closure gao et al 2010 sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 sahoo et al 2011 and zhang et al 2018 proposed some data assimilation methods from various sources remote sensing in situ measurements reanalysis and land surface models for the purpose of evaluating the water balance closure a dataset combining water cycle variables from multiple sources with the climate data record on a monthly scale with a spatial resolution of 0 5 was developed by zhang et al 2018 aimed at providing spatially and temporally consistent water cycle variables which can help the scientific community to understand climate variability through water balance estimates understanding the origin of uncertainties in remote sensing products and their spatial variability is another critical issue that deserves further study investigation of the errors that can exist in these products is important for achieving future water cycle observation missions with fewer errors regarding water balance closure gao et al 2010 penatti et al 2015 sahoo et al 2011 there is also a need for studies to evaluate remote sensing products in different climatic regions and at different temporal scales since most studies have evaluated basins in the northern hemisphere long et al 2014 rodell et al 2004 senay et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 some basins have been studied in south america including the amazon basin azarderakhsh et al 2011 swann and koven 2017 and in the cerrado brazilian savanna and pantanal brazilian tropical wetland oliveira et al 2014 penatti et al 2015 biomes south america is a freshwater abundant continent with several large scale basins such as the amazon and the la plata the discharge from the amazon river contributes about 15 20 of the world s total discharge of fresh water to the ocean davidson and artaxo 2004 salati and vose 1984 whilst the la plata basins play an important role in south american agriculture and hydroelectricity production chen et al 2010 popescu et al 2012 tundisi et al 1998 on the other hand this region has been affected by hydrological extremes in recent years such as the occurrence of droughts 2005 and 2010 and floods 2009 and 2012 in the amazon and multiyear droughts in northeastern 2012 2015 and southeastern 2014 2015 brazil which had significant effects on the water supply marengo 2014 marengo et al 2016 nobre et al 2016 future projections by the intergovernmental panel on climate change suggest more numerous occurrences of extreme hydrological events that will mainly affect the amazon and northeastern regions with a greater frequency intensity and duration of dry seasons and the occurrence of heavy rains in the southern region of brazil marengo 2014 fischer et al 2017 in this context remote sensing estimations of the terrestrial water cycle become important tools for comprehensively understanding the water dynamics in south america in this regard we aimed to analyze the water balance accuracy through different remote sensing datasets at multiple basin scales across south america covering a wide range of biomes and climatic conditions the following scientific questions helped shape the development of this research 1 how consistent are precipitation and et remote sensing estimations over south america 2 do current remote sensing products provide advances in twsc and discharge derived from the water balance 3 how does scale effect can influence of the water balance closure accuracy our methodology included an evaluation of each remote sensing dataset against observed measurements we then used the remote sensing estimations to calculate the twsc as a residual of the simplified water balance equation from small to large basins in south america including as yet unevaluated basins most of the previous studies cover well monitored basins in the northern hemisphere or only large basins in south america finally to understand the potential of remote sensing for evaluating the terrestrial water cycle we assessed the uncertainties in the water balance using estimated errors for each independent hydrological variable 2 dataset descriptions and methodological analysis 2 1 study area the water balance was evaluated in south america on a monthly time scale in 50 wide basins under a range of climatic regimes for 2003 through 2014 the discharge stations of brazilian water agency ana and the argentina hydrological network bdhi the basin areas ec sites used in the study and land cover type for south america are presented in fig 1 further information about the size location biome and climatic conditions of the basins are presented in supplementary information table si1 the largest basins are concentrated in the amazon region the largest tropical rainforest in the world at around 7 million km2 and covering about 40 of south america these experiences significant influence from the local to global climate due to the exchange between the surface and the atmosphere cohen et al 2007 recently the amazon basin was affected by extreme droughts in 2005 and 2010 lewis et al 2011 marengo 2008 and floods in 2009 2012 and 2014 which caused enormous social and economic losses azarderakhsh et al 2011 marengo et al 2012 marengo 2014 sena et al 2012 some of the basins are located at the heart of south america in the cerrado biome the cerrado is the second largest biome in south america covering about 22 of brazil and is extremely important for water resources availability because it is the source area of several large basins in brazil i e the são francisco which carries water to the semi arid region of northeastern brazil the cerrado also has great relevance in regard to groundwater with a large area of the guarani aquifer system located in this biome oliveira et al 2014 furthermore it is considered to be a hotspot of biodiversity with many endemic species of fauna and flora hunke et al 2015 oliveira et al 2014 sano et al 2010 tropical and subtropical basins are located in the la plata basin the second largest basin in south america after the amazon which covers brazil argentina paraguay bolivia and uruguay this basin is highly populated and has great economic importance due to the intensive agriculture and hydropower generation that occurs there however it has recurrent problems with droughts floods and intensive water use chen et al 2010 the drought and flood events have caused severe economic and social losses here cavalcanti et al 2015 pasquini and depetris 2007 such as the droughts that occurred in 1999 2000 2006 chen et al 2010 and 2009 abelen et al 2015 and the floods in 1982 1983 1992 1997 1998 2002 2003 2007 cavalcanti et al 2015 chen et al 2010 and 2009 2010 abelen et al 2015 one of the largest hydropower plants in the world the itaipu plant in terms of power generation is located in this basin having a capacity of 14 000 mw being responsible for 20 of the hydropower energy consumed in brazil and supplying 80 of the electricity consumed in paraguay nóbregaet al 2011 von sperling 2012 in southern southeastern and eastern brazil the available water resources are essential for irrigation urban water supply and for hydropower generation extensive crops of irrigated rice are in the uruguay and south atlantic basins representing around 70 of brazil s production 12 4 of brazil s total area lies in the south atlantic and 7 9 in the uruguay basins these have a high demand for water ana 2015 conab 2015 thus the largest consumption in these basins is for irrigation 66 in the south atlantic and 82 in the uruguay basin 2 2 remote sensing dataset descriptions precipitation and et datasets that were based on remote sensing estimations that were commonly used well validated and available at the global scale were selected to assess water balance in this study for precipitation we used the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep datasets and for et we used modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 and global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam we also used terrestrial water storage changes from grace available from 2002 present a basin average for each remote sensing dataset was used to evaluate the terrestrial water balance in south america 2 2 1 precipitation we used two different satellite based precipitation products trmm3b43 version 7 huffman et al 2007 and mswep version 2 1 beck et al 2017a the first precipitation dataset used was that of the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa used to estimate tropical and subtropical rainfall the tmpa datasets combine multiple satellite precipitation estimates and rain gauge measurements with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 3 hourly daily and monthly temporal resolutions the trmm 3b43 dataset extended from 50 n to 50 s and covered the period from january 1998 to the present huffman et al 2010 2007 mswep a global dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and 3 hourly daily and monthly temporal resolution was specifically designed for hydrological modeling beck et al 2017a the time series extends from january 1979 to december 2016 the mswep dataset merges several high quality precipitation datasets including rain gauge measurements satellite observations and reanalysis data as a function of timescale and location beck et al 2017a 2 2 2 evapotranspiration two global terrestrial et datasets were used mod16 version 5 mu et al 2011 and gleam version 3 2 martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011a both et estimations were based on 8 day averages for computing uncertainties and on monthly time scale for computing the water balance the mod16 and gleam et datasets are global and combine remote sensing images and meteorological reanalysis data the mod16 algorithm mu et al 2011 is based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 penman 1948 and considers both the surface energy partitioning and atmospheric drivers on et to estimate et at the 8 day and monthly time scales at a spatial resolution ranging from 500 m to 0 05 the inputs include remote sensing and global meteorological reanalysis data the remote sensing inputs are derived from modis and include the land cover classification leaf area index lai fraction of photosynthetically active radiation and albedo the daily meteorological inputs include shortwave incident radiation air temperature and specific humidity from the global modeling and assimilation office gmao modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra reanalysis datasets which have a spatial resolution of 0 5 x 0 6 the gleam algorithms are based on the priestley taylor equation and were developed to estimate terrestrial evaporative fluxes at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a daily temporal scale the gleam separates the terrestrial components of et into canopy transpiration soil and open water evaporation interception loss and sublimation each grid cell consists of four different fractions of land cover bare soil sparse vegetation dense vegetation and open water the evaporative flux is computed separately for each cover fraction and then aggregated at the pixel scale the priestley taylor equation is used to calculate the potential et and then convert this to actual et according to the land cover and an evaporative stress factor the latter estimated from the root zone soil moisture and vegetation water content martens et al 2016 2017 miralles et al 2011a 2014 2 2 3 terrestrial water storage the grace mission was launched in 2002 with the main purpose of mapping variations in the earth s gravitational field by measuring the distance between two orbiting satellites landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 tapley et al 2004 the available grace data are anomalies relative to a time mean baseline and so twsc can be obtained as the time derivative of the anomalies long et al 2014 three different research centers process grace data the geoforschungszentrum gfz the center of space research csr university of texas and nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl we used a simple average of the three different solutions gfz csr and jpl to reduce the noise in the gravity field grace solutions sakumura et al 2014 a summary of the remote sensing dataset used to assess the terrestrial water balance in south america is presented in table 1 2 3 surface observations 2 3 1 river discharge measurements to evaluate the water balance across 50 wide basins located in south america we used daily discharge measurements from the ana and bdhi networks for 2003 to 2014 we selected discharge stations with minimal failures during the period of study since we did not gap fill the data the respective datasets are available at http hidroweb ana gov br and at http bdhi hidricosargentina gob ar 2 3 2 precipitation measurements we also used monthly precipitation measurements from 265 and 42 rain gauges from the brazilian national institute of meteorology and bdhi network respectively to evaluate the accuracy of the remote sensing precipitation estimations trmm and mswep as in discharge measurements we did not gap fill in rain gauges since we used a monthly temporal data provided by agencies with minimal failure for 2003 2014 the respective datasets are available at http www inmet gov br projetos rede pesquisa and at http bdhi hidricosargentina gob ar 2 3 3 evapotranspiration measurements the et uncertainties mod16 and gleam were evaluated using 16 ec site measurements covering a wide range of land use and climatic conditions in brazil the ec monitoring sites used are part of the large scale biosphere and atmosphere experiment in the amazon lba davidson and artaxo 2004 gonçalveset al 2013 keller et al 2004 and the south brazilian network of surface fluxes and climate change sulflux roberti et al 2012 the lba is an international program that was created in 1993 and is a pioneer in studies of interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere in a region of great human and natural complexity important results from the program have been summarized by davidson et al 2012 and keller et al 2009 the sulflux network is a scientific and interinstitutional cooperation created in 2008 with the goal of establishing a network for the continuous and extended period measurement of water energy and carbon dioxide flux involved with interactions between the surface and atmosphere in the ecosystems of southern brazil based on several experimental sites located in different land use and land cover sites roberti et al 2012 the ec sites have been extensively described see references in table 2 in terms of their environmental characteristics the equipment used the measurement procedures gap filling methods and data validation we used 30 minute and daily measured latent heat le to evaluate the et estimations of the lba and sulflux datasets respectively for the lba datasets we used data with quality control and analysis for sulflux the datasets were filtered to remove spurious values considering only the measurements 50 le 650 w m 2 for sites prs and cas 40 le 650 w m 2 for sites sma and pas and 50 le 700 w m 2 for site cra site we excluded data for global radiation 10 and le 100 w m 2 at night and during the occurrence of precipitation for both datasets we did not gap fill the data to close the energy balance in order to avoid circularity in the model assessment to convert measured le w m 2 to et mm we used eq 1 to compute the daily and 8 day average et we used a maximum gap of 25 following fisher et al 2009 when the number of missing data exceeded 25 we excluded the daily and 8 day average 1 et le λ where λ mj kg 1 is the le of vaporization for liquid water

variables in mm month 1 each variable was cumulated at time t as remote sensing inputs for precipitation we used the trmm and mswep datasets whilst for et we used mod16 and gleam considering that grace terrestrial water storage tws anomalies were given at irregularly timed intervals we computed these changes as the difference between two grace points representing the average change in terrestrial water storage long et al 2014 oliveira et al 2014 eq 7 7 ds dt tws dt tw s t 1 t w s t δ t uncertainties in the monthly estimates of the water balance were assessed by combining the individual uncertainties for precipitation et and discharge assuming that the errors in these variables are independent and normally distributed the relative uncertainty was given by the quadrature

uncertainty for each component of the water balance the water balance uncertainty was computed at the 95 confidence interval as υ dsdt the uncertainties in each component of the precipitation and et estimations were assessed as the standard deviations of the differences between observed and estimated data at the 307 rain gauges and 16 ec sites respectively at the basin level the precipitation uncertainties were averaged using rain gauge stations that were located in each basin whilst for et we computed the uncertainties for each land cover and then averaged for each basin according to the percentage of area occupied by the land cover class we used mcd12q1 for 2008 as the reference for assessing land use and land cover for discharge we considered an uncertainty of 10 as used by rodell et al 2011 and double of the uncertainty as used by rodell et al 2004 some studies have considered a 10 15 uncertainty approximation for discharge measurements to be reasonable bjerklie et al 2003 coe et al 2002 we also computed the grace uncertainties for each basin the grace anomalies data have measurement and leakage errors measurement errors are associated with instrument and loss signal retrieval errors whilst leakage errors are related to the filtering process landerer and swenson 2012 rodell et al 2011 eq 9 9 total e r r o r leakage e r r o r 2 measurement e r r o r 2 since grace errors are correlated in nearby pixels we computed the covariance as specified at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land maeda et al 2017 rodell et al 2011 then to compute errors in the twsc we multiplied the errors by 2 rodell et al 2004 2011 to evaluate the water balance under distinct climatic conditions we computed the runoff coefficient qcoeff for each basin this is a dimensionless coefficient that relates the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received guimberteau et al 2013 eq 10 10 q coeff q p where q and p are average discharge and precipitation for 2003 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainties in precipitation and et estimations we assessed the individual uncertainties of the precipitation and et remote sensing estimations to compute the water balance uncertainties but due to the spatial distribution of the rain gauges and ec sites we only evaluated the water balance uncertainties for 24 basins 3 1 1 uncertainties in precipitation fig 2 shows the statistical metrics between the rain gauges and mswep and trmm the mswep precipitation yielded a slightly higher accuracy 71 of rain gauges r 0 90 than the trmm estimations around 60 for the rmse both precipitation dataset generally presented more errors in the brazilian northeast 40 60 for trmm errors between 20 and 40 were verified in most rain gauges whilst for mswep fewer errors 0 20 were shown for the amazon and southern brazil mswep presented underestimations for 74 of the rain gauges mainly in southern and northeastern coastal brazil in contrast about 66 of the rain gauges assessed against trmm presented overestimations southern southeastern and northeastern brazil whilst on the northeastern coast of brazil trmm underestimated the precipitation these results agree with oliveira et al 2014 who assessed the water balance in the brazilian cerrado using precipitation from trmm 3b42 versions 6 and 7 and found overestimations mainly in the southern and underestimations in the northeastern brazilian cerrado with a lower bias for trmm version 7 rozante et al 2010 also verified underestimates on the east coast of the northeastern region of brazil attributing this to the occurrence of warm clouds and overestimates at the borders between argentina paraguay and brazil due cold top clouds the precipitation uncertainties in mswep and trmm presented similar results fig 3 with more than half of the rain gauges showing uncertainties of between 0 and 40 overall mswep yielded a mean uncertainty of about 37 whilst for trmm this value was 39 more uncertainties were observed mainly in northeastern brazil downstream of the paraná river and in all the rain gauges in argentina for both precipitation datasets our results agree with those of salio et al 2015 who reported that rainfall estimates that included microwave and infrared information that gave remarkable results improved by the incorporation of measured rainfall data into their calibration algorithms and also with those of beck et al 2017b who assessed 22 precipitation datasets for the entire world and verified that mswep version 2 0 demonstrated higher accuracy for all climate conditions when compared to other datasets with a higher performance mainly attributed to the incorporation of a daily rain gauge correction scheme whilst the datasets that incorporated monthly rain gauge data presented inferior performance a full statistical validation of mswep and trmm are presented in supplementary information tables si2 and si3 3 1 2 uncertainties in evapotranspiration in contrast to other studies that have evaluated et uncertainty using theoretical values or et model estimations azarderakhsh et al 2011 oliveira et al 2014 we used 16 ec measurements from different land use and land cover conditions for each land cover type we computed the standard deviation of the difference between et remote sensing estimations and ec measurements allowing the association of these uncertainties in 37 basins table 3 and fig 4 show the et uncertainties at all ec sites and in selected basins overall the gleam et presented lower uncertainties for mostly ec sites than mod16 for gleam et a range of between 16 and 33 was observed yielding higher accuracy for ec sites located on grassland 15 61 followed by savanna and forest 18 54 and 18 67 respectively whilst lower accuracy was found in the ec sites covered by cropland pasture located in amazon and pampa biomes 32 72 and 23 48 respectively for the mod16 et higher performance was verified over forest and savanna 22 14 and 24 78 respectively with lower accuracy for ec sites located on cropland pasture and grassland for all evaluated biomes ranging from 30 22 to 55 93 our results are comparable to those of michel et al 2016 and khan et al 2018 who evaluated et estimations including mod16 and gleam using ec measurements and of liu et al 2016 who compared different et products against the annual water balance et estimates verifying a superior performance of gleam et estimates although they did not find significant discrepancies between the et models evaluated overall these studies have emphasized that mod16 underestimates et and gleam performs relatively better than the other models including mod16 mainly due to the detailed parameterization of interception losses in tall and short vegetation and the use of microwave information as presented by miralles et al 2011a b and martens et al 2017 fig 5 presents the statistical metrics between observed and estimated et for all ec sites the results indicate a higher correlation coefficient and lower rmse and negative bias mostly for the gleam et indicating that the model is closer to the tower measured et even with a spatial resolution of 0 25 the superior gleam performance compared to that of mod16 may be associated with its grounding in the priestley taylor equation with a small number of inputs particularly considering the use of datasets based on satellite observations from various well validated sources thus minimizing the use of modeled data and parameterizations in addition the model has a minimal dependence on static data which avoids the need for parameter adjustments enabling the et estimations to rely on the accuracy of the remote sensing data used as input miralles et al 2011b 2016 different performances of the et models may be associated with the respective input data and algorithms used as observed by khan et al 2018 and xue et al 2013 mod16 may present low performance due to uncertainties in the input data such as the land cover and use map mcd12q1 product and lai mod15a2 product which uses a simplified version of the land cover and use map for its estimations and meteorological reanalysis data from gmao merra therefore such uncertainties may imply less accuracy in the parameters used in the mod16 algorithm and consequently of the et estimate khan et al 2018 ruhoff et al 2013 it is also important to consider the mismatch between the ec footprint and the et estimations based on remote sensing usually footprint peaks range from a few times the measurement height to a few dozen times for unstable and stable atmospheric conditions respectively aubinet et al 2012 whilst the remote sensing inputs used to estimate et present moderate to low spatial resolution thus much of the surface fluxes are lost in remote sensing models when the spatial resolution is degraded resulting in an increased likelihood of discrepancies in the ec measurements li et al 2008 despite the different spatial resolutions between mod16 and gleam to assess mod16 we used a 3x3 pixels window 500 m et mod16 and for gleam a radius of 25 km surrounding each flux tower to compute average et our results are consistent with those of previous studies which evaluated these et models using ec measurements and verified their good agreement with the in situ measurements khan et al 2018 miralles et al 2011a mu et al 2011 in addition inaccuracies in the ec measurements referred to as the energy balance non closure problem can also be a source of uncertainty several studies have reported on the energy balance closure problem which generally underestimates the turbulent fluxes sum of latent and sensible heat over the available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux araújo 2002 borma et al 2009 foken et al 2006 da rocha et al 2009 wilson 2002 for the ec sites located in the brazilian amazon and cerrado as used in this study da rocha et al 2009 reported an energy balance imbalance between of 0 70 and 1 05 a full statistical assessment between the observed and estimated from the mod16 and gleam et are presented in supplementary information table si4 3 2 uncertainties in the terrestrial water balance the uncertainties in the twsc and discharge for all combinations of the precipitation and et remote sensing datasets are presented in fig 6 for the twsc our results indicate uncertainties ranging between 44 and 96 mm month 1 and medians of between 43 and 22 mm month 1 for the combinations of mswep precipitation and gleam et for most basins on the other hand the combination of trmm precipitation and mod16 et presented higher medians ranging between 44 and 50 mm month 1 and uncertainties of between 38 to 112 mm month 1 overall for mswep precipitation and gleam et the median of the uncertainties ranged from 9 to 22 mm month 1 in the tocantins são francisco paraná northeastern and eastern atlantic basins in the amazon uruguay and south atlantic basins the median of uncertainties ranged between 60 and 21 mm month 1 the results also showed that the lowest uncertainties in discharge were observed for the combination of mswep precipitation and gleam et presenting a lower median and amplitude followed by the combinations trmm gleam mswep mod16 and trmm mod16 for instance at the óbidos station amazon basin the median uncertainty was 55 mm month 1 ranging between 39 and 72 mm month 1 using the combination of mswep gleam combination whilst for trmm mod16 the median uncertainty was around 65 mm month 1 ranging between 49 and 86 mm month 1 these results demonstrate close agreement with the mswep and gleam accuracy assessment when compared to the measured rainfall and et respectively in different climatic conditions and land use cover several studies have analyzed the uncertainties of discharge and et estimates from the water balance perspective and the results are summarized in table 4 azarderakhsh et al 2011 long et al 2014 oliveira et al 2014 rodell et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 those references adopted discharge uncertainties ranging between 5 and 10 and estimated the twsc uncertainties in a similar way to the way we estimated ours however for the precipitation and et uncertainties different methodologies were adopted some studies computed the uncertainties in precipitation and et through the difference between remote sensing estimations and modeled data rodell et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 or used uncertainties based on the literature azarderakhsh et al 2011 maeda et al 2017 we adopted the standard deviation of the difference between the remote sensing estimations and the measured data for et the uncertainty assessments were mostly based on the literature references azarderakhsh et al 2011 oliveira et al 2014 or were calculated using multiple et datasets long et al 2014 there is no agreement yet about the methodology for determining et uncertainties because it is still a challenge to obtain measured et data at consistent spatial and temporal scales the results found in this study for the basins located in the cerrado tocantins paraná and são francisco are similar to the results presented by oliveira et al 2014 and rodell et al 2011 for the combination mswep gleam we found lower discharge uncertainties 36 91 29 40 and 26 54 mm month 1 than in oliveira et al 2014 with the use of trmm mod16 they found 600 600 and 450 mm year 1 in the tocantins paraná and são francisco basins respectively similar results were also observed the for et uncertainty in the tocantins basin where the combination trmm mod16 and mswep gleam resulted in lower uncertainties 53 55 and 49 31 mm month 1 respectively than those found by rodell et al 2011 about 2 mm day 1 azarderakhsh et al 2011 evaluated different combinations of water balance by remote sensing in 14 sub basins in the amazon basin and found lower discharge uncertainties for the combinations trmm mod16 uncertainties of 23 and global precipitation climatology project gpcp mod16 uncertainties of 15 in the óbidos station amazon basin for the combination gpcp mod16 azarderakhsh et al 2011 found discharge uncertainties of 1 17 mmm day 1 or 35 1 mm month 1 whilst we found uncertainties of 45 45 mm month 1 using the combination mswep gleam compared to other studies our results demonstrate that the evaluation of water balance uncertainties derives a strong influence from estimations of the individual uncertainties of the inputs used in this context the establishment of methods for estimating uncertainties is of the utmost importance for improving our understanding of the terrestrial water cycle as reported in other studies gao et al 2010 maeda et al 2017 oliveira et al 2014 rodell et al 2011 sahoo et al 2011 sheffield et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 we have verified that precipitation and twsc are the main contributors to water balance total errors but overall the highest errors are from the precipitation datasets the precipitation data presented higher uncertainties than for et with the average ranging between 23 and 46 for trmm and 20 to 45 for mswep the uncertainties calculated against the ec measurements for the two et models were between 22 and 33 for the mod16 values and less for gleam with values ranging between 19 and 22 for the twsc based on grace the uncertainties are also lower than for precipitation ranging from 23 to 89 mm month 1 for all evaluated basins in addition higher uncertainties in precipitation were observed during the wet season in agreement with maeda et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 which verifies that the highest precipitation uncertainties are mainly due to the lack of in situ gauges in the region such as in the amazon basin and to an increase in precipitation measurement errors by remote sensing products during the rainy season we calculated the imbalance as the difference between the twsc from the water balance and from grace as presented in fig 7 a higher mean negative imbalance was found in the amazon basins where there are high et and discharge rates that are equivalent to or greater than the precipitation when summed in the tocantins and são francisco basins similar imbalance values were verified with the median being close to 10 mm month 1 although the water balance closure has yet to be achieved using the current remote sensing datasets we verified a close agreement with previous studies that merged multiple sources to close the water balance for example sahoo et al 2011 merged precipitation and et from multiple remote sensing datasets and found an imbalance of between 70 and 50 mm month 1 in the amazon basin using a similar methodology pan et al 2012 found mean imbalances close to zero with values ranging seasonally in the amazon basin whilst zhang et al 2018 using data assimilation techniques found a non closure of 46 mm year 1 for the amazon and 47 mm year 1 for the paraná basins 3 3 assessment of water balance dynamics considering the multiple basins in south america under different climatic conditions and at different spatial scales we evaluated whether the water balance accuracy and dynamics would change as a result of a basin scale effect fig 8 shows a scatterplot of the twsc from grace and the remote sensing based water balance grouped into small 100 000 km2 medium sized 100 000 500 000 km2 and large 500 000 km2 basins in the largest basins we found the highest correlation coefficients r 0 85 and 0 89 and rmses of around 58 and 42 for the medium sized and large basins respectively on the other hand basins with areas of less than 100 000 km2 presented a correlation coefficient of about 0 64 and a rmse of 130 the results for small basins can be explained by the growth grace errors inversely proportional to area size and this way higher errors will be more pronounced in small basins landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 our results agree with rodell et al 2011 that evaluated et from water balance in some global basins verified higher errors in water balance estimates over smaller basins and suggested that this fact can be primarily explained by the growth of grace errors in small area however we also found a good performance in the small basins predominantly under tropical wet dry and tropical monsoon climates bacabal 25 500 km2 downstream mearim river cantanhede 49 900 km2 downstream itapecuru river and peixe gordo 47 800 km2 downstream jaguaribe river presented more accurate results for water balance showing a correlation coefficients of about 0 88 and rmse of 62 close to those verified for medium sized basins in addition medium sized basins located in regions with moist climates in southern of brazil garruchos 116 000 km2 upstream uruguay river uruguaiana 190 000 km2 downstream uruguay river yielded correlation coefficients of 0 56 and rmse of 168 with results similar to those found for the small basins although the results have shown better performance in larger basins they also show that a basin s climatic conditions can influence the water balance accuracy because medium sized under subtropical climates with weak seasonal precipitation had higher errors than small basins in tropical climate in this context we also evaluated which hydrological conditions yielded more accurate results between measured discharge and that derived from the water balance fig 9 presents scatterplots of the runoff coefficient rmse and correlation coefficient for discharge from the water balance in the amazon basins we found higher qcoeff ranging from 0 55 to 0 72 mainly in the western northwestern and mainstream regions with a rmse in the discharge of 39 except for some basins located in the southeastern region where the rmse was 99 in the tocantins and high são francisco basins we found qcoeff of 0 27 and 0 25 and rmses of 132 and 194 respectively whilst for the medium and low são francisco basins characterized by semi arid climates qcoeff decresed to 0 15 and the rmse increased to 420 for the other basins influenced by in semi arid and arid climates such as the northeastern atlantic basin in brazil and the salado river basin in argentina with a qcoef 0 06 we found a rmse of more than 364 these results indicate that in semi arid basins discharge derived from the remote sensing water balance presented low accuracy whilst in the other basins influenced mainly by tropical and subtropical climates such as the amazon paraná and uruguay basins high accuracy between the water balance and measured discharge were observed overall satisfactory water balance results were obtained for most of the evaluated basins 76 where both the grace twsc and remote sensing based water balance showed the same seasonal pattern of twsc fig 10 basins with large areas predominantly tropical climatic regions with seasonal precipitation yielded correlation coefficients of around 0 89 and a rmse 48 on the other hand smaller basins mainly located in subtropical climatic regions showed results with an average correlation coefficient of about 0 52 and a rmse of 164 a high accuracy between the remote sensing based water balance and the grace twsc was found in the amazon basin and sub basins that have predominantly tropical humid climates and high water and energy available throughout the year the average precipitation was around 123 249 mm month 1 with pronounced seasonal cycles related to the occurrence of the monsoon system and a water discharge of around 45 168 mm month 1 regarding et the remote sensing estimations showed weak seasonal cycles with values about 95 139 mm month 1 recently maeda et al 2017 evaluated et seasonality across the amazon basin and observed variations in average et values among five sub basins in the solimões basin the highest et values were determined in the drier months september and october whilst in the southern basins purus madeira and tapajós the highest et rates were found in the months with higher precipitation rates november january and november respectively according to this study the maximum et rates did not correspond to the maximum precipitation rates nor to the maximum radiation thus supporting the assumption that et in the amazon is regulated by a balance of radiation precipitation and vegetation physiological control rather than being exclusively limited by one of these factors restrepo coupe et al 2013 the tocantins são francisco and paraná basins are mainly in the cerrado biome with a coverage of semi decidual and decidual forests and seasonal precipitation and et rates reboita et al 2010 da rocha et al 2009 found higher values during the rainy season and lower values during the dry season in transitional forests floodplains and in the cerrado woodlands due to the decline of photosynthesis and a strong seasonality in lai with the et patterns probably being driven by soil moisture availability in these basins a moderate accuracy between the remote sensing based and grace twsc was found average values for basins tocantins r 0 92 rmse 41 são francisco r 0 87 rmse 50 paraná r 0 73 rmse 120 agreeing with oliveira et al 2014 tocantins r 0 93 são francisco r 0 91 paraná r 0 87 indicating that the grace estimations are capable of representing water storage change in the cerrado basins providing information on the seasonality dynamics of the water balance in these basins sun et al 2016 analyzed drought events in the são francisco basin and showed that the tws might be a good indicator of extreme water conditions such as droughts and floods events in this context our results support those of previous studies oliveira et al 2014 sheffield et al 2009 sun et al 2016 which demonstrated the good grace twsc agreement with the remote sensing based water balance our results on basins of the cerrado biome demonstrate a precipitation decrease in the são francisco basin at traipu station of around 21 and 20 in 2007 and 2012 2014 respectively when droughts were recorded in the region paredes trejo et al 2016 sun et al 2016 in the uruguay basin at the uruguaiana station and also other basins in humid subtropical climates we found the smallest correlation coefficients around 0 50 between the twsc from grace and the remote sensing based water balance with a rmse of around 160 in this region precipitation was less seasonal with the highest values associated with cold frontal systems do nascimento et al 2016 reboita et al 2010 as observed by do nascimento et al 2016 in these basins the highest et values are not related to higher water availability as in the cerrado basins here precipitation is well distributed throughout the year with higher et rates being related to higher energy availability during the summer months december to march the grace twsc presented a less significant relation with the remote sensing based water balance in these basins compared to those in the amazon tocantins and the northern northeastern atlantic basins one explanation for this may be basin size these being generally small 56 000 km2 on average compared to those in other regions with higher correlation coefficients areas of 664 000 km2 and even 5 million km2 basins since grace errors are inversely proportional to area and the highest uncertainties are more pronounced in small basins landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 4 conclusions the results of this research demonstrate that trmm and mswep precipitation present a similar seasonal pattern in south american basins with mswep yielding higher accuracy and lower uncertainty values than trmm for et uncertainty we verified higher correlation coefficients and lower rmse for gleam et for most ec sites then we found that the lowest uncertainties for precipitation were observed for the combination of mswep precipitation and gleam et estimations we found imbalances in the water balance for all these basins which resulted from individual errors in the remote sensing datasets even though we verified that the water balance closure has yet to be achieved our results demonstrate agreement with previous studies that used merging techniques for multiple variable sources in situ observation satellite remote sensing land surface model and reanalysis better agreements between the twsc from grace and the remote sensing water balance were found for medium 100 000 to 500 000 km2 and large basins 500 000 km2 however the climatic conditions are also important since we found good results in small basins mainly influenced by tropical climates and worse results in medium sized basins that experienced subtropical humid climates basins in semi arid regions presented the lowest runoff coefficients and the highest discharge rmse indicating that high errors can be found for discharge calculated from the water balance in basins under semi arid conditions in south america finally the water balance performance demonstrated satisfactory results for more than half of the basins where nearly 76 presented correlation coefficients of 0 89 and rmse of 48 between the twsc from grace and the water balance less accurate agreements were found in the southern brazil basins under a predominantly humid subtropical climate this region presents high precipitation rates through the year with no defined dry or wet seasons this feature was evaluated and we determined that basins with higher rates of precipitation and seasonality yield better agreements between the twsc from the water balance and from grace showing that is necessary to advance the understanding of water balance dynamics under humid subtropical climate to understand limitations on grace data use and water balance using on remote sensing in these regions although water balance closure using current remote sensing data has not been achieved yet this study underscores some important information about water balance cycle dynamics related to the basin scale and climatic conditions for multiple basins in south america these results reinforce the great potential of remote sensing data in hydrological studies declaration of

6336,the development of water quality prediction models is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers the traditional method for computing wqi is always associated with errors due to the protracted analysis of the water quality parameters in addition to the great effort and time involved in gathering and analyzing water samples in addition the cost of identifying the magnitude of some of the parameters through experimental testing is very high the water quality of rivers in malaysia is ranked into five classes based on water quality index wqi wqi is function of six water quality parameters ammoniac nitrogen nh3 n biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do ph and suspended solids ss in this research the decision tree machine learning technique is used to predict the wqi for the klang river and its classification within a specific water quality class klang river is one of the most polluted rivers in malaysia modeling experiments are designed to test the prediction and classification accuracy of the model based on various scenarios composed of different water quality parameters results show that the proposed prediction model has a promising potential to predict the class of the wqi moreover the proposed model offers a more efficient process and cost effective approach for the computation and prediction of

supply is sourced from rivers especially in malaysia the deteriorating river water quality has an impact on river health including fluvial ecology which increases the risk to human health and the challenges to ensure sustainable production of drinking water the development of water quality prediction models is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers during the last several decades efforts have been made to develop accurate prediction models for water quality parameters by utilizing different modelling methods chau 2006 manache and melching 2008 singh et al 2011 researchers among others have given special attention to the artificial intelligence modelling methods maier and dandy 2000 artificial neural networks anns have been used with success to predict water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen do biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod in waterways since do is considered to be the most important parameter in river water quality numerous studies were conducted to predict do concentration based on different parameters by using various ann models sarkar and pandey 2015 studied the development of feedforward back propagation anns to simulate do concentration in the yamuna river the researchers found that in order for their ann model to achieve the best performance an optimal number of input variables have to be fed into the model the complexity of a model increased with higher number of input variables and the performance drastically deteriorated with the over reduction of the model input afan et al 2017 sarkar and pandey 2015 a study conducted by csábrági et al 2017 compared the performance of different anns in predicting do concentration the study compared the performance of multivariate linear regression mlr and three other ann models multilayer propagation neural networks mlpnns radial basis networks rbfnns and general regression neural networks grnns the result of the study indicated that the major drawback of mlpnns is the need for multiple runs to avoid the possibility of a misleading outcome of a single run the study concluded that grnns gave the best do prediction in contrast to mlpnns rbfnns and mlr csábrági et al 2017 these studies showed that not only are anns able to predict water quality parameters but they also provide recommendations for modification and improvement of their drawbacks and prediction performance as was shown in the grnn najah et al 2012 conducted a study on water quality prediction by using integrated wavelet anfis model three water quality parameters i e total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity and turbidity of the johor river were used in the study anfis was modified using a wavelet de noising technique to reduce the complex uncertainty induced noise which allows the model to produce superior result as compared to those obtained when using mlpnns and anfis where the mean absolute error in percentage could be as low as 0 01 najah et al 2012 these studies have shown the degree to which machine learning ml models can be used to predict water quality parameters even though they have a complex and non linear computational method and are stochastic in nature in fact the flexibility of ml models makes it possible to develop a better and more effective models to deal with the difficulties in monitoring water quality parameters these studies however focused on the prediction of a single water quality parameter rather than focusing on the prediction of water quality index wqi however several water quality parameters have to be monitored analysed in order to obtain the required information to estimate of wqi as a matter of fact the process of obtaining such predefined water quality parameters is time consuming and very costly in this regard the present study will focus on developing a prediction model for wqi which requires less water quality parameters and therefore reduce the time required to perform the analysis and minimize the cost required in order to achieve the desired wqi for rivers based on the conditions in malaysia the authors believe that this model could potentially be generalized for application to several river conditions worldwide the computation of the water quality index wqi in malaysia which involves a series of sub index calculations is lengthy and complicated and is often associated with errors during the computation processes there are complex and non linear relationships between the wqi and the water quality parameters furthermore some of the parameters require exhaustive sample collection campaign that is time consuming and must be conducted by skilled technicians to ensure accurate sample analysis and data representation even with advanced equipment and technology high operative and management cost hinders a comprehensive spatial and temporal monitoring of river water quality hence there is a need to develop a data driven model with a high capability in order to simplify the processes reduce the errors and reduce the need for costly and time consuming sampling and lab analysis decision tree is a popular machine learning tool and is often used to identify possible consequences such as the chance event outcomes investment risks decision making and interest rate this classifier modelling method showed an outstanding performance even when used with a complex dataset to identify its pattern behaviour everaert et al 2016 the main objective of this research is to develop a model for predicting the class of wqi which indicate the status of river water quality the decision tree modelling has been utilized as a predictor for the wqi class the proposed decision tree model will be evaluated under three different scenarios by utilizing the water quality data for the klang river since it is the most polluted river in malaysia othman et al 2012 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the klang river runs through urban and developed areas cutting right through the middle of the federal territory of kuala lumpur while the upstream and downstream parts of the river flow through the state of selangor it is situated between latitudes 2 55 n and 3 25 n and longitude 101 i5 e and 101 55 e geographically the klang river begins at an altitude of about 1200 m on the western slopes of peninsula malaysia and runs south westwards to join the gombak river in the centre of kuala lumpur the klang river is almost 120 km long and its drainage basin area is around 1260 km2 the population in the klang river basin is projected to reach 10 million by the year 2020 from the current estimated population of 7 2 million several water treatment plants wtps extract water from the tributaries within the klang river basin i e bukit nanas and wangsa maju with a design capacity of 145 mld and 45 mld respectively mohamed et al 2015 however it should be noted that despite the huge basin area most of the treated water for kuala lumpur is supplied by the neighbouring state of selangor fig 1 shows the klang river basin the department of environment doe has setup numerous water quality stations along the main stream of the klang river which are operated by the did to facilitate the monitoring and management of water resources the six parameters as presented in eq 1 were measured and additional assessment on conductivity turbidity salinity temperature microbial nutrients and heavy metals concentration are made when there is a necessity for it sharif et al 2015 the klang river basin lies in an area with humid tropical climate that is characterised by heavy rainfall uniform temperature and high humidity in the east at the foothill the average annual rainfall is almost 2600 mm and the amount decreases to around 1900 mm at the coast peak rainfall occurs during two two month periods i e from april to may and october to november during the southwest and northeast monsoons respectively the average monthly humidity is between 80 and 85 the average monthly temperature in the basin ranges between 26 and 28 c the daily sunshine duration is between 4 5 and 7 0 h day and the daily evaporation ranges between 3 and 5 mm day el shafie et al 2012 the land use in the klang valley basin area is diverse ranging from tropical forests in the headwater region to urban areas with their associated activities in the central region and agriculture in the fringes of the basin about 41 of the basin is agricultural area 29 is urban 25 is forests and swamps and tin mines make up 5 of the total basin area the urban area consists of recreational residential industrial institutional and commercial zones the klang river basin has been experiencing serious environmental degradation and flooding as a result of continuous development industrialization and population growth the rapid development in the area is expected to further increase the probability of water stress condition with regard to future water supply a report published by the did in 2011 projected that the water demand in kuala lumpur gombak petaling and klang will increase to 1194 million liter per day mld for the period between 2015 and 2050 the klang river is currently critically polluted due to inefficient water quality management improperly treated sewage and industrial and residential discharges from the klang river basin flow into the river this problem is compounded by high events of soil erosion as a result of inefficient control plan at construction sites 2 2 data collection the data collected from the 15 automatic monitoring stations for the six parameters during the period between 2000 and 2010 for klang river are demonstrated in fig 2 fig 2 shows the distribution of the six water quality parameters measured between the years 2000 and 2010 the do parameter gives a direct assessment of river health fig 2a shows that the do data contains a significant fraction of low do concentration even up to 1 mg l especially during the period between 2000 and 2002 the do concentration improved substantially in 2003 with an average value of 4 mg l despite the fluctuation in the value of do concentration which occasionally reached the desirable class i category the klang river is in fact a class iii river this is supported by the average value of cod and bod concentrations of 45 and 7 mg l respectively the spikes observed in fig 2b which could peak to 50 mg l for bod is believed to be due to illegal sewage discharges even though the government has imposed strict penalties on those who cause pollution the large area of the klang river basin makes it possible for blind spot discharge locations to exist thus allowing the polluters to avoid being caught by the authorities high concentration of tss was observed in the first few years of the current millennium with the highest measured tss of 1400 mg l fig 2d the rapid development taking place in recent years in kuala lumpur coupled with the lack of training in the proper implementation of erosion and sediment control plan escp are believed to be a major factor contributing to the high levels of sedimentation in the klang river the level of ammonia nitrogen has clearly exceeded the value stipulated in the guideline with the maximum measured value being 20 times higher than the value set for class iii the mean nh3 n value of 4 mg l put the klang river in class v category hence posing serious ecological risk fig 2e shows that the ph ranges between 5 5 and 8 which is within the acceptable range for class ii and iii stipulated in the water quality standard of rivers table 2 the water quality indexes during the study period fluctuate widely between the year 2000 and mid 2005 the classification of klang river varied between class i and class v with an average of class iii throughout this period in 2006 the state of the klang river has improved significantly and a smaller fluctuation was observed in the water quality index despite of this the klang river is still categorized as a class iii river the temporal data of the wqi showed that the klang river was categorized as class i only once 0 01 percent of the time class v twenty times 0 2 of the time and class ii 66 times 6 9 of the time during the study period during the period between the year 2000 and 2010 classifications activities were carried out each two months for the klang river the results showed that klang river mostly was categorized as class iii and class iv 46 and 45 of the time respectively 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 determination of wqi in 1978 the department of environment doe in malaysia introduced the water quality index wqi and started to monitor river water quality the aim of this initiative was to establish a baseline monitoring system for river water quality to detect any changes in water quality and to identify the sources of pollution so that immediate actions could be taken to mitigate the pollution since then a total of 1064 manual monitoring sites have been set up in 143 river basins in malaysia doe 2007 the formula for calculating wqi was proposed by the doe and a panel of experts was consulted on the choice of parameters and the relative weight to be assigned to each parameter hameed et al 2016 the wqi is computed based on six water quality parameters i e biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do suspended solids ss ph and ammoniac nitrogen nh3 n the formula for computing the wqi is given by eq 1 and table 1 presents the formula used to calculate the sub indexes si water quality is ranked into class i ii iii iv and v based on the wqi and the interim national water quality standards for malaysia inwqs as shown in table 2 doe 2007 currently there are 15 automatic monitoring stations which continuously monitor the water quality in the klang river 1 wqi 0 22 s i d o 0 19 s i b o d 0 16 s i c o d 0 16 s i s s 0 15 s i a n 0 12 s i p 2 3 2 decision tree modelling approach decision tree model is one of the most frequently used techniques in data mining it is a popular machine learning tool and is often used to identify possible consequences such as the chance of event outcomes investment risks decision making and interest rate azad and moshkov 2017 khosravi et al 2018 the id3 core algorithm in the decision tree model employs a top down greedy search through the space of possible branches with no backtracking and allows the handling of both categorical and numerical data decision tree models are able to include predictors with dependence assumptions between the predictors brown and myles 2013 decision tree works with a tree structure building classification and regression models when a dataset is fed into this model as an input layer the system breaks down the complex dataset into small subsets while at the same time building a decision tree model by analysing those data see fig 3 the basic idea of decision trees is known as the divide and conquer technique the dataset is broken down into different parts in each step and each part is supposed to better represent one of the possible classes of the data the result is a tree structure where each inner node represents a test for the value of an attribute and each leaf represents the decision for a particular class a new and unknown case is then routed down the tree until it reaches one of the leaves brown and myles 2013 fig 4 presents the structure of a decision tree model where the decision and the leaf nodes are represented by squares and circles respectively each node has two options based on the value type of the feature used at this node for nominal features the number of children is usually equal to the number of possible values of this feature by using a nominal feature for a test in one of the inner nodes the dataset at this stage is basically divided based on the different values of this feature hence a nominal feature will not be tested more than once since all examples further down the tree will have the same value as this particular feature this is different for numerical attributes where test is performed if the attribute value is greater or less than a determined constant the attribute could be tested several times for different constants a decision tree is constructed top down in a recursive divide and conquer mode at the first stage the feature for the root node is selected then a branch for each possible feature value is formed and the cases are split into subsets based on the possible values finally these steps are repeated recursively for each branch using only cases that reach the branch the process will stop when all instances have the same class among the key advantages of a decision tree model are the ease of understanding and interpreting the results and the possibility of adding new scenarios which helps to predict an unpredicted outcome 2 3 3 model configuration the predictive modelling for estimating the wqi for the klang river is investigated based on six predictors i e bod cod do ss ph and nh3 n these input variables were normalised using the z transformation before being fed into the model the normalisation subtracts the mean of the data from all values and divides them by the standard deviation hence the distribution of the data has a mean of zero and a variance of one the purpose of z transformation is to ensure the preservation of the original data distribution and to ensure that the modelling is not affected by outliers kotu and deshpande 2014 in this study data from the years 2001 to 2009 were used for training and validation 95 whilst the data for the year 2010 5 were kept for testing fig 5 illustrates the stages and sections of the modelling several parameters have to be set when using decision tree as the predictive modelling in the rapidminer studio hofmann et al 2013 this software has several parameters to be configured such as the criterion where it is set to gain ratio gain ratio is a splitting feature that adjusts the information gain for each feature to allow for the breadth and uniformity of the feature values maximum depth is the parameter used to restrict the depth of the decision tree where this value is set to 1 in order to not impose any bound on the depth of the tree another important parameter used for the pessimistic error calculation of pruning is the confidence level which is set to be 0 25 the present study employs the pre pruning parameters which represent the stopping criteria the pre pruning is represented by minimal gain and was set to be 0 01 minimal leaf size is two minimal split size is two and the number of pre pruning alternative is two these configurations were set to ensure that the modelling is able to maximise the analysis of parameters correlated with the wqi in order to obtain a more accurate prediction kotu and deshpande 2014 fig 5 and fig 6 show the model configuration in the rapidminer studio these figures show the flow work of model inside the rapidminer interface which is represented by two main stages training and testing 2 3 4 modeling scenarios during the setting up of the modelling it was conducted with all six water quality parameters as input variables to determine the model performance since the main purpose of this research is to use the decision tree to predict the wqi based on a smaller number of parameters as inputs to achieve higher effectiveness and efficiency in determining the wqi of rivers this predictive modelling focused more on prediction accuracy based on lower number of inputs each scenario was developed by reducing the number of water quality parameters as model input parameters to five four and three instead of the six parameters stipulated in the did manual the successful implementation of the proposed decision tree model with a minimal number of model input variables would result in minimal cost of wqi prediction for river water quality this could also reduce the time taken to analyse the water sample in the laboratory to determine the value of the cut off parameters furthermore these scenario analyses would also allow for the identification of the correlation between water quality parameters and the wqi classes in the first scenario five parameters were used as inputs and one parameter was omitted for each case the second scenario has four inputs thereby providing fifteen possibilities with various configuration of water quality parameters in the third scenario the number of neurons was decreased to three and thus increasing the total number of experiments within this scenario to 20 with more possibilities of input combinations tables 3 5 show all combinations of input data for the three scenarios the monthly river water quality data for the klang river basin between 2001 and 2010 were z transformed to speed up the training process and reduce the influence of outliers in the dataset this decision tree modelling was run with infinity depth confidence level of 0 25 and minimal gain of 0 1 to ensure that the model is able to achieve a higher degree of analysis accuracy the optimal architecture was determined based on the prediction accuracy with a minimum benchmark of 75 2 3 5 model performance criteria the accuracy of the predictive modelling was evaluated based on three criteria in order to measure the performance of the model the measurement of performance does not specifically look at the difference between the traditionally computed and the predicted wqi values instead the investigation focused on the similarity of class between the predicted and the wqi values obtained using eq 1 classical statistical measures such as mean absolute error maximum error and mean square error are not required for the comparison of error between the actual and the predicted wqi values for example the range for class iv wqi is set between 31 0 and 51 9 if the computed value using the wqi equations is 50 which indicates class iv and the predicted value is 32 which falls under the class iv then the model is deemed to be acceptable even though the difference between 50 and 32 is rather high and has a poor prediction error in terms of the classical error measure evaluation on the other hand if the measured wqi is 30 class v and the predicted wqi is 32 class iv then the model has made an inaccurate prediction of the wqi class even though the difference between the two values is small in classification or class prediction it is essential to evaluate the model performance at the overall level but also at each class individually therefore there is a need to examine all the possible cases that designate the relationship between the predicted wqi class as the model output and the actual wqi class in fact there are four cases that could occur and should be taken into account to measure the model performance at each class individually the first case is a true positive which is correctly identifying the wqi class in this case the model result is one that detects the class condition when the condition is present the second case is the true negative test that the result is one that does not detect the condition when the condition is absent in other words the model output result correctly rejects the wqi class it should be noted that the second case condition did not occur in this study as wqi class should fall in one of the five classes and never be in neutral condition the third case of condition is the false positive incorrectly identified condition which is experienced when the test result is one that detects the condition when the condition is absent finally the fourth case is the false negative test result is one that does not detect the condition when the condition is present this case represents the incorrectly rejected condition let tp denotes the number of true positives tn the number of true negatives fp the number of false positives and fn the number of false negatives as shown in fig 7 the overall prediction accuracy for the model could be calculated as the sum of tp for all classes the summation of all number in the yellow cells divided by the total number of the tested data 44 in our study in order to carry out the model performance analysis at the class level to examine the performance of the model at each class individually the following evaluation measures could be used sensitivity measures class recall the ability of a test to detect the condition when the condition is present thus sensitivity tp tp fn predictive value positive class precision is the proportion of positives that correspond to the presence of the condition thus predictive value positive tp tp fp the performance vector was calculated based on the confusion matrix shown in table 6 the model performance was evaluated using three types of assessment including prediction accuracy class precision and class recall equation 2 was used to estimate the prediction accuracy which is defined as the ability of the classifier to select all cases that need to be selected and reject all cases that need to be rejected for a classifier with 100 accuracy this would imply that false negative false positive 0 precision is defined as the proportion of cases found that were actually relevant based on the calculation made using eq 3 finally the recall is expressed by eq 4 which is defined as the proportion of the relevant cases that were actually found among all the relevant cases the formulae for performance criteria are expressed as follows 2 prediction a c c u r a c y all c l a s s e s class 1 n t r u e p o

scenarios was developed in order to evaluate each possible input combination for scenario 6 15 and 20 possible combination cases were assessed for the three scenarios respectively the detailed results for each scenario are presented separately in appendix a b and c for first second and third scenario respectively but the main findings are presented below 3 1 first scenario input data with five water quality parameters in the first scenario the prediction model was run based on five different water quality parameters with six different combinations as shown in table 7 data shows that scenario 1 1 i e without nh3 n produced the best result with an accuracy of 84 09 as can be seen in table a 1 the best performance for this combination is supported by the class recall for true iii true iv and true v which achieved 84 85 100 00 and 100 00 respectively and in class precision for predicted iii predicted iv and predicted v 93 99 61 54 and 100 00 respectively table a 2 shows that although not all data were accurately predicted the false predicted data in test 1 1 were still close to its original class for example two data for true ii fall in the predicted iii and five data for true iii fall in the predicted iv in this scenario five other tests were not able to achieve an accuracy of at least 75 00 interestingly the model with these configurations was not able to accurately predict the most critical class v tables a 3 a 6 show that all the data for true v fall in the predicted iii which is a wide difference between the true and the predicted values class v is the lowest class in the wqi and it is very crucial for this class to be correctly identified so that immediate actions can be taken to reduce the effect of the unacceptable limits for the quality of water on the environment and human use based on the analysis the influence of each water quality parameter was investigated in this predictive modelling result show that nh3 n has the least effect on the predicted wqi with notable high accuracy 84 09 for test 1 1 this is a somewhat positive outcome considering the high cost for experimental analysis of nh3 n the cost for laboratory analysis could be reduced by omitting thenh3 n parameter from the modelling input variables 3 2 second scenario input data with four water quality parameters the main objective for carrying out scenario ii is to improve model performance by reducing the number of input variable for the model by using only four water quality parameters different combinations of inputs as shown in table 8 were tested the accuracy of this modelling was determined based on the percentage of prediction accuracy followed by the percentage of class precision and class recall the 15 combinations for water quality parameters are given in appendix b scenario 2 1 provides the best performance with a prediction accuracy of 81 82 with bod cod ss and do as the four inputs it should be noted that besides this combination scenarios 2 7 and 2 15 were able to achieve a prediction accuracy benchmark of 75 00 interestingly the same parameters in both tests are nh3 n and ss table b 1 shows that scenario 2 1 achieved a class precision of 93 10 for predicted iii 57 14 for predicted iv and 100 00 for predicted v the achievement of class recalls for true iii true iv and true v were 81 82 100 00 100 00 respectively in contrast to scenario 1 1 scenario 2 1 omitted ph from the inputs of the modelling and still showed a promising result for this predictive modelling 36 out of 44 which is very close to the prediction accuracy of scenario 1 1 37 out of 44 the results for scenarios 2 7 and 2 15 are shown in table b 7 and table b 15 respectively even though both scenarios achieved a prediction accuracy of 75 00 they were not able to predict the most critical class v the results for both scenarios for true v fall in the predicted iii which is a wide deviation from its original class hence both input combinations for scenarios 2 7 and 2 15 are not qualified for this predictive modelling see tables b 2 b 6 b 10 b 14 and c1 the results of the analysis in the second scenario further proved that nh3 n is the least effective parameter correlated to the prediction of wqi additionally ph has been shown to be a parameter with low correlation to a certain extent to wqi prediction in malaysia the ph of the discharge into rivers is strictly monitored and is the easiest parameter to be monitored as its measurement can be easily obtained in situ and without further laboratory analysis moreover since malaysia is a tropical country which receives plenty of rainfall throughout the year the value of ph in rivers can be easily diluted and neutralised by the rainfall hence the omission of ph and nh3 n as input data for predictive modelling have no effect on the prediction of wqi class in addition to the least effective parameter correlated to wqi prediction this scenario is also able to identify the most effective parameter correlated with wqi analysis of the lowest prediction accuracy across the 15 set of combinations show that scenario 2 12 which excludes bod and do from the predictive model was able to achieve a prediction accuracy of only 25 00 this proves that bod and do are important parameters in the determination of wqi 3 3 third scenario input data with three water quality parameters in the third scenario the number of inputs was further reduced to three parameters a total of 20 different combinations were tested using the predictive modelling and the results are presented in table 9 by using only three parameters to predict wqi scenarios 3 2 and 3 20 were able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 77 27 which is slightly higher than the benchmark of 75 the parameters used in scenario 3 2 were bod cod and do whilst those in scenario 3 20 are do ph nh3 n although both tests showed good ability to predict wqi scenario 3 2 shows a better result in contrast scenario 3 20 with regard to the accuracy of class precision and class recall table c 2 shows that scenario 3 2 achieved a precision of 92 59 50 and 100 for the prediction of class iii iv and v respectively for class recall the test achieved a prediction of 75 76 for true iii 100 00 for true iv and 100 00 for true v in addition the false predicted classes are still close to their original classes for example two data points for class ii fall in predicted class iii and eight data points for class iii fall in predicted class iv see tables c 3 c 19 the result for scenario 3 20 is presented in table c 20 it shows that two data points for true ii fall in predicted iii and predicted iv four data points for true iii fall in predicted iv three data for true iv fall in predicted iii and the only data for true v fall in predicted iii the accuracy for class precision is 85 29 50 00 and 0 00 for predicted ii predicted iv and predicted v respectively the accuracy of class recall is 87 88 62 50 and 0 00 for true iii true iv and true v respectively results of the analysis show that even though the parameters used in scenario 3 20 were able to achieve a high accuracy they were disqualified from being used in this predictive modelling since they were not able to accurately predict the most critical class v additionally the false predicted data show a high deviation from their true value the third scenario proved that nh3 n has the lowest correlation with the prediction of wqi based on scenario 3 2 by excluding nh3 n wqi can be predicted without much loss of information in other words bod cod and do are the most important parameters corresponding to the relative weights given in eq 1 which have a higher correlation with wqi prediction this is proven by the result for scenario 3 19 which achieved 31 82 prediction accuracy when using ss ph and nh3 n as its input data not only did the test achieve low prediction accuracy most of the false predicted data deviate significantly from their true value the data driven model based on decision tree procedure can be considered as a further step for achieving an adaptable water quality index prediction model furthermore the utilization of such modelling procedure is not only able to accurately predict the water quality index but also able to improve the water quality monitoring program by reducing the time consuming and costly experimental testing for each parameter particularly nh3 n additionally the utilization of decision tree to predict water quality index could produce accurate results by allowing the use of a larger database for existing river water quality in malaysia the development of the proposed model in other tropical regions would allow for improvement of the present modelling system which would then result in higher accuracy the ability of the proposed model to predict the class of water quality through the calculation of wqi s class is believed to have similar potential in predicting the indices based river and ecological conditions such as belgium biotic index bbi species at risk index spear and german saprobic index gsi von der ohe et al 2007 interestingly the universal water quality index uwqi utilises 12 parameters of water quality intended for the abstraction of drinking water whereby the calculated index is categorised into three classes based on ec legislation 74 440 eec boyacioglu 2007 based on the similarity in the indices calculation we anticipate that the proposed model s architecture will provide a promising approach for predicting other ecological and water quality indices 4 conclusion this research studied the use of decision tree model for water quality index prediction in a tropical environment the monthly water quality data from the klang river for a ten year period 2001 2010 were utilized in this research a decision tree algorithm was developed to predict the wqi of the klang river by taking into account several scenarios each of which used varying number of water quality parameters as modelling inputs three different scenarios were examined using the decision tree model viz those with five four and three water quality parameters as the model input with the wqi class as the target output for each scenario in this study the best prediction accuracy for the first scenario is 84 09 when nh3 n was omitted from the input variables in the second scenario the best prediction accuracy of 81 82 was achieved when nh3 n and ph were omitted from the input variables and a prediction accuracy of 77 27 was achieved when nh3 n ph and ss were omitted as input variables in the third scenario the three results achieved a prediction accuracy that is higher than the benchmark of 75 prediction accuracy this study has proven that the number of water quality parameters in a monitoring process can be reduced all three scenarios have shown that nh3 n ph and ss have less important effect on the predicted wqi since the prediction accuracy of the model remained above the 75 benchmark when these parameters were omitted from the input variables these findings could change the way wqi class is predicted and monitored in the future thus allowing for better water resources management by reducing the cost and the time involved in the monitoring process the decision tree model is very useful in predicting wqi since it has a remarkable ability to simplify analyse and classify raw data to reduce its complexity and non linearity however a more in depth study needs to be carried out to further improve the prediction accuracy of the model this predictive model could be improved by conducting an extensive study of the correlation between water quality parameters integration with other data pre processing algorithm might be able to reduce the complexity of the data hence improve the ability of the decision tree process to achieve better prediction accuracy although the proposed model has worthy shown appropriate prediction accuracy for wqi class for malaysian conditions the model in its present architecture may not directly apply to other regions without case specific modifications a major outcome from the current research is that the proposed wqi s class prediction model can be of global interest wherever the decision makers the regulators or other stakeholdersare interested in identifying the wqi class rather than the actual value of wq parameters the flexibility given within the proposed prediction model s structure to identify the specifics e g number of classes variables ranges etc is an essential step for model developers to adapt the model to their own case study s conditions acknowledgement the research is funded by the university of malaya research grant umrg rp025a 18sus and supported partially by universiti kebangsaan malaysia

6336,the development of water quality prediction models is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers the traditional method for computing wqi is always associated with errors due to the protracted analysis of the water quality parameters in addition to the great effort and time involved in gathering and analyzing water samples in addition the cost of identifying the magnitude of some of the parameters through experimental testing is very high the water quality of rivers in malaysia is ranked into five classes based on water quality index wqi wqi is function of six water quality parameters ammoniac nitrogen nh3 n biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do ph and suspended solids ss in this research the decision tree machine learning technique is used to predict the wqi for the klang river and its classification within a specific water quality class klang river is one of the most polluted rivers in malaysia modeling experiments are designed to test the prediction and classification accuracy of the model based on various scenarios composed of different water quality parameters results show that the proposed prediction model has a promising potential to predict the class of the wqi moreover the proposed model offers a more efficient process and cost effective approach for the computation and prediction of

supply is sourced from rivers especially in malaysia the deteriorating river water quality has an impact on river health including fluvial ecology which increases the risk to human health and the challenges to ensure sustainable production of drinking water the development of water quality prediction models is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers during the last several decades efforts have been made to develop accurate prediction models for water quality parameters by utilizing different modelling methods chau 2006 manache and melching 2008 singh et al 2011 researchers among others have given special attention to the artificial intelligence modelling methods maier and dandy 2000 artificial neural networks anns have been used with success to predict water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen do biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod in waterways since do is considered to be the most important parameter in river water quality

anns to simulate do concentration in the yamuna river the researchers found that in order for their ann model to achieve the best performance an optimal number of input variables have to be fed into the model the complexity of a model increased with higher number of input variables and the performance drastically deteriorated with the over reduction of the model input afan et al 2017 sarkar and pandey 2015 a study conducted by csábrági et al 2017 compared the performance of different anns in predicting do concentration the study compared the performance of multivariate linear regression mlr and three other ann models multilayer propagation neural networks mlpnns radial basis networks rbfnns and general regression neural networks grnns the result of the study indicated that the major drawback of mlpnns is the need for multiple runs to avoid the possibility of a misleading outcome of a single run the study concluded that grnns gave the best do prediction in contrast to mlpnns rbfnns and mlr csábrági et al 2017 these studies showed that not only are anns able to predict water quality parameters but they also provide recommendations for modification and improvement of their drawbacks and prediction performance as was shown in the grnn najah et al 2012 conducted a study on water quality prediction by using integrated wavelet anfis model three water quality parameters i e total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity and turbidity of the johor river were used in the study anfis was modified using a wavelet de noising technique to reduce the complex uncertainty induced noise which allows the model to produce superior result as compared to those obtained when using mlpnns and anfis where the mean absolute error in percentage could be as low as 0 01 najah et al 2012 these studies have shown the degree to which machine learning ml models can be used to predict water quality parameters even though they have a complex and non linear computational method and are stochastic in nature in fact the flexibility of ml models makes it possible to develop a better and more effective models to deal with the difficulties in monitoring water quality parameters these studies however focused on the prediction of a single water quality parameter rather than focusing on the prediction of water quality index wqi however several water quality parameters have to be monitored analysed in order to obtain the required information to estimate of wqi as a matter of fact the process of obtaining such predefined water quality parameters is time consuming and very costly in this regard the present study will focus on developing a prediction model for wqi which requires less water quality parameters and therefore reduce the time required to perform the analysis and minimize the cost required in order to achieve the desired wqi for rivers based on the conditions in malaysia the authors believe that this model could potentially be generalized for application to several river conditions worldwide the computation of the water quality index wqi in malaysia which involves a series of sub index calculations is lengthy and complicated and is often associated with errors during the computation processes there are complex and non linear relationships between the wqi and the water quality parameters furthermore some of the parameters require exhaustive sample collection campaign that is time consuming and must be conducted by skilled technicians to ensure accurate sample analysis and data representation even with advanced equipment and technology high operative and management cost hinders a comprehensive spatial and temporal monitoring of river water quality hence there is a need to develop a data driven model with a high capability in order to simplify the processes reduce the errors and reduce the need for costly and time consuming sampling and lab analysis decision tree is a popular machine learning tool and is often used to identify possible consequences such as the chance event outcomes investment risks decision making and interest rate this classifier modelling method showed an outstanding performance even when used with a complex dataset to identify its pattern behaviour everaert et al 2016 the main objective of this research is to develop a model for predicting the class of wqi which indicate the status of river water quality the decision tree modelling has been utilized as a predictor for the wqi class the proposed decision tree model will be evaluated under three different scenarios by utilizing the water quality data for the klang river since it is the most polluted river in malaysia othman et al 2012 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the klang river runs through urban and developed areas cutting right through the middle of the federal territory of kuala lumpur while the upstream and downstream parts of the river flow through the state of selangor it is situated between latitudes 2 55 n and 3 25 n and longitude 101 i5 e and 101 55 e geographically the klang river begins at an altitude of about 1200 m on the western slopes of peninsula malaysia and runs south westwards to join the gombak river in the centre of kuala lumpur the klang river is almost 120 km long and its drainage basin area is around 1260 km2 the population in the klang river basin is projected to reach 10 million by the year 2020 from the current estimated population of 7 2 million several water treatment plants wtps extract water from the tributaries within the klang river basin i e bukit nanas and wangsa maju with a design capacity of 145 mld and 45 mld respectively mohamed et al 2015 however it should be noted that despite the huge basin area most of the treated water for kuala lumpur is supplied by the neighbouring state of selangor fig 1 shows the klang river basin the department of environment doe has setup numerous water quality stations along the main stream of the klang river which are operated by the did to facilitate the monitoring and management of water resources the six parameters as presented in eq 1 were measured and additional assessment on conductivity turbidity salinity temperature microbial nutrients and heavy metals concentration are made when there is a necessity for it sharif et al 2015 the klang river basin lies in an area with humid tropical climate that is characterised by heavy rainfall uniform temperature and high humidity in the east at the foothill the average annual rainfall is almost 2600 mm and the amount decreases to around 1900 mm at the coast peak rainfall occurs during two two month periods i e from april to may and october to november during the southwest and northeast monsoons respectively the average monthly humidity is between 80 and 85 the average monthly temperature in the basin ranges between 26 and 28 c the daily sunshine duration is between 4 5 and 7 0 h day and the daily evaporation ranges between 3 and 5 mm day el shafie et al 2012 the land use in the klang valley basin area is diverse ranging from tropical forests in the headwater region to urban areas with their associated activities in the central region and agriculture in the fringes of the basin about 41 of the basin is agricultural area 29 is urban 25 is forests and swamps and tin mines make up 5 of the total basin area the urban area consists of recreational residential industrial institutional and commercial zones the klang river basin has been experiencing serious environmental degradation and flooding as a result of continuous development industrialization and population growth the rapid development in the area is expected to further increase the probability of water stress condition with regard to future water supply a report published by the did in 2011 projected that the water demand in kuala lumpur gombak petaling and klang will increase to 1194 million liter per day mld for the period between 2015 and 2050 the klang river is currently critically polluted due to inefficient water quality management improperly treated sewage and industrial and residential discharges from the klang river basin flow into the river this problem is compounded by high events of soil erosion as a result of inefficient control plan at construction sites 2 2 data collection the data collected from the 15 automatic monitoring stations for the six parameters during the period between 2000 and 2010 for klang river are demonstrated in fig 2 fig 2 shows the distribution of the six water quality parameters measured between the years 2000 and 2010 the do parameter gives a direct assessment of river health fig 2a shows that the do data contains a significant fraction of low do concentration even up to 1 mg l especially during the period between 2000 and 2002 the do concentration improved substantially in 2003 with an average value of 4 mg l despite the fluctuation in the value of do concentration which occasionally reached the desirable class i category the klang river is in fact a class iii river this is supported by the average value of cod and bod concentrations of 45 and 7 mg l respectively the spikes observed in fig 2b which could peak to 50 mg l for bod is believed to be due to illegal sewage discharges even though the government has imposed strict penalties on those who cause pollution the large area of the klang river basin makes it possible for blind spot discharge locations to exist thus allowing the polluters to avoid being caught by the authorities high concentration of tss was observed in the first few years of the current millennium with the highest measured tss of 1400 mg l fig 2d the rapid development taking place in recent years in kuala lumpur coupled with the lack of training in the proper implementation of erosion and sediment control plan escp are believed to be a major factor contributing to the high levels of sedimentation in the klang river the level of ammonia nitrogen has clearly exceeded the value stipulated in the guideline with the maximum measured value being 20 times higher than the value set for class iii the mean nh3 n value of 4 mg l put the klang river in class v category hence posing serious ecological risk fig 2e shows that the ph ranges between 5 5 and 8 which is within the acceptable range for class ii and iii stipulated in the water quality standard of rivers table 2 the water quality indexes during the study period fluctuate widely between the year 2000 and mid 2005 the classification of klang river varied between class i and class v with an average of class iii throughout this period in 2006 the state of the klang river has improved significantly and a smaller fluctuation was observed in the water quality index despite of this the klang river is still categorized as a class iii river the temporal data of the wqi showed that the klang river was categorized as class i only once 0 01 percent of the time class v twenty times 0 2 of the time and class ii 66 times 6 9 of the time during the study period during the period between the year 2000 and 2010 classifications activities were carried out each two months for the klang river the results showed that klang river mostly was categorized as class iii and class iv 46 and 45 of the time respectively 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 determination of wqi in 1978 the department of environment doe in malaysia introduced the water quality index wqi and started to monitor river water quality the aim of this initiative was to establish a baseline monitoring system for river water quality to detect any changes in water quality and to identify the sources of pollution so that immediate actions could be taken to mitigate the pollution since then a total of 1064 manual monitoring sites have been set up in 143 river basins in malaysia doe 2007 the formula for calculating wqi was proposed by the doe and a panel of experts was consulted on the choice of parameters and the relative weight to be assigned to each parameter hameed et al 2016 the wqi is computed based on six water quality parameters i e biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do suspended solids ss ph and ammoniac nitrogen nh3 n the formula for computing the wqi is given by eq 1 and table 1 presents the formula used to calculate the sub indexes si water quality is ranked into class i ii iii iv and v based on the wqi and the interim national water quality standards for malaysia inwqs as shown in table 2 doe 2007 currently there are 15 automatic monitoring stations which continuously monitor the water quality in the klang river 1 wqi 0 22 s i d o 0 19 s i b o d 0 16 s i c o d 0 16 s i s s 0 15 s i a n 0 12 s i p 2 3 2 decision tree modelling approach decision tree model is one of the most frequently used techniques in data mining it is a popular machine learning tool and is often used to identify possible consequences such as the chance of event outcomes investment risks decision making and interest rate azad and moshkov 2017 khosravi et al 2018 the id3 core algorithm in the decision tree model employs a top down greedy search through the space of possible branches with no backtracking and allows the handling of both categorical and numerical data decision tree models are able to include predictors with dependence assumptions between the predictors brown and myles 2013 decision tree works with a tree structure building classification and regression models when a dataset is fed into this model as an input layer the system breaks down the complex dataset into small subsets while at the same time building a decision tree model by analysing those data see fig 3 the basic idea of decision trees is known as the divide and conquer technique the dataset is broken down into different parts in each step and each part is supposed to better represent one of the possible classes of the data the result is a tree structure where each inner node represents a test for the value of an attribute and each leaf represents the decision for a particular class a new and unknown case is then routed down the tree until it reaches one of the leaves brown and myles 2013 fig 4 presents the structure of a decision tree model where the decision and the leaf nodes are represented by squares and circles respectively each node has two options based on the value type of the feature used at this node for nominal features the number of children is usually equal to the number of possible values of this feature by using a nominal feature for a test in one of the inner nodes the dataset at this stage is basically divided based on the different values of this feature hence a nominal feature will not be tested more than once since all examples further down the tree will have the same value as this particular feature this is different for numerical attributes where test is performed if the attribute value is greater or less than a determined constant the attribute could be tested several times for different constants a decision tree is constructed top down in a recursive divide and conquer mode at the first stage the feature for the root node is selected then a branch for each possible feature value is formed and the cases are split into subsets based on the possible values finally these steps are repeated recursively for each branch using only cases that reach the branch the process will stop when all instances have the same class among the key advantages of a decision tree model are the ease of understanding and interpreting the results and the possibility of adding new scenarios which helps to predict an unpredicted outcome 2 3 3 model configuration the predictive modelling for estimating the wqi for the klang river is investigated based on six predictors i e bod cod do ss ph and nh3 n these input variables were normalised using the z transformation before being fed into the model the normalisation subtracts the mean of the data from all values and divides them by the standard deviation hence the distribution of the data has a mean of zero and a variance of one the purpose of z transformation is to ensure the preservation of the original data distribution and to ensure that the modelling is not affected by outliers kotu and deshpande 2014 in this study data from the years 2001 to 2009 were used for training and validation 95 whilst the data for the year 2010 5 were kept for testing fig 5 illustrates the stages and sections of the modelling several parameters have to be set when using decision tree as the predictive modelling in the rapidminer studio hofmann et al 2013 this software has several parameters to be configured such as the criterion where it is set to gain ratio gain ratio is a splitting feature that adjusts the information gain for each feature to allow for the breadth and uniformity of the feature values maximum depth is the parameter used to restrict the depth of the decision tree where this value is set to 1 in order to not impose any bound on the depth of the tree another important parameter used for the pessimistic error calculation of pruning is the confidence level which is set to be 0 25 the present study employs the pre pruning parameters which represent the stopping criteria the pre pruning is represented by minimal gain and was set to be 0 01 minimal leaf size is two minimal split size is two and the number of pre pruning alternative is two these configurations were set to ensure that the modelling is able to maximise the analysis of parameters correlated with the wqi in order to obtain a more accurate prediction kotu and deshpande 2014 fig 5 and fig 6 show the model configuration in the rapidminer studio these figures show the flow work of model inside the rapidminer interface which is represented by two main stages training and testing 2 3 4 modeling scenarios during the setting up of the modelling it was conducted with all six water quality parameters as input variables to determine the model performance since the main purpose of this research is to use the decision tree to predict the wqi based on a smaller number of parameters as inputs to achieve higher effectiveness and efficiency in determining the wqi of rivers this predictive modelling focused more on prediction accuracy based on lower number of inputs each scenario was developed by reducing the number of water quality parameters as model input parameters to five four and three instead of the six parameters stipulated in the did manual the successful implementation of the proposed decision tree model with a minimal number of model input variables would result in minimal cost of wqi prediction for river water quality this could also reduce the time taken to analyse the water sample in the laboratory to determine the value of the cut off parameters furthermore these scenario analyses would also allow for the identification of the correlation between water quality parameters and the wqi classes in the first scenario five parameters were used as inputs and one parameter was omitted for each case the second scenario has four inputs thereby providing fifteen possibilities with various configuration of water quality parameters in the third scenario the number of neurons was decreased to three and thus increasing the total number of experiments within this scenario to 20 with more possibilities of input combinations tables 3 5 show all combinations of input data for the three scenarios the monthly river water quality data for the klang river basin between 2001 and 2010 were z transformed to speed up the training process and reduce the influence of outliers in the dataset this decision tree modelling was run with infinity depth confidence level of 0 25 and minimal gain of 0 1 to ensure that the model is able to achieve a higher degree of analysis accuracy the optimal architecture was determined based on the prediction accuracy with a minimum benchmark of 75 2 3 5 model performance criteria the accuracy of the predictive modelling was evaluated based on three criteria in order to measure the performance of the model the measurement of performance does not specifically look at the difference between the traditionally computed and the predicted wqi values instead the investigation focused on the similarity of class between the predicted and the wqi values obtained using eq 1 classical statistical measures such as mean absolute error maximum error and mean square error are not required for the comparison of error between the actual and the predicted wqi values for example the range for class iv wqi is set between 31 0 and 51 9 if the computed value using the wqi equations is 50 which indicates class iv and the predicted value is 32 which falls under the class iv then the model is deemed to be acceptable even though the difference between 50 and 32 is rather high and has a poor prediction error in terms of the classical error measure evaluation on the other hand if the measured wqi is 30 class v and the predicted wqi is 32 class iv then the model has made an inaccurate prediction of the wqi class even though the difference between the two values is small in classification or class prediction it is essential to evaluate the model performance at the overall level but also at each class individually therefore there is a need to examine all the possible cases that designate the relationship between the predicted wqi class as the model output and the actual wqi class in fact there are four cases that could occur and should be taken into account to measure the model performance at each class individually the first case is a true positive which is correctly identifying the wqi class in this case the model result is one that detects the class condition when the condition is present the second case is the true negative test that the result is one that does not detect the condition when the condition is absent in other words the model output result correctly rejects the wqi class it should be noted that the second case condition did not occur in this study as wqi class should fall in one of the five classes and never be in neutral condition the third case of condition is the false positive incorrectly identified condition which is experienced when the test result is one that detects the condition when the condition is absent finally the fourth case is the false negative test result is one that does not detect the condition when the condition is present this case represents the incorrectly rejected condition let tp denotes the number of true positives tn the number of true negatives fp the number of false positives and fn the number of false negatives as shown in fig 7 the overall prediction accuracy for the model could be calculated as the sum of tp for all classes the summation of all number in the yellow cells divided by the total number of the tested data 44 in our study in order to carry out the model performance analysis at the class level to examine the performance of the model at each class individually the following evaluation measures could be used sensitivity measures class recall the ability of a test to detect the condition when the condition is present thus sensitivity tp tp fn predictive value positive class precision is the proportion of positives that correspond to the presence of the condition thus predictive value positive tp tp fp the performance vector was calculated based on the confusion matrix shown in table 6 the model performance was evaluated using three types of assessment including prediction accuracy class precision and class recall equation 2 was used to estimate the prediction accuracy which is defined as the ability of the classifier to select all cases that need to be selected and reject all cases that need to be rejected for a classifier with 100 accuracy this would imply that false negative false positive 0 precision is defined as the proportion of cases found that were actually relevant based on the calculation made using eq 3 finally the recall is expressed by eq 4 which is defined as the proportion of the relevant cases that were actually found among all the relevant cases the formulae for performance criteria are expressed as follows 2 prediction a c c u r a c y all c l a s s e s class 1 n t r u e p o

scenarios was developed in order to evaluate each possible input combination for scenario 6 15 and 20 possible combination cases were assessed for the three scenarios respectively the detailed results for each scenario are presented separately in appendix a b and c for first second and third scenario respectively but the main findings are presented below 3 1 first scenario input data with five water quality parameters in the first scenario the prediction model was run based on five different water quality parameters with six different combinations as shown in table 7 data shows that scenario 1 1 i e without nh3 n produced the best result with an accuracy of 84 09 as can be seen in table a 1 the best performance for this combination is supported by the class recall for true iii true iv and true v which achieved 84 85 100 00 and 100 00 respectively and in class precision for predicted iii predicted iv and predicted v 93 99 61 54 and 100 00 respectively table a 2 shows that although not all data were accurately predicted the false predicted data in test 1 1 were still close to its original class for example two data for true ii fall in the predicted iii and five data for true iii fall in the predicted iv in this scenario five other tests were not able to achieve an accuracy of at least 75 00 interestingly the model with these configurations was not able to accurately predict the most critical class v tables a 3 a 6 show that all the data for true v fall in the predicted iii which is a wide difference between the true and the predicted values class v is the lowest class in the wqi and it is very crucial for this class to be correctly identified so that immediate actions can be taken to reduce the effect of the unacceptable limits for the quality of water on the environment and human use based on the analysis the influence of each water quality parameter was investigated in this predictive modelling result show that nh3 n has the least effect on the predicted wqi with notable high accuracy 84 09 for test 1 1 this is a somewhat positive outcome considering the high cost for experimental analysis of nh3 n the cost for laboratory analysis could be reduced by omitting thenh3 n parameter from the modelling input variables 3 2 second scenario input data with four water quality parameters the main objective for carrying out scenario ii is to improve model performance by reducing the number of input variable for the model by using only four water quality parameters different combinations of inputs as shown in table 8 were tested the accuracy of this modelling was determined based on the percentage of prediction accuracy followed by the percentage of class precision and class recall the 15 combinations for water quality parameters are given in appendix b scenario 2 1 provides the best performance with a prediction accuracy of 81 82 with bod cod ss and do as the four inputs it should be noted that besides this combination scenarios 2 7 and 2 15 were able to achieve a prediction accuracy benchmark of 75 00 interestingly the same parameters in both tests are nh3 n and ss table b 1 shows that scenario 2 1 achieved a class precision of 93 10 for predicted iii 57 14 for predicted iv and 100 00 for predicted v the achievement of class recalls for true iii true iv and true v were 81 82 100 00 100 00 respectively in contrast to scenario 1 1 scenario 2 1 omitted ph from the inputs of the modelling and still showed a promising result for this predictive modelling 36 out of 44 which is very close to the prediction accuracy of scenario 1 1 37 out of 44 the results for scenarios 2 7 and 2 15 are shown in table b 7 and table b 15 respectively even though both scenarios achieved a prediction accuracy of 75 00 they were not able to predict the most critical class v the results for both scenarios for true v fall in the predicted iii which is a wide deviation from its original class hence both input combinations for scenarios 2 7 and 2 15 are not qualified for this predictive modelling see tables b 2 b 6 b 10 b 14 and c1 the results of the analysis in the second scenario further proved that nh3 n is the least effective parameter correlated to the prediction of wqi additionally ph has been shown to be a parameter with low correlation to a certain extent to wqi prediction in malaysia the ph of the discharge into rivers is strictly monitored and is the easiest parameter to be monitored as its measurement can be easily obtained in situ and without further laboratory analysis moreover since malaysia is a tropical country which receives plenty of rainfall throughout the year the value of ph in rivers can be easily diluted and neutralised by the rainfall hence the omission of ph and nh3 n as input data for predictive modelling have no effect on the prediction of wqi class in addition to the least effective parameter correlated to wqi prediction this scenario is also able to identify the most effective parameter correlated with wqi analysis of the lowest prediction accuracy across the 15 set of combinations show that scenario 2 12 which excludes bod and do from the predictive model was able to achieve a prediction accuracy of only 25 00 this proves that bod and do are important parameters in the determination of wqi 3 3 third scenario input data with three water quality parameters in the third scenario the number of inputs was further reduced to three parameters a total of 20 different combinations were tested using the predictive modelling and the results are presented in table 9 by using only three parameters to predict wqi scenarios 3 2 and 3 20 were able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 77 27 which is slightly higher than the benchmark of 75 the parameters used in scenario 3 2 were bod cod and do whilst those in scenario 3 20 are do ph nh3 n although both tests showed good ability to predict wqi scenario 3 2 shows a better result in contrast scenario 3 20 with regard to the accuracy of class precision and class recall table c 2 shows that scenario 3 2 achieved a precision of 92 59 50 and 100 for the prediction of class iii iv and v respectively for class recall the test achieved a prediction of 75 76 for true iii 100 00 for true iv and 100 00 for true v in addition the false predicted classes are still close to their original classes for example two data points for class ii fall in predicted class iii and eight data points for class iii fall in predicted class iv see tables c 3 c 19 the result for scenario 3 20 is presented in table c 20 it shows that two data points for true ii fall in predicted iii and predicted iv four data points for true iii fall in predicted iv three data for true iv fall in predicted iii and the only data for true v fall in predicted iii the accuracy for class precision is 85 29 50 00 and 0 00 for predicted ii predicted iv and predicted v respectively the accuracy of class recall is 87 88 62 50 and 0 00 for true iii true iv and true v respectively results of the analysis show that even though the parameters used in scenario 3 20 were able to achieve a high accuracy they were disqualified from being used in this predictive modelling since they were not able to accurately predict the most critical class v additionally the false predicted data show a high deviation from their true value the third scenario proved that nh3 n has the lowest correlation with the prediction of wqi based on scenario 3 2 by excluding nh3 n wqi can be predicted without much loss of information in other words bod cod and do are the most important parameters corresponding to the relative weights given in eq 1 which have a higher correlation with wqi prediction this is proven by the result for scenario 3 19 which achieved 31 82 prediction accuracy when using ss ph and nh3 n as its input data not only did the test achieve low prediction accuracy most of the false predicted data deviate significantly from their true value the data driven model based on decision tree procedure can be considered as a further step for achieving an adaptable water quality index prediction model furthermore the utilization of such modelling procedure is not only able to accurately predict the water quality index but also able to improve the water quality monitoring program by reducing the time consuming and costly experimental testing for each parameter particularly nh3 n additionally the utilization of decision tree to predict water quality index could produce accurate results by allowing the use of a larger database for existing river water quality in malaysia the development of the proposed model in other tropical regions would allow for improvement of the present modelling system which would then result in higher accuracy the ability of the proposed model to predict the class of water quality through the calculation of wqi s class is believed to have similar potential in predicting the indices based river and ecological conditions such as belgium biotic index bbi species at risk index spear and german saprobic index gsi von der ohe et al 2007 interestingly the universal water quality index uwqi utilises 12 parameters of water quality intended for the abstraction of drinking water whereby the calculated index is categorised into three classes based on ec legislation 74 440 eec boyacioglu 2007 based on the similarity in the indices calculation we anticipate that the proposed model s architecture will provide a promising approach for predicting other ecological and water quality indices 4 conclusion this research studied the use of decision tree model for water quality index prediction in a tropical environment the monthly water quality data from the klang river for a ten year period 2001 2010 were utilized in this research a decision tree algorithm was developed to predict the wqi of the klang river by taking into account several scenarios each of which used varying number of water quality parameters as modelling inputs three different scenarios were examined using the decision tree model viz those with five four and three water quality parameters as the model input with the wqi class as the target output for each scenario in this study the best prediction accuracy for the first scenario is 84 09 when nh3 n was omitted from the input variables in the second scenario the best prediction accuracy of 81 82 was achieved when nh3 n and ph were omitted from the input variables and a prediction accuracy of 77 27 was achieved when nh3 n ph and ss were omitted as input variables in the third scenario the three results achieved a prediction accuracy that is higher than the benchmark of 75 prediction accuracy this study has proven that the number of water quality parameters in a monitoring process can be reduced all three scenarios have shown that nh3 n ph and ss have less important effect on the predicted wqi since the prediction accuracy of the model remained above the 75 benchmark when these parameters were omitted from the input variables these findings could change the way wqi class is predicted and monitored in the future thus allowing for better water resources management by reducing the cost and the time involved in the monitoring process the decision tree model is very useful in predicting wqi since it has a remarkable ability to simplify analyse and classify raw data to reduce its complexity and non linearity however a more in depth study needs to be carried out to further improve the prediction accuracy of the model this predictive model could be improved by conducting an extensive study of the correlation between water quality parameters integration with other data pre processing algorithm might be able to reduce the complexity of the data hence improve the ability of the decision tree process to achieve better prediction accuracy although the proposed model has worthy shown appropriate prediction accuracy for wqi class for malaysian conditions the model in its present architecture may not directly apply to other regions without case specific modifications a major outcome from the current research is that the proposed wqi s class prediction model can be of global interest wherever the decision makers the regulators or other stakeholdersare interested in identifying the wqi class rather than the actual value of wq parameters the flexibility given within the proposed prediction model s structure to identify the specifics e g number of classes variables ranges etc is an essential step for model developers to adapt the model to their own case study s conditions acknowledgement the research is funded by the university of malaya research grant umrg rp025a 18sus and supported partially by universiti kebangsaan malaysia

hazen equation for ksat of 47 samples collected in nine surficial geologic units from poorly sorted to well sorted soils the means of the two datasets were statistically similar 49 m day kfs vs 41 m day ksat although the variability between the datasets was significantly different with a standard deviation ranging from 44 m day kfs to 75 m day ksat the wilcoxon paired samples and paired t test results suggest the datasets are statistically similar additionally 98 of the 47 paired values were within one order of magnitude of each other the methods presented herein can be used for surficial geologic unit delineation planning purposes and optimizing hydrological models keywords hydraulic conductivity particle size distribution bottomless bucket surficial geology modified brabets 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity is a critical hydrogeologic parameter affecting fluid transport in soils and rocks however large spatial variations in soil hydraulic properties have led to challenges in accurately characterizing this parameter on a local scale particulary within heterogeneous surficial deposits estimates of hydraulic conductivity are known to vary widely across different deposit types and can take on values spanning over 13 orders of magnitude freeze and cherry 1979 in mountainous landscapes hydraulic conductivity can be strongly influenced by topographic variations gebrelibanos and assen 2014 as well as geomorphic qualities such as slope aspect carey and woo 1999 sun et al 2019 soil hydrologic properties can also exhibit significant spatial and temporal variation due to anthropogenic influences such as climate change jarvis et al 2013 vegetation degradation pan et al 2017 fire disturbance neary et al 1999 and agriculture teague et al 2011 methods for measuring hydraulic conductivity also vary widely in their accuracy and ease of use laboratory based methods typically require more time and effort while field based methods tend to be quicker and simpler measuring field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs is usually accomplished in the field via apparati such as single and double ring infiltrometers or borehole flowmeters if a sample is brought back to the lab falling head or constant head permeameters can also be used to measure kfs in general surface methods are most likely to accurately reflect infiltration capacities and runoff as opposed to the permeameter and borehole flowmeter nimmo et al 2009 the type of material can also influence the accuracy of different methods and in poorly sorted materials such as glacial till estimates of k based on particle size distribution methods are known to be less accurate jenssen 1990 ronayne et al 2012 on a global scale estimates of hydraulic conductivity are important for landscape hydrologic modeling however these values are really only obtainable via pedotransfer functions ptfs which crudely estimate hydraulic conductivity from soil properties observed in the field such as bulk density and soil texture zhang et al 2018 the glacially fed eklutna lake provides anchorage with 88 percent of its water supply 27 4 billion liters in 2017 awwu 2018 and a small percentage of the city s power supply via hydropower generation however the glacier has retreated significantly over the last 95 years karpilo 2010 and consequently the relative importance of snowmelt and rainfall has increased in the long term detailed studies of of the hydrologic properties of eklutna watershed surficial deposits will become increasingly important the goal of this paper is to determine the range of hydraulic conductivity values for eklutna valley surficial deposits using two independent field based methods which will aid in the effective management of this water resource each of these methods mathematically derives k in different ways field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs uses on site infiltration data i e nimmo et al 2009 while saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat uses sieve derived particle size distribution data i e hazen 1892 the nimmo et al 2009 method offers a decrease in the complexity of equipment required as well as the ability to calculate kfs values rapidly in the field therefore we ask the question do these two methods requiring distinctly different amounts of time and effort produce statistically similar results moreover through a statistical comparison of the output from these two methods we seek to characterize the variability of hydraulic conductivity in a glaciated alpine setting finally for the sake of comparison our measured kfs and ksat datasets are evaluated against a publicly available ksat dataset estimated by the nrcs 2018 using pedotransfer functions 2 study area glacial history in the eklutna watershed has been traced back to pre wisconsin age before 130 000 years before present bp consisting of the mount susitna glaciation and the caribou hills glaciation subsequently the eklutna glaciation occurred between 130 000 and 85 000 bp and is identified by till and outwash deposits exposed in bluffs along the knik arm north of eagle river flats karlstrom 1956 the naptowne glaciation was the last major episode of glaciation between 45 000 bp and 7 000 bp of the wisconsin ice age karlstrom 1956 many smaller glacial advances are evidenced in the eklutna valley by the various lateral and end moraine deposits most important are the elmendorf moraine dishno pond moraine and the fort richardson moraine as described and illustrated by brabets 1993a all of which are late pleistocene age the till that makes up the moraine deposits is a diamicton consisting of massive poorly sorted gravel sand and silt mixtures with small amounts of clay and scattered boulders brabets 1993a the eklutna glacier terminated at about 366 m elevation in 1957 but in 1988 terminated at about 732 m elevation brabets 1993a while retreating 366 m vertically the eklutna glacier also receded about 1 6 km horizontally over the same 30 year period brabets 1993a more recently glacial melting was quantified by sass et al 2017 showing substantial mass loss over the past half century from 1957 to 2010 mass balance was 0 52 0 46 m w e per year and increased to 0 74 0 46 m w e a 1 between 2010 and 2015 approximately 7 of the inflow to eklutna lake is derived from net mass loss from eklutna glacier sass et al 2017 previous studies of the surficial geology in the eklutna watershed are summarized in the surficial geological maps of brabets 1993b and nrcs 2018 but do not specifically address hydraulic conductivity meyerhofer 2016 described hydraulic conductivity in the eklutna basin by characterizing the soil according to texture and then assigning a range of saturated hydraulic conductivity values defined by the u s department of agriculture these results are largely similar to the broad ranges provided by the nrcs 2018 surficial geologic units defined by material type and expression of the topography in the eklutna watershed range from poorly sorted mixed till to well sorted river sands fig 1 detailed unit descriptions are included in appendix a the study area was defined based on brabets 1993b surficial geology map restricted to include only the area between the eklutna glacier terminus and the point where the eklutna river enters eklutna lake fig 1 lidar light detection and ranging images and aerial photographs were digitally overlain by brabets 1993b surficial geological map thus allowing for a closer analysis of topography glacial geomorphology and degree of accessibility a similar technique was used by smith et al 2006 to compare remotely sensed data to field mapping data concluding that lidar is a relatively complete representation of the glacial geomorphology 3 methods 3 1 sampling strategy to place constraints on hydraulic conductivity k for eklutna basin surficial geologic units two methods were employed the bottomless bucket nimmo et al 2009 and particle size distribution psd analysis hazen 1892 techniques the bottomless bucket method is an in situ process utilizing a bucket apparatus sampling technique with measured values applied to nimmo et al s 2009 equation 1 k fs l g t f in 1 d 0 l g λ where lg ring installation scaling length m tf time when falling head is zero seconds do depth of ponding m and λ macroscopic capillary length m the value of λ is related to the capillary forces in the soil where λ 0 03 m for extremely coarse and gravelly soils λ 0 08 m for soils with significant structural development and λ 0 25 m for fine textured soils without macro pores because estimated kfs values show minimal sensitivity to the λ values used the value of 0 08 m was chosen which is appropriate for application to most soils elrick et al 1989 the second method used was a psd analysis which involves an ex situ soil sieve gradation analysis to obtain the effective grain size d10 in conjunction with hazen s 1892 equation for ksat 2 k sat ρ g μ n φ n d e 2 where 0 9981 density of water in g cm3 g 980 gravity in cm s2 μ 0 0098 centipoise kinematic viscosity in g cm s n 6 10 4 a constant dependent on characteristics of the porous medium φ n 1 10 n 0 26 function of porosity n 0 255 1 0 83 u porosity and de d10 effective grain size in mm grain uniformity u is measured as the ratio of d60 to d10 where d60 equals grain size at which 60 percent of grains are finer and d10 is the grain size at which 10 percent of grains are finer fifty two sampling points were systematically placed among the modified brabets surficial units modification explained in fig 1 a minimum of three sample points were placed within each unit with the exception of the talus cone unit where only two sample points were collected sample point locations were digitized in gis software establishing a general latitude and longitude and then uploaded into a handheld global positioning system gps unit with an average accuracy of 3 m 3 2 data collection at each sample site the bottomless bucket technique was used to measure field saturated hydraulic conductivity this method employed a 19 liter bucket with the bottom surface carefully cut out and dimensions of the bucket recorded for later calculations all leaf litter and loose organic matter was cleared from the soil surface the bottomless bucket was inserted into the ground to a depth of up to two inches a pre measured amount of water varying from 3 8 to 7 6 l was poured into the apparatus the time it took for the water to completely drain into the soil s surface was measured with a stopwatch for later use in eq 1 soil samples were collected at each site and brought back for psd analysis from the 52 sample locations five samples did not make it back to the lab due to transportation mishap the 47 remaining samples were oven dried for 1 5 h at 65 c on a foil sheet once dried the sample was weighed to 0 1 g the dried sample was placed in a container and de aggregated with a rubber mallet until all visual clods of dirt were broken down following the practices of astm d421 2007 clods present in the samples were assumed to be created during the drying process and not present in the field after being de aggregated each sample was placed in a sieve stack 12 7 mm 0 841 mm 0 420 mm 0 250 mm 0 149 mm and 0 074 mm run for 15 minutes on a sieve shaker gilson ss 15 sieve shaker then emptied onto a tared plate and the weight of the soil sample retained in each sieve was recorded each sieve s mesh fabric was cleaned with a coarse brush between samples size fractions were plugged into hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 in order to determine d10 for use in eq 2 producing ksat values for each of the 47 samples 3 3 statistical analysis to evaluate the datasets bottomless bucket and psd two statistical paired sample tests were performed on the 47 samples the non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test is a paired difference test and evaluates whether two datasets have similar or different population ranked means where the null hypothesis suggests that the two populations have similar distributions and means the coefficient of variation cv was used as another comparative analysis between the variability of measured kfs and ksat datasets the cv calculates the dispersion variance of data points around a mean deb and shukla 2012 used cv analysis to evaluate the results of multiple sampling methods of various soil types an f test was used to evaluate the equality of variance between the datasets which is a test used to compare the variance between two sample sets with the null hypothesis that the samples are from different distributions a two tailed paired t test was also performed assuming unequal variance which is a parametric wilcoxon equivalent the two tailed t test was chosen because the direction of any relationship in the data is unknown and unknown effects could be missed with a one tailed test the null hypothesis of a two tailed t test is that the difference between the true means of the datasets is equal to zero to test for a relationship between measured kfs and ksat correlation analyses were performed using kendall s tau test non parametric and the pearson product moment correlation test parametric the closeness of the these coefficients to 1 or 1 reflects the strength of linear relationship between two variables while the p value at the chosen α level of significance can suggest if a linear relationship exists also included is a comparison of nrcs delineated surficial units and nrcs ksat values with measured kfs and ksat values obtained in this study 4 results presented are the results of measured field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat from surficial units brabets 1993b within the eklutna valley overall the range of kfs and ksat values spanned one to two orders of magnitude minimum of 1 m day to a maximum of 390 m day respectively mean k values ranged from 49 kfs to 41 ksat m day and median k values ranged from 34 kfs to 10 ksat m day with standard deviation ranging from 44 to 75 m day respectively table 1 of the 47 samples 25 were in the same order of magnitude 21 were within one order of magnitude and one sample was within two orders of magnitude delta lake deposit kfs and ksat were also analyzed for each of the surficial units brabets 1993b in the study area table 2 and fig 2 among these units mean kfs values ranged from 11 m day outwash deposits to 104 m day talus cone kfs standard deviation values ranged from 7 0 to 129 7 m day and cv values ranged from 0 2 to 1 2 the mean ksat values ranged from 4 m day bedrock surface glacially modified to 201 m day talus cone ksat standard deviation values ranged from 2 3 to 267 9 m day and the cv ranged from 0 5 to 2 4 the d10 grain size for each sample ranged from 0 67 mm coarse sand to 0 03 mm silt with an average grain size of 0 15 mm fine sand particle size distribution graphs for each of the modified brabets surficial units are shown in appendix c for comparison with brabets 1993b surficial units descriptive statistics for all measured kfs and ksat values were also calculated for each of the nrcs 2018 surficial units mean kfs exhibited values ranging from 9 m day clam gulch silt loam to 87 m day talkeetna chugach deneka complex table 3 and fig 3 the kfs standard deviations ranged from 11 0 to 48 2 m day and the cv ranged from 0 8 to 1 2 the mean ksat ranged from 2 m day talkeetna chugach deneka complex to 92 m day river bed with a standard deviation ranging from 3 9 to 99 7 m day and cv values ranging from 0 8 to 2 4 in comparison the nrcs ksat values determined by nrcs 2018 exhibit a range from 0 03 m day to 3 6 m day over all six units in the study area a wilcoxon signed rank test between kfs and ksat values suggests there is no significant difference p 0 08 between the datasets table 4 however the ksat values psd method show greater variability than the kfs values bottomless bucket method as indicated by the cv calculated for kfs 0 8 vs ksat 1 8 both the cv and an f test performed on the kfs and ksat datasets suggests a statistically different variance f 8 4 p 0 01 f critical 1 6 the t test results under the assumption of unequal variances kfs 1 939 and ksat 5 599 with a null hypothesized mean difference of zero suggests the sample means 49 m day vs 41 m day do not differ significantly the t stat of 0 61 lies within the critical t stat range of 1 99 these tests indicate that the null hypothesis should not be rejected suggesting that the datasets can be treated as equal correlation coefficients for kendall s tau and pearson s correlation coefficient suggest that a positive linear relationship exists between the kfs and ksat datasets kendall s tau coefficient non parametric correlation was calculated at α 0 01 and gave a τ value of 0 3 p 0 01 the pearson s product moment correlation test parametric yielded a coefficient of r 0 70 p 0 01 fig 4 a statistical comparison between our measured kfs and ksat values and the ksat values published by the nrcs 2018 indicate the datasets are significantly different the wilcoxon signed rank test yielded a two tailed probability of p 0 01 for measured kfs vs nrcs ksat table 4 t test results on the measured kfs vs nrcs ksat data also suggest there is a significant difference between the datasets t stat of 7 08 lies outside of the critical t stat of 2 02 table 5 wilcoxon p 0 01 and t test results t stat of 3 63 lies outside of the critical t stat of 2 01 on measured ksat vs nrcs ksat data suggests there is a significant difference between those datasets as well pearson s product moment correlation and kendall s tau coefficients calculated between nrcs ksat values and our measured ksat and kfs also indicate no correlation r 0 2 and 0 06 τ 0 2 and 0 03 respectively 5 discussion this paper provides ranges of hydraulic conductivity values for surficial deposits of the eklutna valley which is important for understanding the hydrogeology of the eklutna glacier and lake these reservoirs provide an essential water source for nearly half the population of alaska and must continue to be studied for their long term water storage potential this paper also answers the question of whether a relatively quick and easy field based method can produce the same results as a time intensive primarily lab based method for measuring hydraulic conductivity the results presented herein suggest that these datasets are indeed statistically similar statistical analyses indicate that the values measured for kfs and ksat are not statistically different datasets as evaluated by a wilcoxon signed rank test α 0 01 and paired t tests the kendall s tau and pearson s product moment correlation coefficients also suggest that these methods can bea used to establish a range of possible k values a magnitude comparison between the 47 samples show 53 percent of paired values were within the same order of magnitude 45 percent were within one order of magnitude and one sample was within two orders of magnitude however as freeze and cherry 1979 show various geologic units can range widely in orders of magnitude of k glacial till up to 6 and clean sand up to 4 orders of magnitude examination of kfs and ksat values suggest statistical similarity α 0 01 and significant correlation these results strongly suggest all measured k values are comparable and representative of k in the sampled surficial geologic units of the eklutna watershed although the evaluations suggest similarity between measured kfs and ksat the variability between these two datasets are statistically different as suggested by the f test and cv evaluation variability is inherent with the measurement of k freeze and cherry 1979 mohanty et al 1994 deb and shukla 2012 ronayne et al 2012 deb and shukla 2012 indicate cv values between 0 9 and 1 7 are considered acceptable and our results were within 10 of that defined range variability between different methods as well as the spatial variability of k over relatively small scales can be quite large factors that can affect k values include the variability of soil properties over a given area hydrophobic properties of soils air trapped in pore spaces and variable water temperatures nimmo 2009 freeland 2013 also notes that roots and burrowing near the surface will increase surface soil conductivity while soil weathering products such as clays sesquioxides carbonates and silicates accumulating in the soil beneath will decrease conductivity as such there is typically a substantial decrease in conductivity as water passes from the topsoil to the subsoil horizon freeland 2013 whereas the thickness and extent of these two horizons may vary considerably over a small geographic area this may also contribute to the variability in measured k values in other subarctic regions methods for measuring hydraulic conductivity also vary considerably but similar to our sampling strategy are generally limited to infiltrometry tests in the field combined with lab based methods carey and woo 1999 used pumping tests conducted in wells and piezometers as well as constant head permeameter tests in the laboratory to measure hydraulic conductivity of soils in yukon territory canada sharratt et al 2006 measured the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils in interior alaska using the falling head method klute and dirksen 1986 but measured infiltration using in situ field based methods these studies from similar geographic regions and or similar glaciated terrain report k values on the same order of magnitude as our measured k values sharratt et al 2006 or within one order of magnitude mohanty et al 1994 carey and woo 1999 ronayne et al 2012 hydraulic conductivity values provided by the bottomless bucket kfs method nimmo et al 2009 give a reasonable estimate of k using simple equipment procedures and calculations inherent to this method kfs values will fall somewhere between unsaturated and saturated soils between 0 and 100 saturation because the degree of saturation at the beginning and end of the field procedure is not measured some additional variation in kfs values when compared to the psd method ksat is due to the variables taken into consideration only the water is considered during kfs testing and the soil properties are empirically defined the psd analysis provided the information needed to calculate ksat with eq 2 possible inaccuracy introduced during the particle size sieving process could be caused by the clogging of sieve fabric openings blinding that fail to allow the passing of smaller soil particles overestimating the particle size and causing a narrower psd hogg et al 2008 the hazen 1892 equation is the basis of the psd to k relation that others have built upon similar to the bottomless bucket method there are shortcomings in the hazen equation due to the inherent assumptions within for example the equation considers only the d10 of a soil and omits other larger particles cobbles boulders etc that might provide macro pore pathways which often increases k such overall soil sampling discrepancies and k measurement inaccuracies are surely present within our datasets and are represented in the eklutna valley surficial units ten particle size distribution graphs grouped by modified brabets surficial geology units show some notable patterns appendix c the glacial moraine and talus cone psds showed a heterogeneous mixture of grain sizes gravel to fines while the alluvial cone psd showed a mixture of coarse primarily gravel to primarily sand type grain size curves the psd for the west fork of the eklutna river is very similar to the samples from the glacial moraine areas suggesting the river is reworking moraine deposits in the area the higher flow rate of the west fork of the eklutna river larquier 2010 is reflected in its psd by the higher distribution of coarse grains fine gravel to medium sand in comparison to the east fork with grain size concentrations primarily in the medium to fine sand range the higher degree of sorting in the east fork reflects a lower flow rate capable of carrying only smaller grains overall psds from all samples displayed a bimodal distribution showing either a poorly sorted psd or a well sorted psd with very few in between poor sorting near the channel reflects the eroding of moraine deposits with well sorted material deposited during flood events farther from the main channel the broad characterization of surficial units by the nrcs 2018 likely contributes to some of the large within unit variation e g fig 3 the nrcs 2018 surficial geological unit with the highest measured cv of 2 4 kashwitna kichatna complex falls outside the recommended cv range of 0 9 1 7 as established by deb and shukla 2012 this unit coincides with four modified brabets units alluvial cone glacial moraine river channel deposits and bedrock surface glacially modified suggesting the nrcs could subdelineate the kashwitna kichatna complex another source of uncertainty stems from the methods used by the nrcs 2018 to determine hydraulic conductivity nrcs ksat values are calculated by selecting a soil bulk density class then assigning the soil to a range of ksat values provided in an nrcs textural triangle this provides a quick and generalized estimate qualitative data of this type is empirically derived from nrcs agency experience throughout similar depositional environments and gives an approximate value for similar soil classes over a broad area these values are not meant to be used at a specific site but for a class range comparison of soils nrcs 2012 statistical comparison of measured kfs and ksat with nrcs ksat average values suggest no statistical similarity and no correlation between the datasets however when the mean nrcs ksat value was multiplied by 100 two orders of magnitude and compared to the mean measured kfs and ksat values within nrcs units paired sample t test results suggested these datasets are similar the need for this two order of magnitude multiplier might be explained by the nrcs reporting permeability instead of ksat the original nrcs sampling metadata is unavailable this was known to be an issue in the past when permeability and ksat were used synonymously as noted by the nrcs in technical note six nrcs 2004 after multiplying the mean nrcs ksat for each of their six surficial units by 100 and comparing averaged measured kfs and ksat using a paired sample t test results suggest these datasets are equivalent t test results for measured ksat averages and nrcs ksat averages give a t stat of 1 94 that was within the critical t stat of 2 31 t test results for the measured kfs averages and nrcs ksat averages give a t stat of 0 07 that was within the critical t stat of 2 26 these results suggest the averages for measured ksat and kfs compare with the averages of nrcs ksat ranges after multiplying by 100 insufficient data was available to perform a wilcoxon test results suggest that our measured kfs and ksat are statistically similar datasets meanwhile the averaged nrcs ksat range was shown to be statistically different when compared to our measured kfs and ksat datasets however the averaged range of measured kfs and ksat within nrcs units were within one order of magnitude of the averaged nrcs ksat range if multiplied by 100 therefore a range of possible k values for surficial units in the eklutna watershed is established by measured kfs and ksat values in this evaluation 5 1 recommendations for future work to better define the variability of hydraulic conductivity in the eklutna area future work should focus on increased sample coverage particularly in the less accessible areas also evaluation of psd data using other empirical equations e g slichter 1898 zamarin 1928 zunker 1930 carman 1937 in hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 could provide an increased understanding of the k variability we also acknowledge that additional methods exist for testing hydraulic conductivity that could place further constraints on eklutna surficial units however the primary focus of this paper is on increased efficiency in field sampling and analytical techniques and as such variation in k values are to be expected furthermore measured k values presented in this research are site specific and restricted to shallow sampling depths and are not to be used for interpolation purposes until additional coverage is obtained 6 conclusions the municipality of anchorage which encompasses about half the population of alaska depends on the eklutna watershed to provide critical drinking water and municipal power resources continued retreat of the eklutna glacier over the last 95 years karpilo 2010 as well as documented mass loss over the past half century sass et al 2017 has reduced potential water storage and raised concerns surrounding future water resource management there exists a clear need for a better understanding of the surficial hydrgeolologic properties and characteristics of the eklutna watershed which will aid in management of the resource the nrcs provides the only publicly available hydraulic conductivity data source for the eklutna area however the data is coarse and limited the bottomless bucket and psd methods as utilized in this investigation provide sufficient k values for use in future hydrologic modeling the bottomless bucket method is a simplified sampling technique that can be executed in remote areas with ease the psd method is a standard laboratory procedure to determine k used in conjunction with hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 appropriate sampling design for this investigation was reliant upon proper surficial unit delineation if the units aren t correct sampling design could be misrepresentative for example the surficial geologic maps delineated by brabets 1993b and the nrcs 2018 were key to this study and allowed accurate sample placement within specific geologic units however owing to the heterogeneity between brabets 1993b and the nrcs 2018 delineated surficial units the creation of a unified version or comprehensive map is outside of the scope of this project this paper presents two simple techniques for obtaining a range of k values in heterogeneous point samples given that soil property data is commonly a limiting factor in many hydrogeologic assessments as such the methods presented in this paper could be used for surficial unit delineation and water resource management in any landscape moreover the methods presented could potentially be used by other researchers to obtain the necessary data for creation of an effective localized hydrological

6337,eklutna lake is the primary water supply for anchorage alaska therefore the hydrogeologic properties of eklutna surficial deposits are important to characterize however there is limited data on the hydraulic conductivity of surficial deposits in the eklutna basin this study presents hydraulic conductivity kfs and ksat measurements using two methods the bottomless bucket and particle size distribution methods statistically the two methods produced similar results however the large range in values obtained for kfs and ksat suggests there is a great degree of natural variation one method used a bottomless bucket in place of a ring infiltrometer to measure field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs the other method used a sieve derived particle size distribution to solve a modified hazen equation for ksat of 47 samples collected in nine surficial geologic units from poorly sorted to well sorted soils the means of the two datasets were statistically similar 49 m day kfs vs 41 m day ksat although the variability between the datasets was significantly different with a standard deviation ranging from 44 m day kfs to 75 m day ksat the wilcoxon paired samples and paired t test results suggest the datasets are statistically similar additionally 98 of the 47 paired values were within one order of magnitude of each other the methods presented herein can be used for surficial geologic unit delineation planning purposes and optimizing hydrological models keywords hydraulic conductivity particle size distribution bottomless bucket surficial geology modified brabets 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity is a critical hydrogeologic parameter affecting fluid transport in soils and rocks however large spatial variations in soil hydraulic properties have led to challenges in accurately characterizing this parameter on a local scale particulary within heterogeneous surficial deposits estimates of hydraulic conductivity are known to vary widely across different deposit types and can take on values spanning over 13 orders of magnitude freeze and cherry 1979 in mountainous landscapes hydraulic conductivity can be strongly influenced by topographic variations gebrelibanos and assen 2014 as well as geomorphic qualities such as slope aspect carey and woo 1999 sun et al 2019 soil hydrologic properties can also exhibit significant spatial and temporal variation due to anthropogenic influences such as climate change jarvis et al 2013 vegetation degradation pan et al 2017 fire disturbance neary et al 1999 and agriculture teague et al 2011 methods for measuring hydraulic conductivity also vary widely in their accuracy and ease of use laboratory based methods typically require more time and effort while field based methods tend to be quicker and simpler measuring field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs is usually accomplished in the field via apparati such as single and double ring infiltrometers or borehole flowmeters if a sample is brought back to the lab falling head or constant head permeameters can also be used to measure kfs in general surface methods are most likely to accurately reflect infiltration capacities and runoff as opposed to the permeameter and borehole flowmeter nimmo et al 2009 the type of material can also influence the accuracy of different methods and in poorly sorted materials such as glacial till estimates of k based on particle size distribution methods are known to be less accurate jenssen 1990 ronayne et al 2012 on a global scale estimates of hydraulic conductivity are important for landscape hydrologic modeling however these values are really only obtainable via pedotransfer functions ptfs which crudely estimate hydraulic conductivity from soil properties observed in the field such as bulk density and soil texture zhang et al 2018 the glacially fed eklutna lake provides anchorage with 88 percent of its water supply 27 4 billion liters in 2017 awwu 2018 and a small percentage of the city s power supply via hydropower generation however the glacier has retreated significantly over the last 95 years karpilo 2010 and consequently the relative importance of snowmelt and rainfall has increased in the long term detailed studies of of the hydrologic properties of eklutna watershed surficial deposits will become increasingly important the goal of this paper is to determine the range of hydraulic conductivity values for eklutna valley surficial deposits using two independent field based methods which will aid in the effective management of this water resource each of these methods mathematically derives k in different ways field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs uses on site infiltration data i e nimmo et al 2009 while saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat uses sieve derived particle size distribution data i e hazen 1892 the nimmo et al 2009 method offers a decrease in the complexity of equipment required as well as the ability to calculate kfs values rapidly in the field therefore we ask the question do these two methods requiring distinctly different amounts of time and effort produce statistically similar results moreover through a statistical comparison of the output from these two methods we seek to characterize the variability of hydraulic conductivity in a glaciated alpine setting finally for the sake of comparison our measured kfs and ksat datasets are evaluated against a publicly available ksat dataset estimated by the nrcs 2018 using pedotransfer functions 2 study area glacial history in the eklutna watershed has been traced back to pre wisconsin age before 130 000 years before present bp consisting of the mount susitna glaciation and the caribou hills glaciation subsequently the eklutna glaciation occurred between 130 000 and 85 000 bp and is identified by till and outwash deposits exposed in bluffs along the knik arm north of eagle river flats karlstrom 1956 the naptowne glaciation was the last major episode of glaciation between 45 000 bp and 7 000 bp of the wisconsin ice age karlstrom 1956 many smaller glacial advances are evidenced in the eklutna valley by the various lateral and end moraine deposits most important are the elmendorf moraine dishno pond moraine and the fort richardson moraine as described and illustrated by brabets 1993a all of which are late pleistocene age the till that makes up the moraine deposits is a diamicton consisting of massive poorly sorted gravel sand and silt mixtures with small amounts of clay and scattered boulders brabets 1993a the eklutna glacier terminated at about 366 m elevation in 1957 but in 1988 terminated at about 732 m elevation brabets 1993a while retreating 366 m vertically the eklutna glacier also receded about 1 6 km horizontally over the same 30 year period brabets 1993a more recently glacial melting was quantified by sass et al 2017 showing substantial mass loss over the past half century from 1957 to 2010 mass balance was 0 52 0 46 m w e per year and increased to 0 74 0 46 m w e a 1 between 2010 and 2015 approximately 7 of the inflow to eklutna lake is derived from net mass loss from eklutna glacier sass et al 2017 previous studies of the surficial geology in the eklutna watershed are summarized in the surficial geological maps of brabets 1993b and nrcs 2018 but do not specifically address hydraulic conductivity meyerhofer 2016 described hydraulic conductivity in the eklutna basin by characterizing the soil according to texture and then assigning a range of saturated hydraulic conductivity values defined by the u s department of agriculture these results are largely similar to the broad ranges provided by the nrcs 2018 surficial geologic units defined by material type and expression of the topography in the eklutna watershed range from poorly sorted mixed till to well sorted river sands fig 1 detailed unit descriptions are included in appendix a the study area was defined based on brabets 1993b surficial geology map restricted to include only the area between the eklutna glacier terminus and the point where the eklutna river enters eklutna lake fig 1 lidar light detection and ranging images and aerial photographs were digitally overlain by brabets 1993b surficial geological map thus allowing for a closer analysis of topography glacial geomorphology and degree of accessibility a similar technique was used by smith et al 2006 to compare remotely sensed data to field mapping data concluding that lidar is a relatively complete representation of the glacial geomorphology 3 methods 3 1 sampling strategy to place constraints on hydraulic conductivity k for eklutna basin surficial geologic units two methods were employed the bottomless bucket nimmo et al 2009 and particle size distribution psd analysis hazen 1892 techniques the bottomless bucket method is an in situ process utilizing a bucket apparatus sampling technique with measured values applied to nimmo et al s 2009 equation 1 k fs l g t f in 1 d 0 l g λ where lg ring installation scaling length m tf time when falling head is zero seconds do depth of ponding m and λ macroscopic capillary length m the value of λ is related to the capillary forces in the soil where λ 0 03 m for extremely coarse and gravelly soils λ 0 08 m for soils with significant structural development and λ 0 25 m for fine textured soils without macro pores because estimated kfs values show minimal sensitivity to the λ values used the value of 0 08 m was chosen which is appropriate for application to most soils elrick et al 1989 the second method used was a psd analysis which involves an ex situ soil sieve gradation analysis to obtain the effective grain size d10 in conjunction with hazen s 1892 equation for ksat 2 k sat ρ g μ n φ n d e 2 where 0 9981 density of water in g cm3 g 980 gravity in cm s2 μ 0 0098 centipoise kinematic viscosity in g cm s n 6 10 4 a constant dependent on characteristics of the porous medium φ n 1 10 n 0 26 function of porosity n 0 255 1 0 83 u porosity and de d10 effective grain size in mm grain uniformity u is measured as the ratio of d60 to d10 where d60 equals grain size at which 60 percent of grains are finer and d10 is the grain size at which 10 percent of grains are finer fifty two sampling points were systematically placed among the modified brabets surficial units modification explained in fig 1 a minimum of three sample points were placed within each unit with the exception of the talus cone unit where only two sample points were collected sample point locations were digitized in gis software establishing a general latitude and longitude and then uploaded into a handheld global positioning system gps unit with an average accuracy of 3 m 3 2 data collection at each sample site the bottomless bucket technique was used to measure field saturated hydraulic conductivity this method employed a 19 liter bucket with the bottom surface carefully cut out and dimensions of the bucket recorded for later calculations all leaf litter and loose organic matter was cleared from the soil surface the bottomless bucket was inserted into the ground to a depth of up to two inches a pre measured amount of water varying from 3 8 to 7 6 l was poured into the apparatus the time it took for the water to completely drain into the soil s surface was measured with a stopwatch for later use in eq 1 soil samples were collected at each site and brought back for psd analysis from the 52 sample locations five samples did not make it back to the lab due to transportation mishap the 47 remaining samples were oven dried for 1 5 h at 65 c on a foil sheet once dried the sample was weighed to 0 1 g the dried sample was placed in a container and de aggregated with a rubber mallet until all visual clods of dirt were broken down following the practices of astm d421 2007 clods present in the samples were assumed to be created during the drying process and not present in the field after being de aggregated each sample was placed in a sieve stack 12 7 mm 0 841 mm 0 420 mm 0 250 mm 0 149 mm and 0 074 mm run for 15 minutes on a sieve shaker gilson ss 15 sieve shaker then emptied onto a tared plate and the weight of the soil sample retained in each sieve was recorded each sieve s mesh fabric was cleaned with a coarse brush between samples size fractions were plugged into hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 in order to determine d10 for use in eq 2 producing ksat values for each of the 47 samples 3 3 statistical analysis to evaluate the datasets bottomless bucket and psd two statistical paired sample tests were performed on the 47 samples the non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test is a paired difference test and evaluates whether two datasets have similar or different population ranked means where the null hypothesis suggests that the two populations have similar distributions and means the coefficient of variation cv was used as another comparative analysis between the variability of measured kfs and ksat datasets the cv calculates the dispersion variance of data points around a mean deb and shukla 2012 used cv analysis to evaluate the results of multiple sampling methods of various soil types an f test was used to evaluate the equality of variance between the datasets which is a test used to compare the variance between two sample sets with the null hypothesis that the samples are from different distributions a two tailed paired t test was also performed assuming unequal variance which is a parametric wilcoxon equivalent the two tailed t test was chosen because the direction of any relationship in the data is unknown and unknown effects could be missed with a one tailed test the null hypothesis of a two tailed t test is that the difference between the true means of the datasets is equal to zero to test for a relationship between measured kfs and ksat correlation analyses were performed using kendall s tau test non parametric and the pearson product moment correlation test parametric the closeness of the these coefficients to 1 or 1 reflects the strength of linear relationship between two variables while the p value at the chosen α level of significance can suggest if a linear relationship exists also included is a comparison of nrcs delineated surficial units and nrcs ksat values with measured kfs and ksat values obtained in this study 4 results presented are the results of measured field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat from surficial units brabets 1993b within the eklutna valley overall the range of kfs and ksat values spanned one to two orders of magnitude minimum of 1 m day to a maximum of 390 m day respectively mean k values ranged from 49 kfs to 41 ksat m day and median k values ranged from 34 kfs to 10 ksat m day with standard deviation ranging from 44 to 75 m day respectively table 1 of the 47 samples 25 were in the same order of magnitude 21 were within one order of magnitude and one sample was within two orders of magnitude delta lake deposit kfs and ksat were also analyzed for each of the surficial units brabets 1993b in the study area table 2 and fig 2 among these units mean kfs values ranged from 11 m day outwash deposits to 104 m day talus cone kfs standard deviation values ranged from 7 0 to 129 7 m day and cv values ranged from 0 2 to 1 2 the mean ksat values ranged from 4 m day bedrock surface glacially modified to 201 m day talus cone ksat standard deviation values ranged from 2 3 to 267 9 m day and the cv ranged from 0 5 to 2 4 the d10 grain size for each sample ranged from 0 67 mm coarse sand to 0 03 mm silt with an average grain size of 0 15 mm fine sand particle size distribution graphs for each of the modified brabets surficial units are shown in appendix c for comparison with brabets 1993b surficial units descriptive statistics for all measured kfs and ksat values were also calculated for each of the nrcs 2018 surficial units mean kfs exhibited values ranging from 9 m day clam gulch silt loam to 87 m day talkeetna chugach deneka complex table 3 and fig 3 the kfs standard deviations ranged from 11 0 to 48 2 m day and the cv ranged from 0 8 to 1 2 the mean ksat ranged from 2 m day talkeetna chugach deneka complex to 92 m day river bed with a standard deviation ranging from 3 9 to 99 7 m day and cv values ranging from 0 8 to 2 4 in comparison the nrcs ksat values determined by nrcs 2018 exhibit a range from 0 03 m day to 3 6 m day over all six units in the study area a wilcoxon signed rank test between kfs and ksat values suggests there is no significant difference p 0 08 between the datasets table 4 however the ksat values psd method show greater variability than the kfs values bottomless bucket method as indicated by the cv calculated for kfs 0 8 vs ksat 1 8 both the cv and an f test performed on the kfs and ksat datasets suggests a statistically different variance f 8 4 p 0 01 f critical 1 6 the t test results under the assumption of unequal variances kfs 1 939 and ksat 5 599 with a null hypothesized mean difference of zero suggests the sample means 49 m day vs 41 m day do not differ significantly the t stat of 0 61 lies within the critical t stat range of 1 99 these tests indicate that the null hypothesis should not be rejected suggesting that the datasets can be treated as equal correlation coefficients for kendall s tau and pearson s correlation coefficient suggest that a positive linear relationship exists between the kfs and ksat datasets kendall s tau coefficient non parametric correlation was calculated at α 0 01 and gave a τ value of 0 3 p 0 01 the pearson s product moment correlation test parametric yielded a coefficient of r 0 70 p 0 01 fig 4 a statistical comparison between our measured kfs and ksat values and the ksat values published by the nrcs 2018 indicate the datasets are significantly different the wilcoxon signed rank test yielded a two tailed probability of p 0 01 for measured kfs vs nrcs ksat table 4 t test results on the measured kfs vs nrcs ksat data also suggest there is a significant difference between the datasets t stat of 7 08 lies outside of the critical t stat of 2 02 table 5 wilcoxon p 0 01 and t test results t stat of 3 63 lies outside of the critical t stat of 2 01 on measured ksat vs nrcs ksat data suggests there is a significant difference between those datasets as well pearson s product moment correlation and kendall s tau coefficients calculated between nrcs ksat values and our measured ksat and kfs also indicate no correlation r 0 2 and 0 06 τ 0 2 and 0 03 respectively 5 discussion this paper provides ranges of hydraulic conductivity values for surficial deposits of the eklutna valley which is important for understanding the hydrogeology of the eklutna glacier and lake these reservoirs provide an essential water source for nearly half the population of alaska and must continue to be studied for their long term water storage potential this paper also answers the question of whether a relatively quick and easy field based method can produce the same results as a time intensive primarily lab based method for measuring hydraulic conductivity the results presented herein suggest that these datasets are indeed statistically similar statistical analyses indicate that the values measured for kfs and ksat are not statistically different datasets as evaluated by a wilcoxon signed rank test α 0 01 and paired t tests the kendall s tau and pearson s product moment correlation coefficients also suggest that these methods can bea used to establish a range of possible k values a magnitude comparison between the 47 samples show 53 percent of paired values were within the same order of magnitude 45 percent were within one order of magnitude and one sample was within two orders of magnitude however as freeze and cherry 1979 show various geologic units can range widely in orders of magnitude of k glacial till up to 6 and clean sand up to 4 orders of magnitude examination of kfs and ksat values suggest statistical similarity α 0 01 and significant correlation these results strongly suggest all measured k values are comparable and representative of k in the sampled surficial geologic units of the eklutna watershed although the evaluations suggest similarity between measured kfs and ksat the variability between these two datasets are statistically different as suggested by the f test and cv evaluation variability is inherent with the measurement of k freeze and cherry 1979 mohanty et al 1994 deb and shukla 2012 ronayne et al 2012 deb and shukla 2012 indicate cv values between 0 9 and 1 7 are considered acceptable and our results were within 10 of that defined range variability between different methods as well as the spatial variability of k over relatively small scales can be quite large factors that can affect k values include the variability of soil properties over a given area hydrophobic properties of soils air trapped in pore spaces and variable water temperatures nimmo 2009 freeland 2013 also notes that roots and burrowing near the surface will increase surface soil conductivity while soil weathering products such as clays sesquioxides carbonates and silicates accumulating in the soil beneath will decrease conductivity as such there is typically a substantial decrease in conductivity as water passes from the topsoil to the subsoil horizon freeland 2013 whereas the thickness and extent of these two horizons may vary considerably over a small geographic area this may also contribute to the variability in measured k values in other subarctic regions methods for measuring hydraulic conductivity also vary considerably but similar to our sampling strategy are generally limited to infiltrometry tests in the field combined with lab based methods carey and woo 1999 used pumping tests conducted in wells and piezometers as well as constant head permeameter tests in the laboratory to measure hydraulic conductivity of soils in yukon territory canada sharratt et al 2006 measured the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils in interior alaska using the falling head method klute and dirksen 1986 but measured infiltration using in situ field based methods these studies from similar geographic regions and or similar glaciated terrain report k values on the same order of magnitude as our measured k values sharratt et al 2006 or within one order of magnitude mohanty et al 1994 carey and woo 1999 ronayne et al 2012 hydraulic conductivity values provided by the bottomless bucket kfs method nimmo et al 2009 give a reasonable estimate of k using simple equipment procedures and calculations inherent to this method kfs values will fall somewhere between unsaturated and saturated soils between 0 and 100 saturation because the degree of saturation at the beginning and end of the field procedure is not measured some additional variation in kfs values when compared to the psd method ksat is due to the variables taken into consideration only the water is considered during kfs testing and the soil properties are empirically defined the psd analysis provided the information needed to calculate ksat with eq 2 possible inaccuracy introduced during the particle size sieving process could be caused by the clogging of sieve fabric openings blinding that fail to allow the passing of smaller soil particles overestimating the particle size and causing a narrower psd hogg et al 2008 the hazen 1892 equation is the basis of the psd to k relation that others have built upon similar to the bottomless bucket method there are shortcomings in the hazen equation due to the inherent assumptions within for example the equation considers only the d10 of a soil and omits other larger particles cobbles boulders etc that might provide macro pore pathways which often increases k such overall soil sampling discrepancies and k measurement inaccuracies are surely present within our datasets and are represented in the eklutna valley surficial units ten particle size distribution graphs grouped by modified brabets surficial geology units show some notable patterns appendix c the glacial moraine and talus cone psds showed a heterogeneous mixture of grain sizes gravel to fines while the alluvial cone psd showed a mixture of coarse primarily gravel to primarily sand type grain size curves the psd for the west fork of the eklutna river is very similar to the samples from the glacial moraine areas suggesting the river is reworking moraine deposits in the area the higher flow rate of the west fork of the eklutna river larquier 2010 is reflected in its psd by the higher distribution of coarse grains fine gravel to medium sand in comparison to the east fork with grain size concentrations primarily in the medium to fine sand range the higher degree of sorting in the east fork reflects a lower flow rate capable of carrying only smaller grains overall psds from all samples displayed a bimodal distribution showing either a poorly sorted psd or a well sorted psd with very few in between poor sorting near the channel reflects the eroding of moraine deposits with well sorted material deposited during flood events farther from the main channel the broad characterization of surficial units by the nrcs 2018 likely contributes to some of the large within unit variation e g fig 3 the nrcs 2018 surficial geological unit with the highest measured cv of 2 4 kashwitna kichatna complex falls outside the recommended cv range of 0 9 1 7 as established by deb and shukla 2012 this unit coincides with four modified brabets units alluvial cone glacial moraine river channel deposits and bedrock surface glacially modified suggesting the nrcs could subdelineate the kashwitna kichatna complex another source of uncertainty stems from the methods used by the nrcs 2018 to determine hydraulic conductivity nrcs ksat values are calculated by selecting a soil bulk density class then assigning the soil to a range of ksat values provided in an nrcs textural triangle this provides a quick and generalized estimate qualitative data of this type is empirically derived from nrcs agency experience throughout similar depositional environments and gives an approximate value for similar soil classes over a broad area these values are not meant to be used at a specific site but for a class range comparison of soils nrcs 2012 statistical comparison of measured kfs and ksat with nrcs ksat average values suggest no statistical similarity and no correlation between the datasets however when the mean nrcs ksat value was multiplied by 100 two orders of magnitude and compared to the mean measured kfs and ksat values within nrcs units paired sample t test results suggested these datasets are similar the need for this two order of magnitude multiplier might be explained by the nrcs reporting permeability instead of ksat the original nrcs sampling metadata is unavailable this was known to be an issue in the past when permeability and ksat were used synonymously as noted by the nrcs in technical note six nrcs 2004 after multiplying the mean nrcs ksat for each of their six surficial units by 100 and comparing averaged measured kfs and ksat using a paired sample t test results suggest these datasets are equivalent t test results for measured ksat averages and nrcs ksat averages give a t stat of 1 94 that was within the critical t stat of 2 31 t test results for the measured kfs averages and nrcs ksat averages give a t stat of 0 07 that was within the critical t stat of 2 26 these results suggest the averages for measured ksat and kfs compare with the averages of nrcs ksat ranges after multiplying by 100 insufficient data was available to perform a wilcoxon test results suggest that our measured kfs and ksat are statistically similar datasets meanwhile the averaged nrcs ksat range was shown to be statistically different when compared to our measured kfs and ksat datasets however the averaged range of measured kfs and ksat within nrcs units were within one order of magnitude of the averaged nrcs ksat range if multiplied by 100 therefore a range of possible k values for surficial units in the eklutna watershed is established by measured kfs and ksat values in this evaluation 5 1 recommendations for future work to better define the variability of hydraulic conductivity in the eklutna area future work should focus on increased sample coverage particularly in the less accessible areas also evaluation of psd data using other empirical equations e g slichter 1898 zamarin 1928 zunker 1930 carman 1937 in hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 could provide an increased understanding of the k variability we also acknowledge that additional methods exist for testing hydraulic conductivity that could place further constraints on eklutna surficial units however the primary focus of this paper is on increased efficiency in field sampling and analytical techniques and as such variation in k values are to be expected furthermore measured k values presented in this research are site specific and restricted to shallow sampling depths and are not to be used for interpolation purposes until additional coverage is obtained 6 conclusions the municipality of anchorage which encompasses about half the population of alaska depends on the eklutna watershed to provide critical drinking water and municipal power resources continued retreat of the eklutna glacier over the last 95 years karpilo 2010 as well as documented mass loss over the past half century sass et al 2017 has reduced potential water storage and raised concerns surrounding future water resource management there exists a clear need for a better understanding of the surficial hydrgeolologic properties and characteristics of the eklutna watershed which will aid in management of the resource the nrcs provides the only publicly available hydraulic conductivity data source for the eklutna area however the data is coarse and limited the bottomless bucket and psd methods as utilized in this investigation provide sufficient k values for use in future hydrologic modeling the bottomless bucket method is a simplified sampling technique that can be executed in remote areas with ease the psd method is a standard laboratory procedure to determine k used in conjunction with hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 appropriate sampling design for this investigation was reliant upon proper surficial unit delineation if the units aren t correct sampling design could be misrepresentative for example the surficial geologic maps delineated by brabets 1993b and the nrcs 2018 were key to this study and allowed accurate sample placement within specific geologic units however owing to the heterogeneity between brabets 1993b and the nrcs 2018 delineated surficial units the creation of a unified version or comprehensive map is outside of the scope of this project this paper presents two simple techniques for obtaining a range of k values in heterogeneous point samples given that soil property data is commonly a limiting factor in many hydrogeologic assessments as such the methods presented in this paper could be used for surficial unit delineation and water resource management in any landscape moreover the methods presented could potentially be used by other researchers to obtain the necessary data for creation of an effective localized hydrological

6338,recent annual trends of precipitation and terrestrial water storage tws in west africa have been increasing over the past decade despite a significant impact of soil moisture on the tws in west africa there is little research on the recent spatial and temporal behaviors of surface soil moisture ssm along with the hydrological trends and variability in west africa in this study we assimilate tws estimates from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission into the catchment land surface model clsm and evaluate its impacts on ssm simulations for the years 2002 2017 the evaluation is performed using reference datasets the african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma in situ soil moisture observations three currently available microwave satellite ssm observations from the advanced scatterometer ascat the soil moisture ocean salinity smos and the soil moisture active passive smap satellites and also the triple collocation analysis tca overall modeled ssm shows good agreement with the reference datasets in terms of the anomaly ssm correlations however both modeled and ascat ssm are limited in their representation of the drying rates as observed by ground observations smos and smap estimates further grace data assimilation results in improved ssm simulations in the humid regions with large annual tws variability this study demonstrates the utility of land data assimilation to inform hydrological conditions in west africa where soil moisture monitoring is necessary for water resource and livestock management keywords soil moisture west africa grace data assimilation 1 introduction the capability of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to monitor changes in total water storage tws from surface through groundwater allows a better understanding of water cycle dynamics and water resources from basin to continental scales tapley et al 2004 rodell et al 2009 the assimilation of grace tws data has been proven to improve hydrological model skill and reduce land surface modeling lsm uncertainties e g zaitchik et al 2008 su et al 2010 forman et al 2011 specifically for an improved surface soil moisture ssm estimation grace data assimilation da has been successfully used for example in the north america kumar et al 2016 australia tian et al 2017 and iran khaki et al 2018 however a deeper analysis of the grace da performance in the modeled ssm is still lacking for west africa soil moisture has been shown to be the dominant component of tws in west africa more than its other constituent terms of groundwater surface water and snow water equivalent getirana et al 2017 also soil moisture plays an important role in the water and energy exchanges at the land atmosphere interface specifically in west africa showing a strong feedback mechanism between soil moisture and precipitation koster et al 2004 cheruy et al 2013 because soil moisture has a significant influence on the spatial and temporal variability of weather and climate conditions in west africa soil moisture monitoring has been increasingly required for agricultural and water resources management along with population and income growth e g mcnally et al 2015 leenaars et al 2018 however very few studies have looked at the recent annual trends of soil moisture estimates which is an important hydrological e g flood and agricultural e g drought indicator in west africa using ground measurements satellites and land surface modeling soil moisture estimates from satellite retrievals and models are known to have large biases and uncertainties among different products reichle et al 2004 crow et al 2005 the satellite and model data have complementary advantages and disadvantages and they can be merged to produce an optimally merged soil moisture product particularly in data sparse regions specifically the african monson multidisciplinary analysis amma project lebel et al 2009 was dedicated to collecting in situ land surface and atmospheric measurements and improving our understanding of soil moisture effects on land atmosphere fluxes in west africa redelsperger et al 2006 however the four densely instrumented mesoscale sites in mali niger benin and senegal are considered insufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity and variability of soil moisture at larger spatial scales de rosnay et al 2009 pellarin et al 2009a b other studies demonstrated that microwave soil moisture retrievals have improved hydrological modeling in these regions pellarin et al 2009a 2013 however their approaches are very simple and limited for example not including da in their modeling system recently considerable effort has been put on the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf land data assimilation system ldas and the noaa soil moisture products system smops to investigate satellite and lsm based observations of soil moisture that provide spatial resolutions on the order of tens of kilometers e g albergel et al 2012 al yaari et al 2014 yin et al 2015 these studies mainly focused on global scale evaluations with limited in situ observations very little analysis of the da impact and the dynamics of soil moisture estimates in west africa therefore more analysis on the ability of land data assimilation methods for improved lsm based soil moisture estimates should be considered for studying long term trends on large scale hydrological modeling in west africa recently rodell et al 2018 revealed annual trends in tws at the global scale based on the grace observations from 2002 to 2016 their results showed a positive tws trend in west africa caused by precipitation increase as compared to persistent droughts from 1970 to 2000 giannini et al 2008 galle et al 2018 to investigate the impact of grace da on modeled ssm in west africa we assimilate grace based tws estimates into the catchment land surface model clsm koster et al 2000 using the ensemble kalman smoother from june 2002 to may 2017 houborg et al 2012 demonstrated that grace da with clsm improves the consistency between modeled and grace based tws and produces enhanced soil moisture and groundwater conditions in the u s and north american drought monitors considering the observed higher impacts of soil moisture on tws west africa is an appropriate domain to investigate how the grace da influences modeled ssm this study 1 evaluates the temporal dynamics of modeled ssm against in situ measurements 2 quantifies the spatial correlations between the modeled ssm against satellite observations of soil moisture 3 analyzes the impact of grace da on modeled ssm and 4 presents the qualitative comparisons of seasonality and annual trend of these ssm estimates in west africa in addition to amma s ground observations ssm retrievals from three currently available microwave remote sensing instruments are used to conduct comprehensive inter comparisons and evaluations of the modeled ssm ssmol and ssmda from both the open loop ol reference run and da simulations evaluation of remotely sensed ssm products against in situ measurements is beyond the scope of this work this study serves to improve our understanding of the spatio temporal variability of surface soil moisture and provide potential implications for a land data assimilation system to better track agricultural drought and hydrological changes in west africa 2 data and methods 2 1 study area our study area covers west africa between 18 w to 25 e and 4 n to 18 n excluding arid regions i e sahara due to the small range of variation in ssm values the study domain is characterized by a latitudinal gradient that includes three climate regions sahelian soudanian guinean from north to south with gradually increasing annual precipitation galle et al 2018 in this study amma observations at two meso scale sites in niger and benin are used to evaluate the modeled ssm see fig 1 a two stations in niger tondikiboro and wankama and three stations in benin belefoungou bira and nalohou are available where the soil moisture data were collected hourly at 0 5 cm soil depth for soil texture and vegetation type benin is characterized by sandy clay loam savannas and woody savannas whereas niger is characterized by sandy loam grassland and open shrublands reynolds et al 2000 data at each meso scale site are within a single pixel thus they are spatially averaged to evaluate modeled ssm from the ol and da simulations 2 2 land surface modeling we simulate the water and energy fluxes on a 0 25 spatial resolution domain using the catchment land surface model clsm version fortuna 2 5 koster et al 2000 clsm can explicitly represent groundwater and is implemented within the nasa land information system lis kumar et al 2006 which includes a land data assimilation framework kumar et al 2008 clsm is driven by precipitation from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 and the other meteorological forcing fields are from nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 reichle et al 2017 we extract soil moisture estimates from the first model layer 0 2 cm out of three soil layers for our analysis for this study we used monthly climatologies of leaf area index lai and greenness fraction from the second global soil wetness project gswp 2 dirmeyer et al 2006 these datasets also represent the north south gradient on the spatial maps shown by the climate and precipitation dataset see fig 1 we assimilate grace tws anomalies into clsm using the ensemble kalman smoother enks which is part of lis and follows the approach described in kumar et al 2016 the enks approach disaggregates the monthly grace observations into a daily temporal scale of the land surface model and update the ensemble model fields the update for each ensemble member and for smoothing window t can be written as 1 x t i x t i k t y t m t x t i where x t i is the ith ensemble member of the state vector and y t is the grace observations the measurement operator m t relates the model fields into the observed variables the kalman gain matrix k t determines appropriate weights of the model versus the observations during the update in this study each clsm integration included 20 ensemble members and the observation error variance 10 mm was involved when generating tws estimates from grace observations the grace based tws product used is the center for space research csr grace rl05 mascon solutions at 0 5 degree spatial resolution save et al 2016 tws anomalies from grace observations were converted to absolute tws values in model space by adding time mean tws from clsm simulation on a grid by grid basis in order to evaluate the impact of grace da on modeled ssm an open loop ol simulation without assimilation is generated and compared with the grace data assimilation da integration the simulations were both performed from june 2002 to may 2017 which is limited by the data availability of the grace mission all experiments used a model time step of 15 min and produced daily averaged output fields on a 0 25 spatial resolution 2 3 remote sensing data soil moisture retrievals from three recent satellite based microwave instruments are used in this study they are 1 the advanced scatterometer ascat on board the metop a satellite launched in october 2006 and the metop b satellite launched in september 2012 2 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission launched in november 2009 and 3 the soil moisture active passive smap mission launched in january 2015 ascat is the only global soil moisture dataset from the c band backscatter measurements which has been used in the european space agency s esa climate change initiative cci soil moisture products dorigo et al 2015 ascat represents the degree of saturation of the surface soil layer 0 2 cm schmugge 1983 between totally dry conditions and total water capacity in unit of percent as compared to volumetric units used in both smos and smap missions the esa s smos mission is the first l band passive microwave radiometer mission for soil moisture observation the smos mission can penetrate soil depth to about 5 cm and vegetation cover with water content up to 5 kg m2 with global coverage every three days kerr et al 2000 due to the non functioning radar the smap also provides surface soil moisture measurements from an l band radiometer at approximately 36 km spatial resolution in the top 5 cm soil depth every 3 days with an accuracy of 0 04 m3 m3 entekhabi et al 2010 for specific retrievals of the products used in this study we obtained the ascat dataset from the soil moisture operational products system smops produced at the noaa national environmental satellite data and information service nesdis liu et al 2012 smops generates the global soil moisture maps with a daily interval within the latest 24 h at a 0 25 degree spatial resolution including soil moisture values of the surface soil layer 1 5 cm smops produces ascat data through the near real time nrt retrievals from eumetsat we obtained the operational oper smos level 3 products from the centre aval de traitement des donnéees smos catds al bitar et al 2017 the smos data are global daily 25 km products where a data quality index lower than 0 07 m3 m3 was applied to screen smos soil moisture retrievals in this study chen et al 2016 al yaari et al 2014 also we use smap level 3 radiometer global daily 36 km product available from april 2015 to present from the national snow and ice data center nsidc the soil moisture retrieval quality flag was applied and only pixels flagged as recommended for retrieval are considered in this analysis chan et al 2016 smap data was rescaled to match the 0 25 spatial resolution used in our model runs and the other ssm products using a bilinear interpolation approach 2 4 evaluation approach the daily time series of our modeled surface soil moisture ssmol and ssmda derived from ol and grace da simulations are evaluated with ground observations from january 2013 to december 2014 which is the most recent two years among this publicly available dataset ground based ssm have been regarded as true ssm estimates but they are not representative of lsm based estimates or the soil retrieval from satellite products due to spatial scale differences crow and zhan 2007 therefore modeled ssm is also evaluated with satellite based datasets from june 2015 to may 2017 during which all three satellite sm products and the grace dataset overlap absolute soil moisture products are not readily comparable to each other due to inconsistency of soil layer depths and different behavior of soil models koster et al 2009 also large differences in ssm estimates from lsms satellite based retrievals and in situ observations have been revealed in terms of their respective means and variances reichle et al 2004 therefore we compute anomalies or z scores i e standardized anomalies for all ssm values in this study using their own mean and standard deviation values to investigate the similarity between modeled ssm and ground observations the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse of the ssm anomalies are computed against each of the two reference datasets the anomaly r and rmse values are calculated on a pixel by pixel basis using valid observations of both datasets for the same time period when analyzing the seasonality of modeled ssm and three remote sensing ssm products standardized anomalies of the ssm values are computed due to a discrepancy over measurement units used in the remote sensing ssm products the triple collocation analysis tca mccoll et al 2014 is also applied to assess the performance of da with the modeled soil moisture estimates the tc requires three independent measurements systems x y z to estimate correlation coefficients and errors with respect to the unknown true soil moisture state in this study a model product x ssmol or ssmda an active satellite retrieval y ascat and a passive satellite retrieval z smos are implemented to calculate the tc based r and rmse values of the x 2 r x c o v x y c o v x z v a r x c o v y z 3 rmse x v a r x c o v x y c o v x z cov y z where the cov and var represent the covariance and variance respectively also we analyze annual trends of modeled ssm along with annual trends of grace tws amplitude twsa and precipitation twsa is defined as the average of absolute monthly tws climatological anomaly values 4 twsa m 1 12 tws m tws 12 the first polynomial regression models are applied to investigate the relationship of annual trends of the modeled ssm to those of precipitations and tws amplitude 3 results and discussion 3 1 ssm time series we evaluated modeled ssm ssmol and ssmda against the spatially averaged amma stations in benin and niger fig 2 shows simulated and observed ssm anomaly time series at two amma sites from january 2013 to december 2014 overall both ssmol and ssmda estimates represent well the seasonality of the ground observations with high correlation values r 0 8 al yaari et al 2014 and dorigo et al 2015 demonstrated that tropical semi arid and savannah regions in west africa relate to better performance of soil moisture estimates than the other climate regions or vegetation types both benin and niger sites show a slightly positive da impact on ssm estimates it is interesting to note that during the fall season september to november drying of the modeled ssm is slower than that observed by ground measurements this was shown similarly in a previous study where modeled ssm generated from the noah lsm within a united states based domain had slower drying rates than the smap retrievals shellito et al 2018 when compared to benin the normalized ssm estimates at the sites in niger show a shorter wet season and longer dry season from our modeling and ground observations which is related to the fact that niger is located at a higher more arid and less vegetated latitude than benin to investigate the da performance on the modeled ssm for all four seasons the differences of the anomaly r and anomaly rmse values between ssmol and ssmda are calculated the temporally averaged anomaly r and rmse values do not show a statistically significant improvement with da for both benin and niger in fig 2 interestingly fig 3 shows that grace da particularly improves ssm estimates in the dry period december january february djf this implies that low water condition is easier to reflect the observational information about unmodeled hydrological processes during data assimilation 3 2 spatial distribution of the ssm correlation next we evaluate the ssmol and ssmda estimates with the three operational satellite based ssm products of ascat smos and smap and also the triple collocation analysis tca ssmol or ssmda ascat smos for the period from june 2015 to may 2017 fig 4 illustrates the spatial distributions and latitudinal profiles of the anomaly correlation coefficients and the differences in r for the satellite based ssm products and tca against the clsm ol and da simulations rda rol in general the correlation maps show good agreement with high correlation values r 0 5 over west africa except for the upper right part of the study area i e central niger and chad characterized by low vegetation fraction and relatively steep terrain regions around the south western coast also show low correlation values which is consistent with previous studies which report of microwave ssm products performing poorly over topographic and coastal areas because of large retrieval errors in these regions wanders et al 2012 szczypta et al 2014 escorihuela and quintana segui 2016 the spatial pattern of the normalized ssm correlation values is expected to reflect a latitudinal gradient of annual precipitation and climate regions interestingly the peak values correspond to the transition zone between wet and dry climates over semi arid regions this is consistent with another finding that other transition zones e g indian subcontinent north american great plains and southeastern regions of brazil also show higher correlation values with strong seasonal and inter annual cycle in their ssm estimates al yaari et al 2014 as shown in fig 4m o latitudinal profiles indicate that anomaly correlation values peaks occur in the middle latitude region i e around 10 n higher latitudes close to the sahara desert are more arid and show lower correlation values as a result of little variation in the ssm estimates the lower latitudes corresponding with the humid regions also respond to lower correlation values with more vegetated areas this can be supported by the fact that the standard deviation of the monthly greenness fraction climatologies has the highest values in the higher latitudes of this study area whereas that of lai shows the highest at lower latitudes also it is worth to mention that amongst three satellite based smm products ascat shows the highest correlation at low latitudes and the lowest at high latitudes whereas smos shows the lowest correlation at low latitudes and smap the highest at high latitudes this indicates that when compared to passive soil moisture observations from smos and smap the active sensor i e ascat provides more similar behavior of the ssm retrieval as our modeled ssm in more vegetated areas also the difference maps between rda and rol against each of the satellite soil moisture products and tca show the spatial distribution of the impact of grace da on modeled ssm overall the improvements obtained from da are minor and are not statistically significant the spatial patterns of the r differences in fig 4c f i and l cannot be characterized by similar latitudinal profiles as those of the anomaly r values to further investigate the impact of grace tws data assimilation on modeled ssm the distribution of the r differences against each remote sensing ssm product and tca is plotted as a function of twsa lai greenness fraction and topography for years 2015 2017 in fig 5 the r differences for each product are averaged into 20 mm bins of incremental twsa 0 5 m2 m2 bins of lai 10 bins of greenness fraction and 100 m bins of elevation respectively the results show that the da performance improves modeled ssm as the amplitude of tws increases this indicates that regions with larger tws amplitude give more capacity of the model to simulate more accurate ssm estimates through da this is consistent with the fact that the skill of assimilating grace tws into the catchment lsm can be reduced by a limited water storage capacity and low bed rock depth houborg et al 2012 most notable degradations in the modeled ssm through da are observed in low greenness fraction intervals 30 whereas improvements are seen in the intermediate lai intervals 1 m2 m2 this can be explained by noting that when compared to sparsely vegetated areas moderately vegetated areas show a strong seasonality in the soil moisture and support improved correlation coefficient values in the modeled ssm from assimilating grace tws variations into the land surface model triple collocation analysis tca was also applied to estimate the rmse of the modeled ssm against tc model ascat smos fig 6 shows spatial maps of the rmse of the ssmol and ssmda revealing high errors in the western coastal area senegal the rmse difference map fig 6c shows more significant improvements in the modeled ssm compared to tc based r difference fig 4l 3 3 ssm seasonality seasonal maps of the standardized anomaly ssm values relative to the mean baseline for years 2015 2017 for the lsm ol and da simulations and three satellite soil moisture products ascat smos and smap are shown in fig 7 both ssmol and ssmda show similar seasonality indicating that da preserves the climatology of the ol experiment amongst these ssm products ascat has the lowest values for the boreal winter months djf whereas smap has the highest values in the summer months june july august jja modeled ssm has the lowest values in spring march april may mam and highest values during fall september october november son overall there is good agreement between the general seasonal variability of all products except for the fall season it is also noted here that modeled ssm shows higher anomalies than the satellite smos and smap ssm estimates in fall this is related to the drying rate from summer to fall in the modeled ssm where they were also slower than the ground observations as illustrated in fig 2 also shellito et al 2018 revealed a limitation of the noah lsm to reproduce the ssm dynamics observed by smap due to slow drying rates from the peak value in their noah lsm ssm time series the drying rate of the ascat from summer jja to fall son is slower than that of the smos and smap datasets this is likely related to the c band sensor i e ascat being more influenced by moderately vegetated regions than the l band sensors i e smos smap preventing c band soil moisture observations from precisely capturing the drying rates 3 4 ssm annual trends the mean and annual trends of modeled ssm for years 2002 2017 are analyzed along with twsa from grace observations in fig 8 overall the spatial distribution of the mean ssm and grace tws values are similar to that of the precipitation mean shown also as a latitudinal gradient in fig 1 these results suggest that there may not be significant lateral hydrological fluxes e g runoff surface flow in west africa to make their spatial distributions greatly different twsa values reach as high as 200 mm in the western coastal area guinea and sierra leone and around the lower central region southern nigeria and western cameron of the study area the mean ssm values in the top soil layer 20 mm reach 10 mm in those regions where improvements in annual trends of the modeled ssm estimates are large related to grace data assimilation annual trends of the chirps precipitation show an average of 0 013 mm year for 2003 2017 in west africa see fig 1b the precipitation annual trends show positive values in the western coastal area and the lower east of the study area but negative values in the lower central portion of the domain annual trends of grace tws show an average of 2 685 mm year leading to a positive grace tws annual trend even in areas with a negative precipitation annual trend the average annual trend of ssmda increases to 0 014 mm year over that of ssmol 0 011 mm year as a result of assimilating grace into the lsm the annual trends of ssmda are corrected to be positive in the lower central part of this study area where the annual trends of ssmol and precipitation are negative in fig 9 annual trends of the modeled ssm estimates were analyzed against those of precipitation and twsa using the first polynomial regression model it is noteworthy that the rmse values of ssmda against precipitation and twsa values are reduced through grace data assimilation this indicates that when associated with grace da the change in ssm trend agrees more with the twsa trend 4 summary and conclusions first we evaluated modeled ssm by normalizing the ssm values and correlating them with normalized values from two different types of reference datasets ground based point measurements and satellite based footprint scale observations provide complementary information with respect to the required spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy with ground measurements we confirmed that the catchment lsm represents well the seasonality of ssm values in the time series but it shows little ability to accurately capture drying rates of the ssm estimates in the fall season this suggests that the improvement on accurate specification of the soil physics is required in our modeling system with satellite observations we revealed the spatial distribution of the normalized ssm correlation between modeled ssm and three currently available satellite based soil moisture observations this comparison showed the highest correlation values in the ssm estimates in the transition zone from arid and humid climate regions in west africa which is consistent with a previous study highlighting different transition zone regions al yaari et al 2014 this is likely related to the strong seasonal cycle in the ssm estimates and the distribution of vegetation density also it is interesting to note that the c band active sensor ascat shows more similar behaviors to the modeled ssm than the l band passive microwave sensors smos and smap the result may be affected by the depth of soil being modeled or observed leading to different surface soil drying rates and direct soil evaporation rates second we compare the modeled ssm from the open loop and data assimilation integrations to investigate the impact of grace tws da on the lsm based ssm estimation in regions where the tws amplitude is larger 80 mm an increase of the r differences rda rol in modeled ssm can be seen through the da performance this indicates that information on integrated water storage change from grace observations may be appropriately distributed into surface soil moisture only in regions having the relatively large change of tws amount understanding the performances of the satellite based ssm products would benefit from assimilating ssm observations into the lsms for further da studies including joint assimilation of tws and soil moisture observations which has been recently applied to produce improved water balance estimates and components tian et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 third we analyze the seasonality and annual trends of modeled ssm with the chirps precipitation and grace tws observations in west africa rodell et al 2018 revealed the recent positive trends of grace tws in west africa due to an increase of precipitation from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp without spatial analysis between tws and precipitation in this study we added the spatial distribution of modeled ssm and the chirps precipitation datasets for a more in depth analysis the pixel wise intercomparision of the annual trends demonstrated that our ssm estimates and grace tws observations do not follow the precipitation in their annual trend maps this supports that there is multi process on land atmosphere fluxes i e surface sensible and latent heat flux partitioning to soil moisture the planetary boundary layer pbl height evolution to surface fluxes entrainment fluxes to pbl height evolution the collective feedback of the free atmosphere on pbl thermodynamics santanello et al 2018 in west africa to make their annual trends different on a local scale also it is noteworthy that the long term annual trends in modeled ssm are corrected through grace tws da performance but the da influence is not clearly observed in the seasonality of our ssm estimates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6338,recent annual trends of precipitation and terrestrial water storage tws in west africa have been increasing over the past decade despite a significant impact of soil moisture on the tws in west africa there is little research on the recent spatial and temporal behaviors of surface soil moisture ssm along with the hydrological trends and variability in west africa in this study we assimilate tws estimates from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission into the catchment land surface model clsm and evaluate its impacts on ssm simulations for the years 2002 2017 the evaluation is performed using reference datasets the african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma in situ soil moisture observations three currently available microwave satellite ssm observations from the advanced scatterometer ascat the soil moisture ocean salinity smos and the soil moisture active passive smap satellites and also the triple collocation analysis tca overall modeled ssm shows good agreement with the reference datasets in terms of the anomaly ssm correlations however both modeled and ascat ssm are limited in their representation of the drying rates as observed by ground observations smos and smap estimates further grace data assimilation results in improved ssm simulations in the humid regions with large annual tws variability this study demonstrates the utility of land data assimilation to inform hydrological conditions in west africa where soil moisture monitoring is necessary for water resource and livestock management keywords soil moisture west africa grace data assimilation 1 introduction the capability of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to monitor changes in total water storage tws from surface through groundwater allows a better understanding of water cycle dynamics and water resources from basin to continental scales tapley et al 2004 rodell et al 2009 the assimilation of grace tws data has been proven to improve hydrological model skill and reduce land surface modeling lsm uncertainties e g zaitchik et al 2008 su et al 2010 forman et al 2011 specifically for an improved surface soil moisture ssm estimation grace data assimilation da has been successfully used for example in the north america kumar et al 2016 australia tian et al 2017 and iran khaki et al 2018 however a deeper analysis of the grace da performance in the modeled ssm is still lacking for west africa soil moisture has been shown to be the dominant component of tws in west africa more than its other constituent terms of groundwater surface water and snow water equivalent getirana et al 2017 also soil moisture plays an important role in the water and energy exchanges at the land atmosphere interface specifically in west africa showing a strong feedback mechanism between soil moisture and precipitation koster et al 2004 cheruy et al 2013 because soil moisture has a significant influence on the spatial and temporal variability of weather and climate conditions in west africa soil moisture monitoring has been increasingly required for agricultural and water resources management along with population and income growth e g mcnally et al 2015 leenaars et al 2018 however very few studies have looked at the recent annual trends of soil moisture estimates which is an important hydrological e g flood and agricultural e g drought indicator in west africa using ground measurements satellites and land surface modeling soil moisture estimates from satellite retrievals and models are known to have large biases and uncertainties among different products reichle et al 2004 crow et al 2005 the satellite and model data have complementary advantages and disadvantages and they can be merged to produce an optimally merged soil moisture product particularly in data sparse regions specifically the african monson multidisciplinary analysis amma project lebel et al 2009 was dedicated to collecting in situ land surface and atmospheric measurements and improving our understanding of soil moisture effects on land atmosphere fluxes in west africa redelsperger et al 2006 however the four densely instrumented mesoscale sites in mali niger benin and senegal are considered insufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity and variability of soil moisture at larger spatial scales de rosnay et al 2009 pellarin et al 2009a b other studies demonstrated that microwave soil moisture retrievals have improved hydrological modeling in these regions pellarin et al 2009a 2013 however their approaches are very simple and limited for example not including da in their modeling system recently considerable effort has been put on the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf land data assimilation system ldas and the noaa soil moisture products system smops to investigate satellite and lsm based observations of soil moisture that provide spatial resolutions on the order of tens of kilometers e g albergel et al 2012 al yaari et al 2014 yin et al 2015 these studies mainly focused on global scale evaluations with limited in situ observations very little analysis of the da impact and the dynamics of soil moisture estimates in west africa therefore more analysis on the ability of land data assimilation methods for improved lsm based soil moisture estimates should be considered for studying long term trends on large scale hydrological modeling in west africa recently rodell et al 2018 revealed annual trends in tws at the global scale based on the grace observations from 2002 to 2016 their results showed a positive tws trend in west africa caused by precipitation increase as compared to persistent droughts from 1970 to 2000 giannini et al 2008 galle et al 2018 to investigate the impact of grace da on modeled ssm in west africa we assimilate grace based tws estimates into the catchment land surface model clsm koster et al 2000 using the ensemble kalman smoother from june 2002 to may 2017 houborg et al 2012 demonstrated that grace da with clsm improves the consistency between modeled and grace based tws and produces enhanced soil moisture and groundwater conditions in the u s and north american drought monitors considering the observed higher impacts of soil moisture on tws west africa is an appropriate domain to investigate how the grace da influences modeled ssm this study 1 evaluates the temporal dynamics of modeled ssm against in situ measurements 2 quantifies the spatial correlations between the modeled ssm against satellite observations of soil moisture 3 analyzes the impact of grace da on modeled ssm and 4 presents the qualitative comparisons of seasonality and annual trend of these ssm estimates in west africa in addition to amma s ground observations ssm retrievals from three currently available microwave remote sensing instruments are used to conduct comprehensive inter comparisons and evaluations of the modeled ssm ssmol and ssmda from both the open loop ol reference run and da simulations evaluation of remotely sensed ssm products against in situ measurements is beyond the scope of this work this study serves to improve our understanding of the spatio temporal variability of surface soil moisture and provide potential implications for a land data assimilation system to better track agricultural drought and hydrological changes in west africa 2 data and methods 2 1 study area our study area covers west africa between 18 w to 25 e and 4 n to 18 n excluding arid regions i e sahara due to the small range of variation in ssm values the study domain is characterized by a latitudinal gradient that includes three climate regions sahelian soudanian guinean from north to south with gradually increasing annual precipitation galle et al 2018 in this study amma observations at two meso scale sites in niger and benin are used to evaluate the modeled ssm see fig 1 a two stations in niger tondikiboro and wankama and three stations in benin belefoungou bira and nalohou are available where the soil moisture data were collected hourly at 0 5 cm soil depth for soil texture and vegetation type benin is characterized by sandy clay loam savannas and woody savannas whereas niger is characterized by sandy loam grassland and open shrublands reynolds et al 2000 data at each meso scale site are within a single pixel thus they are spatially averaged to evaluate modeled ssm from the ol and da simulations 2 2 land surface modeling we simulate the water and energy fluxes on a 0 25 spatial resolution domain using the catchment land surface model clsm version fortuna 2 5 koster et al 2000 clsm can explicitly represent groundwater and is implemented within the nasa land information system lis kumar et al 2006 which includes a land data assimilation framework kumar et al 2008 clsm is driven by precipitation from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 and the other meteorological forcing fields are from nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 reichle et al 2017 we extract soil moisture estimates from the first model layer 0 2 cm out of three soil layers for our analysis for this study we used monthly climatologies of leaf area index lai and greenness fraction from the second global soil wetness project gswp 2 dirmeyer et al 2006 these datasets also represent the north south gradient on the spatial maps shown by the climate and precipitation dataset see fig 1 we assimilate grace tws anomalies into clsm using the ensemble kalman smoother enks which is part of lis and follows the approach described in kumar et al 2016 the enks approach disaggregates the monthly grace observations into a daily temporal scale of the land surface model and update the ensemble model fields the update for each ensemble member and for smoothing window t can be written as 1 x t i x t i k t y t m t x t i where x t i is the ith ensemble member of the state vector and y t is the grace observations the measurement operator m t relates the model fields into the observed variables the kalman gain matrix k t determines appropriate weights of the model versus the observations during the update in this study each clsm integration included 20 ensemble members and the observation error variance 10 mm was involved when generating tws estimates from grace observations the grace based tws product used is the center for space research csr grace rl05 mascon solutions at 0 5 degree spatial resolution save et al 2016 tws anomalies from grace observations were converted to absolute tws values in model space by adding time mean tws from clsm simulation on a grid by grid basis in order to evaluate the impact of grace da on modeled ssm an open loop ol simulation without assimilation is generated and compared with the grace data assimilation da integration the simulations were both performed from june 2002 to may 2017 which is limited by the data availability of the grace mission all experiments used a model time step of 15 min and produced daily averaged output fields on a 0 25 spatial resolution 2 3 remote sensing data soil moisture retrievals from three recent satellite based microwave instruments are used in this study they are 1 the advanced scatterometer ascat on board the metop a satellite launched in october 2006 and the metop b satellite launched in september 2012 2 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission launched in november 2009 and 3 the soil moisture active passive smap mission launched in january 2015 ascat is the only global soil moisture dataset from the c band backscatter measurements which has been used in the european space agency s esa climate change initiative cci soil moisture products dorigo et al 2015 ascat represents the degree of saturation of the surface soil layer 0 2 cm schmugge 1983 between totally dry conditions and total water capacity in unit of percent as compared to volumetric units used in both smos and smap missions the esa s smos mission is the first l band passive microwave radiometer mission for soil moisture observation the smos mission can penetrate soil depth to about 5 cm and vegetation cover with water content up to 5 kg m2 with global coverage every three days kerr et al 2000 due to the non functioning radar the smap also provides surface soil moisture measurements from an l band radiometer at approximately 36 km spatial resolution in the top 5 cm soil depth every 3 days with an accuracy of 0 04 m3 m3 entekhabi et al 2010 for specific retrievals of the products used in this study we obtained the ascat dataset from the soil moisture operational products system smops produced at the noaa national environmental satellite data and information service nesdis liu et al 2012 smops generates the global soil moisture maps with a daily interval within the latest 24 h at a 0 25 degree spatial resolution including soil moisture values of the surface soil layer 1 5 cm smops produces ascat data through the near real time nrt retrievals from eumetsat we obtained the operational oper smos level 3 products from the centre aval de traitement des donnéees smos catds al bitar et al 2017 the smos data are global daily 25 km products where a data quality index lower than 0 07 m3 m3 was applied to screen smos soil moisture retrievals in this study chen et al 2016 al yaari et al 2014 also we use smap level 3 radiometer global daily 36 km product available from april 2015 to present from the national snow and ice data center nsidc the soil moisture retrieval quality flag was applied and only pixels flagged as recommended for retrieval are considered in this analysis chan et al 2016 smap data was rescaled to match the 0 25 spatial resolution used in our model runs and the other ssm products using a bilinear interpolation approach 2 4 evaluation approach the daily time series of our modeled surface soil moisture ssmol and ssmda derived from ol and grace da simulations are evaluated with ground observations from january 2013 to december 2014 which is the most recent two years among this publicly available dataset ground based ssm have been regarded as true ssm estimates but they are not representative of lsm based estimates or the soil retrieval from satellite products due to spatial scale differences crow and zhan 2007 therefore modeled ssm is also evaluated with satellite based datasets from june 2015 to may 2017 during which all three satellite sm products and the grace dataset overlap absolute soil moisture products are not readily comparable to each other due to inconsistency of soil layer depths and different behavior of soil models koster et al 2009 also large differences in ssm estimates from lsms satellite based retrievals and in situ observations have been revealed in terms of their respective means and variances reichle et al 2004 therefore we compute anomalies or z scores i e standardized anomalies for all ssm values in this study using their own mean and standard deviation values to investigate the similarity between modeled ssm and ground observations the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse of the ssm anomalies are computed against each of the two reference datasets the anomaly r and rmse values are calculated on a pixel by pixel basis using valid observations of both datasets for the same time period when analyzing the seasonality of modeled ssm and three remote sensing ssm products standardized anomalies of the ssm values are computed due to a discrepancy over measurement units used in the remote sensing ssm products the triple collocation analysis tca mccoll et al 2014 is also applied to assess the performance of da with the modeled soil moisture estimates the tc requires three independent measurements

and a passive satellite retrieval z smos are implemented to calculate the tc based r and rmse values of the x 2 r x c o v x y c o v x z v a r x c o v y z 3 rmse x v a r x c o v x y c o v x z cov y z where the cov and var represent the covariance and variance respectively also we analyze annual trends of modeled ssm along with annual trends of grace tws amplitude twsa and precipitation twsa is defined as the average of absolute monthly tws climatological anomaly values 4 twsa m 1 12 tws m tws 12 the first polynomial regression models are applied to investigate the relationship of annual trends of the modeled ssm to those of precipitations and tws amplitude 3 results and discussion 3 1 ssm time series we evaluated modeled ssm ssmol and ssmda against the spatially averaged amma stations in benin and niger fig 2 shows simulated and observed ssm anomaly time series at two amma sites from january 2013 to december 2014 overall both ssmol and ssmda estimates represent well the seasonality of the ground observations with high correlation values r 0 8 al yaari et al 2014 and dorigo et al 2015 demonstrated that tropical semi arid and savannah regions in west africa relate to better performance of soil moisture estimates than the other climate regions or vegetation types both benin and niger sites show a slightly positive da impact on ssm estimates it is interesting to note that during the fall season september to november drying of the modeled ssm is slower than that observed by ground measurements this was shown similarly in a previous study where modeled ssm generated from the noah lsm within a united states based domain had slower drying rates than the smap retrievals shellito et al 2018 when compared to benin the normalized ssm estimates at the sites in niger show a shorter wet season and longer dry season from our modeling and ground observations which is related to the fact that niger is located at a higher more arid and less vegetated latitude than benin to investigate the da performance on the modeled ssm for all four seasons the differences of the anomaly r and anomaly rmse values between ssmol and ssmda are calculated the temporally averaged anomaly r and rmse values do not show a statistically significant improvement with da for both benin and niger in fig 2 interestingly fig 3 shows that grace da particularly improves ssm estimates in the dry period december january february djf this implies that low water condition is easier to reflect the observational information about unmodeled hydrological processes during data assimilation 3 2 spatial distribution of the ssm correlation next we evaluate the ssmol and ssmda estimates with the three operational satellite based ssm products of ascat smos and smap and also the triple collocation analysis tca ssmol or ssmda ascat smos for the period from june 2015 to may 2017 fig 4 illustrates the spatial distributions and latitudinal profiles of the anomaly correlation coefficients and the differences in r for the satellite based ssm products and tca against the clsm ol and da simulations rda rol in general the correlation maps show good agreement with high correlation values r 0 5 over west africa except for the upper right part of the study area i e central niger and chad characterized by low vegetation fraction and relatively steep terrain regions around the south western coast also show low correlation values which is consistent with previous studies which report of microwave ssm products performing poorly over topographic and coastal areas because of large retrieval errors in these regions wanders et al 2012 szczypta et al 2014 escorihuela and quintana segui 2016 the spatial pattern of the normalized ssm correlation values is expected to reflect a latitudinal gradient of annual precipitation and climate regions interestingly the peak values correspond to the transition zone between wet and dry climates over semi arid regions this is consistent with another finding that other transition zones e g indian subcontinent north american great plains and southeastern regions of brazil also show higher correlation values with strong seasonal and inter annual cycle in their ssm estimates al yaari et al 2014 as shown in fig 4m o latitudinal profiles indicate that anomaly correlation values peaks occur in the middle latitude region i e around 10 n higher latitudes close to the sahara desert are more arid and show lower correlation values as a result of little variation in the ssm estimates the lower latitudes corresponding with the humid regions also respond to lower correlation values with more vegetated areas this can be supported by the fact that the standard deviation of the monthly greenness fraction climatologies has the highest values in the higher latitudes of this study area whereas that of lai shows the highest at lower latitudes also it is worth to mention that amongst three satellite based smm products ascat shows the highest correlation at low latitudes and the lowest at high latitudes whereas smos shows the lowest correlation at low latitudes and smap the highest at high latitudes this indicates that when compared to passive soil moisture observations from smos and smap the active sensor i e ascat provides more similar behavior of the ssm retrieval as our modeled ssm in more vegetated areas also the difference maps between rda and rol against each of the satellite soil moisture products and tca show the spatial distribution of the impact of grace da on modeled ssm overall the improvements obtained from da are minor and are not statistically significant the spatial patterns of the r differences in fig 4c f i and l cannot be characterized by similar latitudinal profiles as those of the anomaly r values to further investigate the impact of grace tws data assimilation on modeled ssm the distribution of the r differences against each remote sensing ssm product and tca is plotted as a function of twsa lai greenness fraction and topography for years 2015 2017 in fig 5 the r differences for each product are averaged into 20 mm bins of incremental twsa 0 5 m2 m2 bins of lai 10 bins of greenness fraction and 100 m bins of elevation respectively the results show that the da performance improves modeled ssm as the amplitude of tws increases this indicates that regions with larger tws amplitude give more capacity of the model to simulate more accurate ssm estimates through da this is consistent with the fact that the skill of assimilating grace tws into the catchment lsm can be reduced by a limited water storage capacity and low bed rock depth houborg et al 2012 most notable degradations in the modeled ssm through da are observed in low greenness fraction intervals 30 whereas improvements are seen in the intermediate lai intervals 1 m2 m2 this can be explained by noting that when compared to sparsely vegetated areas moderately vegetated areas show a strong seasonality in the soil moisture and support improved correlation coefficient values in the modeled ssm from assimilating grace tws variations into the land surface model triple collocation analysis tca was also applied to estimate the rmse of the modeled ssm against tc model ascat smos fig 6 shows spatial maps of the rmse of the ssmol and ssmda revealing high errors in the western coastal area senegal the rmse difference map fig 6c shows more significant improvements in the modeled ssm compared to tc based r difference fig 4l 3 3 ssm seasonality seasonal maps of the standardized anomaly ssm values relative to the mean baseline for years 2015 2017 for the lsm ol and da simulations and three satellite soil moisture products ascat smos and smap are shown in fig 7 both ssmol and ssmda show similar seasonality indicating that da preserves the climatology of the ol experiment amongst these ssm products ascat has the lowest values for the boreal winter months djf whereas smap has the highest values in the summer months june july august jja modeled ssm has the lowest values in spring march april may mam and highest values during fall september october november son overall there is good agreement between the general seasonal variability of all products except for the fall season it is also noted here that modeled ssm shows higher anomalies than the satellite smos and smap ssm estimates in fall this is related to the drying rate from summer to fall in the modeled ssm where they were also slower than the ground observations as illustrated in fig 2 also shellito et al 2018 revealed a limitation of the noah lsm to reproduce the ssm dynamics observed by smap due to slow drying rates from the peak value in their noah lsm ssm time series the drying rate of the ascat from summer jja to fall son is slower than that of the smos and smap datasets this is likely related to the c band sensor i e ascat being more influenced by moderately vegetated regions than the l band sensors i e smos smap preventing c band soil moisture observations from precisely capturing the drying rates 3 4 ssm annual trends the mean and annual trends of modeled ssm for years 2002 2017 are analyzed along with twsa from grace observations in fig 8 overall the spatial distribution of the mean ssm and grace tws values are similar to that of the precipitation mean shown also as a latitudinal gradient in fig 1 these results suggest that there may not be significant lateral hydrological fluxes e g runoff surface flow in west africa to make their spatial distributions greatly different twsa values reach as high as 200 mm in the western coastal area guinea and sierra leone and around the lower central region southern nigeria and western cameron of the study area the mean ssm values in the top soil layer 20 mm reach 10 mm in those regions where improvements in annual trends of the modeled ssm estimates are large related to grace data assimilation annual trends of the chirps precipitation show an average of 0 013 mm year for 2003 2017 in west africa see fig 1b the precipitation annual trends show positive values in the western coastal area and the lower east of the study area but negative values in the lower central portion of the domain annual trends of grace tws show an average of 2 685 mm year leading to a positive grace tws annual trend even in areas with a negative precipitation annual trend the average annual trend of ssmda increases to 0 014 mm year over that of ssmol 0 011 mm year as a result of assimilating grace into the lsm the annual trends of ssmda are corrected to be positive in the lower central part of this study area where the annual trends of ssmol and precipitation are negative in fig 9 annual trends of the modeled ssm estimates were analyzed against those of precipitation and twsa using the first polynomial regression model it is noteworthy that the rmse values of ssmda against precipitation and twsa values are reduced through grace data assimilation this indicates that when associated with grace da the change in ssm trend agrees more with the twsa trend 4 summary and conclusions first we evaluated modeled ssm by normalizing the ssm values and correlating them with normalized values from two different types of reference datasets ground based point measurements and satellite based footprint scale observations provide complementary information with respect to the required spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy with ground measurements we confirmed that the catchment lsm represents well the seasonality of ssm values in the time series but it shows little ability to accurately capture drying rates of the ssm estimates in the fall season this suggests that the improvement on accurate specification of the soil physics is required in our modeling system with satellite observations we revealed the spatial distribution of the normalized ssm correlation between modeled ssm and three currently available satellite based soil moisture observations this comparison showed the highest correlation values in the ssm estimates in the transition zone from arid and humid climate regions in west africa which is consistent with a previous study highlighting different transition zone regions al yaari et al 2014 this is likely related to the strong seasonal cycle in the ssm estimates and the distribution of vegetation density also it is interesting to note that the c band active sensor ascat shows more similar behaviors to the modeled ssm than the l band passive microwave sensors smos and smap the result may be affected by the depth of soil being modeled or observed leading to different surface soil drying rates and direct soil evaporation rates second we compare the modeled ssm from the open loop and data assimilation integrations to investigate the impact of grace tws da on the lsm based ssm estimation in regions where the tws amplitude is larger 80 mm an increase of the r differences rda rol in modeled ssm can be seen through the da performance this indicates that information on integrated water storage change from grace observations may be appropriately distributed into surface soil moisture only in regions having the relatively large change of tws amount understanding the performances of the satellite based ssm products would benefit from assimilating ssm observations into the lsms for further da studies including joint assimilation of tws and soil moisture observations which has been recently applied to produce improved water balance estimates and components tian et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 third we analyze the seasonality and annual trends of modeled ssm with the chirps precipitation and grace tws observations in west africa rodell et al 2018 revealed the recent positive trends of grace tws in west africa due to an increase of precipitation from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp without spatial analysis between tws and precipitation in this study we added the spatial distribution of modeled ssm and the chirps precipitation datasets for a more in depth analysis the pixel wise intercomparision of the annual trends demonstrated that our ssm estimates and grace tws observations do not follow the precipitation in their annual trend maps this supports that there is multi process on land atmosphere fluxes i e surface sensible and latent heat flux partitioning to soil moisture the planetary boundary layer pbl height evolution to surface fluxes entrainment fluxes to pbl height evolution the collective feedback of the free atmosphere on pbl thermodynamics santanello et al 2018 in west africa to make their annual trends different on a local scale also it is noteworthy that the long term annual trends in modeled ssm are corrected through grace tws da performance but the da influence is not clearly observed in the seasonality of our ssm estimates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6339,trend analysis is continuously in the research and application agenda due to climate change effect searches on various engineering social economic agriculture environmental and water resources design management operation and management studies classical trend analysis is useable for holistic trend identification and then statistical quantification as for its intercept and slope the main drawbacks in these classical approaches are the set of fundamental assumptions such as the serial independence of the given time series pre whitening normality of the data and non existence of serial comparison among different sections of the same record this paper explains a non parametric approach to avoid almost all these difficulties by simple methodology which is referred as the innovative polygonal trend analysis ipta such an approach helps not only to identify the trend in a given series but also trend transitions between successive sections of the two equal segments from the original hydro meteorological time series leading to trend polygon which provides a productive basis for finer interpretation with linguistic and numerical interpretations and inferences from a given time series the application of the ipta is presented for rainfall records from new jersey usa danube river and göksu river discharge records from romania and turkey keywords hydro meteorology ipta polygon trend stochastic time series trend analysis trend slope 1 introduction hydro meteorological variable average changes and variabilities in the standard deviation are very essential in different human activities such as water supply groundwater recharge hydro electric energy generation agricultural activities and irrigation applications it is expected that recent global warming and consequent climate change impacts may accelerate these changes and therefore their control should be done according to objective methodologies in the literature there are various methodologies for the assessment of time series trend component and variability changes mann 1945 sen 1968 kendall 1975 şen 2012 a common definition of a trend can be generally directional and in the forms of steadily increasing or decreasing average tendency in a time series it is possible to recognize such tendencies in a given time series visually however their objective identification by scientific and methodological approaches have rather restrictive assumptions two implicit features of any trend are its relatively slow average change along time axis and smoothness that it is a continuous straight line there may be also non linear stochastic trend components in a hydro meteorological time series the purpose of trend analysis is to make future predictions on the objective quantitative and systematic detection identification and prediction mechanisms whereas stochastic component shows itself as the residual around the trend such mechanisms are available mostly through the statistical procedures with a set of restrictive basic assumptions trend detection analysis has a special place in any statistical analysis of hydro meteorological economy geophysics quality control and similar time series studies predominantly temporal trends are the main concern but in some topics especially in geology and engineering works spatial trend searches are significant for regional assessments for instance trend surface analysis tsa has been applied by geologists for more than 60 years to separate an observed contour map into two components a regional trend and a local fluctuation component davis 2002 this approach is limited by using a global polynomial method in trend modeling it does not allow geologist s input to achieve an optimal removal of undesirable trend this leads to a low resolution and sometimes artifacts in highlighting interested features climate change and global warming have led to a dramatic increase in trend analysis application of hydro meteorological time series as temperatures humidity precipitation evaporation stream flow the number of trend researches has been increased since the pioneering works of mann 1945 and kendall 1975 the couple of which is referred classically as the mann kendal mk trend test this method has been applied frequently by many researches burn 1994 bocheva et al 2009 kyselý 2009 korhonen and kuusisto 2010 reihan et al 2012 wilson et al 2010 jones et al 2015 güçlü 2018 zhang et al 2015 yu et al 1993 besides this theil 2011 and sen 1968 investigated theil sen approach for supporting the mk test helps to detect the magnitude of the trend applications of this methodology can be seen in papers by sayemuzzaman and jha 2014 swain et al 2015 and bari et al 2016 şen 2012 proposed innovative trend analysis ita method which provides trend identification from inductive and deductive perspectives this innovative non parametric approach and its severalversions are analyzed by many researches dabanli and şen 2018 şen 2014 2017 alashan 2018a b güçlü et al 2018a b dabanlı et al 2016 sonali and nagesh kumar 2013 tabari et al 2017 wu and qian 2017 elouissi et al 2016 mohorji et al 2017 almazroui et al 2018 trend detection in holistic manner by aforementioned parametric and non parametric methods is important but they do not reflect periodical say monthly trend features which is very essential for depiction of seasonal trend behaviors especially seasonal trend detection can help to regulate or manage water resources systems agriculture and irrigation works therefore new approach is suggested by evolving ita procedure to fulfill this gap in trend analysis the goals of this paper are to explain procedures of ipta templates and to present its applications for discussions such a trend approach provides physical aspects of average and standard deviation seasonal variations that are essential and refined parts hidden in holistic annual trend behaviors the templates that show transitional trend components between successive months are presented for different hydro meteorological records in turkey romania and united states 2 methodology it is by now well known that the ita as suggested by şen 2012 2014 2017a b provides visual interpretations and numerical quantifications of a given hydro meteorological data set classification into low medium and high groups if necessary one can apply the same technique for two three or more sub series of equal length from the mother time series in the application of ita there is no restrictive assumption which first provides subjective visual interpretations leading to objective linguistic inferences the slope and intercept of the monotonic trend can be calculated numerically and finally the significance test can be applied şen 2017a ipta can be applied on several time scales i e daily monthly annual etc in case of monthly statistical parameters basically arithmetic average and standard deviation are taken as template construction between 12 set of each parameter from the first half of the mother time series versus to the second part 12 monthly values these twelve values can also be adapted for any other monthly value such as the skewness coefficient maximum or minimum which provide further detailed information about the monthly variations within the data although in this paper monthly records are considered it is possible to expand such a procedure to weekly or even daily data treatment in the same manner let us consider a monthly hydro meteorological time series as x1 x2 xn where n is the number years this sequence can be arranged into a monthly matrix as it is possible to consider this matrix in two halves as the upper the first and lower the second parts by consideration of the indicator i as i 1 2 n 2 and i n 2 1 n 2 2 n respectively subsequently one can calculate the monthly averages and the standard deviations from each half matrix columns as upper half x u 2 x u 2 x u 12 and lower half x l 2 x l 2 x l 12 and likewise the standard deviations as s u 1 s u 2 s u 12 and s l 1 s l 2 s l 12 respectively in the same way it is possible to identify the maximum and minimum values for the upper and lower parts as m 1 m 2 m 12 and m 1 m m 12 respectively provided that these parameters are considered in two sets then the ipta version of the ita template appears as in fig 1 where each month is shown as the vertex of the polygon successive monthly points are connected by straight lines which indicate the transition from one month to the next one a straight line provides a set of qualitative and quantitative trend information the scatter of monthly values in this graph is dependent on the effects of different hydro meteorological phenomena such as storm types frequency and magnitude weather patterns morphology human settlement vegetation land use and land change in a regular polygon there is generally a rising limb followed by a falling sequence for instance in the fig 1 starting from january jan through points february feb march mar april apr may may up to june jun the monthly values are in rise on the other hand starting from june jun through july jul august aug september sep october oct november nov december dec and ending in january jan a falling sequence exists the comparative difference between the rising and recession limbs also provides how the internal change in the concerned hydro meteorological variable changes for instance during the rising sequence there are more frequent and abundant rainfall occurrences whereas along the falling sequence opposite situations take place although the template in this figure provides rather systematic polygons with one loop however depending on the physical circumstances there may be two or even more complex loops physically the more dynamic and chaotic a hydro meteorological event the more complex polygon are tending to appear however in the case of regular phenomenon the polygons end up with a single loop for instance rainfall events might have comparatively more polygonal loops than runoff because after all the runoff discharges are rather dampened loops due to the collective behavior of a drainage area in the scatter diagram for monthly records the straight lines appear as a 12 vertice polygon with different side lengths and slopes in general simply a straight line expression can be obtained after knowing the coordinates of each successive scatter points on the ipta template hence each trend line slope can be calculated holistically ipta template appears in the form of 12 sided non linearity within the monthly hydro meteorological time series furthermore a ipta template for monthly records provides a basis for qualitative and quantitative interpretations and calculations about the hydro meteorological system leading to the following useful information a the straight line between two consecutive months indicates the change in the monthly values the closed polygon implies the natural balance behavior of the hydro meteorological variable concerned for one year b the consecutive monthly changes are represented by the length of each straight line length c if the slope of each straight line in the ipta template is close enough to each other both in vertical and horizontal direction it implies that the relative monthly rates contribute insignificantly to the mean of hydro meteorological variation for each consecutive month likewise all the straight lines in the ipta template first provide explanation on annual basis 12 month variation for qualitative linguistic inference at each record location d each polygon side implies the assumption that there is a linear change between consecutive months the linearity assumption smaller than one year implies more realistic results in the trend analysis e if the slopes of all the straight lines in an ipta template are not different from each other all of the sides appear around a single global direction then connection of the polygon vertices provide a broken line which is very close to the global regression line fit in this case the polygon is very narrow which means that the internal change within the hydro meteorological variable is quite homogenous isotropic and has uniform variation behavior whereas comparatively wider polygons indicate heterogeneous temporal variation f in general any polygon with a rising form implies that the prevailing conditions are almost in balance on the contrary there may arise two or more polygons loops rather than a single one as indicated in fig 2 g any horizontal line intersection with the polygon provides lower and upper limits of expected hydro meteorological variable monthly amounts variation domain similarly any vertical line depicts the lower and upper limits as well as the range of hydro meteorological amount h the smaller the area of the polygon the more consistent the monthly precipitation and the more stable the hydro meteorological event occurrence i the smaller the overall slope of the polygon from the horizontal axis the more intensive the hydro meteorological event occurrence j in any water resources project planning operation maintenance and development the ipta template provides values for an effective and systematic assessment these general characteristics of the polygon diagrams reflect many quantitative and qualitative properties of the hydro meteorological phenomena 3 application the application of the ipta concept principles is given for three hydro meteorological monthly records from different parts of the world these are the new jersey usa where very long precipitation records are available from 1895 up to 2010 danube river romania monthly flows from 1882 up to 2000 and runoff records from göksu river turkey from 1936 up to 2000 the locations of each region are presented in figs 3a 3b and 3c in all the iptapta template graphs in figs 4 7 are related to various new jersey monthly precipitation records there are significant differences as for the statewide coastal northern and southern regions table 1 presents numerical values of mean and standard deviation for coastal regions for the first and second halves sub series in addition to the trend lengths and slopes for instance in arithmetic mean figure individually five of the months january february june july and august remain below the 1 1 45 no trend straight line which implies that there were less rainfall monthly averages during the recent half 1953 2010 than the first half 1985 1952 however in other months the opposite situation is valid i e there are rainfall increments especially september october november december april and march periods have rather very complicated and inconsistent rainfall behaviors similarly in standard deviation ipta graph july august and september appear under the 1 1 line indicating that there are tendencies towards decreasing trends whereas increasing trends are valid in other months the following points are significant in the interpretation of the monthly arithmetic averages and standard deviation scatters and tables 1 since there is no regular and stable appearance of successive monthly points as it is usually expected like the polygon in fig 1 the mean monthly precipitation and standard deviation at the coastal region of new jersey state are not stable because there are non systematic shifts from month to month 2 the precipitation phenomenon in this region does not reflect homogeneous and isotropic behavior 3 there are strong decreasing trends in the monthly precipitation tendencies in january and february far away from the no trend line 1 1 45 the same is valid in the sequence of june july august months but in opposite direction at weaker decreasing rate 4 starting from february onwards there is a sharp transition from the decreasing part to increasing part of the ipta template towards march and then onwards remains in the same part during transitions to the subsequent month there is a decreasing tendency from may to the limb mentioned in the previous step 5 from august to september there is again a transition to increasing trend region and then after december to the decreasing region until january 6 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 36 1 mm and 26 2 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 117 3 and 2683 for mean and standard deviation respectively apart from the above linguistic interpretations the numerical values are given in table 1 which provides useful information for any quantitative study fig 5 indicates the precipitation monthly arithmetic average and standard deviation transitions for the northern region where some linguistic points are completely different the previous one table 2 presents numerical values of the northern regions ipta one can infer the following major points from the fig 5 and table 2 for the northern region of the new jersey state 1 there is a distinctive polygon where only three months namely february july and august appear in the decreasing trend area with transitions towards the increasing trend area from february to march and august to september for arithmetic mean graph 2 there are also transitions from the increase to decrease area from january to february and june to july in the arithmetic mean graph 3 the previous steps indicate to transitions from winter to spring and from summer to winter season respectively 4 since it is a polygon that closes onto itself the region is under the effect of rather a systematic weather transition with almost stable stages 5 there are strong increasing trends in the standard deviations of monthly precipitation tendencies all months remain in the increasing trend area 6 there are strong increasing trends in the monthly precipitation tendencies of standard deviation in january december april and june far away from the no trend line 1 1 45 straight line 7 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 33 mm and 17 3 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 316 and 443 2 for mean and standard deviation respectively as for the southern region precipitation monthly arithmetic averages and standard deviation in fig 6 again there is not a distinctive polygon that closes onto itself but rather transitions from increase to decrease areas and vice versa the following points are among the most significant features of precipitation ipta template behavior from the fig 6 and table 3 for the southern region 1 although from january to february there is a complete decreasing trend but from february to march there is a significant transition from trend decrease area to the increase area for arithmetic mean graph 2 as for fig 6 arithmetic mean after march two more months the trend remains in increasing form with decreasing trends but another significant transition takes place from may to june and remain there for the next two more months 3 the transition from august to september in arithmetic mean is another lengthy trend and the following three months are also in the increasing region 4 the final segment of the ipta approach is from increase to trend decrease area and hence the polygon reaches to january 5 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 17 3 mm and 15 2 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 443 2 and 415 for mean and standard deviation respectively fig 7 is the last ipta template of the whole statewide precipitation pattern of new jersey which implies the following significant points about the precipitation arithmetic average and standard deviation polygon also table 4 summarizes the numerical values of these graphs 1 again there are decreasing trend starts from january to february then a long transition to the increase area until may 2 likewise the trend components remain in the decrease area for june july august month chain 3 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 33 mm and 13 5 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 253 2 and 4053 8 for mean and standard deviation respectively this trend polygon is almost similar to new jersey mean monthly precipitation at southern region the ipta template in fig 8 for arithmetic mean of danube river has a regular polygon with two limbs as decreasing trends starting from may to october and then a rising limb from november to april there are also transitions from the increase to decrease area and vice versa in arithmetic mean as in fig 8 table 5 summarizes the numerical values of these graphs as mentioned earlier in the case of runoff the arithmetic average ipta templates have almost a single loop polygon the following points appear as significant features 1 again there are decreasing trends start from may to october then a transition to the increase area until april for arithmetic mean trend polygon figure 2 there is a distinctive polygon in standard deviation figure where only four months namely december january may and june show in the decreasing trend area with transitions towards the increasing trend area from january to february and june to july 3 there are also transitions from the increase to decrease area from november to december and april to may 4 in the decreasing trend region of the ipta template there is very close slope trend from may to september in the arithmetic average template 5 the maximum trend length component appears during february march duration in the arithmetic mean and october november in the standard deviation 6 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 2061 m3 s and 678 m3 s for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 4 27 and 7 19 for mean and standard deviation respectively finally göksu river ipta template in fig 9 has a trend polygon but this time almost with one limb in arithmetic mean trend polygon where the limb remains in the trend decrease region completely but practically very close to the 1 1 45 no trend straight line on the other hand the standard deviation for göksu river ipta template in fig 9 has a trend polygon again with two limbs where the lower limb remains in the trend decrease region completely and the upper limb is in the increase region of the template besides table 6 summarizes the numerical values of these graphs one can deduce the following points from fig 9 1 the increasing trend segments in standard deviation graph start from june and continues up to december during which july august part has the biggest trend slope and length 2 the february march duration in arithmetic mean has parallel trend to no trend line 1 1 45 3 there is a sharp transition from the trend decrease region to the increase area from may to june whereas the transition from december to january is rather smooth close to the lowest point in the standard deviation template 4 maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 37 07 m3 s and 16 91 m3 s for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 10 88 and 3 14 for mean and standard deviation respectively 4 conclusions the main purpose of this paper is to propose a trend assessment method on monthly basis by means of a new concept of innovative polygonal trend analysis ipta which is another version of the innovative trend analysis ita as it is already available in the literature herein ipta is used where there are 12 scatter points on the template each for a month with values of arithmetic averages and standard deviations as the necessity requirements for its preparation the ipta template provides much practically demandable linguistic and numerical information such as the trends between two successive months their slopes and lengths per month amounts homogeneities isotropies and others the application of the ipta is performed for three hydro meteorological records from different parts of the world including new jersey usa danube river romania and göksu river turkey in terms of precipitation and runoff declaration of competing interest none

polygonal trend analysis ipta such an approach helps not only to identify the trend in a given series but also trend transitions between successive sections of the two equal segments from the original hydro meteorological time series leading to trend polygon which provides a productive basis for finer interpretation with linguistic and numerical interpretations and inferences from a given time series the application of the ipta is presented for rainfall records from new jersey usa danube river and göksu river discharge records from romania and turkey keywords hydro meteorology ipta polygon trend stochastic time series trend analysis trend slope 1 introduction hydro meteorological variable average changes and variabilities in the standard deviation are very essential in different human activities such as water supply groundwater recharge hydro electric energy generation agricultural activities and irrigation applications it is expected that recent global warming and consequent climate change impacts may accelerate these changes and therefore their control should be done according to objective methodologies in the literature there are various methodologies for the assessment of time series trend component and variability changes mann 1945 sen 1968 kendall 1975 şen 2012 a common definition of a trend can be generally directional and in the forms of steadily increasing or decreasing average tendency in a time series it is possible to recognize such tendencies in a given time series visually however their objective identification by scientific and methodological approaches have rather restrictive assumptions two implicit features of any trend are its relatively slow average change along time axis and smoothness that it is a continuous straight line there may be also non linear stochastic trend components in a hydro meteorological time series the purpose of trend analysis is to make future predictions on the objective quantitative and systematic detection identification and prediction mechanisms whereas stochastic component shows itself as the residual around the trend such mechanisms are available mostly through the statistical procedures with a set of restrictive basic assumptions trend detection analysis has a special place in any statistical analysis of hydro meteorological economy geophysics quality control and similar time series studies predominantly temporal trends are the main concern but in some topics especially in geology and engineering works spatial trend searches are significant for regional assessments for instance trend surface analysis tsa has been applied by geologists for more than 60 years to separate an observed contour map into two components a regional trend and a local fluctuation component davis 2002 this approach is limited by using a global polynomial method in trend modeling it does not allow geologist s input to achieve an optimal removal of undesirable trend this leads to a low resolution and sometimes artifacts in highlighting interested features climate change and global warming have led to a dramatic increase in trend analysis application of hydro meteorological time series as temperatures humidity precipitation evaporation stream flow the number of trend researches has been increased since the pioneering works of mann 1945 and kendall 1975 the couple of which is referred classically as the mann kendal mk trend test this method has been applied frequently by many researches burn 1994 bocheva et al 2009 kyselý 2009 korhonen and kuusisto 2010 reihan et al 2012 wilson et al 2010 jones et al 2015 güçlü 2018 zhang et al 2015 yu et al 1993 besides this theil 2011 and sen 1968 investigated theil sen approach for supporting the mk test helps to detect the magnitude of the trend applications of this methodology can be seen in papers by sayemuzzaman and jha 2014 swain et al 2015 and bari et al 2016 şen 2012 proposed innovative trend analysis ita method which provides trend identification from inductive and deductive perspectives this innovative non parametric approach and its severalversions are analyzed by many researches dabanli and şen 2018 şen 2014 2017 alashan 2018a b güçlü et al 2018a b dabanlı et al 2016 sonali and nagesh kumar 2013 tabari et al 2017 wu and qian 2017 elouissi et al 2016 mohorji et al 2017 almazroui et al 2018 trend detection in holistic manner by aforementioned parametric and non parametric methods is important but they do not reflect periodical say monthly trend features which is very essential for depiction of seasonal trend behaviors especially seasonal trend detection can help to regulate or manage water resources systems agriculture and irrigation works therefore new approach is suggested by evolving ita procedure to fulfill this gap in trend analysis the goals of this paper are to explain procedures of ipta templates and to present its applications for discussions such a trend approach provides physical aspects of average and standard deviation seasonal variations that are essential and refined parts hidden in holistic annual trend behaviors the templates that show transitional trend components between successive months are presented for different hydro meteorological records in turkey romania and united states 2 methodology it is by now well known that the ita as suggested by şen 2012 2014 2017a b provides visual interpretations and numerical quantifications of a given hydro meteorological data set classification into low medium and high groups if necessary one can apply the same technique for two three or more sub series of equal length from the mother time series in the application of ita there is no restrictive assumption which first provides subjective visual interpretations leading to objective linguistic inferences the slope and intercept of the monotonic trend can be calculated numerically and finally the significance test can be applied şen 2017a ipta can be applied on several time scales i e daily monthly annual etc in case of monthly statistical parameters basically arithmetic average and standard deviation are taken as template construction between 12 set of each parameter from the first half of the mother time series versus to the second part 12 monthly values these twelve values can also be adapted for any other monthly value such as the skewness coefficient maximum or minimum which provide further detailed information about the monthly variations within the data although in this paper monthly records are considered it is possible to expand such a procedure to weekly or even daily data treatment in the same manner let us consider a monthly hydro meteorological time series as x1 x2 xn where n is the number years this sequence can be arranged into a monthly matrix as it is possible to consider this matrix in two halves as the upper the first and lower the second parts by consideration of the indicator i as i 1 2 n 2 and i n 2 1 n 2 2 n respectively subsequently one can calculate the monthly averages and the standard deviations from each half matrix columns as upper half x u 2 x u 2 x u 12 and lower half x l 2 x l 2 x l 12 and likewise the standard deviations as s u 1 s u 2 s u 12 and s l 1 s l 2 s l 12 respectively in the same way it is possible to identify the maximum and minimum values for the upper and lower parts as m 1 m 2 m 12 and m 1 m m 12 respectively provided that these parameters are considered in two sets then the ipta version of the ita template appears as in fig 1 where each month is shown as the vertex of the polygon successive monthly points are connected by straight lines which indicate the transition from one month to the next one a straight line provides a set of qualitative and quantitative trend information the scatter of monthly values in this graph is dependent on the effects of different hydro meteorological phenomena such as storm types frequency and magnitude weather patterns morphology human settlement vegetation land use and land change in a regular polygon there is generally a rising limb followed by a falling sequence for instance in the fig 1 starting from january jan through points february feb march mar april apr may may up to june jun the monthly values are in rise on the other hand starting from june jun through july jul august aug september sep october oct november nov december dec and ending in january jan a falling sequence exists the comparative difference between the rising and recession limbs also provides how the internal change in the concerned hydro meteorological variable changes for instance during the rising sequence there are more frequent and abundant rainfall occurrences whereas along the falling sequence opposite situations take place although the template in this figure provides rather systematic polygons with one loop however depending on the physical circumstances there may be two or even more complex loops physically the more dynamic and chaotic a hydro meteorological event the more complex polygon are tending to appear however in the case of regular phenomenon the polygons end up with a single loop for instance rainfall events might have comparatively more polygonal loops than runoff because after all the runoff discharges are rather dampened loops due to the collective behavior of a drainage area in the scatter diagram for monthly records the straight lines appear as a 12 vertice polygon with different side lengths and slopes in general simply a straight line expression can be obtained after knowing the coordinates of each successive scatter points on the ipta template hence each trend line slope can be calculated holistically ipta template appears in the form of 12 sided non linearity within the monthly hydro meteorological time series furthermore a ipta template for monthly records provides a basis for qualitative and quantitative interpretations and calculations about the hydro meteorological system leading to the following useful information a the straight line between two consecutive months indicates the change in the monthly values the closed polygon implies the natural balance behavior of the hydro meteorological variable concerned for one year b the consecutive monthly changes are represented by the length of each straight line length c if the slope of each straight line in the ipta template is close enough to each other both in vertical and horizontal direction it implies that the relative monthly rates contribute insignificantly to the mean of hydro meteorological variation for each consecutive month likewise all the straight lines in the ipta template first provide explanation on annual basis 12 month variation for qualitative linguistic inference at each record location d each polygon side implies the assumption that there is a linear change between consecutive months the linearity assumption smaller than one year implies more realistic results in the trend analysis e if the slopes of all the straight lines in an ipta template are not different from each other all of the sides appear around a single global direction then connection of the polygon vertices provide a broken line which is very close to the global regression line fit in this case the polygon is very narrow which means that the internal change within the hydro meteorological variable is quite homogenous isotropic and has uniform variation behavior whereas comparatively wider polygons indicate heterogeneous temporal variation f in general any polygon with a rising form implies that the prevailing conditions are almost in balance on the contrary there may arise two or more polygons loops rather than a single one as indicated in fig 2 g any horizontal line intersection with the polygon provides lower and upper limits of expected hydro meteorological variable monthly amounts variation domain similarly any vertical line depicts the lower and upper limits as well as the range of hydro meteorological amount h the smaller the area of the polygon the more consistent the monthly precipitation and the more stable the hydro meteorological event occurrence i the smaller the overall slope of the polygon from the horizontal axis the more intensive the hydro meteorological event occurrence j in any water resources project planning operation maintenance and development the ipta template provides values for an effective and systematic assessment these general characteristics of the polygon diagrams reflect many quantitative and qualitative properties of the hydro meteorological phenomena 3 application the application of the ipta concept principles is given for three hydro meteorological monthly records from different parts of the world these are the new jersey usa where very long precipitation records are available from 1895 up to 2010 danube river romania monthly flows from 1882 up to 2000 and runoff records from göksu river turkey from 1936 up to 2000 the locations of each region are presented in figs 3a 3b and 3c in all the iptapta template graphs in figs 4 7 are related to various new jersey monthly precipitation records there are significant differences as for the statewide coastal northern and southern regions table 1 presents numerical values of mean and standard deviation for coastal regions for the first and second halves sub series in addition to the trend lengths and slopes for instance in arithmetic mean figure individually five of the months january february june july and august remain below the 1 1 45 no trend straight line which implies that there were less rainfall monthly averages during the recent half 1953 2010 than the first half 1985 1952 however in other months the opposite situation is valid i e there are rainfall increments especially september october november december april and march periods have rather very complicated and inconsistent rainfall behaviors similarly in standard deviation ipta graph july august and september appear under the 1 1 line indicating that there are tendencies towards decreasing trends whereas increasing trends are valid in other months the following points are significant in the interpretation of the monthly arithmetic averages and standard deviation scatters and tables 1 since there is no regular and stable appearance of successive monthly points as it is usually expected like the polygon in fig 1 the mean monthly precipitation and standard deviation at the coastal region of new jersey state are not stable because there are non systematic shifts from month to month 2 the precipitation phenomenon in this region does not reflect homogeneous and isotropic behavior 3 there are strong decreasing trends in the monthly precipitation tendencies in january and february far away from the no trend line 1 1 45 the same is valid in the sequence of june july august months but in opposite direction at weaker decreasing rate 4 starting from february onwards there is a sharp transition from the decreasing part to increasing part of the ipta template towards march and then onwards remains in the same part during transitions to the subsequent month there is a decreasing tendency from may to the limb mentioned in the previous step 5 from august to september there is again a transition to increasing trend region and then after december to the decreasing region until january 6 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 36 1 mm and 26 2 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 117 3 and 2683 for mean and standard deviation respectively apart from the above linguistic interpretations the numerical values are given in table 1 which provides useful information for any quantitative study fig 5 indicates the precipitation monthly arithmetic average and standard deviation transitions for the northern region where some linguistic points are completely different the previous one table 2 presents numerical values of the northern regions ipta one can infer the following major points from the fig 5 and table 2 for the northern region of the new jersey state 1 there is a distinctive polygon where only three months namely february july and august appear in the decreasing trend area with transitions towards the increasing trend area from february to march and august to september for arithmetic mean graph 2 there are also transitions from the increase to decrease area from january to february and june to july in the arithmetic mean graph 3 the previous steps indicate to transitions from winter to spring and from summer to winter season respectively 4 since it is a polygon that closes onto itself the region is under the effect of rather a systematic weather transition with almost stable stages 5 there are strong increasing trends in the standard deviations of monthly precipitation tendencies all months remain in the increasing trend area 6 there are strong increasing trends in the monthly precipitation tendencies of standard deviation in january december april and june far away from the no trend line 1 1 45 straight line 7 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 33 mm and 17 3 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 316 and 443 2 for mean and standard deviation respectively as for the southern region precipitation monthly arithmetic averages and standard deviation in fig 6 again there is not a distinctive polygon that closes onto itself but rather transitions from increase to decrease areas and vice versa the following points are among the most significant features of precipitation ipta template behavior from the fig 6 and table 3 for the southern region 1 although from january to february there is a complete decreasing trend but from february to march there is a significant transition from trend decrease area to the increase area for arithmetic mean graph 2 as for fig 6 arithmetic mean after march two more months the trend remains in increasing form with decreasing trends but another significant transition takes place from may to june and remain there for the next two more months 3 the transition from august to september in arithmetic mean is another lengthy trend and the following three months are also in the increasing region 4 the final segment of the ipta approach is from increase to trend decrease area and hence the polygon reaches to january 5 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 17 3 mm and 15 2 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 443 2 and 415 for mean and standard deviation respectively fig 7 is the last ipta template of the whole statewide precipitation pattern of new jersey which implies the following significant points about the precipitation arithmetic average and standard deviation polygon also table 4 summarizes the numerical values of these graphs 1 again there are decreasing trend starts from january to february then a long transition to the increase area until may 2 likewise the trend components remain in the decrease area for june july august month chain 3 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 33 mm and 13 5 mm for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 253 2 and 4053 8 for mean and standard deviation respectively this trend polygon is almost similar to new jersey mean monthly precipitation at southern region the ipta template in fig 8 for arithmetic mean of danube river has a regular polygon with two limbs as decreasing trends starting from may to october and then a rising limb from november to april there are also transitions from the increase to decrease area and vice versa in arithmetic mean as in fig 8 table 5 summarizes the numerical values of these graphs as mentioned earlier in the case of runoff the arithmetic average ipta templates have almost a single loop polygon the following points appear as significant features 1 again there are decreasing trends start from may to october then a transition to the increase area until april for arithmetic mean trend polygon figure 2 there is a distinctive polygon in standard deviation figure where only four months namely december january may and june show in the decreasing trend area with transitions towards the increasing trend area from january to february and june to july 3 there are also transitions from the increase to decrease area from november to december and april to may 4 in the decreasing trend region of the ipta template there is very close slope trend from may to september in the arithmetic average template 5 the maximum trend length component appears during february march duration in the arithmetic mean and october november in the standard deviation 6 finally maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 2061 m3 s and 678 m3 s for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 4 27 and 7 19 for mean and standard deviation respectively finally göksu river ipta template in fig 9 has a trend polygon but this time almost with one limb in arithmetic mean trend polygon where the limb remains in the trend decrease region completely but practically very close to the 1 1 45 no trend straight line on the other hand the standard deviation for göksu river ipta template in fig 9 has a trend polygon again with two limbs where the lower limb remains in the trend decrease region completely and the upper limb is in the increase region of the template besides table 6 summarizes the numerical values of these graphs one can deduce the following points from fig 9 1 the increasing trend segments in standard deviation graph start from june and continues up to december during which july august part has the biggest trend slope and length 2 the february march duration in arithmetic mean has parallel trend to no trend line 1 1 45 3 there is a sharp transition from the trend decrease region to the increase area from may to june whereas the transition from december to january is rather smooth close to the lowest point in the standard deviation template 4 maximum values of trend lengths are calculated as 37 07 m3 s and 16 91 m3 s for mean and standard deviation respectively also maximum values for trend slope are calculated as 10 88 and 3 14 for mean and standard deviation respectively 4 conclusions the main purpose of this paper is to propose a trend assessment method on monthly basis by means of a new concept of innovative polygonal trend analysis ipta which is another version of the innovative trend analysis ita as it is already available in the literature herein ipta is used where there are 12 scatter points on the template each for a month with values of arithmetic averages and standard deviations as the necessity requirements for its preparation the ipta template provides much practically demandable linguistic and numerical information such as the trends between two successive months their slopes and lengths per month amounts homogeneities isotropies and others the application of the ipta is performed for three hydro meteorological records from different parts of the world including new jersey usa danube river romania and göksu river turkey in terms of precipitation and runoff declaration of competing interest none
