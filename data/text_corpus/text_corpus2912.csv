14560,in this study a bio electrochemical system was used to investigate the recovery of silver from diammine complex ag nh3 2 coupled with power generation and wastewater treatment measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal acetate was oxidized by anodic microorganisms to produce electrons which were transported to the cathode for the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex after 48 h of operation at different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations 1000 3000 mg ag l a ag removal of over 96 along with a cod removal of 60 76 80 and a columbic efficiency of 8 55 14 69 were achieved maximum power density slightly increased by 4 66 from 3618 to 3795 mw m3 when 10 mm nano3 was added to the catholyte containing 2000 mg ag l the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions through the membrane affected the performance as the inorganic fouling at the membrane surface increased the internal resistance this transport was confirmed by the accumulation of silver in anodic biomass 0 853 mg ag g biomass after 58 days scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray edx and x ray diffraction xrd analysis demonstrated ag deposits with a dendritic structure formed at the cathode surface a deeper understanding on bio electrochemical technology used for ag recovery and electricity production from ag nh3 2 complex was achieved in this study keywords bio electrochemical system silver recovery power generation silver i diammine complex cation exchange membrane 1 introduction a large amount of silver ag has been used in the plating industry and for photographic manufacturing accordingly the effluents from these processes normally contain ag at high concentration waste fixer solutions from photographic manufacturing for example contain ag in the range of 5000 10 000 mg l 1 furthermore the waste composition is relative complex where a variety of organic and inorganic substances such as ammonia edta and thiosulfate usually exist 1 3 the toxicity of silver and other recalcitrant compounds to freshwater and marine organisms is an environmental concern thus the discharge of silver rich wastewater into the environment is regulated stringently the maximum daily discharge of ag into surface water is 0 22 mg l according to the environmental protection agency epa usa 2000 moreover silver is a valuable metal and is not considered as a waste requiring disposal but as a recoverable material therefore for both economic and environmental aspects recovery of silver from effluents is essential recently bio electrochemical system bes technology offers an attractive approach for integrated wastewater treatment along with energy and resource recovery 4 basically a bes consists of an anode and a cathode chamber which are normally separated by an ion exchange membrane iem to prevent the cross over of electrolytes in the anode chamber microorganisms are employed to convert organic wastes and produce electrons which are then transferred through an electrical circuit to the cathode electricity thus can be produced spontaneously instead of used the conversion of biodegradable wastes to electricity by using bes technology has been demonstrated by several researchers 5 6 by acting as electron acceptors in the cathode chamber metal ions are reduced electrochemically and metallic deposits are formed at the cathode surface which can be recovered bes technology has been found to be a new method for recovery of metals from aqueous solutions or wastewater 7 9 recovery of silver from aqueous solution using bes technology has been studied by several researchers 10 13 in which the effects of operational parameters e g ph initial ag concentration were investigated the influences of different iems on bes performance was also examined 14 however the above studies mostly used acidic solutions containing simple free silver ions ag as the model catholyte except ag s2o3 was considered by tao et al 12 due to a high standard redox potential ag ag0 e0 0 799 v versus the standard hydrogen electrode vs she 8 ag ions can be reduced spontaneously in the cathode chamber there are not many studies on recovery of silver from complexes in alkaline waste solutions silver complexes e g ag nh3 2 ag s2o3 2 3 have a lower standard redox potential i e e0 0 373 v 0 01 v vs she respectively as compared to free silver ions i e e0 0 799 v which may not facilitate spontaneous reduction in bes reactor silver i diammine complex contaminated wastewater ag nh3 2 was firstly studied by wang et al 2 to recover ag accompanied with electricity production it was reported that 3 2 j and 160c could be produced and 1 6 g ag could be recovered on the cathode after 9 h of operation while 1 g cod was removed from the anode chamber 2 the experiment was conducted in a small bio electrochemical cell i e working volume 50 ml in which a bipolar iem bpm i beijing ting run co china was used as a separator between the anode and the cathode chamber basically a bipolar iem consists of an anion and a cation exchange layer aem and cem mounted together and allows the simultaneous migration of proton h and hydroxide oh ions generated from the water splitting reaction at the interface of the cem and aem layers however due to the permeability of electrolyte the transition area or interface always contains a certain concentration of electrolyte salts diffusing from both chambers under an electric field there is also migration of the anions through the aem layer toward the anode and the cations through the cem layer toward the cathode which increases the polarization potential of the separator and leads to elevated internal resistance 15 16 furthermore in a bipolar iem based system the ph balance between anode and cathode chambers is severely affected due to the competition for migration of electrolytes at the interface 16 these drawbacks of bipolar iem were also pointed out by wang et al 2 which caused low performance in electricity production in their research also a detail discussion on columbic efficiency power density and their relation to internal resistance were lacking in this research therefore alternative materials for electrodes and membranes which may have an influence on the internal resistance should be investigated to improve the performance in addition in the study of wang et al 2 the operation for silver recovery in the bio electrochemical cell was carried out at one concentration of ag nh3 2 i e 10 mm and the effect of initial ag nh3 2 concentration was not considered thus further studies should be conducted to investigate thoroughly the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex in a bes reactor the objective of this study is to investigate the silver recovery combined with power generation and wastewater treatment in a bes reactor operated with different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations the overall bes performance is characterized by silver removal efficiency in the cathode chamber cod removal and columbic efficiency in the anode chamber in order to improve the electrical output the following materials are used carbon brush as the anode cation exchange membrane cmi 7000s as the separator and nano3 as supporting electrolyte since ag nh3 2 ions can diffuse through the cmi 7000s membrane and adsorb to the anodic biomass which may have an influence on bes performance the characterization of the membrane surface and digestion of biomass after bes operation are conducted to prove the loss of silver scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx and x ray diffraction xrd are also used to demonstrate the formation of metallic silver deposits at the cathode surface the novelty of this study is to understand the fate of ag nh3 2 complex during the bes operation by investigating the possible diffusion from the cathode to the anode chamber through cmi 7000s membrane and the impacts on internal resistance at different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations the determination of ag amount accumulated in the anodic biomass to prove the ag loss through membrane is also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes reactor fabrication cubic shape bes reactors made from acrylic plates were used in this study the reactor consisted of an anode and a cathode chamber i e 12 cm long 6 cm width 22 cm high with a working volume of 1 0 l for each chamber separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7000s membrane international inc usa dimension of the reactor used in the study are shown in fig 1 a the membrane 264 cm2 surface area was pre treated by immersing in 5 nacl solution for 12 h to allow for hydration and expansion carbon brush 15 cm 6 cm prepared by twisting carbon fiber thai carbonfiber co thailand with ti wire of 1 0 mm in diameter prolog titanium co ltd served as the anode while the cathode was a graphite plate 90 cm2 fujian china before making electrical connections with ti wire both electrodes were pre treated to eliminate contaminants and enhance conductivity the pre treatment method was adopted from the ho et al 17 the reactor was then connected to a computer equipped with a data logger grant instruments cambridge co ltd to record cell voltage during experiments 2 2 inoculation stage anaerobic sludge 100 ml from the digester of a brewery wastewater treatment plant pathum thani thailand was used as an inoculum in the anode chamber the anolyte 900 ml served as a nutrient source for the microbial growth including per liter ch3coona 1 28 g as substrate electron donor na2hpo4 3 55 g kh2po4 3 4 g nh4cl 0 31 g and yeast extract 0 2 g the anode chamber was kept in anaerobic conditions during the inoculation stage on the other hand the cathode chambers were filled with buffer solution 1 0 l containing per liter nah2po4 2h2o 4 77 g na2hpo4 2 75 g nacl 2 93 g and purged continuously with air to supply oxygen o2 as an electron acceptor the constant air flow rate of 80 ml min was controlled by using an aerator and a diffuser to maintain do level at its saturation level i e 8 2 mg l at temperature of 25 c and atmospheric pressure of 101 3 kpa 18 the anode and cathode were connected through an electrical circuit made by ti wire and 1000 ω resistance the cell voltage ecell produced from the reactor was recorded automatically using a data logger to monitor the system s behavior the anolyte and catholyte were refreshed when the ecell dropped significantly as the substrate was consumed in the anode chamber by bacteria the system was considered to be successfully acclimated when the ecell was stable after several feeding cycles for 22 days air was then stopped in the cathode chamber and the bes reactor was operated immediately for silver recovery fig 1b 2 3 operation stage in this stage the catholyte was replaced by silver i diammine complex to supply ag i ions as electron acceptors the complex was prepared by dissolving ag2so4 at different ag concentrations 1000 3000 mg l in an excess amount of 30 nh4oh solution in de ionized di water the mixture was heated gently on a hotplate with occasional stirring until the solid ag2so4 dissolved completely silver existed in the form of ag nh3 2 complex the original catholyte ph was around 10 2 in each batch of experiments acetate as substrate cod 1000 mg l was biologically oxidized in the anode chamber eq 1 while ag nh3 2 complex was reduced spontaneously in the cathode chamber eq 2 the thermodynamic cell voltage etherm is calculated as e t h e r m e c a 0 e a n 0 0 373 v 0 29 v 0 663 v 1 2 h c o 3 9 h 8 e c h 3 c o o 4 h 2 o e a n 0 0 29 v v s s h e 2 a g n h 3 2 e a g 0 2 n h 3 e c a 0 0 373 v v s s h e during the operation the anolyte was refilled with fresh solution each time the catholyte was replaced the anode and cathode chambers were purged with n2 80 ml min for 15 min to remove the dissolved oxygen and then sealed with septa to maintain the anaerobic conditions an external resistance rext of 5 ω was connected to maximize the current transferred from the anode to the cathode the ecell was also recorded during operation to observe the cell performance the anolyte and catholyte were sampled every 4 h to determine the remaining cod and silver concentration in the reactor polarization curve analysis was also conducted with different ag nh3 2 concentration levels 1000 3000 mg ag l to characterize the microbial fuel cell reactor the analysis started after the reactor was operated for 10 h the system was first kept in open circuit to obtain stable open circuit voltage ocv and the rext was then varied gradually from 10 000 ω to 5 ω the ecell was observed within 15 min and temporarily stable values were recorded to avoid the changes of substrate product during the measurement the current density i and power density p were then calculated at each resistance the effects of initial ag nh3 2 concentration c0 1000 3000 mg ag l on the bes performance was investigated by considering i silver removal and ecell production with time ii cod removal and columbic efficiency after 48 h and iii polarization and power curves besides in order to investigate the effect of supporting electrolyte on power generation different amounts of nano3 5 10 mm were added into the catholyte containing 2000 mg l of ag ions in addition a supplementary experiment was conducted in a control bes reactor to demonstrate the role of biological anodic reactions and the feasibility of cathodic reduction this experiment was also used to confirm the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions through the cmi 7000s membrane the control reactor was not inoculated anolyte containing acetate and medium along with catholyte i e ag nh3 2 complex 2000 mg ag l were fed into the anode and cathode chambers respectively the experiment was investigated for 48 h and the silver concentrations in the anolyte and catholyte were analyzed all experiments were conducted under batch fed conditions and room temperature 20 25 c the results were obtained as means from duplicate experiments all chemicals used are analytical grade and obtained from fisher scientific uk ajax finechem pty ltd merck millipore darmstadt germany and laboratory reagents and fine chemicals loba chemie pvt ltd india the solutions and reagents were prepared by using di water 2 4 analytical methods and calculation the electrolyte samples obtained from the anode and cathode chambers during operation were filtered through syringe filters ny 0 45 μm allpure before analysis the ag concentration was measured by an inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometer optima 8000 perkinelmer usa soluble cod measurement was based on the closed reflux titrimetric method 18 all measurements were performed in duplicate and the results were the average values the decrement of cod concentration δcs mg l at time t was

faraday constant 96500c mol after 58 days of bes operation the reactor was emptied the graphite plate cathode was taken out of the reactor and air dried at room temperature deposits covering the cathode surfaces were scraped to characterize the morphology and chemical composition by using an sem jsm 7800f jeol usa equipped with edx detector x maxn oxford instruments uk the metallic silver deposits were confirmed by an xrd machine panalytical x pert pro operated at 40 kv 30 ma data were collected over a 2θ range from 5 to 90 at a scanning step of 0 02 the cmi 700s membrane before and after operation was also characterized by sem and edx to detect any deposits occurring at the surface diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions from the catholyte to the anolyte through the cmi 7000s membrane may occur which may then adsorb on the biomass in the anode chamber in order to determine the accumulated amount of ag after bes operation the original anaerobic sludge before being fed into the reactor and the anodic biomass i e mixture of carbon brush and sludge obtained after experiments were firstly digested by microwave cem mars 6 usa for digestion 0 5 g of dry sample were taken in digestion vessels and 10 ml concentrated hno3 acid was added the following operating conditions were used power of 1030 1800 ramp time of 20 25 min hold time of 15 min temperature of 200 c and pressure of 406 psi the ag concentration in the liquid phase was then analyzed by an icp spectrometer optima 8000 perkinelmer usa thereafter the quantity of ag adsorbed per 1 g of biomass was calculated the results were reported as the means obtained from duplicate samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 silver removal and cell voltage production the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex in the catholyte of the bio anodic reactor over time at different c0 is shown in fig 2 a with c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l the reaction occurred rapidly as ag concentration decreased to 50 mg l corresponding to re 96 after 24 h of operation the reduction seems to be completed when the experiment was extended to 48 h i e c48 3 6 mg l re 99 the removal rate of ag nh3 2 complex rag in the catholyte was considered to evaluate the efficiency of silver removal specifically the rag calculated within the first 24 h was 40 15 81 32 and 74 88 mg lh when c0 was 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l respectively accordingly a lower efficiency i e re 59 9 was found after 24 h with c0 of 3000 mg l as compared to that with c0 of 1000 2000 mg l i e re 96 the higher initial ag nh3 2 concentration i e 3000 mg l at the beginning of the operation period i e 24 h is a reason for lower calculated re when the operation was extended to 48 h a comparable re of 96 10 at c0 of 3000 mg l was obtained transport of positive charged ions such as ag nh3 2 through the cmi 7000s membrane was also found during the first 12 h in each batch of experiments only the formation of sparkling deposits at the cathode surface was observed visually but thereafter some deposits gradually occurred at the membrane surface this may affect the ion transfer capacity of the cmi 7000s membrane as the membrane was not replaced after each batch of experiments studies reported that besides the membrane bio fouling which is an inevitable issue in the long term operation of most bes reactors the cation occupation of functional groups of cems and inorganic salt precipitations at the membrane surface are also detrimental issues for bes performance 19 20 this leads to a decrease in ion exchange capacity conductivity and diffusion coefficients of cations through the membrane consequently the bes performance decreases with an increase in number of batch cycles the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions from the catholyte to the anolyte through the cmi 7000s membrane was confirmed by the results obtained in the control reactor which was operated at c0 of 2000 mg l without inoculation see supplementary data this transport is due to the concentration gradient between the two chambers and is not under the effect of an electrical field as no ecell production was found the ag concentration in the anolyte of the control reactor increased gradually from 0 to 12 61 mg l after 48 h fig s1 on the other hand the transport of ag nh3 2 ions in the bio anodic reactor was affected not only by the diffusion due to the concentration gradient but also by the electron flow through the electrical circuit and the migration of other cations e g h through the membrane however the ag concentration in the anolyte of the bio anodic reactor was not measured in each batch of experiments due to the precipitation and adsorption of ag on the anodic biomass instead the accumulated amount of ag in the anodic biomass after 58 days of bes operation was determined to confirm the occurrence of ag in the anode chamber see section 3 5 in the bio anodic reactor along with the ag nh3 2 reduction in the catholyte the ecell progression over time was found simultaneously fig 2b when a c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l was used ecell increased rapidly during the first 8 h and reached the maximum values of 51 mv and 85 mv respectively thereafter it dropped gradually due to the shortage of electron acceptors caused by the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex the ecell production at c0 of 2000 mg l was higher than that at c0 of 1000 mg l during the first 24 h but the trends became similar after that as the measured voltage varied in a low range i e 10 15 mv theorically the ecell output is defined as the potential difference between the cathode and anode potential eca ean in this study as the same anolyte was fed in each batch of experiments the improvement of ecell production was due to changes in cathode potential resulting from the change of initial ag concentration specifically the ean i e 0 29 v vs she was almost similar among different experiments due to the anolyte refreshement whereas eca varied depending on the initial ag concentration which was simply inferred from the theorical values calculated based on nernst equation the results are in line with another study which also reported that an increase in concentration of electron acceptors can enhance the cathodic potential which further increases the cell voltage output 21 however when c0 increased to 3000 mg l a quite different trend was found it was observed that ecell increased slowly and reached a peak i e 74 5 mv at the 18th hour lower and slower ecell production at c0 of 3000 mg l can be attributed to the impacts of cmi 7000s more bio fouling and inorganic precipitation formed at the membrane surface after each cycle leading to an increase of membrane internal resistance which constituted a part of the total internal resistance of the bes it was reported that the mfc with a fouled proton exchange membrane pem after 90 days of operation had a much lower power output as the total internal resistance increased by 20 the open circuit voltage reduced by 9 9 and the maximum output power decreased by 32 3 20 the ecell output at a c0 of 3000 mg l after 18 h however was better as compared to that at a c0 of 1000 2000 mg l the slow rate of ag nh3 2 consumption at a c0 of 3000 mg l led to the high remaining ag nh3 2 concentration in the catholyte this may help to retain high cathodic potential and accordingly a high ecell output was recorded 3 2 cod removal and columbic efficiency during the experiments with different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations in the cathode chamber the performance in biological conversion of organic waste to produce electricity in the anode chamber was also evaluated by considering the cod removal and columbic efficiency ce when c0 in the cathode chamber increased from 1000 to 2000 mg l cod removal efficiency in the anode chamber increased from 60 to 76 80 fig 3 a as the same initial organic loading i e cod0 1000 mg l was fed into the anode chamber for each batch of experiments the increase in cod removal efficiency may be due to the improvement in biological activities of the anodic microbial community as the bes reactor was run for a long duration i e 22 days of inoculation and 58 days of operation it was reported that diverse microbial communities of hydrolytic fermentative acidogenic and acetogenic microorganisms are normally found in bess when the systems were inoculated by mixed cultures and operated for long duration 22 24 thus the biological adaptability and growth rate may be improved which led to higher substrate consumption and an increase in cod removal accordingly studies also indicated that the combined activities of anodophilic and methanogenic bacteria in mfc systems inoculated by mixed cultures or real wastewater could provide high cod removal efficiency 23 25 26 however a slight decrease in cod removal to 75 20 was found when c0 of 3000 mg l was used a higher c0 used in the catholyte caused a higher concentration gradient of electrolyte between the two chambers the transport of cations through the cmi 70001s membrane especially the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions from the catholyte to the anolyte was thus accelerated as compared to that at c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l moreover the experiment at c0 of 3000 mg l was the last batch of the operation the increasing amount of ag accumulated in the anode chamber after several batches of the experiments was not advantageous to the anodic bacteria which may affect the biological activities the occurrence and accumulated amount of silver in the anode chamber was confirmed by quantitative analysis although cod as organic contaminants could be removed effectively in the anode chamber after 48 h the ce referred to as the fraction of electrons recovered as current versus that in the starting organic matter eq 7 was relatively limited specifically ce was 8 55 14 69 when c0 was 1000 3000 mg l respectively fig 3a a better ce obtained at higher c0 resulted from the increase in current yield i e 0 t i d t calculated based on the progression of ecell over 48 h shown in fig 2b limited ce values can be attributed to the competition of non exoelectrogenic species e g fermenters methanogens in the anodic bacterial community with exoelectrogen to consume substrate through different biological processes which did not involve electricity production in other words the ce was influenced by different electron losses which occurred during the oxidation of organic compounds in a mfc system operated with glucose as substrate researchers indicated the electron loss by establishing cod mass balance in which all of output components beside current ma such as ch4 gas ml biomass total cod soluble cod mg were measured and expressed as soluble cod mass mg using equivalent conversion i e 1 e eq 8 g cod 1 ml ch4 2 57 mg cod 24 27 as a result the fraction of cod mass for current production was just 52 7 and the remainder were for ch4 generation 12 9 biomass formation 20 8 unremoved cod 9 7 and unknown processes 3 9 24 this confirmed the considerable activities of non exoelectrogens which did not take part into bio electrochemical reactions for electron production in order to prevent the growth of methanogenic bacteria in the anodic microbial community it is suggested to add 2 bromoethane sulfonate to the anode chamber according to some mfc studies used for electricity production and wastewater treatment 25 28 3 3 polarization curves and power curves the effect of initial ag nh3 2 concentration on power generation can be also evaluated by characterizing the polarization curves and power curves polarization curves e1 e2 and e3 represented ecell as a function of current density while power curves p1 p2 and p3 described power density as a function of current density fig 3b in the first two experiments with a c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l the voltage in e1 and e2 curves was almost linear with current it was reported that linear polarization curves are most often encountered in mfc systems and the internal resistance rint in which ohmic resistance rω is dominant can be determined simply from the slope of these curves 29 accordingly the rint determined as the slope of e1 and e2 was 32 83 and 26 24 respectively an increase of c0 from 1000 to 2000 mg l led to an increase in the ionic conductivity and a decrease in rint of electrolyte li et al 21 also reported that a high concentration of electron acceptors i e cr6 50 500 ppm increased the cathode potential measured by a saturated calomel electrode i e from 619 to 814 mv vs she and decreased the rint i e from 300 to 100 ω respectively however e3 obtained at c0 of 3000 mg l was distorted and nonlinear as compared to e1 and e2 this may be attributed to cathodic potential loss after membrane fouling xu et al 20 found that the fouled layer on the pem in the mfc system decreased the diffusion coefficients of cations through the membrane and heightened the cathodic potential loss thus the rint in the system at c0 of 3000 mg l could not be simply determined as the slope of e3 like for the case of e1 or e2 at a c0 of 1000 or 2000 mg l respectively basically the rint in bioelectrochemical systems includes other components than rω such as the activation charge transfer resistance rct and concentration resistance rdiff 30 31 in order to determine the contribution of different internal resistances to the overall impedance of fuel cells electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis analysis is suggested to be conducted the maximum power density pmax obtained in p1 p2 and p3 was also considered to investigate the performance of electricity production pmax increased from 2984 to 3618 mw m3 when c0 increased from 1000 to 2000 mg l but it slightly dropped to 3009 mw m3 when a c0 of 3000 mg l was used this result confirmed the effect of fouling as inorganic precipitation formed at the surface of cmi 7000s membrane which caused higher rint of membrane and lower performance in electricity production in the last cycle the results obtained in the current study were compared with that reported by wang et al 2 in which ag nh3 2 complex was also investigated table 1 higher performance in electricity production was found in the current study specifically at relatively similar conditions i e c0 of 1000 mg l pmax obtained in the current study and by wang et al 2 was 331 and 317 mw m2 respectively this was due to a decrease in internal resistance as a carbon brush anode and monopolar iem cmi 7000s were used in the current study while a carbon cloth anode and bipolar iem bpm i were employed in their work studies reported that carbon brush has high surface area and porosity for bacterial adhesion coupled with high electrical conductivity and efficient current collection 32 33 before assembling the carbon brush was pretreated section 2 1 according to previous studies this procedure could increase power generation by 25 due to an increase in specific area which facilitated bacteria adhesion with less contaminants that interfere with charge transfer from bacteria to electrode 32 34 harnisch et al 15 also indicated that monopolar iems i e nafion 117 yielded a linear polarization plot whereas the polarization curve of bipolar iems i e fumasep fbm was sigmoidal shaped and showed a considerably higher polarization than monopolar membranes this can be explained that in a bipolar iem based reactor the total ion flux is composed of the migration of electrolyte ions through aem and cem layers and the migration of h and oh ions generated from the water splitting reaction at the interface area between these layers on the other hand as compared to a study reported by ho et al 13 the current study showed a lower overall performance in their research free silver ions ag as agno3 was investigated as electron acceptors in the catholyte with the lower standard redox potential of ag nh3 2 complex i e ag nh3 2 ag0 e0 0 373 v vs she compared to ag ion i e ag ag0 e0 0 799 v vs she the ecell and pmax produced in this study was lower accordingly however high re i e 96 in both cases demonstrated that bes technology can be employed effectively to recover silver from either simple or complex solutions 3 4 effects of supporting electrolyte nano3 on power generation in this experiment ag nh3 2 complex containing 2000 mg ag l with 5 or 10 mm nano3 were investigated for power generation and silver removal as a result with a supplement of 5 mm nano3 the ecell production was improved slightly during the first 16 h thereafter it dropped similarly to that obtained without nano3 addition fig 4 a when the supplementary nano3 level increased to 10 mm the improvement in power generation was better as high ecell remained for a longer time i e 32 h before it became similar to the others the addition of nano3 improved the ionic conductivity of the catholyte and accordingly decreased the resistance of the electrolyte thus higher ecell could be produced the pmax also increased by 4 66 from 3618 to 3795 mw m3 when 10 mm nano3 was added to the catholyte fig 4b during experiments the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex in the catholyte was not affected by the addition of nano3 the na and no3 ions dissolved from a low amount of neutral salt nano3 5 or 10 mm may not compete significantly with ag nh3 2 complex 2000 mg l to accept the electrons in the catholyte results showed that the silver removal was over 99 in all of the cases similar results were found by other researchers when kno3 was used to improve the ionic conductivity of solution for recovery of copper cu and electricity production using a microbial fuel cell mfc 35 it was reported that cu removal efficiency 99 6 was not affected by the addition of kno3 0 200 mm within 11 h while the maximum power output was greatly improved from 96 2 to 143 6 mw m2 the improvement in power generation however was not significant when taking economic aspects into consideration the addition of nano3 or kno3 as a supporting electrolyte even though a low quantity was used conflicts with bes principles in which a chemical intensive process should be avoided on the other hand other ions from metallic salts beside silver ions normally exist in real wastewater or aqueous solutions which may also compete with ag ions to accept electrons and may affect the reduction rate the reduction of other metallic ions in the catholyte may occur simultaneously or sequentially depending on their redox potential thus further studies are recommended to be carried out with complex catholytes containing different metallic salts to investigate their effects on the bes performance 3 5 characterization of electrodeposits at cathode surface after 58 days of operation the graphite plate cathode was taken out of the reactor and air dried at room temperature the deposits on the cathode surface were scrapped and characterized by sem edx and xrd silver with dendritic structures was detected fig 5 a these dendrites have long trunks and short branches which look like a fishbone in contrast wang et al 2 found silver deposits in a compact layer structure at the cathode surface in their study while silver in the form of crystalline particles and dendritic structures were detected by ho et al 13 the difference in morphology of metallic silver deposits was due to the influence of operation time in each batch of experiments see table 1 and ecell output which is related to the intensity of electron flow for the reduction of silver ions in the catholyte liu et al 36 investigated the formation of silver deposits by time and the effects of current density on the silver morphologies in a two cell electrochemical reactor it was reported that with progression of the reaction i e 300 s a spherical pattern composed of small crystals was firstly formed and followed by the growth of small particles on the surface of the pattern these small particles thereafter developed into dendritic structures also the study found that a change in current density i e 25 2000 μa affected the reaction rate therefore this had an influence on the nucleation and growth of silver deposits i e from polyhedral aggregates to long thick rods followed by thick dendrites structures and mixture of dendrites and small cubic particles 36 the sem result was verified by edx fig 5b in which a sharp peak at an energy level of 2 98 kev was found indicating that the deposits were comprised of pure silver specifically the elemental characterization at point 1 in fig 5a had metallic silver of 98 16 wt the xrd pattern shown in fig 5c also confirmed the edx result the xrd patterns matched well with the standard patterns of silver i e jcpds card no 04 0783 all peaks can be readily indexed to face centered cubic silver where the diffraction peaks occur at 2θ values of 38 03 44 19 64 39 77 33 and 81 45 they also can be ascribed to the reflection of 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of the face centered cubic silver respectively no peaks from other phases were detected indicating the high purity of silver deposits 3 6 characterization of membrane surface when the cmi 7000s membrane was used as a separator in the bes reactor transport of positive charged ions through the functional groups i e sulphonic acid hso2oh attached on the membrane structure certainly occurs ag nh3 2 ions thus diffused from the catholyte to anolyte which caused silver loss and affected the overall silver recovery in order to verify the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions the surface of cmi 7000s membrane was characterized by sem and edx see supplementary data the original membrane before assembling in the bes reactor is relatively smooth without any fouling after 58 days of operation some bright deposits were observed visually in some parts of the membrane toward the cathode side under sem the deposits was observed in bulk and had dendritic structures fig s2a the edx analysis confirmed that silver was the main element detected in deposits at the membrane surface fig s2b the elemental characterization at point 2 in fig s2a had metallic silver of 96 97 wt the majority of ag nh3 2 complex in the catholyte was believed to be reduced electrochemically to form silver deposits at the cathode surface however the occurrence of metallic silver at the cmi 7000s surface affected the performance when high initial ag nh3 2 concentration was used e g 3000 mg l the membrane fouling at the cathode side may cause negative impacts on further operation due to the effect on ion exchange capacity replacement of the cmi 7000s membrane is thus essential for long term operation which may increase the operational cost therefore an investigation on the frequency of membrane replacement over a long time is required 3 7 adsorption and accumulation of silver in the anodic biomass ag nh3 2 ions diffused through the membrane and may adsorb on the biomass of the anode chamber silver gradually accumulated over time as the experiments were carried out with different concentration levels of ag nh3 2 complex the anodic biomass including suspended solid and the biofilm attached to the carbon brush was collected after 58 days of bes operation the biomass digestion and analysis of ag content are described in section 2 4 the original anaerobic sludge obtained from the wastewater treatment plant before being used as inoculum in the bes reactor served as a control sample the results are shown in table 2 no ag was detected in the control sample in contrast a high concentration of ag was found in the biomass sample indicating the occurrence and accumulation of ag in the anode chamber the ag accumulated due to adsorption was calculated as 0 853 mg ag g biomass this leads to a concern about the toxic effects of ag on microorganisms in the anode chamber several studies investigated the inhibitory effects of silver ions on the growth and susceptibility of bacteria with focus on escherichia coli 37 38 with a ag concentration of 1 2 mg l inhibited growth of escherichia coli was observed however in the current study anaerobic sludge was used as an inoculum in a bes reactor mixed cultured inoculum was reported to possess high adaptability and resistance to stress 39 in addition patil et al 40 found that the wastewater derived electroactive microbial biofilms in a mfc system was completely unaffected by the presence of antimicrobial compounds including heavy metals i e ag of 0 02 1 0 mg l pb of 0 41 12 48 mg l hg2 of 0 83 1 33 mg l and other biocides i e antibiotics disinfectant they also indicated that a bes may possess a lower susceptibility to toxins than anaerobic digestion due to the high resistance of electroactive microbial biofilms nevertheless the analysis and measurements of biological parameters in the anode chamber such as volatile suspended solids vss to ss ratio which basically reflects biomass health 41 is suggested to be monitored periodically to recognize the toxicity effects of silver besides further studies on the inhibitory effects of silver on a bacterial communityn should be conducted especially with high exposure concentration and longer operation 4 conclusions this study successfully demostrated the recovery of ag from silver i diammine complex coupled with electricity production and wastewater treatment in bes reactors high ag removal efficiency 96 and cod removal 60 could be obtained at different initial ag concentrations 1000 3000 mg l while an encouraging columbic efficiency 8 55 14 69 was found power density of 300 mw m2 was also achieved indicating electricity was a simultaneous by product instead of electricity consumption pure metallic silver deposits with dendritic structures were found at the cathode surface under sem edx and xrd analysis which reaffirmed the successful application of bes technology however diffusion of positive charged ag nh3 2 ions through the cmi 7000s membrane was observed which accelerated membrane fouling and increased the internal resistance in the sem edx characterization of membrane surface ag deposits were detected while digested anodic biomass showed some adsorption and accumulation of silver 0 853 mg

14560,in this study a bio electrochemical system was used to investigate the recovery of silver from diammine complex ag nh3 2 coupled with power generation and wastewater treatment measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal acetate was oxidized by anodic microorganisms to produce electrons which were transported to the cathode for the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex after 48 h of operation at different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations 1000 3000 mg ag l a ag removal of over 96 along with a cod removal of 60 76 80 and a columbic efficiency of 8 55 14 69 were achieved maximum power density slightly increased by 4 66 from 3618 to 3795 mw m3 when 10 mm nano3 was added to the catholyte containing 2000 mg ag l the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions through the membrane affected the performance as the inorganic fouling at the membrane surface increased the internal resistance this transport was confirmed by the accumulation of silver in anodic biomass 0 853 mg ag g biomass after 58 days scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray edx and x ray diffraction xrd analysis demonstrated ag deposits with a dendritic structure formed at the cathode surface a deeper understanding on bio electrochemical technology used for ag recovery and electricity production from ag nh3 2 complex was achieved in this study keywords bio electrochemical system silver recovery power generation silver i diammine complex cation exchange membrane 1 introduction a large amount of silver ag has been used in the plating industry and for photographic manufacturing accordingly the effluents from these processes normally contain ag at high concentration waste fixer solutions from photographic manufacturing for example contain ag in the range of 5000 10 000 mg l 1 furthermore the waste composition is relative complex where a variety of organic and inorganic substances such as ammonia edta and thiosulfate usually exist 1 3 the toxicity of silver and other recalcitrant compounds to freshwater and marine organisms is an environmental concern thus the discharge of silver rich wastewater into the environment is regulated stringently the maximum daily discharge of ag into surface water is 0 22 mg l according to the environmental protection agency epa usa 2000 moreover silver is a valuable metal and is not considered as a waste requiring disposal but as a recoverable material therefore for both economic and environmental aspects recovery of silver from effluents is essential recently bio electrochemical system bes technology offers an attractive approach for integrated wastewater treatment along with energy and resource recovery 4 basically a bes consists of an anode and a cathode chamber which are normally separated by an ion exchange membrane iem to prevent the cross over of electrolytes in the anode chamber microorganisms are employed to convert organic wastes and produce electrons which are then transferred through an electrical circuit to the cathode electricity thus can be produced spontaneously instead of used the conversion of biodegradable wastes to electricity by using bes technology has been demonstrated by several researchers 5 6 by acting as electron acceptors in the cathode chamber metal ions are reduced electrochemically and metallic deposits are formed at the cathode surface which can be recovered bes technology has been found to be a new method for recovery of metals from aqueous solutions or wastewater 7 9 recovery of silver from aqueous solution using bes technology has been studied by several researchers 10 13 in which the effects of operational parameters e g ph initial ag concentration were investigated the influences of different iems on bes performance was also examined 14 however the above studies mostly used acidic solutions containing simple free silver ions ag as the model catholyte except ag s2o3 was considered by tao et al 12 due to a high standard redox potential ag ag0 e0 0 799 v versus the standard hydrogen electrode vs she 8 ag ions can be reduced spontaneously in the cathode chamber there are not many studies on recovery of silver from complexes in alkaline waste solutions silver complexes e g ag nh3 2 ag s2o3 2 3 have a lower standard redox potential i e e0 0 373 v 0 01 v vs she respectively as compared to free silver ions i e e0 0 799 v which may not facilitate spontaneous reduction in bes reactor silver i diammine complex contaminated wastewater ag nh3 2 was firstly studied by wang et al 2 to recover ag accompanied with electricity production it was reported that 3 2 j and 160c could be produced and 1 6 g ag could be recovered on the cathode after 9 h of operation while 1 g cod was removed from the anode chamber 2 the experiment was conducted in a small bio electrochemical cell i e working volume 50 ml in which a bipolar iem bpm i beijing ting run co china was used as a separator between the anode and the cathode chamber basically a bipolar iem consists of an anion and a cation exchange layer aem and cem mounted together and allows the simultaneous migration of proton h and hydroxide oh ions generated from the water splitting reaction at the interface of the cem and aem layers however due to the permeability of electrolyte the transition area or interface always contains a certain concentration of electrolyte salts diffusing from both chambers under an electric field there is also migration of the anions through the aem layer toward the anode and the cations through the cem layer toward the cathode which increases the polarization potential of the separator and leads to elevated internal resistance 15 16 furthermore in a bipolar iem based system the ph balance between anode and cathode chambers is severely affected due to the competition for migration of electrolytes at the interface 16 these drawbacks of bipolar iem were also pointed out by wang et al 2 which caused low performance in electricity production in their research also a detail discussion on columbic efficiency power density and their relation to internal resistance were lacking in this research therefore alternative materials for electrodes and membranes which may have an influence on the internal resistance should be investigated to improve the performance in addition in the study of wang et al 2 the operation for silver recovery in the bio electrochemical cell was carried out at one concentration of ag nh3 2 i e 10 mm and the effect of initial ag nh3 2 concentration was not considered thus further studies should be conducted to investigate thoroughly the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex in a bes reactor the objective of this study is to investigate the silver recovery combined with power generation and wastewater treatment in a bes reactor operated with different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations the overall bes performance is characterized by silver removal efficiency in the cathode chamber cod removal and columbic efficiency in the anode chamber in order to improve the electrical output the following materials are used carbon brush as the anode cation exchange membrane cmi 7000s as the separator and nano3 as supporting electrolyte since ag nh3 2 ions can diffuse through the cmi 7000s membrane and adsorb to the anodic biomass which may have an influence on bes performance the characterization of the membrane surface and digestion of biomass after bes operation are conducted to prove the loss of silver scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx and x ray diffraction xrd are also used to demonstrate the formation of metallic silver deposits at the cathode surface the novelty of this study is to understand the fate of ag nh3 2 complex during the bes operation by investigating the possible diffusion from the cathode to the anode chamber through cmi 7000s membrane and the impacts on internal resistance at different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations the determination of ag amount accumulated in the anodic biomass to prove the ag loss through membrane is also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes reactor fabrication cubic shape bes reactors made from acrylic plates were used in this study the reactor consisted of an anode and a cathode chamber i e 12 cm long 6 cm width 22 cm high with a working volume of 1 0 l for each chamber separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7000s membrane international inc usa dimension of the reactor used in the study are shown in fig 1 a the membrane 264 cm2 surface area was pre treated by immersing in 5 nacl solution for 12 h to allow for hydration and expansion carbon brush 15 cm 6 cm prepared by twisting carbon fiber thai carbonfiber co thailand with ti wire of 1 0 mm in diameter prolog titanium co ltd served as the anode while the cathode was a graphite plate 90 cm2 fujian china before making electrical connections with ti wire both electrodes were pre treated to eliminate contaminants and enhance conductivity the pre treatment method was adopted from the ho et al 17 the reactor was then connected to a computer equipped with a data logger grant instruments cambridge co ltd to record cell voltage during experiments 2 2 inoculation stage anaerobic sludge 100 ml from the digester of a brewery wastewater treatment plant pathum thani thailand was used as an inoculum in the anode chamber the anolyte 900 ml served as a nutrient source for the microbial growth including per liter ch3coona 1 28 g as substrate electron donor na2hpo4 3 55 g kh2po4 3 4 g nh4cl 0 31 g and yeast extract 0 2 g the anode chamber was kept in anaerobic conditions during the inoculation stage on the other hand the cathode chambers were filled with buffer solution 1 0 l containing per liter nah2po4 2h2o 4 77 g na2hpo4 2 75 g nacl 2 93 g and purged continuously with air to supply oxygen o2 as an electron acceptor the constant air flow rate of 80 ml min was controlled by using an aerator and a diffuser to maintain do level at its saturation level i e 8 2 mg l at temperature of 25 c and atmospheric pressure of 101 3 kpa 18 the anode and cathode were connected through an electrical circuit made by ti wire and 1000 ω resistance the cell voltage ecell produced from the reactor was recorded automatically using a data logger to monitor the system s behavior the anolyte and catholyte were refreshed when the ecell dropped significantly as the substrate was consumed in the anode chamber by bacteria the system was considered to be successfully acclimated when the ecell was stable after several feeding cycles for 22 days air was then stopped in the cathode chamber and the bes reactor was operated immediately for silver recovery fig 1b 2 3 operation stage in this stage the catholyte was replaced by silver i diammine complex to supply ag i ions as electron acceptors the complex was prepared by dissolving ag2so4 at different ag concentrations 1000 3000 mg l in an excess amount of 30 nh4oh solution in de ionized di water the mixture was heated gently on a hotplate with occasional stirring until the solid ag2so4 dissolved completely silver existed in the form of ag nh3 2 complex the original catholyte ph was around 10 2 in each batch of experiments acetate as substrate cod 1000 mg l was biologically oxidized in the anode chamber eq 1 while ag nh3 2 complex was reduced spontaneously in the cathode chamber eq 2 the thermodynamic cell voltage etherm is calculated as e t h e r m e c a 0 e a n 0 0 373 v 0 29 v 0 663 v 1 2 h c o 3 9 h 8 e c h 3 c o o 4 h 2 o e a n 0 0 29 v v s s h e 2 a g n h 3 2 e a g 0 2 n h 3 e c a 0 0 373 v v s s h e during the operation the anolyte was refilled with fresh solution each time the catholyte was replaced the anode and cathode chambers were purged with n2 80 ml min for 15 min to remove the dissolved oxygen and then sealed with septa to maintain the anaerobic conditions an external resistance rext of 5 ω was connected to maximize the current transferred from the anode to the cathode the ecell was also recorded during operation to observe the cell performance the anolyte and catholyte were sampled every 4 h to determine the remaining cod and silver concentration in the reactor polarization curve analysis was also conducted with different ag nh3 2 concentration levels 1000 3000 mg ag l to characterize the microbial fuel cell reactor the analysis started after the reactor was operated for 10 h the system was first kept in open circuit to obtain stable open circuit voltage ocv and the rext was then varied gradually from 10 000 ω to 5 ω the ecell was observed within 15 min and temporarily stable values were recorded to avoid the changes of substrate product during the measurement the current density i and power density p were then calculated at each resistance the effects of initial ag nh3 2 concentration c0 1000 3000 mg ag l on the bes performance was investigated by considering i silver removal and ecell production with time ii cod removal and columbic efficiency after 48 h and iii polarization and power curves besides in order to investigate the effect of supporting electrolyte on power generation different amounts of nano3 5 10 mm were added into the catholyte containing 2000 mg l of ag ions in addition a supplementary experiment was conducted in a control bes reactor to demonstrate the role of biological anodic reactions and the feasibility of cathodic reduction this experiment was also used to confirm the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions through the cmi 7000s membrane the control reactor was not inoculated anolyte containing acetate and medium along with catholyte i e ag nh3 2 complex 2000 mg ag l were fed into the anode and cathode chambers respectively the experiment was investigated for 48 h and the silver concentrations in the anolyte and catholyte were analyzed all experiments were conducted under batch fed conditions and room temperature 20 25 c the results were obtained as means from duplicate experiments all chemicals used are analytical grade and obtained from fisher scientific uk ajax finechem pty ltd merck millipore darmstadt germany and laboratory reagents and fine chemicals loba chemie pvt ltd india the solutions and reagents were prepared by using di water 2 4 analytical methods and calculation the electrolyte samples obtained from the anode and cathode chambers during operation were filtered through syringe filters ny 0 45 μm allpure before analysis the ag concentration was measured by an inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometer optima 8000 perkinelmer usa soluble cod measurement was based on the closed reflux titrimetric method 18 all measurements were performed in duplicate and the results were the average values the decrement of cod concentration δcs mg l at time t was

cathode surfaces were scraped to characterize the morphology and chemical composition by using an sem jsm 7800f jeol usa equipped with edx detector x maxn oxford instruments uk the metallic silver deposits were confirmed by an xrd machine panalytical x pert pro operated at 40 kv 30 ma data were collected over a 2θ range from 5 to 90 at a scanning step of 0 02 the cmi 700s membrane before and after operation was also characterized by sem and edx to detect any deposits occurring at the surface diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions from the catholyte to the anolyte through the cmi 7000s membrane may occur which may then adsorb on the biomass in the anode chamber in order to determine the accumulated amount of ag after bes operation the original anaerobic sludge before being fed into the reactor and the anodic biomass i e mixture of carbon brush and sludge obtained after experiments were firstly digested by microwave cem mars 6 usa for digestion 0 5 g of dry sample were taken in digestion vessels and 10 ml concentrated hno3 acid was added the following operating conditions were used power of 1030 1800 ramp time of 20 25 min hold time of 15 min temperature of 200 c and pressure of 406 psi the ag concentration in the liquid phase was then analyzed by an icp spectrometer optima 8000 perkinelmer usa thereafter the quantity of ag adsorbed per 1 g of biomass was calculated the results were reported as the means obtained from duplicate samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 silver removal and cell voltage production the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex in the catholyte of the bio anodic reactor over time at different c0 is shown in fig 2 a with c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l the reaction occurred rapidly as ag concentration decreased to 50 mg l corresponding to re 96 after 24 h of operation the reduction seems to be completed when the experiment was extended to 48 h i e c48 3 6 mg l re 99 the removal rate of ag nh3 2 complex rag in the catholyte was considered to evaluate the efficiency of silver removal specifically the rag calculated within the first 24 h was 40 15 81 32 and 74 88 mg lh when c0 was 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l respectively accordingly a lower efficiency i e re 59 9 was found after 24 h with c0 of 3000 mg l as compared to that with c0 of 1000 2000 mg l i e re 96 the higher initial ag nh3 2 concentration i e 3000 mg l at the beginning of the operation period i e 24 h is a reason for lower calculated re when the operation was extended to 48 h a comparable re of 96 10 at c0 of 3000 mg l was obtained transport of positive charged ions such as ag nh3 2 through the cmi 7000s membrane was also found during the first 12 h in each batch of experiments only the formation of sparkling deposits at the cathode surface was observed visually but thereafter some deposits gradually occurred at the membrane surface this may affect the ion transfer capacity of the cmi 7000s membrane as the membrane was not replaced after each batch of experiments studies reported that besides the membrane bio fouling which is an inevitable issue in the long term operation of most bes reactors the cation occupation of functional groups of cems and inorganic salt precipitations at the membrane surface are also detrimental issues for bes performance 19 20 this leads to a decrease in ion exchange capacity conductivity and diffusion coefficients of cations through the membrane consequently the bes performance decreases with an increase in number of batch cycles the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions from the catholyte to the anolyte through the cmi 7000s membrane was confirmed by the results obtained in the control reactor which was operated at c0 of 2000 mg l without inoculation see supplementary data this transport is due to the concentration gradient between the two chambers and is not under the effect of an electrical field as no ecell production was found the ag concentration in the anolyte of the control reactor increased gradually from 0 to 12 61 mg l after 48 h fig s1 on the other hand the transport of ag nh3 2 ions in the bio anodic reactor was affected not only by the diffusion due to the concentration gradient but also by the electron flow through the electrical circuit and the migration of other cations e g h through the membrane however the ag concentration in the anolyte of the bio anodic reactor was not measured in each batch of experiments due to the precipitation and adsorption of ag on the anodic biomass instead the accumulated amount of ag in the anodic biomass after 58 days of bes operation was determined to confirm the occurrence of ag in the anode chamber see section 3 5 in the bio anodic reactor along with the ag nh3 2 reduction in the catholyte the ecell progression over time was found simultaneously fig 2b when a c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l was used ecell increased rapidly during the first 8 h and reached the maximum values of 51 mv and 85 mv respectively thereafter it dropped gradually due to the shortage of electron acceptors caused by the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex the ecell production at c0 of 2000 mg l was higher than that at c0 of 1000 mg l during the first 24 h but the trends became similar after that as the measured voltage varied in a low range i e 10 15 mv theorically the ecell output is defined as the potential difference between the cathode and anode potential eca ean in this study as the same anolyte was fed in each batch of experiments the improvement of ecell production was due to changes in cathode potential resulting from the change of initial ag concentration specifically the ean i e 0 29 v vs she was almost similar among different experiments due to the anolyte refreshement whereas eca varied depending on the initial ag concentration which was simply inferred from the theorical values calculated based on nernst equation the results are in line with another study which also reported that an increase in concentration of electron acceptors can enhance the cathodic potential which further increases the cell voltage output 21 however when c0 increased to 3000 mg l a quite different trend was found it was observed that ecell increased slowly and reached a peak i e 74 5 mv at the 18th hour lower and slower ecell production at c0 of 3000 mg l can be attributed to the impacts of cmi 7000s more bio fouling and inorganic precipitation formed at the membrane surface after each cycle leading to an increase of membrane internal resistance which constituted a part of the total internal resistance of the bes it was reported that the mfc with a fouled proton exchange membrane pem after 90 days of operation had a much lower power output as the total internal resistance increased by 20 the open circuit voltage reduced by 9 9 and the maximum output power decreased by 32 3 20 the ecell output at a c0 of 3000 mg l after 18 h however was better as compared to that at a c0 of 1000 2000 mg l the slow rate of ag nh3 2 consumption at a c0 of 3000 mg l led to the high remaining ag nh3 2 concentration in the catholyte this may help to retain high cathodic potential and accordingly a high ecell output was recorded 3 2 cod removal and columbic efficiency during the experiments with different initial ag nh3 2 concentrations in the cathode chamber the performance in biological conversion of organic waste to produce electricity in the anode chamber was also evaluated by considering the cod removal and columbic efficiency ce when c0 in the cathode chamber increased from 1000 to 2000 mg l cod removal efficiency in the anode chamber increased from 60 to 76 80 fig 3 a as the same initial organic loading i e cod0 1000 mg l was fed into the anode chamber for each batch of experiments the increase in cod removal efficiency may be due to the improvement in biological activities of the anodic microbial community as the bes reactor was run for a long duration i e 22 days of inoculation and 58 days of operation it was reported that diverse microbial communities of hydrolytic fermentative acidogenic and acetogenic microorganisms are normally found in bess when the systems were inoculated by mixed cultures and operated for long duration 22 24 thus the biological adaptability and growth rate may be improved which led to higher substrate consumption and an increase in cod removal accordingly studies also indicated that the combined activities of anodophilic and methanogenic bacteria in mfc systems inoculated by mixed cultures or real wastewater could provide high cod removal efficiency 23 25 26 however a slight decrease in cod removal to 75 20 was found when c0 of 3000 mg l was used a higher c0 used in the catholyte caused a higher concentration gradient of electrolyte between the two chambers the transport of cations through the cmi 70001s membrane especially the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions from the catholyte to the anolyte was thus accelerated as compared to that at c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l moreover the experiment at c0 of 3000 mg l was the last batch of the operation the increasing amount of ag accumulated in the anode chamber after several batches of the experiments was not advantageous to the anodic bacteria which may affect the biological activities the occurrence and accumulated amount of silver in the anode chamber was confirmed by quantitative analysis although cod as organic contaminants could be removed effectively in the anode chamber after 48 h the ce referred to as the fraction of electrons recovered as current versus that in the starting organic matter eq 7 was relatively limited specifically ce was 8 55 14 69 when c0 was 1000 3000 mg l respectively fig 3a a better ce obtained at higher c0 resulted from the increase in current yield i e 0 t i d t calculated based on the progression of ecell over 48 h shown in fig 2b limited ce values can be attributed to the competition of non exoelectrogenic species e g fermenters methanogens in the anodic bacterial community with exoelectrogen to consume substrate through different biological processes which did not involve electricity production in other words the ce was influenced by different electron losses which occurred during the oxidation of organic compounds in a mfc system operated with glucose as substrate researchers indicated the electron loss by establishing cod mass balance in which all of output components beside current ma such as ch4 gas ml biomass total cod soluble cod mg were measured and expressed as soluble cod mass mg using equivalent conversion i e 1 e eq 8 g cod 1 ml ch4 2 57 mg cod 24 27 as a result the fraction of cod mass for current production was just 52 7 and the remainder were for ch4 generation 12 9 biomass formation 20 8 unremoved cod 9 7 and unknown processes 3 9 24 this confirmed the considerable activities of non exoelectrogens which did not take part into bio electrochemical reactions for electron production in order to prevent the growth of methanogenic bacteria in the anodic microbial community it is suggested to add 2 bromoethane sulfonate to the anode chamber according to some mfc studies used for electricity production and wastewater treatment 25 28 3 3 polarization curves and power curves the effect of initial ag nh3 2 concentration on power generation can be also evaluated by characterizing the polarization curves and power curves polarization curves e1 e2 and e3 represented ecell as a function of current density while power curves p1 p2 and p3 described power density as a function of current density fig 3b in the first two experiments with a c0 of 1000 and 2000 mg l the voltage in e1 and e2 curves was almost linear with current it was reported that linear polarization curves are most often encountered in mfc systems and the internal resistance rint in which ohmic resistance rω is dominant can be determined simply from the slope of these curves 29 accordingly the rint determined as the slope of e1 and e2 was 32 83 and 26 24 respectively an increase of c0 from 1000 to 2000 mg l led to an increase in the ionic conductivity and a decrease in rint of electrolyte li et al 21 also reported that a high concentration of electron acceptors i e cr6 50 500 ppm increased the cathode potential measured by a saturated calomel electrode i e from 619 to 814 mv vs she and decreased the rint i e from 300 to 100 ω respectively however e3 obtained at c0 of 3000 mg l was distorted and nonlinear as compared to e1 and e2 this may be attributed to cathodic potential loss after membrane fouling xu et al 20 found that the fouled layer on the pem in the mfc system decreased the diffusion coefficients of cations through the membrane and heightened the cathodic potential loss thus the rint in the system at c0 of 3000 mg l could not be simply determined as the slope of e3 like for the case of e1 or e2 at a c0 of 1000 or 2000 mg l respectively basically the rint in bioelectrochemical systems includes other components than rω such as the activation charge transfer resistance rct and concentration resistance rdiff 30 31 in order to determine the contribution of different internal resistances to the overall impedance of fuel cells electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis analysis is suggested to be conducted the maximum power density pmax obtained in p1 p2 and p3 was also considered to investigate the performance of electricity production pmax increased from 2984 to 3618 mw m3 when c0 increased from 1000 to 2000 mg l but it slightly dropped to 3009 mw m3 when a c0 of 3000 mg l was used this result confirmed the effect of fouling as inorganic precipitation formed at the surface of cmi 7000s membrane which caused higher rint of membrane and lower performance in electricity production in the last cycle the results obtained in the current study were compared with that reported by wang et al 2 in which ag nh3 2 complex was also investigated table 1 higher performance in electricity production was found in the current study specifically at relatively similar conditions i e c0 of 1000 mg l pmax obtained in the current study and by wang et al 2 was 331 and 317 mw m2 respectively this was due to a decrease in internal resistance as a carbon brush anode and monopolar iem cmi 7000s were used in the current study while a carbon cloth anode and bipolar iem bpm i were employed in their work studies reported that carbon brush has high surface area and porosity for bacterial adhesion coupled with high electrical conductivity and efficient current collection 32 33 before assembling the carbon brush was pretreated section 2 1 according to previous studies this procedure could increase power generation by 25 due to an increase in specific area which facilitated bacteria adhesion with less contaminants that interfere with charge transfer from bacteria to electrode 32 34 harnisch et al 15 also indicated that monopolar iems i e nafion 117 yielded a linear polarization plot whereas the polarization curve of bipolar iems i e fumasep fbm was sigmoidal shaped and showed a considerably higher polarization than monopolar membranes this can be explained that in a bipolar iem based reactor the total ion flux is composed of the migration of electrolyte ions through aem and cem layers and the migration of h and oh ions generated from the water splitting reaction at the interface area between these layers on the other hand as compared to a study reported by ho et al 13 the current study showed a lower overall performance in their research free silver ions ag as agno3 was investigated as electron acceptors in the catholyte with the lower standard redox potential of ag nh3 2 complex i e ag nh3 2 ag0 e0 0 373 v vs she compared to ag ion i e ag ag0 e0 0 799 v vs she the ecell and pmax produced in this study was lower accordingly however high re i e 96 in both cases demonstrated that bes technology can be employed effectively to recover silver from either simple or complex solutions 3 4 effects of supporting electrolyte nano3 on power generation in this experiment ag nh3 2 complex containing 2000 mg ag l with 5 or 10 mm nano3 were investigated for power generation and silver removal as a result with a supplement of 5 mm nano3 the ecell production was improved slightly during the first 16 h thereafter it dropped similarly to that obtained without nano3 addition fig 4 a when the supplementary nano3 level increased to 10 mm the improvement in power generation was better as high ecell remained for a longer time i e 32 h before it became similar to the others the addition of nano3 improved the ionic conductivity of the catholyte and accordingly decreased the resistance of the electrolyte thus higher ecell could be produced the pmax also increased by 4 66 from 3618 to 3795 mw m3 when 10 mm nano3 was added to the catholyte fig 4b during experiments the reduction of ag nh3 2 complex in the catholyte was not affected by the addition of nano3 the na and no3 ions dissolved from a low amount of neutral salt nano3 5 or 10 mm may not compete significantly with ag nh3 2 complex 2000 mg l to accept the electrons in the catholyte results showed that the silver removal was over 99 in all of the cases similar results were found by other researchers when kno3 was used to improve the ionic conductivity of solution for recovery of copper cu and electricity production using a microbial fuel cell mfc 35 it was reported that cu removal efficiency 99 6 was not affected by the addition of kno3 0 200 mm within 11 h while the maximum power output was greatly improved from 96 2 to 143 6 mw m2 the improvement in power generation however was not significant when taking economic aspects into consideration the addition of nano3 or kno3 as a supporting electrolyte even though a low quantity was used conflicts with bes principles in which a chemical intensive process should be avoided on the other hand other ions from metallic salts beside silver ions normally exist in real wastewater or aqueous solutions which may also compete with ag ions to accept electrons and may affect the reduction rate the reduction of other metallic ions in the catholyte may occur simultaneously or sequentially depending on their redox potential thus further studies are recommended to be carried out with complex catholytes containing different metallic salts to investigate their effects on the bes performance 3 5 characterization of electrodeposits at cathode surface after 58 days of operation the graphite plate cathode was taken out of the reactor and air dried at room temperature the deposits on the cathode surface were scrapped and characterized by sem edx and xrd silver with dendritic structures was detected fig 5 a these dendrites have long trunks and short branches which look like a fishbone in contrast wang et al 2 found silver deposits in a compact layer structure at the cathode surface in their study while silver in the form of crystalline particles and dendritic structures were detected by ho et al 13 the difference in morphology of metallic silver deposits was due to the influence of operation time in each batch of experiments see table 1 and ecell output which is related to the intensity of electron flow for the reduction of silver ions in the catholyte liu et al 36 investigated the formation of silver deposits by time and the effects of current density on the silver morphologies in a two cell electrochemical reactor it was reported that with progression of the reaction i e 300 s a spherical pattern composed of small crystals was firstly formed and followed by the growth of small particles on the surface of the pattern these small particles thereafter developed into dendritic structures also the study found that a change in current density i e 25 2000 μa affected the reaction rate therefore this had an influence on the nucleation and growth of silver deposits i e from polyhedral aggregates to long thick rods followed by thick dendrites structures and mixture of dendrites and small cubic particles 36 the sem result was verified by edx fig 5b in which a sharp peak at an energy level of 2 98 kev was found indicating that the deposits were comprised of pure silver specifically the elemental characterization at point 1 in fig 5a had metallic silver of 98 16 wt the xrd pattern shown in fig 5c also confirmed the edx result the xrd patterns matched well with the standard patterns of silver i e jcpds card no 04 0783 all peaks can be readily indexed to face centered cubic silver where the diffraction peaks occur at 2θ values of 38 03 44 19 64 39 77 33 and 81 45 they also can be ascribed to the reflection of 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of the face centered cubic silver respectively no peaks from other phases were detected indicating the high purity of silver deposits 3 6 characterization of membrane surface when the cmi 7000s membrane was used as a separator in the bes reactor transport of positive charged ions through the functional groups i e sulphonic acid hso2oh attached on the membrane structure certainly occurs ag nh3 2 ions thus diffused from the catholyte to anolyte which caused silver loss and affected the overall silver recovery in order to verify the diffusion of ag nh3 2 ions the surface of cmi 7000s membrane was characterized by sem and edx see supplementary data the original membrane before assembling in the bes reactor is relatively smooth without any fouling after 58 days of operation some bright deposits were observed visually in some parts of the membrane toward the cathode side under sem the deposits was observed in bulk and had dendritic structures fig s2a the edx analysis confirmed that silver was the main element detected in deposits at the membrane surface fig s2b the elemental characterization at point 2 in fig s2a had metallic silver of 96 97 wt the majority of ag nh3 2 complex in the catholyte was believed to be reduced electrochemically to form silver deposits at the cathode surface however the occurrence of metallic silver at the cmi 7000s surface affected the performance when high initial ag nh3 2 concentration was used e g 3000 mg l the membrane fouling at the cathode side may cause negative impacts on further operation due to the effect on ion exchange capacity replacement of the cmi 7000s membrane is thus essential for long term operation which may increase the operational cost therefore an investigation on the frequency of membrane replacement over a long time is required 3 7 adsorption and accumulation of silver in the anodic biomass ag nh3 2 ions diffused through the membrane and may adsorb on the biomass of the anode chamber silver gradually accumulated over time as the experiments were carried out with different concentration levels of ag nh3 2 complex the anodic biomass including suspended solid and the biofilm attached to the carbon brush was collected after 58 days of bes operation the biomass digestion and analysis of ag content are described in section 2 4 the original anaerobic sludge obtained from the wastewater treatment plant before being used as inoculum in the bes reactor served as a control sample the results are shown in table 2 no ag was detected in the control sample in contrast a high concentration of ag was found in the biomass sample indicating the occurrence and accumulation of ag in the anode chamber the ag accumulated due to adsorption was calculated as 0 853 mg ag g biomass this leads to a concern about the toxic effects of ag on microorganisms in the anode chamber several studies investigated the inhibitory effects of silver ions on the growth and susceptibility of bacteria with focus on escherichia coli 37 38 with a ag concentration of 1 2 mg l inhibited growth of escherichia coli was observed however in the current study anaerobic sludge was used as an inoculum in a bes reactor mixed cultured inoculum was reported to possess high adaptability and resistance to stress 39 in addition patil et al 40 found that the wastewater derived electroactive microbial biofilms in a mfc system was completely unaffected by the presence of antimicrobial compounds including heavy metals i e ag of 0 02 1 0 mg l pb of 0 41 12 48 mg l hg2 of 0 83 1 33 mg l and other biocides i e antibiotics disinfectant they also indicated that a bes may possess a lower susceptibility to toxins than anaerobic digestion due to the high resistance of electroactive microbial biofilms nevertheless the analysis and measurements of biological parameters in the anode chamber such as volatile suspended solids vss to ss ratio which basically reflects biomass health 41 is suggested to be monitored periodically to recognize the toxicity effects of silver besides further studies on the inhibitory effects of silver on a bacterial communityn should be conducted especially with high exposure concentration and longer operation 4 conclusions this study successfully demostrated the recovery of ag from silver i diammine complex coupled with electricity production and wastewater treatment in bes reactors high ag removal efficiency 96 and cod removal 60 could be obtained at different initial ag concentrations 1000 3000 mg l while an encouraging columbic efficiency 8 55 14 69 was found power density of 300 mw m2 was also achieved indicating electricity was a simultaneous by product instead of electricity consumption pure metallic silver deposits with dendritic structures were found at the cathode surface under sem edx and xrd analysis which reaffirmed the successful application of bes technology however diffusion of positive charged ag nh3 2 ions through the cmi 7000s membrane was observed which accelerated membrane fouling and increased the internal resistance in the sem edx characterization of membrane surface ag deposits were detected while digested anodic biomass showed some adsorption and accumulation of silver 0 853 mg

14561,the aim of this work was to determine the optimal photoperoxi electrocoagulation ppec process experimental conditions for the treatment of a tannery industrial wastewater tiw the lab scale ppec reactor comprises a pair of iron flat plates resulting in a contact effective area of 58 5 cm2 the ppec reaction was conducted by electrochemical phenomenon associated to a fenton s reaction based on the h2o2 concentrations added the solar uv vis light was exposed as well as iron ion dissolved original plate deterioration resulting in a production of an efficient hydroxyl radical oh an optimising analysis using a response surface methodology was performed the optimum conditions of the ppec process were attained at a solution ph of 4 current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 6 g h2o2 l 1 and an electrolysis time of 120 min the effects on the removal of chromium and cod were evaluated suggesting satisfactory results for the ppec reaction based on the low calculated median lethal dose ld50 values from a lettuce seed based ecotoxicity test untreated tiw samples were completely lethal for doses with 100 except for samples taken after 90 and 120 min the ppec process could be applied as an efficient low cost alternative treatment for the removal of pollutants from tiw with a low environmental impact keywords tannery industrial wastewater tiw photoperoxi electrocoagulation experimental design ecotoxicity bioassays 1 introduction generally tannery procedures required a high amount of clean water resulting in around 10 100 m3 of wastewater per ton of rawhide processed depending mainly on the raw material and the finishing and production processes 1 2 the main stages of leather finishing such as degreasing chrome retanning re tanning and finishing generate effluents with toxic characteristics that are harmful to humans and the environment tannery industrial wastewaters tiw generally show the following in their composition acids bases chromium salts tannins solvents sulphides dyes and others 3 in addition variations in organic and physical chemical pollutant contents such as chemical oxygen demand cod 1 58 g l 1 total suspended solids tss 2 5 70 g l 1 total dissolved solids tds 22 67 g l 1 sulphides 0 025 3 3 g l 1 chrome iii 0 4 1 g l 1 and nitrate 0 08 3 8 g l 1 were verified 1 4 6 due to the high toxicity and complex characteristics environmental laws govern the disposal of tiw into water bodies 7 8 thus several methods and techniques have been investigated for tiw treatment such as biological oxidation processes 9 11 physical chemical coagulation 12 13 nanofiltration 14 15 membrane 16 electrochemical 17 21 advanced oxidation processes aops 22 24 and integrated combining sequential of electrocoagulation ec fenton and or photo fenton pf processes 8 25 the ability to simultaneously perform oxidative and electrochemical reactions within an electrolytic cell has become an attraction for the scientific community namely electro advanced oxidation processes eaops such as cathodic and anodic oxidation electro fenton ef photoelectro fenton pef and photoperoxi coagulation ppc 23 26 27 such eaops are based on hydroxyl radical formation oh as a complementary oxidant to ec physical phenomena leading to reactions between metallic hydroxides and hydrogen peroxide coming from dissolution of electrodes and injection in solution respectively 28 29 in the ppec process the oh radicals can be obtained in several ways in anodic oxidation water oxidation at the anode surface produces adsorbed oh radicals eq 1 30 31 electrogeneration of h2o2 occurs trough the two electron reduction of o2 at the cathode surface according to eq 2 32 electrogenerated h2o2 and the fe2 added from the outside and provided by the sacrificial iron anode form oh trough the fenton reaction eq 3 33 in addition the absorption of solar irradiation by h2o2 causes its photolysis in two hydroxyl radicals eq 4 34 1 h2o oh oh e 2 o2 g 2h 2e h2o2 3 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 4 h2o2 hv 2oh the ppef process can also be based in the photolysis of fe oh 2 the preferential fe3 species at ph close to 3 5 regenerating additional fe2 and producing more oh from the reaction eq 5 35

applied to the treatment of pharmaceuticals 29 36 38 winery wastewater 39 organic compounds 40 41 and solution dyes such as azo dyes 26 42 carmoisine edible dye 43 and dye direct yellow 4 44 the ppec process has advantages such as low sludge generation reduction of toxicity and degradation of pollutants from the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh converting intermediate products into co2 h2o and inorganic ions 41 42 45 in this study the aim was to determine the optimal photoperoxi electrocoagulation ppec process experimental conditions for the treatment of tannery industrial wastewater tiw thus an electrolytic cell was built based on iron plates and the ppec reaction was conducted by the h2o2 concentrations added as well as the iron ion dissolved original of the plate s deterioration an optimisation analysis using a response surface methodology was performed to examine the effect of ppec parameters such as ph of the solution current density h2o2 concentration and reaction time on the performance of chromium and cod removal in addition ecotoxicity bioassays using lettuce seeds as a bioindicator were performed for treated and untreated tiw and a cost analysis of the ppec process was undertaken 2 material and methods 2 1 samples solvents and reactants raw wastewater rw samples 200 l were collected in a tannery industry located in toledo paraná state brazil treated and untreated samples were stored and preserved according to the standard methodologies described by the american public health association 46 analytical grade chemical reagents were used milli q ultrapure and deionised water were used to prepare and dilute reagents as an oxidant hydrogen peroxide 35 w v 1 13 g cm 3 was used 2 2 analytical determinations treated and untreated samples were characterised based on the physicochemical parameters presented in table 1 in addition the samples were submitted to bioassays to evaluate the ecotoxicity effects on aquatic flora lettuce seeds lactuca sativa were used as bioindicators and the germination level was used to determine the acute toxicity according to methodology described in literature 47 before the analysis involving biological and chemical oxidations as well as bioassays hydrogen peroxide in excess was removed adding a small aliquot of catalase solution 2500 u mg 1 from bovine liver all samples were previously centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min powerspin mx 8624 except for the determination of total suspended solids tss total volatile solids tvs total fixed solids tfs and chemical oxygen demand cod a cod standard solution combicheck 20 merck with a concentration of 750 mg o2 l 1 was utilised to verify the quality of the photometric system as well as to identify the sample dependent effects on the cod results using a nylon membrane 0 45 μm the decanted residual sludge was separated of the supernatant liquid phase and dried at 105 c 2 3 photoperoxi electrocoagulation reactor the ppec reactions were carried out in a batch and closed system using a glass reactor with usable volume of 1 l in this work electrical current density ecd values ranging from 17 to 85 ma cm 2 were assessed in the experimental design the ppec reactor was built with an electrolytic cell containing two parallel iron plates 9 cm 7 5 cm 0 2 cm with a 4 cm gap between them resulting in a contact effective area of 58 5 cm2 allowing to treat an effective effluent volume of 0 8 l and perform all physical chemical analyses the ppec reactor was electrically connected to a dc power supply instrutemp model fa 1030 providing control ranges of 0 10 a and 0 30 v in monopolar mode two plates monopolar configurations can generate higher amounts of dissolved iron and generally have a lower operation cost and no significantly higher efficiency than bipolar configurations 48 from previous researches an increase on the distance between electrodes can lead to higher electrical energy consumption by applying relatively high voltages in order to keep a suitable electrical current density as reported in the literature the ecd is an important parameter of improvement on the ec process performance since it demands high ecd values 70 ma cm 2 1 3 the reactor was positioned in an exposed condition of external solar radiation in addition to apply stirring and monitor temperature and ph of the solution during the reactions the ppec reactor was equipped by a magnetic stirred system and ph meter temperature orp model hi 2221 respectively under the tested conditions in which the reactor was exposed to sun light the temperature varied only from 24 to 36 c with a standard deviation of 6 data not shown the ppec reactor schematic is illustrated in fig 1 2 4 photoperoxi electrocoagulation procedure first 0 8 l of tiw was added into the glass reactor under constant stirring 120 rpm and the ph of the solution was adjusted to the required values using small amounts of hcl 2 n or naoh 6 m solutions following this the dc power supply was connected to the electrodes cathode and anode and used to provide control of the current density required finally a small aliquot of h2o2 was added to the solution and the experiment was carried out under solar irradiation to start the reaction the mean solar uv irradiation measured and reported by the technological institute of meteorology of the brazilian paraná state nearest meteorological station from toledo city was approximately 1 13 mj m 2 h 1 during the same period and location during the experiments small aliquots of treated tiw were collected and then a catalase solution 2500 u mg 1 from bovine liver was added to eliminate the remaining h2o2 analytical determinations were subsequently conducted 2 5 central composite rotational design ccrd to evaluate the influence of the main ppec reactor operation parameters rop such as h2o2 concentration 3 15 g l 1 current density 17 1 85 5 ma cm 2 ph of the solution 2 5 8 5 and electrolysis time 30 150 namely q1 q4 respectively a response surface methodology rsm was used 48 thus the effects of four independent variables n 4 q1 4 on the response functions cod and cr removal were investigated realising a central composite rotational design ccrd with 28 experiments there were 16 factorial points 8 axial points and 4 replicates at the centre points the first step was to obtain the polynomial equations to describe the responses cod and cr removal as a function of the independent variables a second order polynomial equation was used see eq 7 the second step was to evaluate the quality of the fitted equation using variance analysis anova which is based on the f test 49 the third step used the desirability function approach which consisted of converting multiple responses into a single composite function this approach can help in the process optimisation or near optimal with multiple responses 50 51 the statistical analysis was carried out using statistica software 7 r a 0 i 1 k a i q i i 1 k a i i q i 2 i i j j a i j q i q j where r is the response variable qi and qj are independent variables a0 is the intercept term ai is a coefficient that determines the influence of parameter i in the response linear term and aij refers to the interaction effect furthermore a kinetic experiment using the best conditions of pors obtained at the analysis of msr was carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 tannery industrial wastewater characterisation the characterisation of tiw is presented in table 2 the measured parameters show high values of organic and inorganic pollutants such as tss tfs tvs cod and organic nitrogen probably due of process soaking and unhairing liming 3 as well as the colour and turbidity of dyes applied in the determination of skin fibres 52 heavy metals processing such as tanning and retanning 4 53 and toxicity from the homogeneous mixture of tiw 54 similar characterisation of different tiw has been reported by some authors 8 14 22 3 2 ccrd results to check the optimal conditions of the ppec process under solar irradiation a ccrd was applied using cod and cr removal as response functions in table 3 the removal results of the cod and cr for each experimental run are shown in summary removal efficiencies for cr from 10 to 96 and for cod from 29 to 76 were achieved using the statistica software such experimental data cr and cod removal percentages were analysed and fitted according to the proposed model eq 3 the models obtained after adjustment represent the interaction between the linear and quadratic coefficients of rops table 4 and were validated by variance analysis anova two way interaction with 95 statistical significance table 5 such models for the removal of cr and cod are linear functions of the ph of the solution q1 current density q2 h2o2 concentration q3 and electrolysis time q4 as well as quadratic functions of the interaction effects between these parameters as represented by eqs 8 and 9 8 c r 46 5 6 q 1 1 3 q 1 2 5 4 q 2 1 6 q 2 2 11 8 q 3 1 1 q 3 2 17 6 q 4 3 5 q 4 2 0 01 q 1 q 2 0 1 q 1 q 3 4 1 q 1 q 4 1 4 q 2 q 3 0 01 q 2 q 4 4 2 q 3 q 4 9 c o d 72 4 8 q 1 1 3 q 1 2 3 4 q 2 3 1 q 2 2 3 q 3 4 4 q 3 2 9 q 4 5 3 q 4 2 0 4 q 1 q 2 1 q 1 q 3 1 1 q 1 q 4 0 7 q 2 q 3 0 1 q 2 q 4 0 2 q 3 q 4 the negative linear parameters of q1 and q3 indicate better efficiency of the process in the slightly acid ph of the solution ph 4 and reduced the concentration of h2o2 added positive linear parameters q2 and q4 indicate the health of the ppec reactor at high current density and electrolysis time respectively fig 2 shows the influence of the ph of the solution current density h2o2 concentration and electrolysis time on the ppec reaction efficiencies or near optimal with multiple responses although similar results were obtained in all of the tested range 2 5 8 5 the ppec responses demonstrated that the best results were achieved in acid conditions ph 4 see fig 2a as described in other study 55 the h2o2 electro generation and free oxidant radical production can be influenced by different ph of the solution consequently resulting in different global efficiencies of ppec in addition the fenton reaction is more effective due the iron ion solubility in acid solution which favoured the first oxi reduction of catalyst as well as h2o2 decomposition and consequently generated more oh responsible for oxidant attack of organic compounds 55 however at near neutral ph of the solution or at a ph more than 5 h2o2 does not decomposed becoming a scavenger of protons forming h3o2 eq 10 which is electrophilic in the presence of fenton reactants thereby decreasing the ppec reaction rate 56 10 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 the applied current density is the driving force for the reduction of oxygen leading to the generation of h2o2 at the cathode as a consequence high values of current density are associated with high h2o2 concentrations and consequently increase the amount of oh formed 57 thus fig 2b shows that the best results can be obtained using up to 68 4 ma cm 1 and a small decrease was verified with higher values probably due to the oxygen discharge on the anode eq 11 and the release of h on the cathode eq 12 such species inhibit the formation of oh and decrease the ppec efficiency 58 59 11 2h 2 o 2 4 h o 2 4 e 12 2h 2e h 2 the h2o2 added and or formed limits the efficiency and completion of the ppec reaction 60 61 in addition the residual h2o2 can further the formation of by products and nitrogen compounds thereby increasing the toxic levels of treated effluent 22 62 63 thus fig 2c shows the ideal condition of the best ppec reaction performance to be 6 g h2o2 l 1 when using high concentrations more than 6 g h2o2 l 1 a decrease was verified probably due to the preferential reactions involving oh and h2o2 in excess forming the hydroperoxyl radicals o2h eq 13 on the other hand reactions with oh form h2o and o2 and not oh eq 14 consequently these do not attack and oxidise pollutants 38 63 64 13 h 2 o 2 o h o 2 h h 2 o 14 o 2 h o h h 2 o o 2 finally a longer electrolysis time 120 min results in an increased efficiency as can be observed in fig 2d this probably occurs due to the electro generation of h2o2 and the consequent oh formation as well as an increased exposure time of pollutants to the oxidising agent keeping fixed values of ph h2o2 concentration and electrolysis time at 4 6 g l 1 and 120 min respectively both response parameters cr concentration and cod measured at tested conditions of 34 2 and 68 4 ma cm 2 presented almost the same removal values within the standard deviation see table 3 for this reason the current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 was chosen in order to reduce the electric energy consumption and consequently the total cost of the eaop treatment an improvement of 10 20 on pollutant removal performance by eaops was earlier attained by other researches applying uv irradiation in effluents such as tannery reactive yellow 160 azo and sunset yellow fcf azo dyes as reported by isarain chavez et al bedolla guzman et al and moreira et al respectively in this work two experiments at a suitable eaop condition setting values of ph current density h2o2 concentration and electrolysis time at 4 34 2 ma cm 2 6 g l 1 and 120 min respectively were performed with and without uv irradiation revealing a relative better pollutant removal performance of around 17 when uv irradiation was applied data not shown 3 3 study of the ppec time effect another ppec experiment using ph of 4 current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 and 6 g h2o2 l 1 was performed taking aliquots at different ppec times 5 420 min profiles of cod colour turbidity tss tfs and tvs removal as well as h2o2 sludge cr ion and total dissolved iron tdi can be seen in fig 3 the maximum removal efficiency for all the parameters evaluated was achieved until a ppec time of 120 min resulting in reductions of 80 95 98 88 96 and 83 for cod colour turbidity tss tfs and tvs respectively fig 3a this high efficiency of ppec reaction can be due the electrochemical and fenton associated phenomena the iron ion dissolved in solution is originally of electrode dissolutions as a consequence of the electro activity which results in the deterioration of plates in the sequence the predominant fenton reaction is evidenced after the addition of h2o2 and exposure to solar uv vis light followed by a small h2o2 consumption and oh generation according to eqs 15 18 the pf reaction predominance can be confirmed due the oxidant attacks which decrease sludge contents as a consequence the chromium concentrations increase due to the disintegration of sludge cr agglutinated fig 3b similar results reported in literature 8 show that the fenton reactants attack the organic contents of tannery effluents and consequently discharge the chromium ions ligated onto the dissolved solids to solution 15 fe 2 aq h 2 o 2 fe 3 aq o h oh 16 fe 3 aq h 2 o 2 fe 2 aq o 2 h h a q 17 fe 3 aq o 2 fe 2 aq o 2 h a q 18 h 2 o 2 h v 2 oh however increases of h2o2 concentrations are evidenced after the first 15 min which can be explained due to the h2o2 electrogeneration from oxygen discharged on the anode and h dissolution on the cathode eq 19 58 59 in the sequence the electrochemical phenomena contributed to the chromium removal precipitation see fig 3b 19 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 3 4 ecotoxicity bioassays the same aliquots collected for the study of ppec time effect performed using a ph of 4 current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 and 6 g h2o2 l 1 were submitted to ecotoxicity bioassays thus toxicity assays were carried out to evaluate the effect of untreated and ppec treated tiw on the aquatic flora in order to determine the optimum ppec treatment time to get an effluent without

times 0 600 min are given in table 6 applying the trimmed spearman karber method 65 the estimated median lethal dose ld50 values and their confidence intervals ci were calculated in addition profiles of organic nitrogen ammonia nitrate and the percentage of estimated median lethal dose ld50 values as a function of treatment ppec time are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from table 6 increasing the treated tiw solution dose from 1 to 100 resulted in strong inhibition on the length of the radical ag and roots gi probably due to the presence of some soluble toxic compounds untreated tiw solutions were completely lethal for doses of 100 except for samples taken after 90 and 120 min which can be associated to the strong oxidations and consequently low concentrations of organic and ammonia nitrogen contents as can be seen in fig 4 however as a by product of organic and ammonia nitrogen oxidations nitrates are formed 189 mg l 1 resulting in an increase in the toxic effects after 180 min of reaction the nitrate concentrations decreased which can be explained by the reduction of organic and ammonia nitrogen in the reactional mean thus reducing the initial nitrate production rate while the electrochemical oxidation rate of nitrate continues to occur 22 66 in addition the initial strong oxidisation of organic pollutants suggest that recalcitrant intermediate compounds formed during the ppec reaction are possibly responsible for the worst results ld50 decreases at the first time of reaction 15 min probably due to toxic levels of chromium 12 mg cr l 1 according to the reports in

of treatment of tiw one of the great advantages of the ppec process is the high removal of turbidity cr a tds creating the possibility its application in letter tanning industries maximizing the decontamination of tiw and minimizing the negative effects caused by the discharge of these wastewaters in water bodies 4 conclusion tannery industrial wastewaters tiw present moderate colour solid

compounds nevertheless using the optimal ppec reaction experimental conditions obtained by the response surface methodology as follows ph of 4 current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 6 g h2o2 l 1 and electrolysis time of 120 min the highest pollutant removal performance of a tiw was verified this high ppec reaction efficiency can be assigned to the strong deterioration of iron plates providing the catalytic ion in solution which associated the h2o2 added as well as formed in situ by electrochemical hydrolysis producing high levels of oh as the main oxidant agent although under such conditions the tiw treated wastewaters have shown good reductions of organic matter the final characteristics are unsuitable for final discharge in terms of toxicity effects requiring a thorough study for the

sludge disaggregated respectively resulting in toxic effects however with a ppec reaction of 120 min lower toxicity values were achieved indicating a suitable time to stop the oxidation in addition

14561,the aim of this work was to determine the optimal photoperoxi electrocoagulation ppec process experimental conditions for the treatment of a tannery industrial wastewater tiw the lab scale ppec reactor comprises a pair of iron flat plates resulting in a contact effective area of 58 5 cm2 the ppec reaction was conducted by electrochemical phenomenon associated to a fenton s reaction based on the h2o2 concentrations added the solar uv vis light was exposed as well as iron ion dissolved original plate deterioration resulting in a production of an efficient hydroxyl radical oh an optimising analysis using a response surface methodology was performed the optimum conditions of the ppec process were attained at a solution ph of 4 current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 6 g h2o2 l 1 and an

values from a lettuce seed based ecotoxicity test untreated tiw samples were completely lethal for doses with 100 except for samples taken after 90 and 120 min the ppec process could be applied as an efficient low cost alternative treatment for the removal of pollutants from tiw with a low environmental impact keywords tannery industrial wastewater tiw photoperoxi electrocoagulation experimental design ecotoxicity bioassays 1 introduction generally tannery procedures required a high amount of clean water resulting in around 10 100 m3 of wastewater per ton of rawhide processed depending mainly on the raw material and the finishing and production processes 1 2 the main stages of leather finishing such as degreasing chrome retanning re tanning and finishing generate effluents with toxic characteristics that are harmful to humans and the environment tannery industrial wastewaters tiw generally show the following in their composition acids bases chromium salts tannins solvents sulphides dyes and others 3 in addition variations in organic and physical chemical pollutant contents such as chemical oxygen demand cod 1 58 g l 1 total suspended solids tss 2 5 70 g l 1 total

govern the disposal of tiw into water bodies 7 8 thus several methods and techniques have been investigated for tiw treatment such as biological oxidation processes 9 11 physical chemical coagulation

processes 8 25 the ability to simultaneously perform oxidative and electrochemical reactions within an electrolytic cell has become an attraction for the scientific community namely electro advanced oxidation processes eaops such as cathodic and anodic oxidation electro fenton ef photoelectro fenton pef and photoperoxi coagulation ppc 23 26 27 such eaops are based on hydroxyl radical formation oh as a complementary oxidant to ec physical phenomena leading to reactions between metallic hydroxides and hydrogen peroxide coming from dissolution of electrodes and injection in solution respectively 28 29 in the ppec process the oh radicals can be obtained in several ways in anodic oxidation water oxidation at the anode surface produces adsorbed oh radicals eq 1 30 31 electrogeneration of h2o2 occurs trough the two electron reduction of o2 at the cathode surface according to eq 2 32 electrogenerated h2o2 and the fe2 added from the outside and provided by the sacrificial iron anode form oh trough the fenton reaction eq 3 33 in addition the absorption of solar irradiation by h2o2 causes its photolysis in two hydroxyl radicals eq 4 34 1 h2o oh oh e 2 o2 g 2h 2e h2o2 3 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 4 h2o2 hv 2oh the ppef process can also be based in the photolysis of fe oh 2 the preferential fe3 species at ph close to 3 5 regenerating additional fe2 and producing more oh from the reaction eq 5 35

applied to the treatment of pharmaceuticals 29 36 38 winery wastewater 39 organic compounds 40 41 and solution dyes such as azo dyes 26 42 carmoisine edible dye 43 and dye direct yellow 4 44 the ppec process has advantages such as low sludge generation reduction of toxicity and degradation of pollutants from the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh converting intermediate products into co2 h2o and inorganic ions 41 42 45 in this study the aim was to determine the optimal photoperoxi electrocoagulation ppec process experimental conditions for the treatment of tannery industrial wastewater tiw thus an electrolytic cell was built based on iron plates and the ppec reaction was conducted by the h2o2 concentrations added as well as the iron ion dissolved original of the plate s deterioration an optimisation analysis using a response surface methodology was performed to examine the effect of ppec parameters such as ph of the solution current density h2o2 concentration and reaction time on the performance of chromium and cod removal in addition ecotoxicity bioassays using lettuce seeds as a bioindicator were performed for treated and untreated tiw and a cost analysis of the ppec process was undertaken 2 material and methods 2 1 samples solvents and reactants raw wastewater rw samples 200 l were collected in a tannery industry located in toledo paraná state brazil treated and untreated samples were stored and preserved according to the standard methodologies described by the american public health association 46 analytical grade chemical reagents were used milli q ultrapure and deionised water were used to prepare and dilute reagents as an oxidant hydrogen peroxide 35 w v 1 13 g cm 3 was used 2 2 analytical determinations treated and untreated samples were characterised based on the physicochemical parameters presented in table 1 in addition the samples were submitted to bioassays to evaluate the ecotoxicity effects on aquatic flora lettuce seeds lactuca sativa were used as bioindicators and the germination level was used to determine the acute toxicity according to methodology described in literature 47 before the analysis involving biological and chemical oxidations as well as bioassays hydrogen peroxide in excess was removed adding a small aliquot of catalase solution 2500 u mg 1 from bovine liver all samples were previously centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min powerspin mx 8624 except for the determination of total suspended solids tss total volatile solids tvs total fixed solids tfs and chemical oxygen demand cod a cod standard solution combicheck 20 merck with a concentration of 750 mg o2 l 1 was utilised to verify the quality of the photometric system as well as to identify the sample dependent effects on the cod results using a nylon membrane 0 45 μm the decanted residual sludge was separated of the supernatant liquid phase and dried at 105 c 2 3 photoperoxi electrocoagulation reactor the ppec reactions were carried out in a batch and closed system using a glass reactor with usable volume of 1 l in this work electrical current density ecd values ranging from 17 to 85 ma cm 2 were assessed in the experimental design the ppec reactor was built with an electrolytic cell containing two parallel iron plates 9 cm 7 5 cm 0 2 cm with a 4 cm gap between them resulting in a contact effective area of 58 5 cm2 allowing to treat an effective effluent volume of 0 8 l and perform all physical chemical analyses the ppec reactor was electrically connected to a dc power supply instrutemp model fa 1030 providing control ranges of 0 10 a and 0 30 v in monopolar mode two plates monopolar configurations can generate higher amounts of dissolved iron and generally have a lower operation cost and no significantly higher efficiency than bipolar configurations 48 from previous researches an increase on the distance between electrodes can lead to higher electrical energy consumption by applying relatively high voltages in order to keep a suitable electrical current density as reported in the literature the ecd is an important parameter of improvement on the ec process performance since it demands high ecd values 70 ma cm 2 1 3 the reactor was positioned in an exposed condition of external solar radiation in addition to apply stirring and monitor temperature and ph of the solution during the reactions the ppec reactor was equipped by a magnetic stirred system and ph meter temperature orp model hi 2221 respectively under the tested conditions in which the reactor was exposed to sun light the temperature varied only from 24 to 36 c with a standard deviation of 6 data not shown the ppec reactor schematic is illustrated in fig 1 2 4 photoperoxi electrocoagulation procedure first 0 8 l of tiw was added into the glass reactor under constant stirring 120 rpm and the ph of the solution was adjusted to the required values using small amounts of hcl 2 n or naoh 6 m solutions following this the dc power supply was connected to the electrodes cathode and anode and used to provide control of the current density required finally a small aliquot of h2o2 was added to the solution and the experiment was carried out under solar irradiation to start the reaction the mean solar uv irradiation measured and reported by the technological institute of meteorology of the brazilian paraná state nearest meteorological station from toledo city was approximately 1 13 mj m 2 h 1 during the same period and location during the experiments small aliquots of treated tiw were collected and then a catalase solution 2500 u mg 1 from bovine liver was added to eliminate the remaining h2o2 analytical determinations were subsequently conducted 2 5 central composite rotational design ccrd to evaluate the influence of the main ppec reactor operation parameters rop such as h2o2 concentration 3 15 g l 1 current density 17 1 85 5 ma cm 2 ph of the solution 2 5 8 5 and electrolysis time 30 150 namely q1 q4 respectively a response surface methodology rsm was used 48 thus the effects of four independent variables n 4 q1 4 on the response functions cod and cr removal were investigated realising a central composite rotational design ccrd with 28 experiments there were 16 factorial points 8 axial points and 4 replicates at the centre points the first step was to obtain the polynomial equations to describe the responses cod and cr removal as a function of the independent variables a second order polynomial equation was used see eq 7 the second step was to evaluate the quality of the fitted equation using variance analysis anova which is based on the f test 49 the third step used the desirability function approach which consisted of converting multiple responses into a single composite function this approach can help in the process optimisation or near optimal with multiple responses 50 51 the statistical analysis was carried out using statistica software 7 r a 0 i 1 k a i q i i 1 k a i i q i 2 i i j j a i j q i q j where r is the response variable qi and qj are independent variables a0 is the intercept term ai is a coefficient that determines the influence of parameter i in the response linear term and aij refers to the interaction effect furthermore a kinetic experiment using the best conditions of pors obtained at the analysis of msr was carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 tannery industrial wastewater characterisation the characterisation of tiw is presented in table 2 the measured parameters show high values of organic and inorganic pollutants such as tss tfs tvs cod and organic nitrogen probably due of process soaking and unhairing liming 3 as well as the colour and turbidity of dyes applied in the determination of skin fibres 52 heavy metals processing such as tanning and retanning 4 53 and toxicity from the homogeneous mixture of tiw 54 similar characterisation of different tiw has been reported by some authors 8 14 22 3 2 ccrd results to check the optimal conditions of the ppec process under solar irradiation a ccrd was applied using cod and cr removal as response functions in table 3 the removal results of the cod and cr for each experimental run are shown in summary removal efficiencies for cr from 10 to 96 and for cod from 29 to 76 were achieved using the statistica software such experimental data cr and cod removal percentages were analysed and fitted according to the proposed model eq 3 the models obtained after adjustment represent the interaction between the linear and quadratic coefficients of rops table 4 and were validated by variance analysis anova two way interaction with 95 statistical significance table 5 such models for the removal of cr and cod are linear functions of the ph of the solution q1 current density q2 h2o2 concentration q3 and electrolysis time q4 as well as quadratic functions of the interaction effects between these parameters as represented by eqs 8 and 9 8 c r 46 5 6 q 1 1 3 q 1 2 5 4 q 2 1 6 q 2 2

2 1 q 1 q 3 1 1 q 1 q 4 0 7 q 2 q 3 0 1 q 2 q 4 0 2 q 3 q 4 the negative linear parameters of q1 and q3 indicate better efficiency of the process in the slightly acid ph of the solution ph 4 and reduced the concentration of h2o2 added positive linear parameters q2 and q4 indicate the health of the ppec reactor at high current density and electrolysis time respectively fig 2 shows the influence of the ph of the solution current density h2o2 concentration and electrolysis time on the ppec reaction efficiencies or near optimal with multiple responses although similar results were obtained in all of the tested range 2 5 8 5 the ppec responses demonstrated that the best results were achieved in acid conditions ph 4 see fig 2a as described in other study 55 the h2o2 electro generation and free oxidant radical production can be influenced by different ph of the solution consequently resulting in different global efficiencies of ppec in addition the fenton reaction is more effective due the iron ion solubility in acid solution which favoured the first oxi reduction of catalyst as well as h2o2 decomposition and consequently generated more oh responsible for oxidant attack of organic compounds 55 however at near neutral ph of the solution or at a ph more than 5 h2o2 does not decomposed becoming a scavenger of protons forming h3o2 eq 10 which is electrophilic in the presence of fenton reactants thereby decreasing the ppec reaction rate 56 10 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 the applied current density is the driving force for the reduction of oxygen leading to the generation of h2o2 at the cathode as a consequence high values of current density are associated with high h2o2 concentrations and consequently increase the amount of oh formed 57 thus fig 2b shows that the best results can be obtained using up to 68 4 ma cm 1 and a small decrease was verified with higher values probably due to the oxygen discharge on the anode eq 11 and the release of h on the cathode eq 12 such species inhibit the formation of oh and decrease the ppec efficiency 58 59 11 2h 2 o 2 4 h o 2 4 e 12 2h 2e h 2 the h2o2 added and or formed limits the efficiency and completion of the ppec reaction 60 61 in addition the residual h2o2 can further the formation of by products and nitrogen compounds thereby increasing the toxic levels of treated effluent 22 62 63 thus fig 2c shows the ideal condition of the best ppec reaction performance to be 6 g h2o2 l 1 when using high concentrations more than 6 g h2o2 l 1 a decrease was verified probably due to the preferential reactions involving oh and h2o2 in excess forming the hydroperoxyl radicals o2h eq 13 on the other hand reactions with oh form h2o and o2 and not oh eq 14 consequently these do not attack and oxidise pollutants 38 63 64 13 h 2 o 2 o h o 2 h h 2 o 14 o 2 h o h h 2 o o 2 finally a longer electrolysis time 120 min results in an increased efficiency as can be observed in fig 2d this probably occurs due to the electro generation of h2o2 and the consequent oh formation as well as an increased exposure time of pollutants to the oxidising agent keeping fixed values of ph h2o2 concentration and electrolysis time at 4 6 g l 1 and 120 min respectively both response parameters cr concentration and cod measured at tested conditions of 34 2 and 68 4 ma cm 2 presented almost the same removal values within the standard deviation see table 3 for this reason the current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 was chosen in order to reduce the electric energy consumption and consequently the total cost of the eaop treatment an improvement of 10 20 on pollutant removal performance by eaops was earlier attained by other researches applying uv irradiation in effluents such as tannery reactive yellow 160 azo and sunset yellow fcf azo dyes as reported by isarain chavez et al bedolla guzman et al and moreira et al respectively in this work two experiments at a suitable eaop condition setting values of ph current density h2o2 concentration and electrolysis time at 4 34 2 ma cm 2 6 g l 1 and 120 min respectively were performed with and without uv irradiation revealing a relative better pollutant removal performance of around 17 when uv irradiation was applied data not shown 3 3 study of the ppec time effect another ppec experiment using ph of 4 current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 and 6 g h2o2 l 1 was performed taking aliquots at different ppec times 5 420 min profiles of cod colour turbidity tss tfs and tvs removal as well as h2o2 sludge cr ion and total dissolved iron tdi can be seen in fig 3 the maximum removal efficiency for all the parameters evaluated was achieved until a ppec time of 120 min resulting in reductions of 80 95 98 88 96 and 83 for cod colour turbidity tss tfs and tvs respectively fig 3a this high efficiency of ppec reaction can be due the electrochemical and fenton associated phenomena the iron ion dissolved in solution is originally of electrode dissolutions as a consequence of the electro activity which results in the deterioration of plates in the sequence the predominant fenton reaction is evidenced after the addition of h2o2 and exposure to solar uv vis light followed by a small h2o2 consumption and oh generation according to eqs 15 18 the pf reaction predominance can be confirmed due the oxidant attacks which decrease sludge contents as a consequence the chromium concentrations increase due to the disintegration of sludge cr agglutinated fig 3b similar results reported in literature 8 show that the fenton reactants attack the organic contents of tannery effluents and consequently discharge the chromium ions ligated onto the dissolved solids to solution 15 fe 2 aq h 2 o 2 fe 3 aq o h oh 16 fe 3 aq h 2 o 2 fe 2 aq o 2 h h a q 17 fe 3 aq o 2 fe 2 aq o 2 h a q 18 h 2 o 2 h v 2 oh however increases of h2o2 concentrations are evidenced after the first 15 min which can be explained due to the h2o2 electrogeneration from oxygen discharged on the anode and h dissolution on the cathode eq 19 58 59 in the sequence the electrochemical phenomena contributed to the chromium removal precipitation see fig 3b 19 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 3 4 ecotoxicity bioassays the same aliquots collected for the study of ppec time effect performed using a ph of 4 current density of 34 2 ma cm 2 and 6 g h2o2 l 1 were submitted to ecotoxicity bioassays thus toxicity assays were carried out to evaluate the effect of untreated and ppec treated tiw on the aquatic flora in order to determine the optimum ppec treatment time to get an effluent without contaminant risk to the aquatic environment a set of results for the lettuce seeds bioassays applied on pure and diluted samples of treated and untreated tiw solutions for different ppec treatment times 0 600 min are given in table 6 applying the trimmed spearman karber method 65 the estimated median lethal dose ld50 values and their confidence intervals ci were calculated in addition profiles of organic nitrogen ammonia nitrate and the percentage of estimated median lethal dose ld50 values as a function of treatment ppec time are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from table 6 increasing the treated tiw solution dose from 1 to 100 resulted in strong inhibition on the length of the radical ag and roots gi probably due to the presence of some soluble toxic compounds untreated tiw solutions were completely lethal for doses of 100 except for samples taken after 90 and 120 min which can be associated to the strong oxidations and consequently low concentrations of organic and ammonia nitrogen contents as can be seen in fig 4 however as a by product of organic and ammonia nitrogen oxidations nitrates are formed 189 mg l 1 resulting in an increase in the toxic effects after 180 min of reaction the nitrate concentrations decreased which can be explained by the reduction of organic and ammonia nitrogen in the reactional mean thus reducing the initial nitrate production rate while the electrochemical oxidation rate of nitrate continues to occur 22 66 in addition the initial strong oxidisation of organic pollutants suggest that recalcitrant intermediate compounds formed during the ppec reaction are possibly responsible for the worst results ld50 decreases at the first time of reaction 15 min probably due to toxic levels of chromium 12 mg cr l 1 according to the reports in section 3 3 however the best ld50 values 40 were achieved at a ppec reaction time of 120 min 3 5 cost analysis in this research the costs of management of the generated sludge volume and its disposal

14562,the catalytic ozonation using mesoporous sba 15 supported copper catalyst cu sba 15 was employed for the degradation of reactive orange 4 ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution the catalyst was synthesized and characterized using bet sem tem and edx techniques the characteristic results revealed highly ordered mesoporous structure uniform pore sizes parallel arranged channels and large surface area for the catalyst the effects of copper loading on sba 15 initial solution ph and ozone dose on the degradation of ro4 dye were studied the complete colour removal from ro4 azo dye aqueous solution was obtained after 21 min of ozonation the maximum toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained at optimum operational conditions of 2 copper loadings initial solution ph 9 and ozone dose of 5 g m3 after 60 min reaction time the degradation pathway of catalytic ozonation reaction was studied by adding t butanol as radical scavenger and it was found that the presence of radical scavenger had no effect on colour removal efficiency suggesting direct ozone molecular type mechanism however toc removal efficiency was significantly reduced with the addition of t butanol thereby indicating a hydroxyl radical based mechanism the catalytic ozonation reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics with respect to ro4 dye concentration the reusability study for the catalyst suggested a negligible loss in the degradation efficiency after five runs of experiments the stability of the catalyst was studied by performing leaching experiments which suggested that the catalyst has the potential to be utilized for the degradation of aqueous dye solution keywords catalytic ozonation cu sba 15 mesoporous catalyst reactive orange 4 azo dye degradation mechanism 1 introduction dyes have aromatic molecular structures which make them chemically stable non biodegradable toxic and carcinogenic in nature many industries such as textile pulp and paper paint food and plastics utilize dyes to colour their finished products 1 3 around 10 15 of total utilized dyes are discharged into water bodies through industrial effluents due to their low fixation energy on the fiber 4 their release into water bodies poses serious threat to aquatic life and constitutes a potential human health hazard 5 therefore dyes must be removed from the effluent before discharging it into the environment among all dyes azo dyes containing one or more than one azo groups nn are most versatile class of dyes and represent more than half of the total dyes produced annually 6 azo dyes are generally resistant to aerobic biodegradation 7 anaerobic treatment can only remove the colour of the effluent by converting the azo bond to aromatic amines but these amines are carcinogenic and more dangerous than the azo dyes 8 various conventional methods such as adsorption coagulation flocculation filtration and biological treatments are available for the degradation of azo dyes in aqueous solution however these conventional methods have limitations like lower degradation efficiency sludge disposal large space requirement and high residence time 9 11 hence efficient treatment techniques are needed to improve degradation of azo dyes present in the effluent ozone based advanced oxidation processes have been emerged as effective treatment method for industrial effluent containing wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds 12 however ozonation alone is not often adequate in completely removing organic pollutants as some intermediates like organic acids of small molecular weight formed during ozonation are relatively refractory to ozone due to its selective nature 13 14 therefore it is combined with catalyst called as catalytic ozonation to overcome shortcomings of sole ozonation the catalysts prepared by impregnating metal ions metal oxides or metals metal oxides on supports have been used in catalytic ozonation processes 15 the materials such as alumina activated carbon silica titania and ceria have been widely explored as catalysts or catalyst supports in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 16 20 nowadays mesoporous materials have been emerged as very effective catalysts because of their unique physical properties such as large surface area uniform pore structure and high thermal stability 21 22 the silica based mesoporous materials like sba 15 mcm 41 and mcm 48 are commonly utilized in catalytic reactions the mesoporous materials are modified with active sites like cerium iron lanthanum vanadium platinum and palladium metals species to enhance their catalytic activity 23 25 the catalytic activities of mesoporous material sba 15 supported cerium ce sba 15 and iron fe sba 15 catalysts were studied for the degradation of dimethyl phthalate pollutant 26 27 the copper oxide supported on sba 15 has also been reported as catalyst for the degradation of mesoxalic and oxalic acids 28 similarly other mesoporous materials such as mcm 41 and mcm 48 have been used as catalyst supports for the mineralization of p chlorobenzoic acid and bromide containing water respectively 29 30 it has been recently reported in the literature that mesoporous materials are employed in only 15 of total catalytic ozonation studies published in the last twelve years 2005 12 in spite of their unique physical properties 31 out of those studies as per authors best knowledge only two catalytic ozonation studies for the degradation of dye solution involving mesoporous materials are available 32 33 additionally the degradation mechanism and economics of catalytic ozonation studies involving mesoporous materials are unclear and need to be studied in detail this paper therefore highlights the use of mesoporous material as catalyst support in catalytic ozonation for degradation of organic pollutants the paper aims to develop and use sba 15 mesoporous material supported copper catalyst cu sba 15 in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of reactive orange 4 ro4 azo dye solution the degradation efficiency of ro4 azo dye solution was expressed in terms of colour removal efficiency cre and total organic carbon toc removal efficiency the process parameters such as copper loading on sba 15 initial solution ph and ozone dose have been optimized to achieve highest degradation efficiency the paper is also aimed to explore degradation mechanism reaction kinetics and economics for catalytic ozonation of ro4 azo dye solution involving cu sba 15 catalyst 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials poly ethylene glycol block poly propylene glycol block poly ethylene glycol p123 polymer was purchased from aldrich chemical company missouri usa tetraethyl orthosilicate teos was obtained from tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan cupric nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o was procured from thomas baker pvt ltd mumbai india whereas t butanol tba was obtained from sisco research laboratories pvt ltd mumbai india all chemicals were of analytical grade a commercially available ro4 dye was purchased from a local market and used without any further purification 2 2 preparation of sba 15 and cu sba 15 the mesoporous material sba 15 was synthesized using triblock copolymer p123 as a templating agent and teos as a silica source 28 initially 10 0 g of p123 was dispersed into 300 g of 2 m hcl solution and 75 g of distilled water at 40 c until total dissolution the silica source teos 20 8 g was added into the solution and the mixture was continuously stirred at 40 c for 24 h the mixture is then aged for 54 h at 80 c the white powder recovered by filtration was washed with ethanol and water before drying at 80 c overnight calcination of the obtained sample was carried out at 550 c for 6 h by slowly increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 1 2 c min from a room temperature to 550 c the mesoporous catalyst cu sba 15 was prepared by impregnating copper metal in sba 15 using incipient wetness impregnation method 26 in this method appropriate amount of cupric nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o as copper precursor was dissolved in 50 ml of deionised water and 2 5 g of sba 15 was added to this solution the mixture is stirred under ultrasonic vibrator for 90 min it is then dried in oven at 80 c overnight it is finally calcined at 550 c for 3 h to obtain cu sba 15 catalyst 2 3 catalytic ozonation procedure the experimental set up for catalytic ozonation process is shown in fig 1 the catalytic ozonation was carried out in a stainless steel made 22 l volume reactor of height 70 cm and diameter 20 cm the oxygen concentrator based on pressure swing adsorption technique was used to generate more than 95 pure oxygen the generated oxygen with a constant flow rate of 5 l min was fed to ozone generator oz air ism 10 series in which ozone was generated using corona discharge method the generated ozone was supplied to the reactor through a recirculation loop consisting of recirculation pump venturi injector and the static mixer to achieve effective mixing with dye solution the effluent was drawn from the bottom of the reactor using the recirculation pump and the ozone was injected through the venturi injector located at the outlet of the pump venturi injector which works on a principle of converging diverging pathways was used to facilitate effective inception of ozone into liquid effluent static mixer located after the venturi injector was utilized for effective mixing of ozone and the effluent the mixture of ozone and the effluent was diffused back into the reactor using a venturi diffuser the ozone concentration at the reactor inlet was measured in terms of ozone dose and was kept constant throughout the experiment all experiments were carried out at room temperature with a fixed amount of catalyst 2 g volume 10 l and initial ro4 azo dye concentration of 100 mg l in aqueous solution the ozone gas concentration was measured continuously at the reactor outlet using an ozone analyzer bmt 964 germany the quantity of ozone consumed in the ozonation was determined using the values of ozone dose measured at inlet and outlet of the reactor an ozone destruction unit was used to convert ozone to oxygen in the outgoing gases leaving from the reactor effluent samples were withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor at regular time intervals for analysis 2 4 analytical procedures effluent samples were analyzed for the ro4 azo dye concentration using the uv spectrophotometer spectro uv vis double beam 3500 india at a wavelength of 489 nm and the linear relationship between the absorbance and the concentration of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution was obtained the colour removal efficiency for ro4 azo dye was calculated using the following equation 1 c o l o u r r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct are the initial and final after treatment for a time t ro4 azo dye concentrations in the aqueous solution mg l respectively the concentration of toc was measured using toc analyzer analytic jena multi n c 2100 the operation of which is based on carbon dioxide infrared adsorption experiments were repeated to check its reproducibility and error was found to be 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the scanning electronic microscopy sem images for catalyst support sba 15 and catalyst cu sba 15 are presented in fig 2 the sem images revealed many rod like domains with relatively uniform sizes which are aggregated into wheat like structures the images also depicted a similar morphology for particles indicating high thermal stability 34 transmission electron microscopy tem measurements have been performed to understand pore architecture of sba 15 the tem images of sba 15 and cu sba 15 are demonstrated in fig 3 the micrographs revealed well ordered 2d hexagonal arrays with uniform pore sizes and parallel arranged channels 34 35 the surface area pore diameter and volume of sba 15 catalyst support were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for sba 15 support are presented in fig 4 according to iupac classification the isotherm curve of type iv with h1 type hysteresis loop indicated typical mesoporous material and its characteristic of capillary condensation within uniform mesopores showed a good quality of sba 15 36 the textural characteristics of the catalyst are presented in table 1 it was found that surface area of sba 15 was decreased with the impregnation of copper metal the surface area of bare sba 15 was 538 26 m2 g which was decreased to 432 33 m2 g for 2 cu loading and further decreased to 292 73 m2 g when copper loadings was 8 this decrease in surface area was due to deposition of copper metal on sba 15 support similar trend was observed in case of pore volume which was decreased from 0 81 cm3 g for bare sba 15 to 0 75 cm3 g for 2 cu sba 15 and 0 51 cm3 g for 8 cu sba 15 the decrease in surface area and pore volume indicated well dispersion of copper species on sba 15 however pore diameter was increased with copper loadings suggesting slighter wider pore distribution but still they were well within the mesoporous range of 5 8 nm the edx analysis to represent the elemental composition of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst has been carried in this analysis a beam of high state energy electrons are bombarded on the sample due to the bombardment electrons are ejected from the atoms of the sample the vacancies created by ejection of electrons are filled up by higher state electrons and x ray spectrums are emitted from the sample to balance energy difference between two electrons states the number and energy of these x ray spectrums emitted by the sample are determined by x ray detector through voltage measurement the measured voltage is used for data evaluation to analyze elemental composition of the catalyst the edx spectrum for 2 cu sba 15 catalyst is shown in fig 5 the energy peaks in edx analysis showed the presence of silicon si copper cu and oxygen whereas no other major element was detected the edx quantification results for 2 cu sba 15 catalyst are presented in table 2 3 2 treatment of aqueous solution containing ro4 azo dye by oxygenation ozonation and catalytic ozonation the experiments were performed for the treatment of aqueous solution containing ro4 azo dye with oxygen and ozone as oxidants and the results in terms of colour and toc removal efficiencies are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively it can be noticed from fig 6a that no significant colour removal efficiency 2 9 was obtained on oxidation with oxygen however 100 colour removal efficiency was obtained after 21 min of oxidation with ozone further ozonation in presence of cu sba 15 catalyst also resulted in 100 colour removal efficiency after 21 min but the initial rate of colour removal efficiency was higher for catalytic ozonation the toc removal efficiencies for oxygenation ozonation and catalytic ozonation using cu sba 15 catalyst of aqueous solution containing reactive orange 4 ro4 dye are shown in fig 6b it can be noticed that a toc removal efficiency of 3 5 was obtained after 60 min of oxidation with oxygen the toc removal efficiency of 40 and 70 were obtained with sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation after 60 min of oxidation compared to 100 colour removal efficiency obtained after 21 min of oxidation this might be due to the selective nature of ozone in attacking colour imparting chromophore groups compared to auxochrome groups of the dye since the catalytic ozonation resulted in higher toc removal efficiency compared to ozonation it was decided to perform oxidation experiments by ozone in presence of cu sba 15 catalyst 3 3 optimization of catalytic ozonation parameters the catalytic ozonation experiments were performed using cu sba 15 catalyst the effect of copper loading initial solution ph and ozone dose on the colour and toc removal efficiencies was studied to obtain an optimum value of these parameters 3 3 1 effect of copper loading experiments were performed to study the effect of copper loading on colour and toc removal efficiencies by varying the copper loading from 1 wt to 8 wt and the results are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively it can be observed from fig 7a that there is no effect of copper loading on colour removal efficiency as complete colour removal was obtained after 21 min of ozonation and catalytic ozonation with different copper loadings 1 2 4 and 8 wt this might be due to the high reactivity of ozone towards chromophore groups which impart colour to the dye an enhancement in toc removal efficiency from 40 to 65 after 1 h of reaction was observed for catalytic ozonation 1 wt cu compared to ozonation alone further the toc removal efficiency was found to increase from 65 to 71 with an increase in the cu loading from 1 wt to 2 wt it was due to the fact that an increase in copper loading resulted in an increase in the active surface sites of the catalyst thus enhancing the toc removal efficiency however further increase in copper loading from 2 wt to 8 wt resulted in a decrease in toc removal efficiency this was mainly due to steric hinderance effect in which high copper loading could have blocked the pores of sba 15 thus reducing its active surface area 27 37 therefore 2 wt copper loading was found to be optimum and was used in further experiments 3 3 2 effect of initial solution ph the initial solution ph plays a vital role in enhancing the efficiency of catalytic ozonation process as variation in initial solution ph can alter the ozone decomposition rate the surface properties of catalyst and generation of hydroxyl radicals 38 the effect of initial solution ph on colour and toc removal efficiencies for aqueous solution containing ro4 azo dye was studied by performing experiments with different initial solution ph 3 10 and the results are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively it can be noticed from fig 8a that there is no effect of initial solution ph on colour removal efficiency and complete decolourization was achieved after 21 min of ozonation however the variation in initial solution ph had a significant effect on toc removal efficiency fig 8b the toc removal efficiency was increased from 48 4 to 86 with an increase in initial solution ph from 3 to 9 this could be due to the increase in decomposition rate of ozone leading to generation of more hydroxyl radicals with an increase in initial solution ph the decomposition of ozone occurs by following reactions 38 2 o3 oh o2 ho2 3 o3 ho2 2o2 oh these hydroxyl radicals due to their higher oxidation potential 2 8 ev than ozone 2 07 ev react with auxochrome group of dye molecule and intermediates formed during ozonation in a non selective manner however a further increase in initial solution ph from 9 to 10 decreased toc removal efficiency the decrease in toc removal efficiency could be due to excessive generation of hydroxyl radicals which react with each other and with hydroperoxyl ho2 free radical generated during ozone decomposition before getting terminated 29 the termination reactions are as follows 4 ho2 oh h2o o2 5 oh oh h2o2 thus the initial solution ph of 9 was found to be optimum ph and further catalytic ozonation experiments were performed at an initial solution ph 9 in addition to solution ph the presence of the catalyst also initiates decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals the hydroxyl groups developed on the surface of the metal oxide catalyst when it comes in contact with water are responsible for decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals 39 40 the charge properties of the surface hydroxyl groups depend on ph of the solution and phpzc of the catalyst the surface of the catalyst becomes protonated solution ph phpzc eq 6 or deprotonated solution ph phpzc eq 7 depending on the solution ph 41 6 m oh h m oh2 ph phpzc 7 m oh oh m o h2o ph phpzc in the present study the phpzc of the cu sba 15 catalyst was determined by salt addition method and found to be 6 7 the optimum initial solution ph 9 was more than phpzc of the catalyst due to which the surface of the catalyst became negatively charged the ozone molecule has two extreme forms of resonance structures which makes it act as dipole with both electrophilic and nucleophilic agents 38 the ozone adsorbs on the surface of the catalyst and decomposes immediately to generate hydroxyl radicals 13 42 3 3 3 effect of ozone dose experiments were performed to study the effect of ozone dose on catalytic ozonation of aqueous solution containing ro4 dye by varying the ozone dose from 1 g m3 to 7 5 g m3 and the results in terms of colour and toc removal efficiencies are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively the ozone dose has been defined as gram of ozone generated per m3 of oxygen fed to the ozone generator it can be noticed that an increase in ozone dose enhanced both colour and toc removal efficiencies the colour removal efficiency was increased from 38 5 to 100 with an increase in at ozone dose from 1 g m3 to 5 g m3 after 21 min fig 9a similar trend was observed for toc removal efficiency which was increased from 19 to 86 after 60 min when ozone dose was increased from 1 g m3 to 5 g m3 the increase in degradation efficiency is due to the fact that with an increase in ozone dose the driving force for the transfer of ozone to the aqueous dye solution increases subsequently increasing the concentration of ozone in the aqueous solution resulting in an enhanced degradation of the dye a further increase in ozone dose from 5 g m3 to 7 5 g m3 did not enhance the toc removal significantly as the toc removal efficiency increased only by 1 7 after 60 min fig 9b this could be due to the saturation of aqueous dye solution with ozone limiting its transfer to aqueous solution 43 45 thus an ozone dose of 5 g m3 was considered to be optimum as a higher inlet ozone dose leads to increase in ozone generation cost a toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained after 60 min of ozonation at the optimum value of the parameters initial solution ph 9 metal loading 2 ozone dose 5 g m3 3 4 degradation pathway for catalytic ozonation of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution the catalytic ozonation for the degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution occurs either through direct mechanism ozone molecule directly reacting with dye or indirect mechanism generation of hydroxyl radical which reacts with dye the degradation mechanism was identified by adding radical scavenger t butanol into the catalytic ozonation reaction the radical scavenger t butanol has higher reaction rate constant 6 108 m 1 s 1 with hydroxyl radicals compared with ozone 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 and has potential to terminate radical chain reactions by generating inert intermediates 27 the effect of addition of radical scavenger t butanol on colour and toc removal efficiencies is shown in fig 10 a and b respectively it can be noticed that colour removal efficiency was not changed with the addition of radical scavenger t butanol which indicated that the direct ozone molecular mechanism was predominant to hydroxyl radical mechanism therefore it can be stated that colour removal of the ro4 azo dye solution was mainly governed by direct ozone molecular mechanism it can be noticed from fig 10b that the toc removal efficiency decreased with an addition of radical scavenger the toc removal efficiency decreased from 86 to 30 and 16 7 after 60 min of ozonation with the addition of 1 mg l and 5 mg l of t butanol respectively this clearly indicated that t butanol consumed the hydroxyl radicals generated in the aqueous solution and it can be concluded that toc removal for ro4 azo dye aqueous solution occurred via hydroxyl radical mechanism 3 5 reaction kinetics the catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution occurred through direct pathway reaction of ozone molecule with dye for colour removal and through indirect pathway reaction of generated hydroxyl radical with dye for toc removal thus degradation of ro4 azo dye can be represented by following two reactions 8 r o 4 a z o d y e o 3 k o 3 o x i d a t i o n p r o d u c t s 9 r o 4 a z o d y e o h k o h o x i d a t i o n p r o d u c t s the rate expression for the degradation of ro4 dye can be written as 10 d r o 4 d t k o 3 r o 4 o 3 k o h r o 4 o h where k o 3 and k oh are reaction rate constants for reactions presented by eqs 8 and 9 respectively rearranging eq 10 11 d r o 4 d t k o 3 o 3 k o h o h r o 4 since concentration of ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous solution is assumed constant the term k o 3 o 3 k o h o h becomes constant thus 12 d r o 4 d t k r o 4 where k is apparent rate constant and equals to k o 3 o 3 k o h o h integrating eq 12 results 13 ln r o 4 r o 4 i k t where r o 4 i and r o 4 are initial concentration and concentration at time t of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution the degradation kinetics of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution was studied by plotting ln ro 4 ro 4 i versus ozonation time and the results are shown in fig 11 the linear relationship plot with high correlation coefficient r2 0 988 indicated pseudo first order kinetics with respect to ro4 azo dye concentration in the aqueous solution and the apparent rate constant k was found to be 0 031 min 1 the variation of apparent rate constant k with initial solution ph and ozone dose was studied and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be noticed from fig 12a that there is an increase in apparent rate constant k with an increase in initial solution ph from 3 to 9 further increase in initial solution ph from 9 to 10 resulted in reduction in apparent rate constant k due to excessive generation and termination of free radicals during ozone decomposition it can be noticed from fig 12b that the apparent rate constant increased with an increase in ozone dose from 1 g m3 to 5 g m3 a further increase in ozone dose from 5 g m3 to 7 5 g m3 did not enhance apparent rate constant significantly 3 6 reusability of the catalyst the reusability of the catalyst is an important factor in evaluating its potential for long term use in catalytic ozonation the reusability of the 2 cu sba 15 catalyst was explored by performing the catalytic ozonation experiments using the spent catalyst and the results are shown in fig 13 it can be noticed that there is no significant reduction in colour and toc removal efficiencies after five runs of experiments at same experimental conditions suggesting negligible loss in activity of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst 3 7 leaching test the leaching test was performed to study the stability of cu sba 15 catalyst and it was found that 0 065 mg l of copper was leached in the aqueous dye solution after 60 min of catalytic ozonation the concentration of leached copper in the aqueous solution was found to be within discharge standards prescribed by central pollution control board india 3 8 cost estimation for catalytic ozonation the aops involving ozone is considered as expensive process due to high ozone generation cost the costs involved in catalytic ozonation are the cost of the catalyst and operational cost which mainly includes cost of electricity for ozone generation the electrical energy consumed per order of pollutant removal ee o kw h m 3 order 1 was computed as 46 14 e e o p t 1000 v 60 log c i c o 15 log c i c o k a t where p is the power kw of the catalytic ozonation t is the reaction time min v is the volume l in the reactor c i and c o are the inflow and outflow pollutant concentration mmol l and k a is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 for the decay of the pollutant in the pollutant concentration combining eqs 14 and 15 ee o becomes 16 e e o 38 4 p v k a the pseudo first order rate constant calculated for 2 cu sba 15 at optimized conditions for 86 toc removal was found to be 0 031 min 1 with correlation coefficient of 0 988 fig 11 in the present study maximum toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained at ozone dose of 5 g m3 5 g of ozone generated per m3of oxygen fed to the ozone generator in all the optimized experiments constant oxygen flow rate of 5 l min was fed to the ozone generator therefore total 1 5 g of ozone was generated during 60 min experiment time the electrical energy required to generate 1 g of ozone has been assumed as 0 012 kwh 47 the ee o value as computed from eq 16 was found to be 2 229 kwh m 3 order 1 the result obtained for ee o value is in agreement with that reported in the literature 48 the chemical structure of dye initial dye concentration and amount of consumed ozone have a significant influence on electric energy requirements the catalyst preparation cost mainly involves expenses for procurement of chemical reagents the cost of the chemical reagents used in the preparation of 1 g of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst is shown in table 3 the electricity cost for small industrial scale set up in india is around rs 5 4 per kwh in the present study 2 g of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst was used for the treatment of 10 l ro4 azo dye aqueous solution all these costs are approximate and in large scale operation these costs can be reduced significantly summing all these costs total operational cost for the treatment of 1 m3 of ro4 azo dye aqueous solution using catalytic ozonation was found to be rs 9056 which is equivalent to 131 24 this operational cost is for 86 toc removal efficiency the operational cost for treatment of 4 chlorophenol and eriochrome black t dye by ozonation was reported as 150 and 110 m3 respectively 49 this investigation suggests that operational cost in catalytic ozonation process mainly depends on nature of catalyst type of pollutant and amount of ozone required additionally it can be stated that reuse of catalysts can significantly reduce operational cost 4 conclusion the degradation of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution was studied using mesoporous material based catalytic ozonation the highly ordered mesoporous material sba 15 with uniform pore sizes and parallel arranged channels was prepared as a catalyst support the catalytic activity of sba 15 was improved by creating new active sites through immobilization of copper metal using incipient wetness impregnation method it was found that the use of catalyst in ozonation process significantly improved degradation efficiency over sole ozonation process the catalytic activity of cu sba 15 was maximized for degradation of ro4 azo dye by optimizing operational parameters the operating parameters like copper loading on sba 15 initial solution ph and ozone dose played a vital role in achieving highest toc removal efficiency it was found that maximum toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained in 60 min at optimal conditions of 2 copper loading initial solution ph 9 and ozone dose 5 g m3 the degradation pathway for catalytic ozonation reaction was studied by adding radical scavenger t butanol into the reaction the colour removal was governed by direct ozone molecular mechanism while toc removal occurred via hydroxyl radical mechanism the kinetics for catalytic ozonation reaction was studied and it was found that the reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics with respect to ro4 azo dye concentration in the aqueous solution the reusability of the cu sba 15 catalyst was evaluated and a negligible loss in the activity of the catalyst was noticed after five runs of experiments at same experimental conditions the operational cost for catalytic ozonation process was computed and found that it was at par with other ozonation processes it can be concluded from the study that copper supported sba 15 cu sba 15 is a promising mesoporous catalyst in ozonation process for the treatment of effluent containing azo dyes acknowledgement spg thanks csir national environmental engineering research institute neeri nehru marg nagpur for sponsoring his phd candidature 
14562,the catalytic ozonation using mesoporous sba 15 supported copper catalyst cu sba 15 was employed for the degradation of reactive orange 4 ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution the catalyst was synthesized and characterized using bet sem tem and edx techniques the characteristic results revealed highly ordered mesoporous structure uniform pore sizes parallel arranged channels and large surface area for the catalyst the effects of copper loading on sba 15 initial solution ph and ozone dose on the degradation of ro4 dye were studied the complete colour removal from ro4 azo dye aqueous solution was obtained after 21 min of ozonation the maximum toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained at optimum operational conditions of 2 copper loadings initial solution ph 9 and ozone dose of 5 g m3 after 60 min reaction time the degradation pathway of catalytic ozonation reaction was studied by adding t butanol as radical scavenger and it was found that the presence of radical scavenger had no effect on colour removal efficiency suggesting direct ozone molecular type mechanism however toc removal efficiency was significantly reduced with the addition of t butanol thereby indicating a hydroxyl radical based mechanism the catalytic ozonation reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics with respect to ro4 dye concentration the reusability study for the catalyst suggested a negligible loss in the degradation efficiency after five runs of experiments the stability of the catalyst was studied by performing leaching experiments which suggested that the catalyst has the potential to be utilized for the degradation of aqueous dye solution keywords catalytic ozonation cu sba 15 mesoporous catalyst reactive orange 4 azo dye degradation mechanism 1 introduction dyes have aromatic molecular structures which make them chemically stable non biodegradable toxic and carcinogenic in nature many industries such as textile pulp and paper paint food and plastics utilize dyes to colour their finished products 1 3 around 10 15 of total utilized dyes are discharged into water bodies through industrial effluents due to their low fixation energy on the fiber 4 their release into water bodies poses serious threat to aquatic life and constitutes a potential human health hazard 5 therefore dyes must be removed from the effluent before discharging it into the environment

catalysts because of their unique physical properties such as large surface area uniform pore structure and high thermal stability 21 22 the silica based mesoporous materials like sba 15 mcm 41 and mcm 48 are commonly utilized in catalytic reactions the mesoporous materials are modified with active sites like cerium iron lanthanum vanadium platinum and palladium metals species to enhance their catalytic activity 23 25 the catalytic activities of mesoporous material sba 15 supported cerium ce sba 15 and iron fe sba 15 catalysts were studied for the degradation of dimethyl phthalate pollutant 26 27 the copper oxide supported on sba 15 has also been reported as catalyst for the degradation of mesoxalic and oxalic acids 28 similarly other mesoporous materials such as mcm 41 and mcm 48 have been used as catalyst supports for the mineralization of p chlorobenzoic acid and bromide containing water respectively 29 30 it has been recently reported in the literature that mesoporous materials are employed in only 15 of total catalytic ozonation studies published in the last twelve years 2005 12 in spite of their unique physical properties 31 out of those studies as per authors best

recovered by filtration was washed with ethanol and water before drying at 80 c overnight calcination of the obtained sample was carried out at 550 c for 6 h by slowly increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 1 2 c min from a room temperature to 550 c the mesoporous catalyst cu sba 15 was prepared by impregnating copper metal in sba 15 using incipient wetness impregnation method 26 in this method appropriate amount of cupric nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o as copper precursor was dissolved in 50 ml of deionised water and 2 5 g of sba 15 was added to this solution the mixture is stirred under ultrasonic vibrator for 90 min it is then dried in oven at 80 c overnight it is finally calcined at 550 c for 3 h to obtain cu sba 15 catalyst 2 3 catalytic ozonation procedure the experimental set up for catalytic ozonation process is shown in fig 1 the catalytic ozonation was carried out in a stainless steel made 22 l volume reactor of height 70 cm and diameter 20 cm the oxygen concentrator based on pressure swing adsorption technique was used to generate more than 95 pure oxygen the generated oxygen with a constant flow rate of 5 l min was fed to ozone generator oz air ism 10 series in which ozone was generated using corona discharge method the generated ozone was supplied to the reactor through a recirculation loop consisting of recirculation pump venturi injector and the static mixer to achieve effective mixing with dye solution the effluent was drawn from the bottom of the reactor using the recirculation pump and the ozone was injected through the venturi injector located at the outlet of the pump venturi injector which works on a principle of converging diverging pathways was used to facilitate effective inception of ozone into liquid effluent static mixer located after the venturi injector was utilized for effective mixing of ozone and the effluent the mixture of ozone and the effluent was diffused back into the reactor using a venturi diffuser the ozone concentration at the reactor inlet was measured in terms of ozone dose and was kept constant throughout the experiment all experiments were carried out at room temperature with a fixed amount of catalyst 2 g volume 10 l and initial ro4 azo dye concentration of 100 mg l in aqueous solution the ozone gas concentration was measured continuously at the reactor outlet using an ozone analyzer bmt 964 germany the quantity of ozone consumed in the ozonation was determined using the values of ozone dose measured at inlet and outlet of the reactor an ozone destruction unit was used to convert ozone to oxygen in the outgoing gases leaving from the reactor effluent samples were withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor at regular time intervals for analysis 2 4 analytical procedures effluent samples were analyzed for the ro4 azo dye concentration using the uv spectrophotometer spectro uv vis double beam 3500 india at a wavelength of 489 nm and the linear relationship between the absorbance and the concentration of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution was obtained the colour removal efficiency for ro4 azo dye was calculated using the following equation 1 c o l o u r r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct are the initial and final after treatment for a time t ro4 azo dye concentrations in the aqueous solution mg l respectively the concentration of toc was measured using toc analyzer analytic jena multi n c 2100 the operation of which is based on carbon dioxide infrared adsorption experiments were repeated to check its reproducibility and error was found to be 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the scanning electronic microscopy sem images for catalyst support sba 15 and catalyst cu sba 15 are presented in fig 2 the sem images revealed many rod like domains with relatively uniform sizes which are aggregated into wheat like structures the images also depicted a similar morphology for particles indicating high thermal stability 34 transmission electron microscopy tem measurements have been performed to understand pore architecture of sba 15 the tem images of sba 15 and cu sba 15 are demonstrated in fig 3 the micrographs revealed well ordered 2d hexagonal arrays with uniform pore sizes and parallel arranged channels 34 35 the surface area pore diameter and volume of sba 15 catalyst support were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for sba 15 support are presented in fig 4 according to iupac classification the isotherm curve of type iv with h1 type hysteresis loop indicated typical mesoporous material and its characteristic of capillary condensation within uniform mesopores showed a good quality of sba 15 36 the textural characteristics of the catalyst are presented in table 1 it was found that surface area of sba 15 was decreased with the impregnation of copper metal the surface area of bare sba 15 was 538 26 m2 g which was decreased to 432 33 m2 g for 2 cu loading and further decreased to 292 73 m2 g when copper loadings was 8 this decrease in surface area was due to deposition of copper metal on sba 15 support similar trend was observed in case of pore volume which was decreased from 0 81 cm3 g for bare sba 15 to 0 75 cm3 g for 2 cu sba 15 and 0 51 cm3 g for 8 cu sba 15 the decrease in surface area and pore volume indicated well dispersion of copper species on sba 15 however pore diameter was increased with copper loadings suggesting slighter wider pore distribution but still they were well within the mesoporous range of 5 8 nm the edx analysis to represent the elemental composition of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst has been carried in this analysis a beam of high state energy electrons are bombarded on the sample due to the bombardment electrons are ejected from the atoms of the sample the vacancies created by ejection of electrons are filled up by higher state electrons and x ray spectrums are emitted from the sample to balance energy difference between two electrons states the number and energy of these x ray spectrums emitted by the sample are determined by x ray detector through voltage measurement the measured voltage is used for data evaluation to analyze elemental composition of the catalyst the edx spectrum for 2 cu sba 15 catalyst is shown in fig 5 the energy peaks in edx analysis showed the presence of silicon si copper cu and oxygen whereas no other major element was detected the edx quantification results for 2 cu sba 15 catalyst are presented in table 2 3 2 treatment of aqueous solution containing ro4 azo dye by oxygenation ozonation and catalytic ozonation the experiments were performed for the treatment of aqueous solution containing ro4 azo dye with oxygen and ozone as oxidants and the results in terms of colour and toc removal efficiencies are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively it can be noticed from fig 6a that no significant colour removal efficiency 2 9 was obtained on oxidation with oxygen however 100 colour removal efficiency was obtained after 21 min of oxidation with ozone further ozonation in presence of cu sba 15 catalyst also resulted in 100 colour removal efficiency after 21 min but the initial rate of colour removal efficiency was higher for catalytic ozonation the toc removal efficiencies for oxygenation ozonation and catalytic ozonation using cu sba 15 catalyst of aqueous solution containing reactive orange 4 ro4 dye are shown in fig 6b it can be noticed that a toc removal efficiency of 3 5 was obtained after 60 min of oxidation with oxygen the toc removal efficiency of 40 and 70 were obtained with sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation after 60 min of oxidation compared to 100 colour removal efficiency obtained after 21 min of oxidation this might be due to the selective nature of ozone in attacking colour imparting chromophore groups compared to auxochrome groups of the dye since the catalytic ozonation resulted in higher toc removal efficiency compared to ozonation it was decided to perform oxidation experiments by ozone in presence of cu sba 15 catalyst 3 3 optimization of catalytic ozonation parameters the catalytic ozonation experiments were performed using cu sba 15 catalyst the effect of copper loading initial solution ph and ozone dose on the colour and toc removal efficiencies was studied to obtain an optimum value of these parameters 3 3 1 effect of copper loading experiments were performed to study the effect of copper loading on colour and toc removal efficiencies by varying the copper loading from 1 wt to 8 wt and the results are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively it can be observed from fig 7a that there is no effect of copper loading on colour removal efficiency as complete colour removal was obtained after 21 min of ozonation and catalytic ozonation with different copper loadings 1 2 4 and 8 wt this might be due to the high reactivity of ozone towards chromophore groups which impart colour to the dye an enhancement in toc removal efficiency from 40 to 65 after 1 h of reaction was observed for catalytic ozonation 1 wt cu compared to ozonation alone further the toc removal efficiency was found to increase from 65 to 71 with an increase in the cu loading from 1 wt to 2 wt it was due to the fact that an increase in copper loading resulted in an increase in the active surface sites of the catalyst thus enhancing the toc removal efficiency however further increase in copper loading from 2 wt to 8 wt resulted in a decrease in toc removal efficiency this was mainly due to steric hinderance effect in which high copper loading could have blocked the pores of sba 15 thus reducing its active surface area 27 37 therefore 2 wt copper loading was found to be optimum and was used in further experiments 3 3 2 effect of initial solution ph the initial solution ph plays a vital role in enhancing the efficiency of catalytic ozonation process as variation in initial solution ph can alter the ozone decomposition rate the surface properties of catalyst and generation of hydroxyl radicals 38 the effect of initial solution ph on colour and toc removal efficiencies for aqueous solution containing ro4 azo dye was studied by performing experiments with different initial solution ph 3 10 and the results are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively it can be noticed from fig 8a that there is no effect of initial solution ph on colour removal efficiency and complete decolourization was achieved after 21 min of ozonation however the variation in initial solution ph had a significant effect on toc removal efficiency fig 8b the toc removal efficiency was increased from 48 4 to 86 with an increase in initial solution ph from 3 to 9 this could be due to the increase in decomposition rate of ozone leading to generation of more hydroxyl radicals with an increase in initial solution ph the decomposition of ozone occurs by following reactions 38 2 o3 oh o2 ho2 3 o3 ho2 2o2 oh these hydroxyl radicals due to their higher oxidation potential 2 8 ev than ozone 2 07 ev react with auxochrome group of dye molecule and intermediates formed during ozonation in a non selective manner however a further increase in initial solution ph from 9 to 10 decreased toc removal efficiency the decrease in toc removal efficiency could be due to excessive generation of hydroxyl radicals which react with each other and with hydroperoxyl ho2 free radical generated during ozone decomposition before getting terminated 29 the termination reactions are as follows 4 ho2 oh h2o o2 5 oh oh h2o2 thus the initial solution ph of 9 was found to be optimum ph and further catalytic ozonation experiments were performed at an initial solution ph 9 in addition to solution ph the presence of the catalyst also initiates decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals the hydroxyl groups developed on the surface of the metal oxide catalyst when it comes in contact with water are responsible for decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals 39 40 the charge properties of the surface hydroxyl groups depend on ph of the solution and phpzc of the catalyst the surface of the catalyst becomes protonated solution ph phpzc eq 6 or deprotonated solution ph phpzc eq 7 depending on the solution ph 41 6 m oh h m oh2 ph phpzc 7 m oh oh m o h2o ph phpzc in the present study the phpzc of the cu sba 15 catalyst was determined by salt addition method and found to be 6 7 the optimum initial solution ph 9 was more than phpzc of the catalyst due to which the surface of the catalyst became negatively charged the ozone molecule has two extreme forms of resonance structures which makes it act as dipole with both electrophilic and nucleophilic agents 38 the ozone adsorbs on the surface of the catalyst and decomposes immediately to generate hydroxyl radicals 13 42 3 3 3 effect of ozone dose experiments were performed to study the effect of ozone dose on catalytic ozonation of aqueous solution containing ro4 dye by varying the ozone dose from 1 g m3 to 7 5 g m3 and the results in terms of colour and toc removal efficiencies are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively the ozone dose has been defined as gram of ozone generated per m3 of oxygen fed to the ozone generator it can be noticed that an increase in ozone dose enhanced both colour and toc removal efficiencies the colour removal efficiency was increased from 38 5 to 100 with an increase in at ozone dose from 1 g m3 to 5 g m3 after 21 min fig 9a similar trend was observed for toc removal efficiency which was increased from 19 to 86 after 60 min when ozone dose was increased from 1 g m3 to 5 g m3 the increase in degradation efficiency is due to the fact that with an increase in ozone dose the driving force for the transfer of ozone to the aqueous dye solution increases subsequently increasing the concentration of ozone in the aqueous solution resulting in an enhanced degradation of the dye a further increase in ozone dose from 5 g m3 to 7 5 g m3 did not enhance the toc removal significantly as the toc removal efficiency increased only by 1 7 after 60 min fig 9b this could be due to the saturation of aqueous dye solution with ozone limiting its transfer to aqueous solution 43 45 thus an ozone dose of 5 g m3 was considered to be optimum as a higher inlet ozone dose leads to increase in ozone generation cost a toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained after 60 min of ozonation at the optimum value of the parameters initial solution ph 9 metal loading 2 ozone dose 5 g m3 3 4 degradation pathway for catalytic ozonation of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution the catalytic ozonation for the degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution occurs either through direct mechanism ozone molecule directly reacting with dye or indirect mechanism generation of hydroxyl radical which reacts with dye the degradation mechanism was identified by adding radical scavenger t butanol into the catalytic ozonation reaction the radical scavenger t butanol has higher reaction rate constant 6 108 m 1 s 1 with hydroxyl radicals compared with ozone 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 and has potential to terminate radical chain reactions by generating inert intermediates 27 the effect of addition of radical scavenger t butanol on colour and toc removal efficiencies is shown in fig 10 a and b respectively it can be noticed that colour removal efficiency was not changed with the addition of radical scavenger t butanol which indicated that the direct ozone molecular mechanism was predominant to hydroxyl radical mechanism therefore it can be stated that colour removal of the ro4 azo dye solution was mainly governed by direct ozone molecular mechanism it can be noticed from fig 10b that the toc removal efficiency decreased with an addition of radical scavenger the toc removal efficiency decreased from 86 to 30 and 16 7 after 60 min of ozonation with the addition of 1 mg l and 5 mg l of t butanol respectively this clearly indicated that t butanol consumed the hydroxyl radicals generated in the aqueous solution and it can be concluded that toc removal for ro4 azo dye aqueous solution occurred via hydroxyl radical mechanism 3 5 reaction kinetics the catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution occurred through direct pathway reaction of ozone molecule with dye for colour removal and through indirect pathway reaction of generated hydroxyl radical with dye for toc removal thus degradation of ro4 azo dye can be represented by following two reactions 8 r o 4 a z o d y e o 3 k o 3 o x i d a t i o n p r o d u c t s 9 r o 4 a z o d y e o h k o h o x i d a t i o n p r o d u c t s the rate expression for the degradation of ro4 dye can be written as 10 d r o 4 d t k o 3 r o 4 o 3 k o h r o 4 o h where k o 3 and k oh are reaction rate constants for reactions presented by eqs 8 and 9 respectively rearranging eq 10 11 d r o 4 d t k o 3 o 3 k o h o h r o 4 since concentration of ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous solution is assumed constant the term k o 3 o 3 k o h o h becomes constant thus 12 d r o 4 d t k r o 4 where k is apparent rate constant and equals to k o 3 o 3 k o h o h integrating eq 12 results 13 ln r o 4 r o 4 i k t where r o 4 i and r o 4 are initial concentration and concentration at time t of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution the degradation kinetics of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution was studied by plotting ln ro 4 ro 4 i versus ozonation time and the results are shown in fig 11 the linear relationship plot with high correlation coefficient r2 0 988 indicated pseudo first order kinetics with respect to ro4 azo dye concentration in the aqueous solution and the apparent rate constant k was found to be 0 031 min 1 the variation of apparent rate constant k with initial solution ph and ozone dose was studied and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be noticed from fig 12a that there is an increase in apparent rate constant k with an increase in initial solution ph from 3 to 9 further increase in initial solution ph from 9 to 10 resulted in reduction in apparent rate constant k due to excessive generation and termination of free radicals during ozone decomposition it can be noticed from fig 12b that the apparent rate constant increased with an increase in ozone dose from 1 g m3 to 5 g m3 a further increase in ozone dose from 5 g m3 to 7 5 g m3 did not enhance apparent rate constant significantly 3 6 reusability of the catalyst the reusability of the catalyst is an important factor in evaluating its potential for long term use in catalytic ozonation the reusability of the 2 cu sba 15 catalyst was explored by performing the catalytic ozonation experiments using the spent catalyst and the results are shown in fig 13 it can be noticed that there is no significant reduction in colour and toc removal efficiencies after five runs of experiments at same experimental conditions suggesting negligible loss in activity of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst 3 7 leaching test the leaching test was performed to study the stability of cu sba 15 catalyst and it was found that 0 065 mg l of copper was leached in the aqueous dye solution after 60 min of catalytic ozonation the concentration of leached copper in the aqueous solution was found to be within discharge standards prescribed by central pollution control board india 3 8 cost estimation for catalytic ozonation the aops involving ozone is considered as expensive process due to high ozone generation cost the costs involved in catalytic ozonation are the cost of the catalyst and operational cost which mainly includes cost of electricity for ozone generation the electrical energy consumed per order of pollutant removal ee o kw h m 3 order 1 was computed as 46 14 e e o p t 1000 v 60 log c i c o 15 log c i c o k a t where p is the power kw of the catalytic ozonation t is the reaction time min v is the volume l in the reactor c i and c o are the inflow and outflow pollutant concentration mmol l and k a is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 for the decay of the pollutant in the pollutant concentration combining eqs 14 and 15 ee o becomes 16 e e o 38 4 p v k a the pseudo first order rate constant calculated for 2 cu sba 15 at optimized conditions for 86 toc removal was found to be 0 031 min 1 with correlation coefficient of 0 988 fig 11 in the present study maximum toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained at ozone dose of 5 g m3 5 g of ozone generated per m3of oxygen fed to the ozone generator in all the optimized experiments constant oxygen flow rate of 5 l min was fed to the ozone generator therefore total 1 5 g of ozone was generated during 60 min experiment time the electrical energy required to generate 1 g of ozone has been assumed as 0 012 kwh 47 the ee o value as computed from eq 16 was found to be 2 229 kwh m 3 order 1 the result obtained for ee o value is in agreement with that reported in the literature 48 the chemical structure of dye initial dye concentration and amount of consumed ozone have a significant influence on electric energy requirements the catalyst preparation cost mainly involves expenses for procurement of chemical reagents the cost of the chemical reagents used in the preparation of 1 g of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst is shown in table 3 the electricity cost for small industrial scale set up in india is around rs 5 4 per kwh in the present study 2 g of 2 cu sba 15 catalyst was used for the treatment of 10 l ro4 azo dye aqueous solution all these costs are approximate and in large scale operation these costs can be reduced significantly summing all these costs total operational cost for the treatment of 1 m3 of ro4 azo dye aqueous solution using catalytic ozonation was found to be rs 9056 which is equivalent to 131 24 this operational cost is for 86 toc removal efficiency the operational cost for treatment of 4 chlorophenol and eriochrome black t dye by ozonation was reported as 150 and 110 m3 respectively 49 this investigation suggests that operational cost in catalytic ozonation process mainly depends on nature of catalyst type of pollutant and amount of ozone required additionally it can be stated that reuse of catalysts can significantly reduce operational cost 4 conclusion the degradation of ro4 azo dye in aqueous solution was studied using mesoporous material based catalytic ozonation the highly ordered mesoporous material sba 15 with uniform pore sizes and parallel arranged channels was prepared as a catalyst support the catalytic activity of sba 15 was improved by creating new active sites through immobilization of copper metal using incipient wetness impregnation method it was found that the use of catalyst in ozonation process significantly improved degradation efficiency over sole ozonation process the catalytic activity of cu sba 15 was maximized for degradation of ro4 azo dye by optimizing operational parameters the operating parameters like copper loading on sba 15 initial solution ph and ozone dose played a vital role in achieving highest toc removal efficiency it was found that maximum toc removal efficiency of 86 was obtained in 60 min at optimal conditions of 2 copper loading initial solution ph 9 and ozone dose 5 g m3 the degradation pathway for catalytic ozonation reaction was studied by adding radical scavenger t butanol into the reaction the colour removal was governed by direct ozone molecular mechanism while toc removal occurred via hydroxyl radical mechanism the kinetics for catalytic ozonation reaction was studied and it was found that the reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics with respect to ro4 azo dye concentration in the aqueous solution the reusability of the cu sba 15 catalyst was evaluated and a negligible loss in the activity of the catalyst was noticed after five runs of experiments at same experimental conditions the operational cost for catalytic ozonation process was computed and found that it was at par with other ozonation processes it can be concluded from the study that copper supported sba 15 cu sba 15 is a promising mesoporous catalyst in ozonation process for the treatment of effluent containing azo dyes acknowledgement spg thanks csir national environmental engineering research

14563,in the present study an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas bioreactor was subjected to dissimilar intermittent aeration ia cyclic operations and its effects were investigated on extracellular polymeric substances eps production sludge characteristics and specific power consumption a total of three ia cycles ia1 150 min aeration on and 30 min off ia2 120 min aeration on and 60 min off ia3 90 min aeration on and 60 min off were evaluated in the present ifas reactor specific eps production mg g of suspended solids was found to be following the increasing trend with respect to the non aeration to aeration time ratio whereas the sludge production followed the reverse trend the amount of bound eps was observed to be much higher 6 10 times than soluble microbial product smp in each intermittent aeration phase during all the investigated ia cycles the pilot was observed to be significantly affected in terms of biomass characteristics which was also confirmed by increasing trends of sludge volume index svi and filamentous index fi values in situ monitoring and measurement of reactor operation parameters such as ph oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do was also done in all ia cycles a maximum of 27 05 reduction in electrical energy was observed in highest non aeration period cycle keywords ifas intermittent aeration sludge characteristics extracellular polymeric substances energy saving 1 introduction all the biological wastewater treatment systems suspended and or attached produce a complex mixtures of high molecular weight substances i e polymers secreted by microorganisms produced from cell disintegration and adsorbed substrate from wastewaters 1 which are known as extracellular polymeric substances eps these materials play a consequential role in enhanced settling of biomass and helps them to form the microbial clusters in a wastewater treatment system the prime components of eps mixture include macromolecules such as carbohydrates and proteins which exerts influence on bio chemical characteristics of microbial consortium 2 furthermore the two forms of eps exist at outer surface of microbial cells which can be categorized as bound eps and soluble eps 3 4 as the classification term implies the bound eps are closely attached with microbial cells whereas soluble eps are those compounds which are either loosely bound with cells or dissolved into the mother solutions 5 in spite of significant research on eps many other factors play important role which could influence the composition and production rate of eps in environmental systems this quantitative as well as qualitative variation in constituents of the extracted eps may be attributed to various factors such as type of wastewater biomass conditions operational parameters bioreactor type and extraction method etc 3 among the various important operational parameters of bioreactors solid retention time shear rate or aeration intensity and aerobic or anaerobic conditions were found to be affecting the eps production and composition as well however the results published in literature are slightly contradictory as some reported increasing trend while others observed the decreasing trend of eps production with similar change in operating conditions 5 6 9 to date although ample amount of literature is published about eps quantification methods but more studies are required to investigate their roles in the biological wastewater treatment systems under different operational conditions therefore to gain confidence about the fate of eps it is important to conduct more studies under stressed conditions to investigate the behaviour of biomass with respect to eps production in last two decades various operational strategies such as intermittent aeration and variable dissolved oxygen mode have been investigated for biological wastewater treatment systems 10 13 among these operational stresses intermittent aeration ia strategies also called alternating anoxic oxic process have been proved very efficient in removal of the biodegradable components organics solids and nutrients of wastewaters in continuous as well as in batch reactors during the times of 1980 1990 a good number of plants were built to operate under same operational conditions and data on treatment performance and energy consumption were reported 14 17 more advantages of alternating anoxic oxic process are well documented in our recently published studies 12 13 this type of operational strategies also gives a major reduction in electric energy consumption as well as in operational costs associated with aeration 18 23 the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas systems which were introduced in 1994 emerged as one of the most encouraging alternative in decentralized context 24 26 these systems have been proved efficient in developing as well as in developed countries for the municipal and or industrial wastewater treatment 12 27 31 to date some studies have been reported the role and impact of various intermittent aeration strategies on organics and nutrient removal in natural and aerobic wastewater treatment systems 32 35 however the sludge characteristics of these systems are still unexplored and very limited studies are available revealing the role of eps and nature of sludge produced in biological wastewater treatment systems 36 until now very limited published literature is available reporting the effect of intermittent aeration strategies on the eps quantity produced and biomass characteristics in an ifas and or biofilm reactor 37 therefore this study was carried out to investigate the effects of different ia cycles on the eps production and sludge characteristics in an ifas reactor 2 material and methods 2 1 description of experimental set up all the experiments were conducted on a pilot scale fixed media based ifas reactor table 1 the whole body of reactor was made up of stainless steel including fixed media holding frame the fixed media curtains a loop knitted polypropylene fabric in a rectangular geometry placed within the aerobic zone of system and mounted within a detachable frame assembly which can be simply lifted out from the aeration tank for maintenance or inspection whenever required necessary aeration in the ifas reactor was provided by using an automated blower supplying requisite air to the highly efficient membrane diffusers installed at the bottom of the fixed media holding tank the actual municipal wastewater was pumped from the sump well of the sewage pumping station and settled activated sludge along with raw municipal wastewater flowed over a weir into the aeration chamber by using centrifugal pumps the typical characteristics of wastewater fed to pilot were equivalent of medium strength sewage and the values of main parameters are noted in the range of 400 600 240 350 200 360 40 65 and 3 10 for cod bod tss tn and tp respectively the daily wastewater feeding rate was adjusted to yield a hydraulic retention time hrt of 11 1 h the schematic diagram of experimental setup used in this study is shown in fig 1 2 2 start up and experimental methodology the start up of pilot plant was done according to our previous study 12 and results of treatment performance analysis and changes in microbial diversity are presented in our recent studies 12 13 the overall experimental campaign was divided into four phases three intermittent aeration ia runs and one continuous run each of the ia phase lasted for around three weeks with an interval of one week between two consecutive phases the operational parameters for the pilot are presented in table 2 the aeration was controlled by using an automated timer in the blower unit with fixed time periods of aeration and non aeration 2 3 analysis and measurement during the entire experimental period the influent effluent and sludge samples were placed in an icebox and brought to environmental engineering laboratory at iit roorkee until analysis could be performed selected in situ operational parameters and reactor conditions such as ph dissolved oxygen do hrt waste activated sludge was rates and return activated sludge ras rates were monitored and measured on each sampling day while oxidation reduction potential orp was monitored in batch mode the major treatment performance parameters such as 3 day biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to standard methods 66 the mixed liquor suspended phase biom hrt waste activated sludge was rates and return activated sludge ras rates were monitored and measured on each sampling day while oxidation reduction potential orp was monitored in batch mode the major treatment performance parameters such as 3 day biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to standard methods 66 the mixed liquor suspended phase biomass samples were collected from the ifas reactor and characterized by mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge volume index svi measurements by following the procedure as presented in standard methods 66 the electrical energy consumption was calculated by considering the rating and running hours of blower unit 2 4 eps quantification in order to examine the physiochemical condition of the suspended biomass in ifas reactor the total concentration of eps termed as epst was measured in present study the soluble termed as soluble microbial products smp and bound eps concentrations were determined according to zhang et al 38 di bella et al 39 di bella and torregrossa 40 the total eps both bound and soluble concentration was calculated as the sum of the above two described fractions according to the below equation eps t eps b smp epsbp epsbc smpp smpc where epsb bound eps smp soluble microbial product here subscripts p and c indicate the content of proteins and carbohydrates in the epsb and smp respectively in order to measure the contents of proteins and carbohydrates in bound and soluble eps lowry s folin method 41 and anthrone s method 42 were used respectively 2 5 microscopic examination of sludge for microscopic analysis the suspended biomass from the aeration tank of ifas reactor was examined using an olympus bright field microscope bh 2 olympus co ltd tokyo japan relative abundance of filamentous microorganisms in suspended biomass during different experimental runs was determined using the filamentous index fi method 43 44 a scale range from 0 to 6 from none to excessive was used to determine the filamentous bacteria abundance with values as follows 0 none 1 few 2 some 3 common 4 very common 5 abundant and 6 excessive simplified technique of filamentous count stfc was used for counting of filamentous bacteria in per ml of sludge samples 43 45 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance under intermittent aeration conditions the treatment potential of the present ifas system was also examined under studied ia conditions the ifas system was operated with f m ratio of 0 38 0 47 and 0 53 and sludge retention time as 4 6 3 7 and 4 8 days in ia1 ia2 ia3 period respectively in spite of great variation in influent characteristics the average cod values of effluent were observed as 33 29 and 42 mg l achieving the mean removal efficiencies as 96 97 and 96 in ia1 ia2 and ia3 period respectively the bod removal efficiencies also follows the same trend and reported in the range of 90 95 these results indicate that non aeration times of applied experimental conditions had an insignificant effect on overall removal efficiencies of organic matter with regard to tss concentrations the average values were almost same and amounted as 15 mg l under all ia conditions considering the nutrient parameters the average ammonia concentrations in the effluent were noted below 1 5 and 7 mg l in the period ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively while the average nitrate concentrations in the effluent in the same periods were 8 6 and 4 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of total nitrogen varied in the range of 70 80 under all applied ia conditions overall the experimental results showed that both nitrification and denitrification may successfully be carded out into present ifas system developing anaerobic and aerobic conditions in ifas reactors has been noticed by researchers recently therefore tp removal efficiencies were examined in the present system and removal efficiencies were found to be inversely proportional to the duration of non aeration time in each ia phase the average tp removal rate dropped from 80 to 43 when changing the aeration cycle from ia1 to ia3 overall the ifas reactor was effective in removing bod cod tss and tn irrespective of cycle characteristics more details about the treatment performance are documented in our previous published works 12 13 3 2 eps production and microscopic observations a change in the bioreactor operational conditions such as shear rate mixing and flow patterns or aeration intensity could change the eps content in activated sludge 47 some researchers also reported that the amount of carbohydrate content in extracted eps from activated sludge increases with the increased air flow in some batch reactors such as sequential bioreactors whereas the amount of protein substances remain almost unchanged at the same air intensities 48 which revealed that shear rate affects the eps quantity produced and may trigger bacteria to excrete more carbohydrate substances moreover ramasamy and zhang 49 also reported that however a sudden increase in shear rate may led to increased content of carbohydrates in eps but may returns to its original concentration level after a period of cultivation the eps from the reactor biomass could also be released by mechanic shear force and hydrodynamic conditions which can lead to higher concentrations of soluble eps 50 51 furthermore the prevailing conditions of bioreactor such as aerobic or anaerobic can also influence the eps production it is also documented in literature that activated sludge flocs tend to break or solubilize in containing solutions under oxygen limiting environments such dissolution of microbial aggregates might be caused either by the hindrance in eps production or by the hydrolysis process of eps shin et al 48 compared three bioreactors under different dissolved oxygen conditions in terms of eps production and reported that production of carbohydrates in eps increases with time at high dissolved oxygen levels whereas insignificant changes were observed in protein content at the same conditions contrary the similar concentrations of both carbohydrates and proteins were observed at a low dissolved oxygen levels fig 2 a reports the specific eps content total mg eps per gram of ss of suspended biomass in each experimental state while fig 2b depicts the carbohydrate and protein concentration in smp which includes loosely bound and or dissolved eps and bound eps respectively more specifically the term smp is first used by namkung and rittmann and it is defined as soluble cellular components that are released from substrate metabolism and biomass decay results of our previous studies revealed that although the attached biomass biofilms are capable to produce bit higher quantity of eps than suspended biomass but as the biomass acclimatizes the levels of eps production by the suspended biomass also increases fig 2a these results suggest that suspended biomass may produce similar levels of eps as attached biomass with the long run of ifas system this increasing pattern may be attributed to the release of attached microorganisms into mixed liquor also called as seeding effect of attached biomass 26 results of present investigations revealed that the epst concentrations e g the sum of epsbound and smp in the present ifas reactor were significantly higher than those observed under continuous aeration conditions the percentage of bound eps was much higher 6 10 times than smp in each experimental phase even if sporadically measured on the contrary it is worth underlying that increased values of smps were observed in each consequent experimental state on reducing the duration of the aeration on time a possible reason might be related to a stress condition on the biomass that anoxic conditions exerted on the biomass due to release of smp by cell autolysis under anoxic conditions and loosely bound eps lbeps from attached biomass of reactor 52 54 differently slightly less variation was observed in bound eps as compared to smp concentrations however further studies are required to confirm these hypotheses carbohydrate and protein mixtures are crucial components of eps to control the microbial activity and destruction in bioreactor systems carbohydrate concentration was found to be in increasing order in bound eps 21 28 36 and 49 mg l and smp 18 13 22 and 34 mg l while protein content in bound eps was almost stable varied between 176 and 191 mg l under all intermittent aeration conditions on the other side protein content of smp was found to increasing and observed as 26 32 41 and 46 mg l in continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 runs respectively this might be due to increase in non aeration period therefore the longer durations of non aeration time in ia cycles might enhance the denitrification activity but may have a significant impact on overall eps production these results were quite similar to previous studies 20 in which longer aeration off times were found to be responsible for exploded cell growth and consequently increased eps concentrations 3 3 control of filamentous organisms the abundance of various types of filamentous microorganisms often leads to poor settling and sometime promotes the bulking sludge in biological wastewater treatment systems this phenomenon is mainly associated with low do conditions high f m ratios or septic sewage the chances of septic sewage are possible in our study as sewage was fed to pilot from a sewage pumping station moreover the sludge settleability decreases also evidenced by significant rise in the svi and the sludge appears light and fluffy similar effects have been observed in this study according to several researchers alternating the aerobic anoxic periods in biological reactor enhance the reductive conditions thus allowing the hydrolysis of the particulate matter and places the filamentous organism in system 55 during the microscopic examination of suspended sludge the concentrations of thin filaments were visually quantified using fi values over the whole experimental time the fi remained between fi2 fi3 this observation is attested in fig 3 a c it was also observed that during intermittent aeration runs most stalked ciliated disappeared and free swimming small flagellates were found to be predominant this caused the high svi values during intermittent aeration period however free swimming protozoa survived under the ia conditions these results suggest that intermittent aeration conditions allow predators to survive which contributed to the decrease in the sludge amount through their predation on the dispersed bacteria 3 4 sludge production and characterization fig 4 a shows the variation in mlss and svi values in the mixed liquor of ifas reactor during various experimental schedules observing fig 4a it is worth noting that during the whole period mlss values were almost stable concentrations varied between 1338 1452 1355 1405 and 1280 1312 mg l during ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively the averaged ratio of volatile to suspended solids was found to be fluctuating a little around a mean value of 0 73 this indicates that small amount of inorganic compounds and discernible inert are accumulated in the bioreactor during the whole experimental period the sludge settleability was affected significantly by increasing the non aeration period in intermittent aeration cycle and higher svi values are achieved in run ia3 as compared to ia1 and ia2 however in all the intermittent aeration runs the svi values were above the settleability threshold of 155 ml g at continuous aeration mode the increased svi values ranging between 186 and 203 218 238 and 241 267 ml g in ia run 1 2 and 3 were observed for present ifas system these increased values of svi were also evidenced by presence of thin filaments in suspended biomass another reason behind the increased svi values may be more eps production which may have a pessimistic effect on the settleability of microbial aggregates 56 generally the eps are negatively charged and high concentration of eps increases the surface charge of microbes which can result in an increased repulsive forces between microbial cells and a decrease in the settleability of microbial aggregates 57 it is also important to mention here that whenever plant goes under intermittent aeration phase the aeration basin acts as sludge storage and due to the fact that the aeration had no mixers hence whenever blowers are turned off suspended phase biomass settled down within a short period of time this cyclic phenomenon also affected adversely the sludge characteristics as reported in other similar systems 58 the sludge production was also estimated in each phase and presented in fig 4b it can be seen from this figure that reduced sludge production was observed in intermittent aeration mode with values noted as 8 56 8 35 7 39 and 5 79 kg d during continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively this reduction with aeration off time can be attributed to lesser biomass produced under anoxic conditions as compared to aerobic conditions in general length of non aeration period determines the net sludge production during cyclic intermittent aeration operation of biological reactors furthermore a reduced anoxic endogenous respiration rate may be responsible for the reduced sludge yield 59 3 5 orp do ph monitoring in biological wastewater treatment systems ph do and orp charts can provide useful information about the biological process such as operational conditions over aeration and under aeration microorganism activity and process inhibition 60 61 to facilitate the process understanding characteristic profiles of ph do and orp versus time in each intermittent cycle have been observed in the present ifas system fig 5 in each graph vertical line represents the start and end of non aeration phase it is possible to see from fig 5 that the do concentration drops down almost to zero in each ia run the peak positive and negative orp values were observed as 25 32 7 27 32 9 and 49 43 2 mv for ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively compared with the negative orp value of ia1 and ia2 run the values for ia3 was slightly lower because the mixed liquor in aeration basin was much more in reduced state caused by decreased aeration time and increased non aeration time it can also be seen from the graph that although the positive peak values of orp were high in ia3 but non aeration duration was lower than ia1 and ia2 that is why significant ammonia removal could not be achieved the appreciable fluctuation of orp curve during non aeration period and initial stage of aeration on period was also encountered in ia 3 it may be also due to no mixing during the anoxic period in aeration basin and high concentration gradient of reduced substances between supernatant and settled sludge layers with regard to ph change not much variation was observed in each phase 3 6 electric energy consumption in the intermittent aeration processes alternation of aerobic and anoxic phases in the same bioreactor allows to obtain an effective decrease in the energy utilization 15 62 moreover in a carbon constrained future intermittent aeration also has the potential of minimizing the operational costs associated with aeration and needs to be carefully evaluated 63 65 previous studies have also reported significant energy consumption varying in the range of 10 30 18 19 23 in the present study the actual power requirement for the pilot was calculated by estimating the power required by the electro mechanical unit installed in pilot and the data of the performed cycles a comparison of the total energy consumption during the continuous aeration and intermittent aeration periods table 3 showed that the energy savings achieved from ia schedules was 12 24 and 28 kw per day for run ia 1 ia2 and ia3 respectively the most significant savings was obtained by calculating the energy specific consumptions and noted as 2 21 1 94 and 1 82 kw m3 for run ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively an average energy saving of 11 42 for ia1 22 24 for ia 2 and 27 05 for ia3 was achieved which were in good agreement with previous literature values 62 10 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are as follows eps production by suspended biomass increased as the ratio of non aeration to aeration time got longer probably due to operational stress condition on the biomass and release of smp from bound eps during non aeration periods the content at 150 30 min 120 60 min and 90 60 min aeration on off time increased 1 32 times 1 47 and 1 78 times respectively as compared to values of continuous aeration mode operation the total sludge production by pilot decreased up to 3 7 13 6 and 32 3 in run 1 2 and 3 respectively the high svi values confirmed that the settling characteristics disturbed during intermittent aeration and found to be proportional to ratio of non aeration to aeration time this fact was also evidenced by the increasing presence of filamentous microorganism contemporary to the organics and nutrient removals also proportional energy savings in the range of 10 30 was attained acknowledgement department of science and technology india and european union within the 7th framework program under project saraswati and grant number

14563,in the present study an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas bioreactor was subjected to dissimilar intermittent aeration ia cyclic operations and its effects were investigated on extracellular polymeric substances eps production sludge characteristics and specific power consumption a total of three ia cycles ia1 150 min aeration on and 30 min off ia2 120 min aeration on and 60 min off ia3 90 min aeration on and 60 min off were evaluated in the present ifas reactor specific eps production mg g of suspended solids was found to be following the increasing trend with respect to the non aeration to aeration time ratio whereas the sludge production followed the reverse trend the amount of bound eps was observed to be much higher 6 10 times than soluble microbial product smp in each intermittent aeration phase during all the investigated ia cycles the pilot was observed to be significantly affected in terms of biomass characteristics which was also confirmed by increasing trends of sludge volume index svi and filamentous index fi values in situ monitoring and measurement of reactor operation parameters such as ph oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do was also done in all ia cycles a maximum of 27 05 reduction in electrical energy was observed in highest non aeration period cycle keywords ifas intermittent aeration sludge characteristics extracellular polymeric substances energy saving 1 introduction all the biological wastewater treatment systems suspended and or attached produce a complex mixtures of high molecular weight substances i e polymers secreted by microorganisms produced from cell disintegration and adsorbed substrate from wastewaters 1 which are known as extracellular polymeric substances eps these materials play a consequential role in enhanced settling of biomass and helps them to form the microbial clusters in a wastewater treatment system the prime components of eps mixture include macromolecules such as carbohydrates and proteins which exerts influence on bio chemical characteristics of microbial consortium 2 furthermore the two forms of eps exist at outer surface of microbial cells which can be categorized as bound eps and soluble eps 3 4 as the classification term implies the bound eps are closely attached with microbial cells whereas soluble eps are those compounds which are either loosely bound with cells or dissolved into the mother solutions 5 in spite of significant research on eps many other factors play important role which could influence the composition and production rate of eps in environmental systems this quantitative as well as qualitative variation in constituents of the extracted eps may be attributed to various factors such as type of wastewater biomass conditions operational parameters bioreactor type and extraction method etc 3 among the various important operational parameters of bioreactors solid retention time shear rate or aeration intensity and aerobic or anaerobic conditions were found to be affecting the eps production and composition as well however the results published in literature are slightly contradictory as some reported increasing trend while others observed the decreasing trend of eps production with similar change in operating conditions 5 6 9 to date although ample amount of literature is published about eps quantification methods but more studies are required to investigate their roles in the biological wastewater treatment systems under different operational conditions therefore to gain confidence about the fate of eps it is important to conduct more studies under stressed conditions to investigate the behaviour of biomass with respect to eps production in last two decades various operational strategies such as intermittent aeration and variable dissolved oxygen mode have been investigated for biological wastewater treatment systems 10 13 among these operational stresses intermittent aeration ia strategies also called alternating anoxic oxic process have been proved very efficient in removal of the biodegradable components organics solids and nutrients of wastewaters in continuous as well as in batch reactors during the times of 1980 1990 a good number of plants were built to operate under same operational conditions and data on treatment performance and energy consumption were reported 14 17 more advantages of alternating anoxic oxic process are well documented in our recently published studies 12 13 this type of operational strategies also gives a major reduction in electric energy consumption as well as in operational costs associated with aeration 18 23 the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas systems which were introduced in 1994 emerged as one of the most encouraging alternative in decentralized context 24 26 these systems have been proved efficient in developing as well as in developed countries for the municipal and or industrial wastewater treatment 12 27 31 to date some studies have been reported the role and impact of various intermittent aeration strategies on organics and nutrient removal in natural and aerobic wastewater treatment systems 32 35 however the sludge characteristics of these systems are still unexplored and very limited studies are available revealing the role of eps and nature of sludge produced in biological wastewater treatment systems 36 until now very limited published literature is available reporting the effect of intermittent aeration strategies on the eps quantity produced and biomass characteristics in an ifas and or biofilm reactor 37 therefore this study was carried out to investigate the effects of different ia cycles on the eps production and sludge characteristics in an ifas reactor 2 material and methods 2 1 description of experimental set up all the experiments were conducted on a pilot scale fixed media based ifas reactor table 1 the whole body of reactor was made up of stainless steel including fixed media holding frame the fixed media curtains a loop knitted polypropylene fabric in a rectangular geometry placed within the aerobic zone of system and mounted within a detachable frame assembly which can be simply lifted out from the aeration tank for maintenance or inspection whenever required necessary aeration in the ifas reactor was provided by using an automated blower supplying requisite air to the highly efficient membrane diffusers installed at the bottom of the fixed media holding tank the actual municipal wastewater was pumped from the sump well of the sewage pumping station and settled activated sludge along with raw municipal wastewater flowed over a weir into the aeration chamber by using centrifugal pumps the typical characteristics of wastewater fed to pilot were equivalent of medium strength sewage and the values of main parameters are noted in the range of 400 600 240 350 200 360 40 65 and 3 10 for cod bod tss tn and tp respectively the daily wastewater feeding rate was adjusted to yield a hydraulic retention time hrt of 11 1 h the schematic diagram of experimental setup used in this study is shown in fig 1 2 2 start up and experimental methodology the start up of pilot plant was done according to our previous study 12 and results of treatment performance analysis and changes in microbial diversity are presented in our recent studies 12 13 the overall experimental campaign was divided into four phases three intermittent aeration ia runs and one continuous run each of the ia phase lasted for around three weeks with an interval of one week between two consecutive phases the operational parameters for the pilot are presented in table 2 the aeration was controlled by using an automated timer in the blower unit with fixed time periods of aeration and non aeration 2 3 analysis and measurement during the entire experimental period the influent effluent and sludge samples were placed in an icebox and brought to environmental engineering laboratory at iit roorkee until analysis could be performed selected in situ operational parameters and reactor conditions such as ph dissolved oxygen do hrt waste activated sludge was rates and return activated sludge ras rates were monitored and measured on each sampling day while oxidation reduction potential orp was monitored in batch mode the major treatment performance parameters such as 3 day biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to standard methods 66 the mixed liquor suspended phase biom hrt waste activated sludge was rates and return activated sludge ras rates were monitored and measured on each sampling day while oxidation reduction potential orp was monitored in batch mode the major treatment performance parameters such as 3 day biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to standard methods 66 the mixed liquor suspended phase biomass samples were collected from the ifas reactor and characterized by mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge volume index svi measurements by following the procedure as presented in standard methods 66 the electrical energy consumption was calculated by considering the rating and running hours of blower unit 2 4 eps quantification in order to examine the physiochemical condition of the suspended biomass in ifas reactor the total concentration of eps termed as epst was measured in present study the soluble termed as soluble microbial products smp and bound eps concentrations were determined according to zhang et al 38 di bella et al 39 di bella and torregrossa 40 the total eps both bound and soluble concentration was calculated as the sum of the above two described fractions according to the below equation eps t eps b smp epsbp epsbc smpp smpc where epsb bound eps smp soluble microbial product here subscripts p and c indicate the content of proteins and carbohydrates in the epsb and smp respectively in order to measure the contents of proteins and carbohydrates in bound and soluble eps lowry s folin method 41 and anthrone s method 42 were used respectively 2 5 microscopic examination of sludge for microscopic analysis the suspended biomass from the aeration tank of ifas reactor was examined using an olympus bright field microscope bh 2 olympus co ltd tokyo japan relative abundance of filamentous microorganisms in suspended biomass during different experimental runs was determined using the filamentous index fi method 43 44 a scale range from 0 to 6 from none to excessive was used to determine the filamentous bacteria abundance with values as follows 0 none 1 few 2 some 3 common 4 very common 5 abundant and 6 excessive simplified technique of filamentous count stfc was used for counting of filamentous bacteria in per ml of sludge samples 43 45 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance under intermittent aeration conditions the treatment potential of the present ifas system was also examined under studied ia conditions the ifas system was operated with f m ratio of 0 38 0 47 and 0 53 and sludge retention time as 4 6 3 7 and 4 8 days in ia1 ia2 ia3 period respectively in spite of great variation in influent characteristics the average cod values of effluent were observed as 33 29 and 42 mg l achieving the mean removal efficiencies as 96 97 and 96 in ia1 ia2 and ia3 period respectively the bod removal efficiencies also follows the same trend and reported in the range of 90 95 these results indicate that non aeration times of applied experimental conditions had an insignificant effect on overall removal efficiencies of organic matter with regard to tss concentrations the average values were almost same and amounted as 15 mg l under all ia conditions considering the nutrient parameters the average ammonia concentrations in the effluent were noted below 1 5 and 7 mg l in the period ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively while the average nitrate concentrations in the effluent in the same periods were 8 6 and 4 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of total nitrogen varied in the range of 70 80 under all applied ia conditions overall the experimental results showed that both nitrification and denitrification may successfully be carded out into present ifas system developing anaerobic and aerobic conditions in ifas reactors has been noticed by researchers recently therefore tp removal efficiencies were examined in the present system and removal efficiencies were found to be inversely proportional to the duration of non aeration time in each ia phase the average tp removal rate dropped from 80 to 43 when changing the aeration cycle from ia1 to ia3 overall the ifas reactor was effective in removing bod cod tss and tn irrespective of cycle characteristics more details about the treatment performance are documented in our previous published works 12 13 3 2 eps production and microscopic observations a change in the bioreactor operational conditions such as shear rate mixing and flow patterns or aeration intensity could change the eps content in activated sludge 47 some researchers also reported that the amount of carbohydrate content in extracted eps from activated sludge increases with the increased air flow in some batch reactors such as sequential bioreactors whereas the amount of protein

furthermore the prevailing conditions of bioreactor such as aerobic or anaerobic can also influence the eps production it is also documented in literature that activated sludge flocs tend to break or solubilize in containing solutions under oxygen limiting environments such dissolution of microbial aggregates might be caused either by the hindrance in eps production or by the hydrolysis process of

dissolved oxygen levels whereas insignificant changes were observed in protein content at the same conditions contrary the similar concentrations of both carbohydrates and proteins were observed at a low dissolved oxygen levels fig 2 a reports the specific eps content total mg eps per gram of ss of suspended biomass in each experimental state while fig 2b depicts the carbohydrate and protein

on the biomass that anoxic conditions exerted on the biomass due to release of smp by cell autolysis under anoxic conditions and loosely bound eps lbeps from attached biomass of reactor 52 54 differently slightly less variation was observed in bound eps as compared to smp concentrations however further studies are required to confirm these hypotheses carbohydrate and protein mixtures are crucial components of eps to control the microbial activity and destruction in bioreactor systems carbohydrate concentration was found to be in increasing order in bound eps 21 28 36 and 49 mg l and smp 18 13 22 and 34 mg l while protein content in bound eps was almost stable varied between 176 and 191 mg l under all intermittent aeration conditions on the other side protein content of smp was found to increasing and observed as 26 32 41 and 46 mg l in continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 runs respectively this might be due to increase in non aeration period therefore the longer durations of non aeration time in ia cycles might enhance the denitrification activity but may have a significant impact on overall eps production these results were quite similar to previous studies 20 in which longer aeration off times were found to be responsible for exploded cell growth and consequently increased eps concentrations 3 3 control of filamentous organisms the abundance of various types of filamentous microorganisms often leads to poor settling and sometime promotes the bulking sludge in biological wastewater treatment systems this phenomenon is mainly associated with low do conditions

examination of suspended sludge the concentrations of thin filaments were visually quantified using fi values over the whole experimental time the fi remained between fi2 fi3 this observation is attested in fig 3 a c it was also observed that during intermittent aeration runs most stalked ciliated disappeared and free swimming small flagellates were found to be predominant this caused the high svi values during intermittent aeration period however free swimming protozoa survived under the ia conditions these results suggest that intermittent aeration conditions allow predators to survive which contributed to the decrease in the sludge amount through their predation on the dispersed bacteria 3 4 sludge production and characterization fig 4 a shows the variation in mlss and svi values in the mixed liquor of ifas reactor during various experimental schedules observing fig 4a it is worth noting that during the whole period mlss values were almost stable concentrations varied between 1338 1452 1355 1405 and 1280 1312 mg l during ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively the averaged ratio of volatile to suspended solids was found to be fluctuating a little around a mean value of 0 73 this indicates that small amount of inorganic compounds and discernible inert are accumulated in the bioreactor during the whole experimental period the sludge settleability was affected significantly by increasing the non aeration period in intermittent aeration cycle and higher svi values are achieved in run ia3 as compared to ia1 and ia2 however in all the intermittent aeration runs the svi values were above the settleability threshold of 155 ml g at continuous aeration mode the increased svi values ranging between 186 and 203 218 238 and 241 267 ml g in ia run 1 2 and 3 were observed for present ifas system these increased values of svi were also evidenced by presence of thin filaments in suspended biomass another reason behind the increased svi values may be more eps production which may have a pessimistic effect on the settleability of microbial aggregates 56 generally the eps are negatively charged and high concentration of eps increases the surface charge of microbes which can result in an increased repulsive forces between microbial cells and a decrease in the settleability of microbial aggregates 57 it is also important to mention here that whenever plant goes under intermittent aeration phase the aeration basin acts as sludge storage and due to the fact that the aeration had no mixers hence whenever blowers are turned off suspended phase biomass settled down within a short period of time this cyclic phenomenon also affected adversely the sludge characteristics as reported in other similar systems 58 the sludge production was also estimated in each phase and presented in fig 4b it can be seen from this figure that reduced sludge production was observed in intermittent aeration mode with values noted as 8 56 8 35 7 39 and 5 79 kg d during continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively this reduction with aeration off time can be attributed to lesser biomass produced under anoxic conditions as compared to aerobic conditions in general length of non aeration period determines the net sludge production during cyclic intermittent aeration operation of biological reactors furthermore a reduced anoxic endogenous respiration rate may be responsible for the reduced sludge yield 59 3 5 orp do ph monitoring in biological wastewater treatment systems ph do and orp charts can provide useful information about the biological process such as operational conditions over aeration and under aeration microorganism activity and process inhibition 60 61 to facilitate the process understanding characteristic profiles of ph do and orp versus time in each intermittent cycle have been observed in the present ifas system fig 5 in each graph vertical line represents the start and end of non aeration phase it is possible to see from fig 5 that the do concentration drops down almost to zero in each ia run the peak positive and negative orp values were observed as 25 32 7 27 32 9 and 49 43 2 mv for ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively compared with the negative orp value of ia1 and ia2 run the values for ia3 was slightly lower because the mixed liquor in aeration basin was much more in reduced state caused by decreased aeration time and increased non aeration time it can also be seen from the graph that although the positive peak values of orp were high in ia3 but non aeration duration was lower than ia1 and ia2 that is why significant ammonia removal could not be achieved the appreciable fluctuation of orp curve during non aeration period and initial stage of aeration on period was also encountered in ia 3 it may be also due to no mixing during the anoxic period in aeration basin and high concentration gradient of reduced substances between supernatant and settled sludge layers with regard to ph change not much variation was observed in each phase 3 6 electric energy consumption in the intermittent aeration processes alternation of aerobic and anoxic phases in the same bioreactor allows to obtain an effective decrease in the energy utilization 15 62 moreover in a carbon constrained future intermittent aeration also has the potential of minimizing the operational costs associated with aeration and needs to be carefully evaluated 63 65 previous studies have also reported significant energy consumption varying in the range of 10 30 18 19 23 in the present study the actual power requirement for the pilot was calculated by estimating the power required by the electro mechanical unit installed in pilot and the data of the performed cycles a comparison of the total energy consumption during the continuous aeration and intermittent aeration periods table 3 showed that the energy savings achieved from ia schedules was 12 24 and 28 kw per day for run ia 1 ia2 and ia3 respectively the most significant savings was obtained by calculating the energy specific consumptions and noted as 2 21 1 94 and 1 82 kw m3 for run ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively an average energy saving of 11 42 for ia1 22 24 for ia 2 and 27 05 for ia3 was achieved which were in good agreement with previous literature values 62 10 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are as follows eps production by suspended biomass increased as the ratio of non aeration to aeration time got longer probably due to operational stress condition on the biomass and release of smp from bound eps during non aeration periods the content at 150 30 min 120 60 min and 90 60 min aeration on off time increased 1 32 times 1 47 and 1 78 times respectively as compared to values of continuous aeration mode operation the total sludge production by pilot decreased up to 3 7 13 6 and 32 3 in run 1 2 and 3 respectively the high svi values confirmed that the settling characteristics disturbed during intermittent aeration and found to be proportional to ratio of non aeration to aeration time this fact was also evidenced by the increasing presence of filamentous microorganism contemporary to the organics and nutrient removals also proportional energy savings in the range of 10 30 was attained acknowledgement department of science and technology india and european union within the 7th framework program under project saraswati and grant number

14564,produced water is a wastewater from oil and gas industries which contains harmful pollutants it is crucial to treat the produced water properly before reuse or to be disposed of membrane separation technology have been applied for produced water treatment however this method encountered the problems such as fouling in this research the membrane technology was designed as double stages to overcome the fouling problem in the double stages mode the first stage was responsible for rejecting organic foulants and the second stage contributed to reduce dissolved solids specifically modified nano hybrid membrane was implemented and this research is aimed to evaluate the membrane performance during filtration processes using single stage and double stage system the nanohybrid pes nano zno membranes were prepared via nips methods followed by surface modifications via uv irradiation and thermal annealing treatment result of sem images showed that uv irradiation on the membrane surface confirmed more finger like porous structure and thinner dense layer water contact angle measurement showed that the nano zno incorporation and uv irradiation increased hydrophilicity by lowering the water contact angle from 63 to 53 63 filtration tests exhibited that the flux increased up to 18 and rejection of tds improved up to 15 in double stages process the double stages process

continue to increase after the industrial revolution indonesia put 47 percent of its energy consumption to petroleum in addition oil and gas industry is contingent for the indonesian economics 1 a big exploration is required to fulfill the high demand of energy from oil and gas produced water is generated in large volume during oil and gas production global produced water production is estimated at around 250 million barrels of water per day in indonesia produced water is projected at around 12 million barrels of water per day 2 3 this water specification is different because it contains hazardous chemical substances and matters in the oil and gas the usage of produced water and an unprocessed waste of produced water contains a lot of dangerous substances that can endanger the environmental stability produced water contains 1 2 200 mg l of oil total dissolved solid tds of 1000 15 000 mg l cod of 20 2250 mg l and tss around 5 4200 mg l 4 in addition the produced water contains toxic substances such as dissolved hydrocarbon including benzene toluene naphthalene and phenols 2 heavy metals including cd cr cu pb hg ni ag and zn 5 moreover naturally occurring radioactive materials norm for example 226radium and 228radium are the most abundant norm in produced water 6 all of the concentration that consists in produced water doesn t meet the quality standard that already set in the indonesian minister of environment regulation no 19 of 2010 for the quality standard of wastewater for oil and gas and geothermal business and activities 7 produced water can be adequately utilized after being treated to make it drinkable or usable studies conducted to identify verify and compile existing and newly developed techniques demonstrate the economic benefits of produced water treatment 2 many technologies have been applied for produced water treatment both in physical and chemical treatment centrifuge and hydro cyclone are examples of conventional physical treatment by using centrifugal force to separate oil droplets and suspended solid however the technology was not able to separate soluble solid and energy requirement was relatively high 8 extraction and chemical treatment such as ozone treatment also has been applied for produced water treatment nevertheless wastes from solvent regeneration and sludge were highly obtained which requires further complex treatment 9 membrane based separation process for produced water treatment have been intensively studied however the conventional membrane application still needs high pressure due to membrane fouling of oil and grease the strategy of membrane modification and application on its implementation for produced water treatment needs a high attention to achieve membrane separation with low fouling and low pressure driving force 10 previous studies to overcome the fouling problem in the membrane application for produced water treatment have been found membrane surface modifications have been accomplished to enhance anti fouling behaviour of the membrane such as cross linking 11 photo grafting 12 uv irradiation 13 membrane coating 14 and plasma treatment 15 the incorporation of the inorganic material into organic matrix also has been applied in membrane development 16 17 kumar et al 18 embedded bentonite particle in the polysulfone polymer to enhance rejection and permeability as well as lowering the foulant deposition kusworo et al 19 introduced nano silica in polyethersulfone membrane to improve the membrane performance for produced water treatment nano zno tio2 graphene oxide cnt were the typical nanomaterials that were usually embedded in membrane material 20 23 generally an effort to reduce fouling on the membrane by membrane modifications is focused on enhancing membrane hydrophilicity the hydrophilic membrane has been reported successfully reduce the oil droplet deposition on the membrane through lowering the surface tension 24 however all the strategies still did not significantly increase membrane productivity in this research the membrane system was modified where the separation process was designed as double stages with a different type of membrane in this study the two stage membrane filtration is aimed to separate large particles in the first stage while the finer substrates are separated in the secondary stage this is a novel concept in filtering oily produced water where the first stage filtration is focused on rejecting the fouling initiator such as oil droplet and organic pollutants further the second stages contribute to reducing the dissolved solid in permeate water by applying this concept the membrane is more applicable for produced water treatment with longer membrane life time and high productivity in addition the study investigated several modifications such as nano zno incorporation uv irradiation thermal annealed and the combination treatment the synergistic work between the stages is expected to improve membrane filtration performance and prolong the lifetime of the membrane during produced water treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 materials polyethersulfone veradel pesu 3100p and glass transition temperature tg 220 c was supplied from solvay advanced material 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp as a solvent was provided from merck nano material zno and polyethylene glycol peg 400 4000 and 6000 da were purchased from nano center indonesia original produced water as feed was obtained from pt pertamina and characteristics of produced water sample are displayed in table 1 2 2 preparation membrane polyethersulfone pes nano zno membranes were prepared at various concentration of zno and uv irradiation after that the membranes were exposed to thermal annealing treatment polyethersulfone pes with a composition of 23 dissolved with nanoparticle zno 0 5 1 and 1 5 in total solid n methyl 2 pyrrolidine nmp with 77 composition as a solvent added in polyethersulfone pes and zno the solution is stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 4 6 h until a homogeneous solution was obtained then the solution is cast by dry wet phase inversion on a glass plate with manual casting knife the thickness of the membrane was 150 μm the membrane was exposed to uv irradiation treatment for 1 5 and 10 min further the membrane was immersed immediately in a coagulation bath for overnight at room temperature in order to confirm that the solvent in the membrane was completely removed after that the membranes were dried for overnight at 30 c or room temperature finally the membrane was ready for use in produced water treatment 2 3 characterization of pes nano zno membrane 2 3 1 flux and rejection of membrane the prepared membranes were applied for produced water treatment the performance of membrane in double stages system was compared with membrane performance in single stage system neat pes 23 wt was used in single stage filtration and modified pes membranes were used in double stages filtration the performance of the membrane was evaluated according to permeate flux profile as a function of time and solute rejection the permeate flux of membrane was determined by measuring the permeate water volume every 40 min during filtration process in the cross flow system as shown in fig 1 the permeate flux was then calculated by using eq 1 1 j w v w a p t where jw flux l m2 hr vw volume of permeate l t time hr a membrane surface area m2 p pressure difference bar in addition rejections of suspended solids dissolved solids chloride and sulfide ions were determined to evaluate the membrane performance the solute rejections at any point were defined by eq 2 as follow 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where r rejection cf concentration feed cp concentration permeate 2 3 2 scanning electron

zno and surface modification on the membrane morphology the sem images both surface and cross section are very useful to observe the morphology of the membrane which can then be used to understand the membrane transport properties 26 there were several membranes tested on this analysis pes 23 wt pes 23 wt 0 5 wt zno and pes 23 wt 0 5 zno with uv for 10 min and thermal annealing at 180 c fig 2 a shows the images of sem on the surface and cross section membrane of pes 23 wt fig 2b shows sem analysis of surface and cross section membrane pes 23 wt 0 5 wt zno the surface of the membrane without zno nanoparticles is smoother than a membrane with zno nanoparticle loading see fig 2a 1 and b 1 no void is observed on the membrane surface at 5 000x magnification indicating that the membranes do not have macro voids in fig 2b there are white spots presumably indicating zno nanoparticles at higher concentration of nano zno the agglomerate formation is possible to happen the particle agglomeration on the membrane surface significantly decreases the separation efficiency of the membrane the membrane cross sectional structure images show a dense layer in the top layer a finger like porous structure in the middle layer and another dense layer in the bottom layer dense layer is responsible for maintaining the separation efficiency while porous structure contributes to maintaining the permeability of the membrane based on fig 2a and b the membrane with nano zno loading has fewer finger like porous structure this phenomenon might be due to the slow demixing process during coagulation in non solvent furthermore the presence of nanoparticles caused interfere on the solvent demixing and the separation processes became slower this phenomenon results in a thicker dense layer which could increase the separation efficiency however with this condition the permeability will be lower fig 2c shows the sem images of uv irradiated and thermal annealed membrane with nano zno incorporation the surface of the modified membrane fig 2c 1 has a smoother surface than unmodified membrane fig 2b 1 this is due to the uv irradiation on the membrane with nano zno loading initiated the attachment between the nano zno particle surface and pes matrix the uv irradiation on the membrane pes is well known to improve the membrane hydrophilicity the hydrophilic polymer is more comfortable to attach to nano zno particles moreover the smoother membrane reduces the potential of foulant deposition on the membrane surface in fig 2c 2 a membrane with uv irradiation and the annealing has more finger like porous structure than membrane without uv and thermal modification see fig 2b 2 therefore the dense membrane layer of modified membrane became thinner when filtration is carried out by using a membrane with uv and thermal annealing it increases the value of the flux and the rejection of the membrane fig 2d shows the sem images of the modified membrane after being used for produced water filtration as shown in fig 2d 2 the porous structure is not compacted even after being used for filtration process it indicates that the membrane with nano zno loading is better in term of mechanical properties fouling on the membrane surface is defined as the accumulation of the particles that retained during the filtration process fouling causes the performance of membrane to decrease over time 3 2 mwco pore size and porosity measurement results the mwco measurements were carried out using peg method five percent wt peg solute with a molecular weight of 400 4000 and 6000 da were used for this measurement the result of mwco experiment for 23 pes membrane 23 nano zno 0 5 wt and 23 pes 23 nano zno 0 5 wt with uv irradiation shown in fig 3 the mwco values for each membrane are shown in table 2 based on table 2 pes membrane without the addition of zno nano particles has the lowest value of mwco porosity and average pore radius the mwco value of pes 23 pes nano zno and uv irradiated pes nano zno are 2600 4640 and 5275 da respectively a membrane with nano zno loading has a higher mwco value confirming that the pores of modified membrane are larger than neat pes membrane this phenomenon might be due to the insufficient attachment between two phases nanoparticle surface and pes polymer porosity or void fraction is a measure of the void spaces in a material and is a fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume pes membranes with the addition of zno nano particles have a higher porosity value giving higher permeate flux as well addition of uv also offers a higher porosity value because it can change the polymer structure where more finger like porous structures are formed the uv irradiation slightly increases the temperature of casted dope solution which is lowering the viscosity of the casted dope solution and providing rapid demixing during coagulation the rapid demixing result on the higher finger like porous structure on the membrane this result is accordance with permeation test where the uv irradiated membrane shows higher permeate flux 3 2 1 water contact angle results the contact angle measurements are one of the standard methods to measure the wettability and hydrophilicity of membrane surface if the water contact angle is smaller than 90 the solid surface is considered hydrophilic the effect of nano zno loading on water contact angle values is shown in table 3 and the effect of uv irradiation can is listed in table 4 according to tables 3 and 4 pes without the nano zno incorporation and uv irradiation have the highest contact angle value of θ 63 indicating that pes is slightly hydrophobic in contrast the addition of nano zno can improve the hydrophilic properties of the membrane this is confirmed by the value of its contact angle which decreased from 61 34 to 53 63 due to the properties of nano zno particles the nano zno particles have a large surface area so particles can easily absorb hydrophilic hydroxyl group oh which provides hydrophilic properties the free paired electrons in zno molecule could be contributors to hydrophilicity enhancement the results correspond with previous researcher 27 which reported that the hydrophilic properties of the membrane could enhance by incorporating hydrophilic nanoparticles for uv irradiation the longer radiation was also have effect on the contact angle values the longer radiation time the contact angle value of the membrane decreased the membrane s hydrophilic properties increase by subjecting the membrane under uv irradiation this could be due to the formation of the hydrophilic group in membrane after being exposed to uv ray a similar result was found in the previous research conducted by konruang et al 28 on the modification of asymmetric polysulfone membrane surfaces by irradiation the uv irradiation was applied before the membrane being coagulated thus the demixing process was delayed which is resulting in smoother membrane surface smooth membrane surface has lower surface tension than rough membrane surface the more hydrophilic membrane is preferred because the hydrophilic membrane surface strongly rejects the oil droplet due to its hydrophobicity oil droplet deposition initiates the foulant formation on the membrane if the oil droplet deposition can be minimized then the fouling can be mitigated 3 3 membrane performance on single stage 3 3 1 effect of ultraviolet uv irradiation on membrane performance fig 4 shows the permeate flux profile of membrane with different uv irradiation time the profiles show that all flux decline with the time of filtration process the flux decline is caused by the membrane compaction and foulant deposition over the membrane the highest permeate flux is achieved by a membrane with 10 min uv irradiation at the initial flux up to 28 l m2h the initial permeate fluxes of the membrane with 5 min 1 min and without irradiation are 26 25 and 16 l m2h respectively this phenomenon is caused by the effects of uv light exposure to the polymer membrane the uv light induced the polymer chains to restructure and grafting so that the polymer becomes denser while the more prolonged exposure of uv light on the membrane surface it leads to the polymer chain degradation of polyethersulfone polymer as the consequences the membrane pores are larger the membrane hydrophilicity of pes membrane and the flux increase a similar result also has been reported by konruang et al 28 where pes membrane becomes more hydrophilic after exposing under uv lights its contact angle values also confirm it with uv irradiation the contact angle membrane is 58 0 which is lower than without uv irradiation membrane contact angle of 62 the smaller the contact angles indicates the membrane has hydrophilic or water like properties fig 5 a d sequentially show the effect of uv irradiation on the rejection of tds s2 cl and turbidity it can be seen that the longer filtration time the value of the membrane rejection increases with the phenomena occurring at each rejection it can be concluded that the percent of membrane rejection with uv irradiation 1 min significantly higher than that of uv irradiated membrane rejection as well as irradiation with 5 min and 10 min the uv irradiation effect causes this phenomenon and creates membrane have chain scission and crosslinking these cause membrane pores are denser and preventing more contaminant pass to permeate however longer uv irradiation has effect on the formation of a chain polymer degradation in the membrane polymer 29 the degradation can be a chemical change reaction or decomposition of a compound or molecule into a simpler compound or molecule 30 as a result more prominent membrane pores are formed and make it easier to diffuse water through the membrane pores on the other hand the longer the filtration time the entire percent of the rejection ion increases because the inorganic and organic substances in the produced water have been retained on the surface of the membrane the different rejection efficiency among the contaminants is caused by the particle size of each contaminant for example turbidity rejection is the highest rejection efficiency which can be achieved by membrane up to 97 98 turbidity in the wastewater arises due to the dispersed particulates the solid particles have significantly large size to be visually observed these particulates are easily rejected by the membrane with nanometer pore size however the particulate will be a foulant on the membrane with the presence of oil droplets on the other hand tds s2 cl are dissolved solid which invisible to be observed visually the size of ions is much lower than turbidity particulate and the rejection efficiencies are similar to 15 40 3 3 2 effect of zno concentration fig 6 exhibits the flux profile of pes membrane with different nano zno loading the flux profiles decline during the filtration process it takes place because the longer filtration time the filtration pressure increases the increase in pressure indicates fouling on the membrane surface and cause the pores of the membrane is closed and hence decrease the permeate volume it can also be seen from fig 5 that there is a difference in the flux value of each zno concentration the membrane with zno has higher flux than the membrane without zno the higher flux is due to the zno can increase the membrane hydrophilicity the hydrophilic properties of zno are confirmed by the contact angle results table 3 where with the addition of zno the contact angle is lower zno causes the hydrophilic and the this characteristic causes the water produced flows easier through the membrane as a result permeate volume is higher and the flux value increases however the addition of nano zno higher than 0 5 wt was observed to give the flux value lower than the membrane flux with 0 5 wt loading 31 high concentration of nano zno loading will form nano particles aggregation and the zno will accumulate at one point or not spread as a whole nano domain in filtration processes this is not favourable because the separation performance decreases significantly in this research the optimum condition of zno is 0 5 wt fig 7 presents the effect of zno concentration on the tds s2 cl and turbidity rejection it can be seen that the longer filtration time the value of the membrane rejection increases nevertheless the higher concentration of zno the rejection decreases as for s2 ion rejection as shown in fig 6b the same point takes place in s2 where with longer filtering time the value of rejection increases similar phenomenon also occurs in cl rejection and turbidity rejection as shown in fig 6c and d respectively stating the degree of clarity inside water in rejection turbidity also occurs the increase in rejection over time according to fig 7a d it can be seen that with the addition of zno rejection of membrane will increase this phenomenon indicated that addition of zno provides the sieving mechanism of separation so with the smaller pores the rejection of the membrane will increase this phenomenon occurs in case the concentration of nano zno loading is below 0 5 wt in addition of nano zno higher than 0 5 wt it causes aggregate on the membrane so that membrane performance will decrease the aggregate will form on the surface of the membrane thus making the surface of the membrane is not homogeneous as a consequence it makes the membrane performance unequal on each surface and the membrane s ability to hold particles on each side of the surface is not the same 3 4 effect of thermal annealing based on fig 8 it can be seen that the flux value without thermal annealing is higher than a membrane with thermal annealing although the difference is not very significant thermal annealing causes the value of membrane flux to decrease the phenomenon occurs because the membrane with a thermal annealing at a temperature of 180 c is close to the pes polymer glass transition temperature tg 220 c 32 the closer of the glass transition temperature causes breaking of molecular bonds between polymer in the pes membrane and hence the membrane becomes denser with a thicker dense skin layer structure 33 a tight membrane structure causes the flux value is less than membrane without thermal annealing fig 9 a shows the effect of thermal annealing on tds rejection where the longer the filtration time the membrane rejection increase the rejection of the membrane using thermal annealing is found higher than membrane without thermal annealing in fig 9b the rejection profile of s2 is shown presenting similar phenomenon as tds rejection it is also occurred in cl ion rejection and turbidity rejection as displaying in fig 9c and d respectively both rejection profile confirms the increase in rejection over time fig 9a d shows that the rejection value of tds turbidity s2 ion and cl ion with thermal annealing is higher than without thermal annealing its because thermal annealing causes narrowing of pore size 34 the thermal annealing treatment causes the re arrangement of membrane molecules so that the membrane is denser the particulates are stuck on the membrane surface because the pores are getting denser it causes membrane rejection with thermal annealing higher than without thermal annealing differences in membrane rejection to tds turbidity s2 ions and cl ions are caused by the response or the ability of the membrane to reject components differently so the rejection results of each ion are varied 3 5 the comparison of membrane performance on single stage and double stage separation double separation is implemented to improve membrane performance in this system permeate of the initial membrane filtration is redistributed and used as feed for filtration using a second membrane since the best result of single filtration single stage was obtained from the 0 5 pes nano zno membrane hence this membrane was applied to the double stages separation system based on fig 10 a the flux value in the second filtration is bigger representing a better performance than those flux at the single separation system more particles have been retained on the first membrane so the higher the value of flux is obtained moreover for double stage the highest flux value was also obtained on the pes nano zno membrane with 0 5 wt of zno in total solid and 10 min irradiation time with uv this phenomenon is presumably caused by the increase of the hydrophilic value of the membrane creating easier diffusion of water through the membrane pores previous work 35 also demonstrated that double stages provided better performance in permeate flux due to the most organic foulants were retained in the first stage this research investigated the performance of the membrane in the double stage system in the term of membrane rejection fig 10b shows a comparison of each rejection on a single stage and double stages on both stages the same membrane pes nano zno 0 5 wt is implemented based on fig 10b it can be seen that the percent of rejection of tds s2 cl and turbidity in double stages has a greater result than the single stage this is undoubtedly because the filtration system is performed twice where the inorganic and organic particles from the produced water have been much restrained on the surface of the membrane pes nano zno in the initial stage in the second stage the pes nano zno membrane was exposed to thermal annealing treatment or heating which makes the membrane pores closer and makes the membrane performance to retain the impurity particles is better 3 6 the comparison of solutes concentration of feed and permeate in double stages produced water contains various dissolved pollutants such as minerals dispersed and organic oils as well as suspended pollutants such as suspended solids implementation of the conventional membrane filtration has a risk of damaging the membrane due to fouling formation on membrane surface and result on the decline of permeability and solute rejection such occurrences are not found in double stages system where permeate fluxes are maintained and solute rejection increased in this work four parameters of produced water were used to observe the quality of produced water both in feed and permeate the best membrane performance was achieved using nanohybrid pes nano zno with 1 min uv irradiation the concentrations of pollutant solutes in feed and permeate water are shown in table 5 based on table 5 the concentration of total dissolved solids tds chloride cl sulfide s2 and turbidity in produced water feed and permeate are presented total dissolved solid chloride represents the mineral content in produced water sulfide is an essential parameter in produced water because sulfide is a toxic substance that is commonly found in produced water the turbidity of produced water indicates the concentration of visible suspended solid the concentration of tds decreased significantly from 6600 to 3900 mg l rejection efficiency of 41 since the concentration of tds in permeate still relatively high after filtrated using nanofiltration membrane in double stages it indicates that the most minerals content in produced water are monovalent ions this corresponds to the decrease of chloride concentration from 1975 to 669 mg l rejection efficiency of 66 where the concentration of cl in permeate is relatively high the rejection of sulfide is higher than tds and cl rejection 85 because sulfide is divalent ions which effectively rejected by nanofiltration membrane turbidity shows highest rejection efficiency with 99 8 rejection even though the concentration of tds and cl still relatively higher than clean water quality standard however the double stages concept shows some improvements than the conventional nanofiltration the implementation of double stages concept demonstrates higher flux and rejection as well as lower fouling formation 3 7 the stability of membrane in determining membrane performance it is necessary to consider the stability of the membrane the stability of a membrane is influenced by fouling or particles retained on the surface of the membrane the stability of the membrane between single stage and double stages membrane system is shown in fig 11 according to the figure the double stages membrane system is more stable than the single stage membrane system in addition it is presented that flux value in double stages is higher on the single stage membrane system some particles are previously deposited on the membrane surface so the work of double stages membranes is easier moreover it is possible that fouling in the single stage membrane system is more than the double stages membrane system the fouling is accumulated on the membrane surface and affect the permeate rate empirically the foulant deposition on the single stage membrane system is more than the double stage membrane system this was due to in the single stage membrane system large to small particles are filtered in the same membrane in the double stages membrane system the filtration process is easier because large particles size is previously filtered through the first membrane as a result the second membrane is performed on filtering s2 cl and others the fouling on the single stage membrane system is greater and the membrane performance in the single stage easily decreased hence it is confirmed that the stability of the double stages membrane system is better than the single stage membrane system 4 conclusion performance of membrane increased with membrane modification by nano zno incorporation the nano zno loading in the membrane significantly improved the membrane hydrophilicity by lowering the contact angle value from 63 to 53 in addition uv irradiation decreased the contact angle value from 62 to 58 nano hybrid membranes that were subjected to the uv ray enhanced the flux from 16 to 25 28 l hm2 in contrast the addition of nano zno significantly improved the tds rejection from 10 to 18 the thermal annealing treatment also gave an improvement in tds rejection from 16 to 22 double stages configuration showed higher value both of flux and pollutant rejection experimentally the initial flux enhanced from 26 to 32 l hm2 by double stages system and the tds rejection also increased from 18 to 22 this strategy is expected can be applied in industrial scale produced water treatment with lower fouling deposition and higher productivity acknowledgement the author would like to thanks to the management board and staffs of waste treatment laboratory of the department of chemical engineering diponegoro university for the supports and facilities during the research 
14564,produced water is a wastewater from oil and gas industries which contains harmful pollutants it is crucial to treat the produced water properly before reuse or to be disposed of membrane separation technology have been applied for produced water treatment however this method encountered the problems such as fouling in this research the membrane technology was designed as double stages to overcome the fouling problem in the double stages mode the first stage was responsible for rejecting organic foulants and the second stage contributed to reduce dissolved solids specifically modified nano hybrid membrane was implemented and this research is aimed to evaluate the membrane performance during filtration processes using single stage and double stage system the nanohybrid pes nano zno membranes were prepared via nips methods followed by surface modifications via uv irradiation and thermal annealing treatment result of sem images showed that uv irradiation on the membrane surface confirmed more finger like porous structure and thinner dense layer water contact angle measurement showed that the nano zno incorporation and uv irradiation increased hydrophilicity by lowering the water contact angle from 63 to 53 63 filtration tests exhibited that the flux increased up to 18 and rejection of tds improved up to 15 in double stages process the double stages process also presented less foulant deposition on the membrane surface it was demonstrated that the concept of double stages process in filtering produced water provided a better performance than the

reducing the dissolved solid in permeate water by applying this concept the membrane is more applicable for produced water treatment with longer membrane life time and high productivity in addition the study investigated several modifications such as nano zno incorporation uv irradiation thermal annealed and the combination treatment the synergistic work between the stages is expected to improve membrane filtration performance and prolong the lifetime of the membrane during produced water treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 materials polyethersulfone veradel pesu 3100p and glass transition

purchased from nano center indonesia original produced water as feed was obtained from pt pertamina and characteristics of produced water sample are displayed in table 1 2 2 preparation membrane

order to confirm that the solvent in the membrane was completely removed after that the membranes were dried for overnight at 30 c or room temperature finally the membrane was ready for use in produced water treatment 2 3 characterization of pes nano zno membrane 2 3 1 flux and rejection of membrane the prepared membranes were applied for produced water treatment the performance of membrane in double stages system was compared with membrane performance in single stage system neat pes 23 wt was used in single stage filtration and modified pes membranes were used in double stages filtration the performance of the membrane was evaluated according to permeate flux profile as a function of time and solute rejection the permeate flux of membrane was determined by measuring the permeate water volume every 40 min during filtration process in the cross flow system as shown in fig 1 the permeate flux was then calculated by using eq 1 1 j w v w a p t where jw flux l m2 hr vw volume of permeate l t time hr a membrane surface area m2 p pressure difference bar in addition rejections of suspended solids dissolved solids chloride and sulfide ions were determined to evaluate the membrane performance the solute rejections at any point were defined by eq 2 as follow 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where r rejection cf concentration feed cp concentration permeate 2 3 2 scanning electron

zno and surface modification on the membrane morphology the sem images both surface and cross section are very useful to observe the morphology of the membrane which can then be used to understand the membrane transport properties 26 there were several membranes tested on this analysis pes 23 wt pes 23 wt 0 5 wt zno and pes 23 wt 0 5 zno with uv for 10 min and thermal annealing at 180 c fig 2 a shows the images of sem on the surface and cross section membrane of pes 23 wt fig 2b shows sem analysis of surface and cross section membrane pes 23 wt 0 5 wt zno the surface of the membrane without zno nanoparticles is smoother than a membrane with zno nanoparticle loading see fig 2a 1 and b 1 no void is observed on the membrane surface at 5 000x magnification indicating that the membranes do not have macro voids in fig 2b there are white spots presumably indicating zno nanoparticles at higher concentration of nano zno the agglomerate formation is possible to happen the particle agglomeration on the membrane surface significantly decreases the separation efficiency of the membrane the membrane cross sectional structure images show a dense layer in the top layer a finger like porous structure in the middle layer and another dense layer in the bottom layer dense layer is responsible for maintaining the separation efficiency while porous structure contributes to maintaining the permeability of the membrane based on fig 2a and b the membrane with nano zno loading has fewer finger like porous structure this phenomenon might be due to the slow demixing process during coagulation in non solvent furthermore the presence of nanoparticles caused interfere on the solvent demixing and the separation processes became slower this phenomenon results in a thicker dense layer which could increase the separation efficiency however with this condition the permeability will be lower fig 2c shows the sem images of uv irradiated and thermal annealed membrane with nano zno incorporation the surface of the modified membrane fig 2c 1 has a smoother surface than unmodified membrane fig 2b 1 this is due to the uv irradiation on the membrane with nano zno loading initiated the attachment between the nano zno particle surface and pes matrix the uv irradiation on the membrane pes is well known to improve the membrane hydrophilicity the hydrophilic polymer is more comfortable to attach to nano zno particles moreover the smoother membrane reduces the potential of foulant deposition on the membrane surface in fig 2c 2 a membrane with uv irradiation and the annealing has more finger like porous structure than membrane without uv and thermal modification see fig 2b 2 therefore the dense membrane layer of modified membrane became thinner when filtration is carried out by using a membrane with uv and thermal annealing it increases the value of the flux and the rejection of the membrane fig 2d shows the sem images of the modified membrane after being used for produced water filtration as shown in fig 2d 2 the porous structure is not compacted even after being used for filtration process it indicates that the membrane with nano zno loading is better in term of mechanical properties fouling on the membrane surface is defined as the accumulation of the particles that retained during the filtration process fouling causes the performance of membrane to decrease over time 3 2 mwco pore size and porosity measurement results the mwco measurements were carried out using peg method five percent wt peg solute with a molecular weight of 400 4000 and 6000 da were used for this measurement the result of mwco experiment for 23 pes membrane 23 nano zno 0 5 wt and 23 pes 23 nano zno 0 5 wt with uv irradiation shown in fig 3 the mwco values for each membrane are shown in table 2 based on table 2 pes membrane without the addition of zno nano particles has the lowest value of mwco porosity and average pore radius the mwco value of pes 23 pes nano zno and uv irradiated pes nano zno are 2600 4640 and 5275 da respectively a membrane with nano zno loading has a higher mwco value confirming that the pores of modified membrane are larger than neat pes membrane this phenomenon might be due to the insufficient attachment between two phases nanoparticle surface and pes polymer porosity or void fraction is a measure of the void spaces in a material and is a fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume pes membranes with the addition of zno nano particles have a higher porosity value giving higher permeate flux as well addition of uv also offers a higher porosity value because it can change the polymer structure where more finger like porous structures are formed the uv irradiation slightly increases the temperature of casted dope solution which is lowering the viscosity of the casted dope solution and providing rapid demixing during coagulation the rapid demixing result on the higher finger like porous structure on the membrane this result is accordance with permeation test where the uv irradiated membrane shows higher permeate flux 3 2 1 water contact angle results the contact angle measurements are one of the standard methods to measure the wettability and hydrophilicity of membrane surface if the water contact angle is smaller than 90 the solid surface is considered hydrophilic the effect of nano zno loading on water contact angle values is shown in table 3 and the effect of uv irradiation can is listed in table 4 according to tables 3 and 4 pes without the nano zno incorporation and uv irradiation have the highest contact angle value of θ 63 indicating that pes is slightly hydrophobic in contrast the addition of nano zno can improve the hydrophilic properties of the membrane this is confirmed by the value of its contact angle which decreased from 61 34 to 53 63 due to the properties of nano zno particles the nano zno particles have a large surface area so particles can easily absorb hydrophilic hydroxyl group oh which provides hydrophilic properties the free paired electrons in zno molecule could be contributors to hydrophilicity enhancement the results correspond with previous researcher 27 which reported that the hydrophilic properties of the membrane could enhance by incorporating hydrophilic nanoparticles for uv irradiation the longer radiation was also have effect on the contact angle values the longer radiation time the contact angle value of the membrane decreased the membrane s hydrophilic properties increase by subjecting the membrane under uv irradiation this could be due to the formation of the hydrophilic group in membrane after being exposed to uv ray a similar result was found in the previous research conducted by konruang et al 28 on the modification of asymmetric polysulfone membrane surfaces by irradiation the uv irradiation was applied before the membrane being coagulated thus the demixing process was delayed which is resulting in smoother membrane surface smooth membrane surface has lower surface tension than rough membrane surface the more hydrophilic membrane is preferred because the hydrophilic membrane surface strongly rejects the oil droplet due to its hydrophobicity oil droplet deposition initiates the foulant formation on the membrane if the oil droplet deposition can be minimized then the fouling can be mitigated 3 3 membrane performance on single stage 3 3 1 effect of ultraviolet uv irradiation on membrane performance fig 4 shows the permeate flux profile of membrane with different uv irradiation time the profiles show that all flux decline with the time of filtration process the flux decline is caused by the membrane compaction and foulant deposition over the membrane the highest permeate flux is achieved by a membrane with 10 min uv irradiation at the initial flux up to 28 l m2h the initial permeate fluxes of the membrane with 5 min 1 min and without irradiation are 26 25 and 16 l m2h respectively this phenomenon is caused by the effects of uv light exposure to the polymer membrane the uv light induced the polymer chains to restructure and grafting so that the polymer becomes denser while the more prolonged exposure of uv light on the membrane surface it leads to the polymer chain degradation of polyethersulfone polymer as the consequences the membrane pores are larger the membrane hydrophilicity of pes membrane and the flux increase a similar result also has been reported by konruang et al 28 where pes membrane becomes more hydrophilic after exposing under uv lights its contact angle values also confirm it with uv irradiation the contact angle membrane is 58 0 which is lower than without uv irradiation membrane contact angle of 62 the smaller the contact angles indicates the membrane has hydrophilic or water like properties fig 5 a d sequentially show the effect of uv irradiation on the rejection of tds s2 cl and turbidity it can be seen that the longer filtration time the value of the membrane rejection increases with the phenomena occurring at each rejection it can be concluded that the percent of membrane rejection with uv irradiation 1 min significantly higher than that of uv irradiated membrane rejection as well as irradiation with 5 min and 10 min the uv irradiation effect causes this phenomenon and creates membrane have chain scission and crosslinking these cause membrane pores are denser and preventing more contaminant pass to permeate however longer uv irradiation has effect on the formation of a chain polymer degradation in the membrane polymer 29 the degradation can be a chemical change reaction or decomposition of a compound or molecule into a simpler compound or molecule 30 as a result more prominent membrane pores are formed and make it easier to diffuse water through the membrane pores on the other hand the longer the filtration time the entire percent of the rejection ion increases because the inorganic and organic substances in the produced water have been retained on the surface of the membrane the different rejection efficiency among the contaminants is caused by the particle size of each contaminant for example turbidity rejection is the highest rejection efficiency which can be achieved by membrane up to 97 98 turbidity in the wastewater arises due to the dispersed particulates the solid particles have significantly large size to be visually observed these particulates are easily rejected by the membrane with nanometer pore size however the particulate will be a foulant on the membrane with the presence of oil droplets on the other hand tds s2 cl are dissolved solid which invisible to be observed visually the size of ions is much lower than turbidity particulate and the rejection efficiencies are similar to 15 40 3 3 2 effect of zno concentration fig 6 exhibits the flux profile of pes membrane with different nano zno loading the flux profiles decline during the filtration process it takes place because the longer filtration time the filtration pressure increases the increase in pressure indicates fouling on the membrane surface and cause the pores of the membrane is closed and hence decrease the permeate volume it can also be seen from fig 5 that there is a difference in the flux value of each zno concentration the membrane with zno has higher flux than the membrane without zno the higher flux is due to the zno can increase the membrane hydrophilicity the hydrophilic properties of zno are confirmed by the contact angle results table 3 where with the addition of zno the contact angle is lower zno causes the hydrophilic and the this characteristic causes the water produced flows easier through the membrane as a result permeate volume is higher and the flux value increases however the addition of nano zno higher than 0 5 wt was observed to give the flux value lower than the membrane flux with 0 5 wt loading 31 high concentration of nano zno loading will form nano particles aggregation and the zno will accumulate at one point or not spread as a whole nano domain in filtration processes this is not favourable because the separation performance decreases significantly in this research the optimum condition of zno is 0 5 wt fig 7 presents the effect of zno concentration on the tds s2 cl and turbidity rejection it can be seen that the longer filtration time the value of the membrane rejection increases nevertheless the higher concentration of zno the rejection decreases as for s2 ion rejection as shown in fig 6b the same point takes place in s2 where with longer filtering time the value of rejection increases similar phenomenon also occurs in cl rejection and turbidity rejection as shown in fig 6c and d respectively stating the degree of clarity inside water in rejection turbidity also occurs the increase in rejection over time according to fig 7a d it can be seen that with the addition of zno rejection of membrane will increase this phenomenon indicated that addition of zno provides the sieving mechanism of separation so with the smaller pores the rejection of the membrane will increase this phenomenon occurs in case the concentration of nano zno loading is below 0 5 wt in addition of nano zno higher than 0 5 wt it causes aggregate on the membrane so that membrane performance will decrease the aggregate will form on the surface of the membrane thus making the surface of the membrane is not homogeneous as a consequence it makes the membrane performance unequal on each surface and the membrane s ability to hold particles on each side of the surface is not the same 3 4 effect of thermal annealing based on fig 8 it can be seen that the flux value without thermal annealing is higher than a membrane with thermal annealing although the difference is not very significant thermal annealing causes the value of membrane flux to decrease the phenomenon occurs because the membrane with a thermal annealing at a temperature of 180 c is close to the pes polymer glass transition temperature tg 220 c 32 the closer of the glass transition temperature causes breaking of molecular bonds between polymer in the pes membrane and hence the membrane becomes denser with a thicker dense skin layer structure 33 a tight membrane structure causes the flux value is less than membrane without thermal annealing fig 9 a shows the effect of thermal annealing on tds rejection where the longer the filtration time the membrane rejection increase the rejection of the membrane using thermal annealing is found higher than membrane without thermal annealing in fig 9b the rejection profile of s2 is shown presenting similar phenomenon as tds rejection it is also occurred in cl ion rejection and turbidity rejection as displaying in fig 9c and d respectively both rejection profile confirms the increase in rejection over time fig 9a d shows that the rejection value of tds turbidity s2 ion and cl ion with thermal annealing is higher than without thermal annealing its because thermal annealing causes narrowing of pore size 34 the thermal annealing treatment causes the re arrangement of membrane molecules so that the membrane is denser the particulates are stuck on the membrane surface because the pores are getting denser it causes membrane rejection with thermal annealing higher than without thermal annealing differences in membrane rejection to tds turbidity s2 ions and cl ions are caused by the response or the ability of the membrane to reject components differently so the rejection results of each ion are varied 3 5 the comparison of membrane performance on single stage and double stage separation double separation is implemented to improve membrane performance in this system permeate of the initial membrane filtration is redistributed and used as feed for filtration using a second membrane since the best result of single filtration single stage was obtained from the 0 5 pes nano zno membrane hence this membrane was applied to the double stages separation system based on fig 10 a the flux value in the second filtration is bigger representing a better performance than those flux at the single separation system more particles have been retained on the first membrane so the higher the value of flux is obtained moreover for double stage the highest flux value was also obtained on the pes nano zno membrane with 0 5 wt of zno in total solid and 10 min irradiation time with uv this phenomenon is presumably caused by the increase of the hydrophilic value of the membrane creating easier diffusion of water through the membrane pores previous work 35 also demonstrated that double stages provided better performance in permeate flux due to the most organic foulants were retained in the first stage this research investigated the performance of the membrane in the double stage system in the term of membrane rejection fig 10b shows a comparison of each rejection on a single stage and double stages on both stages the same membrane pes nano zno 0 5 wt is implemented based on fig 10b it can be seen that the percent of rejection of tds s2 cl and turbidity in double stages has a greater result than the single stage this is undoubtedly because the filtration system is performed twice where the inorganic and organic particles from the produced water have been much restrained on the surface of the membrane pes nano zno in the initial stage in the second stage the pes nano zno membrane was exposed to thermal annealing treatment or heating which makes the membrane pores closer and makes the membrane performance to retain the impurity particles is better 3 6 the comparison of solutes concentration of feed and permeate in double stages produced water contains various dissolved pollutants such as minerals dispersed and organic oils as well as suspended pollutants such as suspended solids implementation of the conventional membrane filtration has a risk of damaging the membrane due to fouling formation on membrane surface and result on the decline of permeability and solute rejection such occurrences are not found in double stages system where permeate fluxes are maintained and solute rejection increased in this work four parameters of produced water were used to observe the quality of produced water both in feed and permeate the best membrane performance was achieved using nanohybrid pes nano zno with 1 min uv irradiation the concentrations of pollutant solutes in feed and permeate water are shown in table 5 based on table 5 the concentration of total dissolved solids tds chloride cl sulfide s2 and turbidity in produced water feed and permeate are presented total dissolved solid chloride represents the mineral content in produced water sulfide is an essential parameter in produced water because sulfide is a toxic substance that is commonly found in produced water the turbidity of produced water indicates the concentration of visible suspended solid the concentration of tds decreased significantly from 6600 to 3900 mg l rejection efficiency of 41 since the concentration of tds in permeate still relatively high after filtrated using nanofiltration membrane in double stages it indicates that the most minerals content in produced water are monovalent ions this corresponds to the decrease of chloride concentration from 1975 to 669 mg l rejection efficiency of 66 where the concentration of cl in permeate is relatively high the rejection of sulfide is higher than tds and cl rejection 85 because sulfide is divalent ions which effectively rejected by nanofiltration membrane turbidity shows highest rejection efficiency with 99 8 rejection even though the concentration of tds and cl still relatively higher than clean water quality standard however the double stages concept shows some improvements than the conventional nanofiltration the implementation of double stages concept demonstrates higher flux and rejection as well as lower fouling formation 3 7 the stability of membrane in determining membrane performance it is necessary to consider the stability of the membrane the stability of a membrane is influenced by fouling or particles retained on the surface of the membrane the stability of the membrane between single stage and double stages membrane system is shown in fig 11 according to the figure the double stages membrane system is more stable than the single stage membrane system in addition it is presented that flux value in double stages is higher on the single stage membrane system some particles are previously deposited on the membrane surface so the work of double stages membranes is easier moreover it is possible that fouling in the single stage membrane system is more than the double stages membrane system the fouling is accumulated on the membrane surface and affect the permeate rate empirically the foulant deposition on the single stage membrane system is more than the double stage membrane system this was due to in the single stage membrane system large to small particles are filtered in the same membrane in the double stages membrane system the filtration process is easier because large particles size is previously filtered through the first membrane as a result the second membrane is performed on filtering s2 cl and others the fouling on the single stage membrane system is greater and the membrane performance in the single stage easily decreased hence it is confirmed that the stability of the double stages membrane system is better than the single stage membrane system 4 conclusion performance of membrane increased with membrane modification by nano zno incorporation the nano zno loading in the membrane significantly improved the membrane hydrophilicity by lowering the contact angle value from 63 to 53 in addition uv irradiation decreased the contact angle value from 62 to 58 nano hybrid membranes that were subjected to the uv ray enhanced the flux from 16 to 25 28 l hm2 in contrast the addition of nano zno significantly improved the tds rejection from 10 to 18 the thermal annealing treatment also gave an improvement in tds rejection from 16 to 22 double stages configuration showed higher value both of flux and pollutant rejection experimentally the initial flux enhanced from 26 to 32 l hm2 by double stages system and the tds rejection also increased from 18 to 22 this strategy is expected can be applied in industrial scale produced water treatment with lower fouling deposition and higher productivity acknowledgement the author would like to thanks to the management board and staffs of waste treatment laboratory of the department of chemical engineering diponegoro university for
