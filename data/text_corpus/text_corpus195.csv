975,boreal forests biomes are of great importance for regulating the hydrological cycling of global ecosystem however how boreal forest restoration affect the river runoff were poorly understood in this study two boreal forest watersheds the upper huma river and ganhe river located in the da hinggan mountains of northeastern china were selected to quantify the effects of increased forest cover on runoff from 1980 to 2012 using the budyko hypothesis associated with elasticity coefficients of runoff the results indicated that the annual runoff existed a decreased trend associated with the rapidly increase in forest cover after the implementation of the natural forest protection project in two study watersheds the quantitative results of the method of the budyko hypothesis associated with elasticity coefficients of runoff showed that climate variability was the dominate driver the relative contributions were 56 11 and 71 92 in the upper huma river and ganhe river watersheds respectively for decreasing annual runoff while forest cover changes also played an important role for decreasing annual runoff in boreal forested watersheds in northeastern china which accounted for 41 20 and 23 80 of the total change of river runoff respectively the results of this work highlight the importance of considering the effects of increased forest biomes on streamflow and also inform our understanding of the interaction between boreal forest change and surface water resource in the study region and similar boreal forest regions across the globe graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words forest cover climate variability runoff budyko hypothesis boreal watershed 1 introduction boreal forests biomes play a critical role in regulating the hydrological cycling of global ecosystem liu et al 2020 during the past decades boreal forests experienced the dramatic disturbance including human disturbance logging reforestation conversion and urbanization and natural disturbance fire insect infestation and climate variability wei et al 2018 liu et al 2020 evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 in boreal forest ecosystem conifers are the main component of the biomass of the ecosystem liu et al 2020 whose changes is supposed to affect the forest hydrological process and consequently affect river runoff however it is not clear how boreal forests and its interactions with climate variability affect water resources change in watersheds of northern ecosystem assessing the impacts of boreal forest change on runoff at the watershed scale is of great importance for understanding the forests biomes water balances of northern ecosystems in previous studies it has been commonly accepted that the runoff was mainly affected by climate variability and watershed underlying surface change lv et al 2019 yu et al 2020 deng et al 2018 li et al 2019 as we know the watershed underlying surface changes were mainly attributed to the changes in land use vegetation and topography lv et al 2019 liu et al 2019 price 2011 wei et al 2018 in which the topography conditions usually remain unchanged the vegetation conditions such as forest cover in forested watershed is thus considered to be the major factor influencing river runoff deng et al 2018 xu et al 2014 wei et al 2018 at present some progress has been made across the globe in the studies on the effects of forest cover change and climate variability on runoff wang and hejazi 2011 liu et al 2015 duan and cai 2018a liu et al 2019 however most of these studies were located in the tropics subtropics or temperate zone liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 although few studies assess the relationship between boreal forest change and runoff they mainly focus on how the reduction of boreal forests affects runoff on a global scale wei et al 2018 ide et al 2013 for instance wei et al 2018 found that boral forest lost 1 7 and 3 3 in russia and finland with the relative contributions to runoff change was 30 3 and 37 6 respectively however since the natural forest protection project nfpp was implemented in china after 1998 and the boreal forest coverage has been increasing rapidly in high latitudes of northeastern china yu et al 2011 which provides an opportunity to study the impact of boreal forest restoration on river runoff studying on the impact of boreal forest cover increase on runoff can provide reference for coordinating regional carbon water relationship and formulating sustainable forest management strategy and also provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the ecological and hydrological benefits of vegetation restoration in northeastern china since the implementation of the nfpp up to now numerous methods are available to quantitative assessment of runoff response to forest cover and climate change wei et al 2013 dey and mishra 2017 these methods are mainly divided into three types including experimental approaches such as paired catchment experiments hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool and conceptual methods such as budyko hypothesis and tomer schilling framework li et al 2019 meng et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 however conceptual methods have the advantage that there is no analytical suggestion for minimum data requirement also it can be explained by just long term annual actual evapotranspiration annual potential evapotranspiration and their relationship with annual precipitation dey and mishra 2017 it can be used in the regions where data are scarce for example li et al 2019 successfully used the budyko hypothesis to analyze the relative contribution of climate and vegetation change to runoff in soft sandstone area meanwhile wei et al 2018 analyzed the quantitative response of annual runoff to vegetation cover and climate variability by applying the frameworks of budyko combined fu s equations at globe scale and the validity of this method was confirmed thus the budyko hypothesis combined with the elasticity coefficients was selected for this study to quantify the relative contribution of forest cover change and climate variability to the changes of runoff in this study two boreal forested watersheds of the upper huma river hmr and ganhe river ghr located in the da hinggan mountains of far northeastern china were selected the objectives of this study were i to detect any significant trends of hydrology climate and forest cover change over the past three decades ii to calculate the elasticity coefficients of runoff to forest cover and climate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration variability and iii to quantify the relative contributions of forest cover increase to the changes of annual runoff in boreal forested watersheds 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the hmr 10882 km2 and ghr 9575 km2 watersheds located in the da hinggan mountains of northeastern china fig 1 the elevation ranges from 382 to 1516 m and 333 to 1532 m about sea level in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively the hmr and ghr watersheds are typical continental monsoon climate with an average precipitation are 496 8 and 540 1 mm from 1980 to 2012 respectively and more than 70 of the annual precipitation occurred in the rainy season june from september in both watersheds annual mean temperature are 2 2 and 0 3 c in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively the dominant soil types and land cover of both watersheds are brown coniferous forest soils and forest land the main climax vegetation type of both watersheds was dominated by cold temperate coniferous forest including larix gmelinii detailed description of study watersheds can be found in duan and cai 2018b 2 2 data 2 2 1 hydrology and climate data daily streamflow data from 1980 to 2012 were gained from the guqigu and jiagedaqi hydrological station located at the outlet of the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively unfortunately the streamflow data in 1983 of the hmr watershed was lost daily meteorological data including precipitation mean maximum minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours during 1980 2012 of the hmr and ghr watersheds were collected from tahe id 50246 and jiagedaqi id 50442 meteorological station http cdc cma gov cn respectively 2 2 2 forest cover data in this study the annual tree canopy cover and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets were used to assess the temporal variation in forest cover conditions in the study watersheds over the period of 1980 2012 note that the trees in annual tree cover datasets were defined as vegetation being higher than 5 meters and time series is from 1982 to 2012 with the resolution of 30 30 meters wei et al 2018 the datasets were obtained from https glad umd edu dataset long term global land change meanwhile in order to obtained more accurate and reliable result of forest cover change over the study period two ndvi datasets was selected as supplement i e the global inventory of modelling and mapping studies gimms ndvi data and spot vegetation ndvi data the growing season ndvi data from june to august was used gimms ndvi data is from 1981 to 2011 with an 8 km resolution and obtained from the environmental and ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn the spot ndvi data from 1998 to 2012 that is obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn was used with an 1 km resolution 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trends analysis in this study the nonparametric trend test of mann kendall test m k was selected to detect significant trends of hydrology climate and forest cover data annual tree cover and ndvi during 1980 to 2012 in two study watersheds mann 1945 kendall 1975 including annual runoff q precipitation p mean temperature tave maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin potential evapotranspiration pet the dryness index pet p and ndvi meanwhile the sen s slope method sen 1968 hirsch et al 1982 was used to estimate the change rate of hydrology climate and forest cover data the slope change per unit time can be expressed as 1 β median x j x i j i for all i j here β is the magnitude of the trend or the change per unit time 1 i j n and is the median of all possible combinations of pairs for the entire data set 2 3 2 breakpoint test identifying the breakpoint of runoff is a key step to further distinguish the independent impacts of climate and watershed underlying surface change on runoff however it is difficult to make accurate analysis and generally has large uncertainty based on one method wong et al 2006 thus in this paper we used multiple methods of breakpoint test including mann kendall test m k pettitt test moving t test mtt yamamoto cumulative anomaly curve cac and double mass curves dmc combined with the mann whitney statistic to identify the statistical significance of breakpoint li et al 2019 wang et al 2009 song et al 2018 then the whole study period was divided into two sub periods according to the significant runoff breakpoint baseline period and change period 2 3 3 framework of budyko hypothesis the budyko hypothesis is based on the coupling of water and heat it discusses the influence of climate and underlying surface conditions on runoff from the perspective of water energy balance li et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 budyko 1974 at present the budyko hypothesis has derived many improved forms after years of practice and development wu et al 2017 in this study the fu s equation fu 1981 was used and can be expressed as 2 et p 1 p pet 1 1 p pet m 1 m here et is actual evapotranspiration p is precipitation pet is potential evapotranspiration and m is watershed underlying surface change by consulting with the local forestry experts combining with the history forest coverage data from local forestry bureau and the annual tree canopy cover and ndvi datasets the average forest coverage of two study watersheds is approximately 80 over the past several decades it indicated that forest cover change is the main type of land use and the driving force of underlying surface variation in both study watersheds in past several decades thus the m was mainly used to reflect forest cover change in study watersheds based on the relationship of long term watershed water balance et can be calculated as 3 et p q δ s here q is runoff and δs is water storage change in the watershed note that the change of water storage can be ignored when the length of time series is more than 10 years wu et al 2017 the fao penman monteith equation was used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet during the study period allen et al 1998 mcmahon et al 2013 the pet can be calculated as 4 pet 0 408 δ rn g γ 900 tave 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 here δ is the slope of the vapour press curve kpa c 1 rn is the net daily radiation mj m 2 g is the soil heat flux into the ground mj m 2 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa u2 is the mean wind speed m s 1 at a 2 m height and ta is the air temperature at a 2 m height the detailed calculation procedure of each parameter can be found in mcmahon et al 2013 combining equations 2 to 4 the q can be written as 5 q p 1 pet p m 1 m pet according to equations 5 m can be obtained based on pet p and q of the study watershed 2 3 4 elasticity coefficients of runoff assuming p pet and m in equation 5 are independent variables the change in runoff can be calculated as equations 6 6 dq q p dp q pet dpet q m dm in order to estimate the independent impact of p pet and m on runoff respectively the elasticity coefficient of runoff ε x dq q dx x was proposed by the study of schaake 1990 in which the equations 6 can be rewritten as 7 dq q ε p dp p ε pet dpet pet ε m dm m then the εp εpet and εm are the p pet and m elasticities of runoff respectively and can be calculated as equations 8 11 8 ε p 1 φ m 1 m 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 φ m 1 m φ 9 ε pet 1 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 m 10 ε m ln 1 φ m φ m ln 1 φ m m 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 m 11 φ pet p based on the equations 7 11 the total change in runoff δq from baseline period to change period was calculated using the elasticity coefficient method 12 δ q δ q p δ q pet δ q m 13 δ q p ε p q p δ p δ q pet ε pet q pet δ pet δ q m ε m q m δ m here δp δpet and δm are the deviations of mean precipitation potential evapotranspiration and watershed underlying surface change caused by forest cover change between baseline and change periods respectively 2 3 5 contribution analysis of runoff change it is should be noted that some uncounted residual was exited between the observed total change in runoff δq and the estimated total change in runoff δq from baseline period to change period calculated by the budyko hypothesis and elasticity of runoff because the high order terms in the taylor series expansion was ignored the detailed description can be found in zhou et al 2015 and yang et al 2014 the error δq e can be expressed as 14 δ q q 2 q 1 15 δ q e δ q δ q here q 1 and q 2 are the mean annual runoff in baseline and change periods respectively finally the relative contributions of climate variability δq c δq p δq pet forest cover change δq v δq f and δq e on total change in runoff can be calculated as follow 16 δ q δ q c δ q v δ q e δ q p δ q pet δ q f δ q e 17 r p δ p δ q 100 18 r pet δ pet δ q 100 19 r f δ m δ q 100 20 r e δ q e δ q 100 here rp rpet rf and re are the relative contributions of δp δpet forest cover δm and δq e on total change in runoff from baseline period to change period respectively 3 results 3 1 trends of hydrology climate and forest cover 3 1 1 hydrology and climate variables it can be seen from table 1 and fig 2 the annual pet p 0 05 and tmax p 0 01 had the significant increasing trends during the period of 1980 to 2012 in the two study watersheds the annual tave and tmin had the significant increasing trends p 0 01 during the period of 1980 to 2012 in the ghr watershed while the no statistically significant p 0 05 trend was found in the hmr watershed meanwhile there was no statistically significant p 0 05 trend in q p pet p and et in the whole study period 3 1 2 forest cover change table 2 showed that the annual tree cover 1982 2012 and gimms ndvi 1981 2011 had no significant increasing p 0 05 trend in the whole study period in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively meanwhile the annual tree cover 1982 1997 and gimms ndvi 1981 1997 had a slightly p 0 05 trend and even decreased before the implementation of nfpp with the rate of 0 06 and 0 34 year for hmr and ghr watersheds respectively fig 3 and table 2 however after the implementation of nfpp fig 4 and table 2 the value of annual tree cover in both watersheds showed positive trends the increasing rate of the gimms ndvi 1998 2011 were 0 28 and 0 29 year for hmr and ghr watersheds respectively furthermore the high resolution datasets of annual tree cover and spot ndvi 1998 2012 had the significantly p 0 05 increased trend with the rate of 0 49 and 0 32 year and 0 47 and 0 43 year for hmr and ghr watersheds respectively 3 2 breakpoints analysis of runoff in this study six methods m k pettitt test mtt yamamoto cac and dmc were selected to detect the breakpoints of annual runoff in two study watersheds from 1980 to 2012 as shown in table 3 the breakpoints of annual runoff were both detected in 2004 and had the statistical significances p 0 05 by the cac and dmc methods in the hmr watershed however the breakpoints of annual runoff detected by m k were not significant p 0 05 on the other hand in the ghr watershed the breakpoints were identified in 1999 by m k mtt and dmc fig 5 at the 95 significant level respectively thus based on the significant breakpoints two sub periods of baseline period 1980 2003 and change period 2004 2012 were divided in the hmr watershed while baseline and change periods in ghr were determined to be 1980 1998 and 1999 2012 respectively 3 3 elasticity coefficients of runoff table 4 showed that the εp in the hmr and ghr watersheds varied from 1 54 and 1 62 in baseline period to 1 46 and 1 44 in change period respectively which indicated that the runoff would increase by 15 2 and 15 5 when the p increased by 10 in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively by contrast the changes of elasticity coefficients of pet or m from baseline period to change period suggested that the pet or m increased by 10 in the hmr and ghr watershed the runoff would decrease by 10 9 or 11 5 and 11 5 or 11 3 respectively the higher εp indicated that runoff is more sensitive to changes in p than pet and m of both study watersheds 3 4 relative contributions of climate variability and forest cover change on runoff table 5 showed the estimated contributions of climate variability p and pet and forest cover change m to runoff variations in two study watersheds during the change period annual runoff decreased by 27 90mm and 56 79 mm due to the changes in climate p and pet in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively with the contributions to the total change in runoff being 56 11 and 71 92 respectively while annual runoff reduced by 20 49 mm and 18 79 mm attributed to forest cover change m variations in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively with the contributions to the total change in runoff being 41 20 and 23 80 respectively furthermore according to the equations 14 20 see section in 2 3 5 the error between estimated total change in runoff and the observed total change in runoff from baseline period to change period were 1 34 mm and 3 38mm in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively with the contributions to the total change in runoff only being 2 69 and 4 28 respectively table 5 these results indicated that the hydrological responses of two watersheds to forest cover change are similar which climate variability play a more important role in the variations of runoff than the changes in forest cover change in two study watersheds during the study period 4 discussion 4 1 responses of runoff to forest cover change our results indicated that the hydrological responses of two watersheds to forest cover change are similar the average decrement of annual runoff attributed to forest cover change was 20 49 mm 41 20 and 18 79 mm 23 80 in the hmr and ghr watersheds from baseline period to the change period respectively this result is consistent with the global average value of relative contribution 32 8 of forests cover change to runoff wei et al 2018 in our study watersheds forest cover increased rapidly after the implementation of nfpp fig 4 and fig 6 due to the high forest cover in our study watersheds forest cover change can be considered as the main driving force for the changes in watershed underlying surface change in study watersheds which is consistent with the change trend of m from baseline period 1 59 and 1 69 to change period 1 71 and 1 81 in two study watersheds table 4 respectively in previous studies the generally accepted conclusion is that forest restoration decreased runoff while deforestation increased it duan and cai 2018a liu et al 2016 li et al 2017 specifically we can find some evident in different climate zones for instance studying in the different sub catchments of temperate zone of australia suggested that the increase of vegetation cover significantly reduced annual runoff range from 22 mm year to 52 mm year tuteja et al 2007 liu et al 2015 found that reforestation decreased annual runoff by 51 mm year in meijiang watershed 6983km2 in subtropical region of china similar results were found in the cold temperate region duan et al 2018a in contrast costa et al 2003 found that the decreasing of forest cover significantly increased annual runoff in the tocantins river in the tropical region which is consistent with the results of temperate and subtropical forested watersheds li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 the possible reason is that the decrease of forest cover leads to the reduce of evapotranspiration and canopy interception that consequently rainfall can be quickly converted into surface runoff to rivers liu et al 2015 however compared the deforestation forest recovery improved soil conditions and increased soil water storage and infiltration capacity so that can store more water in the aquifers and lengthen the flow paths to rivers liu et al 2015 duan et al 2018a which consequently leads to the decrease of streamflow meanwhile forest cover increase can effectively increase the interception of rainfall and the water consumption of transpiration caused by the increased leaf area and enhanced root systems xu et al 2019 liu et al 2015 in this study we also found that the et had the increasing trend during study period in both forest watersheds table 1 and figure 2 additional litter from forest vegetation play an important role in water cycle process bulcock and jewitt 2012 which helped in limiting soil water loss from evaporation and increasing interception of precipitation sangha et al 2006 resulting in decreased runoff however duo to the difference in forest type of watersheds the response of runoff to forest cover change was different wei et al 2018 compared eight forest biomes across the globe the result shown that the runoff was more sensitive to mediterranean forests than that the other forest biomes when the vegetation changes by 5 while the intermediate response was found in boreal forest biomes furthermore in large watersheds 1000 km2 the response of runoff change caused by forest cover change in mixed or broadleaf forest dominated watersheds was higher than in coniferous forest dominated watersheds while the hydrologically resilient of runoff to forest cover change in small mixed forest dominated watersheds 1000 km2 was larger zhang et al 2017 for instance the xinancha watershed 2582 km2 which was dominated by mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest watershed of northeastern china the relative contribution of forest recovery to runoff was 87 4 duan and cai 2018a which was higher than that in our study watersheds dominated by cold temperate coniferous forest generally the transpiration of conifer species is lower than that of broad leaved species yu et al 2019 we infer that the differences in physiological processes of forest type such as transpiration has a major influence on water use by the changes in et at watershed scale sun et al 2011 the interaction between forest cover change and regional climate is also an important factor influencing hydrological processes land use and forest cover change affects surface energy balance due to the change in land surface reflectance and the distribution of precipitation among soil water evapotranspiration and runoff thus affecting regional climate especially precipitation and temperature foley et al 2005 findell et al 2007 furthermore global studies have observed climate drought impacts on forest cover berdugo et al 2020 anderegg et al 2020 in which more forest fires and pests occurred and in turn affect the hydrological processes for instance chen et al 2021 reported that the water yield effects related to forest biophysical processes increase significantly with the increase of climate drought and these parts are usually larger than those from the background climate in previous studies because the impact of interaction between forest cover and climate on runoff is complex and hard to quantify among the numerous methods of distinguishing relative contribution of forest change and climate impact on runoff the forest cover change and climate were usually considered to be independent variables wei et al 2013 deng et al 2018 dey and mishra 2017 li et al 2019 thus although the interaction between forest cover and climate in the framework of budyko hypothesis was not considered we acknowledged that the important role between long term forest biophysical effects and climate in regulating watershed hydrological processes therefore how to accurately quantify the impact of interaction between forest cover and climate on runoff has long been a challenge across the globe which needs more process based and modeling studies to investigate 4 2 responses of runoff to climate variability in this study although there is no significant trend in p and pet p in the whole study period the differences of climate factors p and pet between two subperiods baseline and change periods were found see table 5 the contributions of climate variability on annual runoff decreased were closely related to the reduced p and increased pet in change period climate variability p and pet reduced total runoff by 56 11 and 71 92 from 1980 to 2012 in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively it suggested that climate p and pet variability was the relative dominate driver for decreasing annual runoff in two study watersheds which is consistent with the results in other large scale watersheds deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2013 liu et al 2013 for instance zhang et al 2016 found that the runoff change was more closely related to climate variability in the heihe river watershed 12800km2 of northwest china similarly li et al 2018 indicated that the relative contributions of climate variability to total runoff decreased was 73 0 in the upper similkameen river watershed of usa these findings demonstrated that runoff change is primarily controlled by climate variability contrarily many studies concluded that climate variability has limited effects on runoff li et al 2019 duan et al 2017b ma et al 2009 for example li et al 2019 reported that the climate change such as p and pet on runoff was only 4 9 7 4 and 11 3 in the huangfuchuan gushanchuan and kuyehe watersheds respectively however whether climate variability plays a dominant role in runoff depends on the degree and direction of climate variables and forest cover change zhang et al 2012 wei et al 2018 in our study the additive effects of p and pet on annual runoff were found which is consistent with some studies deng et al 2018 it indicated that p and pet both lead to reduce or increase runoff however many studies suggested that p and pet has the offsetting effects on annual runoff liu et al 2019 duan et al 2017b for example lv et al 2019 found that the offset effects of p and pet on runoff in the fen river watershed these inconsistent results demonstrated that the responses of runoff to climate variability may depend on the intensity and direction of climate factor variation and vary across different watersheds li et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 on the other hand some studies reported that the sensitivity of hydrological responses to forest change is not consistent which may change with climate gradient zhang et al 2017 global scale studies indicated that the runoff to forest cover change was more sensitive in dry climate zone watersheds than in wet climate zone watersheds li et al 2017 chen et al 2021 for instance sun et al 2006 found that the runoff decreased attribution to reforestation in semi arid regions was higher than in humid regions similarly wei et al 2018 found that the response of runoff to tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests was higher than that the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests when vegetation changes are consistent the reason may be that in the energy limited watersheds the saturated soils are common asbjornsen et al 2011 forests are less dependent on water resources but more responsive to temperature zhang et al 2017 the above analysis shows that the impact of climate change on runoff is complex 4 3 implications for water resources management in boreal forested watershed the siberian ecological region is one of the largest boreal forests as well as a great importance carbon sink liu et al 2020 da hinggan mountains of northeastern china is located in the southern margin of the siberian zone which also serves as a significant boreal forests biomes the da hinggan mountains is not only headwater watersheds of the nenjiang river and heilongjiang river but also an important carbon pool in china yu et al 2019 although forest quality and carbon storage have been increasing with the implementation of the nfpp there are decreasing trend in water resources in boreal forested watersheds duan and cai 2018a our study indicated that forest cover increase and climate variability both decreased runoff which indicated that there is a trade off relationship between water resources and the increase in boreal forest cover however boreal forest ecosystem is the most important component of terrestrial carbon pool thus the solution of balancing boreal forest carbon storage and their relationship with water resources must be sought in the future which is of great importance for the effective forested watershed management 4 4 uncertainty and future work although independent impacts of p pet and forest cover m change on runoff was distinguished using the framework of budyko hypothesis in this study there are several uncertainties and limitations firstly as shown in table 5 the small results errors were found similar errors were also found in liu et al 2019 li et al 2019 and xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 reported that the potential error is caused by ignores of the higher order term in taylor series expansion when estimating the runoff elasticity coefficient secondly different forms of budyko hypothesis and pet estimation can also influence the results for instance wu et al 2017 compared the differences of climate on runoff among the eight forms of budyko hypothesis and the results indicated that those are slightly different between the parametric and non parametric methods thirdly two forested watersheds located in the da hinggan mountains of north eastern china where spans the large area of permafrost duan et al 2017a in recent years with the globe climate warming the permafrost degradation was found in this region and influenced the interactions of surface underground hydrological processes duan et al 2017a a few studies suggested that the watershed underlying surface change may be related to the permafrost degradation liu et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study we applied the budyko hypothesis and elasticity coefficients of runoff to quantify the effects of forest cover change on runoff in two boreal forested watersheds in the da hinggan mountains of northeastern china the results showed that the hydrological effects of two watersheds were similar forest cover change and climate variability both decreased the runoff in two study watersheds from 1980 to 2012 and the responses of runoff to the changes in p was more sensitive than those in the pet and forest cover according to the quantitative results we concluded that although climate variability was the dominate driver for decreasing annual runoff forest cover change was of great importance for decreasing annual runoff in boreal forested watersheds in northeastern china these results highlight the importance of considering the effects of increasing forest biomes on surface water resource in the study boreal forest region of china and the similar regions across the globe

975,boreal forests biomes are of great importance for regulating the hydrological cycling of global ecosystem however how boreal forest restoration affect the river runoff were poorly understood in this study two boreal forest watersheds the upper huma river and ganhe river located in the da hinggan mountains of northeastern china were selected to quantify the effects of increased forest cover on runoff from 1980 to 2012 using the budyko hypothesis associated with elasticity coefficients of runoff the results indicated that the annual runoff existed a decreased trend associated with the rapidly increase in forest cover after the implementation of the natural forest protection project in two study watersheds the quantitative results of the method of the budyko hypothesis associated with elasticity coefficients of runoff showed that climate variability was the dominate driver the relative contributions were 56 11 and 71 92 in the upper huma river and ganhe river watersheds respectively for decreasing annual runoff while forest cover changes also played an important role for decreasing annual runoff in boreal forested watersheds in northeastern china which accounted for 41 20 and 23 80 of the total change of river runoff respectively the results of this work highlight the importance of considering the effects of increased forest biomes on streamflow and also inform

ecosystem liu et al 2020 whose changes is supposed to affect the forest hydrological process and consequently affect river runoff however it is not clear how boreal forests and its interactions with climate variability affect water resources change in watersheds of northern ecosystem assessing the impacts of boreal forest change on runoff at the watershed scale is of great importance for understanding the forests biomes water balances of northern ecosystems in previous studies it has been commonly accepted that the runoff was mainly affected by climate variability and watershed underlying surface change lv et al 2019 yu et al 2020 deng et al 2018 li et al 2019 as we know the watershed underlying surface changes were mainly attributed to the changes in land use vegetation and topography lv et al 2019 liu et al 2019 price 2011 wei et al 2018 in which the topography conditions usually remain unchanged the vegetation conditions such as forest cover in forested watershed is thus considered to be the major factor influencing river runoff deng et al 2018 xu et al 2014 wei et al 2018 at present some progress has been made across the globe in the studies on the effects of forest cover change and climate variability on runoff wang and hejazi 2011 liu et al 2015 duan and cai 2018a liu et al 2019 however most of these studies were located in the tropics subtropics or temperate zone liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 although few studies assess the relationship between boreal forest change and runoff they mainly focus on how the reduction of boreal forests affects runoff on a global scale wei et al 2018 ide et al 2013 for instance wei et al 2018 found that boral forest lost 1 7 and 3 3 in russia and finland with the relative contributions to runoff change was 30 3 and 37 6 respectively however since the natural forest protection project nfpp was implemented in china after 1998 and the boreal forest coverage has been increasing rapidly in high latitudes of northeastern china yu et al 2011 which provides an opportunity to study the impact of boreal forest restoration on river runoff studying on the impact of boreal forest cover increase on runoff can provide reference for coordinating regional carbon water relationship and formulating sustainable forest management strategy and also provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the ecological and hydrological benefits of vegetation restoration in northeastern china since the implementation of the nfpp up to now numerous methods are available to quantitative assessment of runoff response to forest cover and climate change wei et al 2013 dey and mishra 2017 these methods are mainly divided into three types including experimental approaches such as paired catchment experiments hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool and conceptual methods such as budyko hypothesis and tomer schilling framework li et al 2019 meng et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 however conceptual methods have the advantage that there is no analytical suggestion for minimum data requirement also it can be explained by just long term annual actual evapotranspiration annual potential evapotranspiration and their relationship with annual precipitation dey and mishra 2017 it can be used in the regions where data are scarce for example li et al 2019 successfully used the budyko hypothesis to analyze the relative contribution of climate and vegetation change to runoff in soft sandstone area meanwhile wei et al 2018 analyzed the quantitative response of annual runoff to vegetation cover and climate variability by applying the frameworks of budyko combined fu s equations at globe scale and the validity of this method was confirmed thus the budyko hypothesis combined with the elasticity coefficients was selected for this study to quantify the relative contribution of forest cover change and climate variability to the changes of runoff in this study two boreal forested watersheds of the upper huma river hmr and ganhe river ghr located in the da hinggan mountains of far northeastern china were selected the objectives of this study were i to detect any significant trends of hydrology climate and forest cover change over the past three decades ii to calculate the elasticity coefficients of runoff to forest cover and climate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration variability and iii to quantify the relative contributions of forest cover increase to the changes of annual runoff in boreal forested watersheds 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the hmr 10882 km2 and ghr 9575 km2 watersheds located in the da hinggan mountains of northeastern china fig 1 the elevation ranges from 382 to 1516 m and 333 to 1532 m about sea level in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively the hmr and ghr watersheds are typical continental monsoon climate with an average precipitation are 496 8 and 540 1 mm from 1980 to 2012 respectively and more than 70 of the annual precipitation occurred in the rainy season june from september in both watersheds annual mean temperature are 2 2 and 0 3 c in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively the dominant soil types and land cover of both watersheds are brown coniferous forest soils and forest land the main climax vegetation type of both watersheds was dominated by cold temperate coniferous forest including larix gmelinii detailed description of study watersheds can be found in duan and cai 2018b 2 2 data 2 2 1 hydrology and climate data daily streamflow data from 1980 to 2012 were gained from the guqigu and jiagedaqi hydrological station located at the outlet of the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively unfortunately the streamflow data in 1983 of the hmr watershed was lost daily meteorological data including precipitation mean maximum minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours during 1980 2012 of the hmr and ghr watersheds were collected from tahe id 50246 and jiagedaqi id 50442 meteorological station http cdc cma gov cn respectively 2 2 2 forest cover data in this study the annual tree canopy cover and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets were used to assess the temporal variation in forest cover conditions in the study watersheds over the period of 1980 2012 note that the trees in annual tree cover datasets were defined as vegetation being higher than 5 meters and time series is from 1982 to 2012 with the resolution of 30 30 meters wei et al 2018 the datasets were obtained from https glad umd edu dataset long term global land change meanwhile in order to obtained more accurate and reliable result of forest cover change over the study period two ndvi datasets was selected as supplement i e the global inventory of modelling and mapping studies gimms ndvi data and spot vegetation ndvi data the growing season ndvi data from june to august was used gimms ndvi data is from 1981 to 2011 with an 8 km resolution and obtained from the environmental and ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn the spot ndvi data from 1998 to 2012 that is obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn was used with an 1 km resolution 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trends analysis in this study the nonparametric trend test of mann kendall test m k was selected to detect significant trends of hydrology climate and forest cover data annual tree cover and ndvi during 1980 to 2012 in two study watersheds mann 1945 kendall 1975 including annual runoff q precipitation p mean temperature tave maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin potential evapotranspiration pet the dryness index pet p and ndvi meanwhile the sen s slope method sen 1968 hirsch et al 1982 was used to estimate the change rate of hydrology climate and forest cover data the slope change per unit time can be expressed as 1 β median x j x i j i for all i j here β is the magnitude of the trend or the change per unit time 1 i j n and is the median of all possible combinations of pairs for the entire data set 2 3 2 breakpoint test identifying the breakpoint of runoff is a key step to further distinguish the independent impacts of climate and watershed underlying surface change on runoff however it is difficult to make accurate analysis and generally has large uncertainty based on one method wong et al 2006 thus in this paper we used multiple methods of breakpoint test including mann kendall test m k pettitt test moving t test mtt yamamoto cumulative anomaly curve cac and double mass curves dmc combined with the mann whitney statistic to identify the statistical significance of breakpoint li et al 2019 wang et al 2009 song et al 2018 then the whole study period was divided into two sub periods according to the significant runoff breakpoint baseline period and change period 2 3 3 framework of budyko hypothesis the budyko hypothesis is based on the coupling of water and heat it discusses the influence of climate and underlying surface conditions on runoff from the perspective of water energy balance li et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 budyko 1974 at present the budyko hypothesis has derived many improved forms after years of practice and development wu et al 2017 in this study the fu s equation fu 1981 was used and can be expressed as 2 et p 1 p pet 1 1 p pet m 1 m here et is actual evapotranspiration p is precipitation pet is potential evapotranspiration and m is watershed underlying surface change by consulting with the local forestry experts combining with the history forest coverage data from local forestry bureau and the annual tree canopy cover and ndvi datasets the average forest coverage of two study watersheds is approximately 80 over the past several decades it indicated that forest cover change is the main type of land use and the driving force of underlying surface variation in both study watersheds in past several decades thus the m was mainly used to reflect forest cover change in study watersheds based on the relationship of long term watershed water balance et can be calculated as 3 et p q δ s here q is runoff and δs is water storage change in the watershed note that the change of water storage can be ignored when the length of time series is more than 10 years wu et al 2017 the fao penman monteith equation was used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet during the study period allen et al 1998 mcmahon et al 2013 the pet can be calculated as 4 pet 0 408 δ rn g γ 900 tave 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 here δ is the slope of the vapour press curve kpa c 1 rn is the net daily radiation mj m 2 g is the soil heat flux into the ground mj m 2 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa u2 is the mean wind speed m s 1 at a 2 m height and ta is the air temperature at a 2 m height the detailed calculation procedure of each parameter can be found in mcmahon et al 2013 combining equations 2 to 4 the q can be written as 5 q p 1 pet p m 1 m pet according to equations 5 m can be obtained based on pet p and q of the study watershed 2 3 4 elasticity coefficients of runoff assuming p pet and m in equation 5 are independent variables the change in runoff can be calculated as equations 6 6 dq q p dp q pet dpet q m dm in order to estimate the independent impact of p pet and m on runoff respectively the elasticity coefficient of runoff ε x dq q dx x was proposed by the study of schaake 1990 in which the equations 6 can be rewritten as 7 dq q ε p dp p ε pet dpet pet ε m dm m then the εp εpet and εm are the p pet and m elasticities of runoff respectively and can be calculated as equations 8 11 8 ε p 1 φ m 1 m 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 φ m 1 m φ 9 ε pet 1 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 m 10 ε m ln 1 φ m φ m ln 1 φ m m 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 m 11 φ pet p based on the equations 7 11 the total change in runoff δq from baseline period to change period was calculated using the elasticity coefficient method 12 δ q δ q p δ q pet δ q m 13 δ q p ε p q p δ p δ q pet ε pet q pet δ pet δ q m ε m q m δ m here δp δpet and δm are the deviations of mean precipitation potential evapotranspiration and watershed underlying surface change caused by forest cover change between baseline and change periods respectively 2 3 5 contribution analysis of runoff change it is should be noted that some uncounted residual was exited between the observed total change in runoff δq and the estimated total change in runoff δq from baseline period to change period calculated by the budyko hypothesis and elasticity of runoff because the high order terms in the taylor series expansion was ignored the detailed description can be found in zhou et al 2015 and yang et al 2014 the error δq e can be expressed as 14 δ q q 2 q 1 15 δ q e δ q δ q here q 1 and q 2 are the mean annual runoff in baseline and change periods respectively finally the relative contributions of climate variability δq c δq p δq pet forest cover change δq v δq f and δq e on total change in runoff can be calculated as follow 16 δ q δ q c δ q v δ q e δ q p δ q pet δ q f δ q e 17 r p δ p δ q 100 18 r pet δ pet δ q 100 19 r f δ m δ q 100 20 r e δ q e δ q 100 here rp rpet rf and re are the relative contributions of δp δpet forest cover δm and δq e on total change in runoff from baseline period to change period respectively 3 results 3 1 trends of hydrology climate and forest cover 3 1 1 hydrology and climate variables it can be seen from table 1 and fig 2 the annual pet p 0 05 and tmax p 0 01 had the significant increasing trends during the period of 1980 to 2012 in the two study watersheds the annual tave and tmin had the significant increasing trends p 0 01 during the period of 1980 to 2012 in the ghr watershed while the no statistically significant p 0 05 trend was found in the hmr watershed meanwhile there was no statistically significant p 0 05 trend in q p pet p and et in the whole study period 3 1 2 forest cover change table 2 showed that the annual tree cover 1982 2012 and gimms ndvi 1981 2011 had no significant increasing p 0 05 trend in the whole study period in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively meanwhile the annual tree cover 1982 1997 and gimms ndvi 1981 1997 had a slightly p 0 05 trend and even decreased before the implementation of nfpp with the rate of 0 06 and 0 34 year for hmr and ghr watersheds respectively fig 3 and table 2 however after the implementation of nfpp fig 4 and table 2 the value of annual tree cover in both watersheds showed positive trends the increasing rate of the gimms ndvi 1998 2011 were 0 28 and 0 29 year for hmr and ghr watersheds respectively furthermore the high resolution datasets of annual tree cover and spot ndvi 1998 2012 had the significantly p 0 05 increased trend with the rate of 0 49 and 0 32 year and 0 47 and 0 43 year for hmr and ghr watersheds respectively 3 2 breakpoints analysis of runoff in this study six methods m k pettitt test mtt yamamoto cac and dmc were selected to detect the breakpoints of annual runoff in two study watersheds from 1980 to 2012 as shown in table 3 the breakpoints of annual runoff were both detected in 2004 and had the statistical significances p 0 05 by the cac and dmc methods in the hmr watershed however the breakpoints of annual runoff detected by m k were not significant p 0 05 on the other hand in the ghr watershed the breakpoints were identified in 1999 by m k mtt and dmc fig 5 at the 95 significant level respectively thus based on the significant breakpoints two sub periods of baseline period 1980 2003 and change period 2004 2012 were divided in the hmr watershed while baseline and change periods in ghr were determined to be 1980 1998 and 1999 2012 respectively 3 3 elasticity coefficients of runoff table 4 showed that the εp in the hmr and ghr watersheds varied from 1 54 and 1 62 in baseline period to 1 46 and 1 44 in change period respectively which indicated that the runoff would increase by 15 2 and 15 5 when the p increased by 10 in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively by contrast the changes of elasticity coefficients of pet or m from baseline period to change period suggested that the pet or m increased by 10 in the hmr and ghr watershed the runoff would decrease by 10 9 or 11 5 and 11 5 or 11 3 respectively the higher εp indicated that runoff is more sensitive to changes in p than pet and m of both study watersheds 3 4 relative contributions of climate variability and forest cover change on runoff table 5 showed the estimated contributions of climate variability p and pet and forest cover change m to runoff variations in two study watersheds during the change period annual runoff decreased by 27 90mm and 56 79 mm due to the changes in climate p and pet in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively with the contributions to the total change in runoff being 56 11 and 71 92 respectively while annual runoff reduced by 20 49 mm and 18 79 mm attributed to forest cover change m variations in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively with the contributions to the total change in runoff being 41 20 and 23 80 respectively furthermore according to the equations 14 20 see section in 2 3 5 the error between estimated total change in runoff and the observed total change in runoff from baseline period to change period were 1 34 mm and 3 38mm in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively with the contributions to the total change in runoff only being 2 69 and 4 28 respectively table 5 these results indicated that the hydrological responses of two watersheds to forest cover change are similar which climate variability play a more important role in the variations of runoff than the changes in forest cover change in two study watersheds during the study period 4 discussion 4 1 responses of runoff to forest cover change our results indicated that the hydrological responses of two watersheds to forest cover change are similar the average decrement of annual runoff attributed to forest cover change was 20 49 mm 41 20 and 18 79 mm 23 80 in the hmr and ghr watersheds from baseline period to the change period respectively this result is consistent with the global average value of relative contribution 32 8 of forests cover change to runoff wei et al 2018 in our study watersheds forest cover increased rapidly after the implementation of nfpp fig 4 and fig 6 due to the high forest cover in our study watersheds forest cover change can be considered as the main driving force for the changes in watershed underlying surface change in study watersheds which is consistent with the change trend of m from baseline period 1 59 and 1 69 to change period 1 71 and 1 81 in two study watersheds table 4 respectively in previous studies the generally accepted conclusion is that forest restoration decreased runoff while deforestation increased it duan and cai 2018a liu et al 2016 li et al 2017 specifically we can find some evident in different climate zones for instance studying in the different sub catchments of temperate zone of australia suggested that the increase of vegetation cover significantly reduced annual runoff range from 22 mm year to 52 mm year tuteja et al 2007 liu et al 2015 found that reforestation decreased annual runoff by 51 mm year in meijiang watershed 6983km2 in subtropical region of china similar results were found in the cold temperate region duan et al 2018a in contrast costa et al 2003 found that the decreasing of forest cover significantly increased annual runoff in the tocantins river in the tropical region which is consistent with the results of temperate and subtropical forested watersheds li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 the possible reason is that the decrease of forest cover leads to the reduce of evapotranspiration and canopy interception that consequently rainfall can be quickly converted into surface runoff to rivers liu et al 2015 however compared the deforestation forest recovery improved soil conditions and increased soil water storage and infiltration capacity so that can store more water in the aquifers and lengthen the flow paths to rivers liu et al 2015 duan et al 2018a which consequently leads to the decrease of streamflow meanwhile forest cover increase can effectively increase the interception of rainfall and the water consumption of transpiration caused by the increased leaf area and enhanced root systems xu et al 2019 liu et al 2015 in this study we also found that the et had the increasing trend during study period in both forest watersheds table 1 and figure 2 additional litter from forest vegetation play an important role in water cycle process bulcock and jewitt 2012 which helped in limiting soil water loss from evaporation and increasing interception of precipitation sangha et al 2006 resulting in decreased runoff however duo to the difference in forest type of watersheds the response of runoff to forest cover change was different wei et al 2018 compared eight forest biomes across the globe the result shown that the runoff was more sensitive to mediterranean forests than that the other forest biomes when the vegetation changes by 5 while the intermediate response was found in boreal forest biomes furthermore in large watersheds 1000 km2 the response of runoff change caused by forest cover change in mixed or broadleaf forest dominated watersheds was higher than in coniferous forest dominated watersheds while the hydrologically resilient of runoff to forest cover change in small mixed forest dominated watersheds 1000 km2 was larger zhang et al 2017 for instance the xinancha watershed 2582 km2 which was dominated by mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest watershed of northeastern china the relative contribution of forest recovery to runoff was 87 4 duan and cai 2018a which was higher than that in our study watersheds dominated by cold temperate coniferous forest generally the transpiration of conifer species is lower than that of broad leaved species yu et al 2019 we infer that the differences in physiological processes of forest type such as transpiration has a major influence on water use by the changes in et at watershed scale sun et al 2011 the interaction between forest cover change and regional climate is also an important factor influencing hydrological processes land use and forest cover change affects surface energy balance due to the change in land surface reflectance and the distribution of precipitation among soil water evapotranspiration and runoff thus affecting regional climate especially precipitation and temperature foley et al 2005 findell et al 2007 furthermore global studies have observed climate drought impacts on forest cover berdugo et al 2020 anderegg et al 2020 in which more forest fires and pests occurred and in turn affect the hydrological processes for instance chen et al 2021 reported that the water yield effects related to forest biophysical processes increase significantly with the increase of climate drought and these parts are usually larger than those from the background climate in previous studies because the impact of interaction between forest cover and climate on runoff is complex and hard to quantify among the numerous methods of distinguishing relative contribution of forest change and climate impact on runoff the forest cover change and climate were usually considered to be independent variables wei et al 2013 deng et al 2018 dey and mishra 2017 li et al 2019 thus although the interaction between forest cover and climate in the framework of budyko hypothesis was not considered we acknowledged that the important role between long term forest biophysical effects and climate in regulating watershed hydrological processes therefore how to accurately quantify the impact of interaction between forest cover and climate on runoff has long been a challenge across the globe which needs more process based and modeling studies to investigate 4 2 responses of runoff to climate variability in this study although there is no significant trend in p and pet p in the whole study period the differences of climate factors p and pet between two subperiods baseline and change periods were found see table 5 the contributions of climate variability on annual runoff decreased were closely related to the reduced p and increased pet in change period climate variability p and pet reduced total runoff by 56 11 and 71 92 from 1980 to 2012 in the hmr and ghr watersheds respectively it suggested that climate p and pet variability was the relative dominate driver for decreasing annual runoff in two study watersheds which is consistent with the results in other large scale watersheds deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2013 liu et al 2013 for instance zhang et al 2016 found that the runoff change was more closely related to climate variability in the heihe river watershed 12800km2 of northwest china similarly li et al 2018 indicated that the relative contributions of climate variability to total runoff decreased was 73 0 in the upper similkameen river watershed of usa these findings demonstrated that runoff change is primarily controlled by climate variability contrarily many studies concluded that climate variability has limited effects on runoff li et al 2019 duan et al 2017b ma et al 2009 for example li et al 2019 reported that the climate change such as p and pet on runoff was only 4 9 7 4 and 11 3 in the huangfuchuan gushanchuan and kuyehe watersheds respectively however whether climate variability plays a dominant role in runoff depends on the degree and direction of climate variables and forest cover change zhang et al 2012 wei et al 2018 in our study the additive effects of p and pet on annual runoff were found which is consistent with some studies deng et al 2018 it indicated that p and pet both lead to reduce or increase runoff however many studies suggested that p and pet has the offsetting effects on annual runoff liu et al 2019 duan et al 2017b for example lv et al 2019 found that the offset effects of p and pet on runoff in the fen river watershed these inconsistent results demonstrated that the responses of runoff to climate variability may depend on the intensity and direction of climate factor variation and vary across different watersheds li et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 on the other hand some studies reported that the sensitivity of hydrological responses to forest change is not consistent which may change with climate gradient zhang et al 2017 global scale studies indicated that the runoff to forest cover change was more sensitive in dry climate zone watersheds than in wet climate zone watersheds li et al 2017 chen et al 2021 for instance sun et al 2006 found that the runoff decreased attribution to reforestation in semi arid regions was higher than in humid regions similarly wei et al 2018 found that the response of runoff to tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests was higher than that the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests when vegetation changes are consistent the reason may be that in the energy limited watersheds the saturated soils are common asbjornsen et al 2011 forests are less dependent on water resources but more responsive to temperature zhang et al 2017 the above analysis shows that the impact of climate change on runoff is complex 4 3 implications for water resources management in boreal forested watershed the siberian ecological region is one of the largest boreal forests as well as a great importance carbon sink liu et al 2020 da hinggan mountains of northeastern china is located in the southern margin of the siberian zone which also serves as a significant boreal forests biomes the da hinggan mountains is not only headwater watersheds of the nenjiang river and heilongjiang river but also an important carbon pool in china yu et al 2019 although forest quality and carbon storage have been increasing with the implementation of the nfpp there are decreasing trend in water resources in boreal forested watersheds duan and cai 2018a our study indicated that forest cover increase and climate variability both decreased runoff which indicated that there is a trade off relationship between water resources and the increase in boreal forest cover however boreal forest ecosystem is the most important component of terrestrial carbon pool thus the solution of balancing boreal forest carbon storage and their relationship with water resources must be sought in the future which is of great importance for the effective forested watershed management 4 4 uncertainty and future work although independent impacts of p pet and forest cover m change on runoff was distinguished using the framework of budyko hypothesis in this study there are several uncertainties and limitations firstly as shown in table 5 the small results errors were found similar errors were also found in liu et al 2019 li et al 2019 and xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 reported that the potential error is caused by ignores of the higher order term in taylor series expansion when estimating the runoff elasticity coefficient secondly different forms of budyko hypothesis and pet estimation can also influence the results for instance wu et al 2017 compared the differences of climate on runoff among the eight forms of budyko hypothesis and the results indicated that those are slightly different between the parametric and non parametric methods thirdly two forested watersheds located in the da hinggan mountains of north eastern china where spans the large area of permafrost duan et al 2017a in recent years with the globe climate warming the permafrost degradation was found in this region and influenced the interactions of surface underground hydrological processes duan et al 2017a a few studies suggested that the watershed underlying surface change may be related to the permafrost degradation liu et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study we applied the budyko hypothesis and elasticity coefficients of runoff to quantify the effects of forest cover change on runoff in two boreal forested watersheds in the da hinggan mountains of northeastern china the results showed that the hydrological effects of two watersheds were similar forest cover change and climate variability both decreased the runoff in two study watersheds from 1980 to 2012 and the responses of runoff to the changes in p was more sensitive than those in the pet and forest cover according to the quantitative results we concluded that although climate variability was the dominate driver for decreasing annual runoff forest cover change was of great importance for decreasing annual runoff in boreal forested watersheds in northeastern china these results highlight the importance of considering the effects of increasing forest biomes on surface water resource in the study boreal forest region of china and the similar regions across the globe

976,climate change effects on groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes are a function of interaction mechanisms between aquifers with unique hydraulic properties and ecosystems it is currently difficult to determine the magnitude and direction of impacts and to achieve integrated groundwater resources management partly because most impact assessments do not incorporate gdes this review aims to present existing knowledge regarding the assessment of gdes resilience to climate change in terms of methods applicability and outputs reliability in reference to transboundary aquifer tba settings climate change impacts estimation on groundwater includes future scenarios utilization through global climate models gcm to produce atmospheric forcing for hydrogeological models to provide

combination of models and different scenarios is recommended to avoid a single non representative outcome ecosystems protective measures in most tbas are country specific in southern africa and do not consider neighbouring countries activities while based on low flow requirements through baseflow excluding terrestrial gdes to a large extent therefore a collaborative approach to resource management

africa e g cobbing et al 2008 department of water affairs dwa 2011 altchenko villholth 2013 but little has happened not many gde related studies in literature were undertaken in tba settings therefore this review includes studies from non transboundary aquifers too a study has been initiated in the tuli karoo tba around the confluence of shashe and limpopo rivers in the southern african development community sadc region fig 1 which falls in semi arid climatic region and sub tropical ecoregion it is aimed at conceptualizing groundwater ecosystems interactions and applying appropriate modelling methods through downscaling techniques to assess the impacts of climate change on gdes here gdes have not been delineated groundwater is extensively utilized but abstraction has not been quantified and the impacts of climate change are unknown pietersen beekman 2016 although drier and hotter conditions are projected for the basin joubert kohler 1996 these knowledge gaps will be addressed to enable monitoring and evaluation of the associated impacts however the details of the initiated study are not the focus of this review also due to the absence of tba specific eco hydrogeological and climate change impact assessments studies on groundwater and gdes similar studies conducted elsewhere in the sadc region are included in this review this review therefore aims to comprehensively present the existing knowledge regarding the assessment of impacts of climate change on gdes in terms of methods models used applicability and outputs reliability in transboundary aquifer settings 2 gde classification and characterization 2 1 classification ecosystems are divided into aquatic e g wetlands springs and lakes and terrestrial e g forests and grasslands types both types comprise partly or entirely groundwater supported species seasonally or all year round in arid and semi arid regions with non perennial rivers many gdes e g seepage wetlands are seasonally supported wrp 1993 mccartney 2000 groundwater definition for ecological and environmental requirements extends to water from unconfined and perched aquifers interflow and soil water of the unsaturated zone hatton evans 1998 classified gdes into directly and indirectly dependent species table 1 subsequently there have been various gdes definitions e g colvin et al 2003 springer stevens 2009 aldous bach 2011 brown et al 2011 blevins aldous 2011 for the purpose of this review gdes are defined as ecosystems that depend on groundwater such that they would be negatively impacted if groundwater was inaccessible in terms of quantity quality and time 2 2 characterization the true characterization and optimal management of gdes require the understanding of encompassing ecological hydrological and physico chemical links between surface water groundwater and supported ecosystems currently very limited hunt et al 2016 necessitating improved understanding of groundwater ecosystems linkages paz et al 2017 reviewed current uses of ground penetrating radar in gde characterization through the construction of a database comprising ninety one worldwide case studies the review found that despite almost all case studies propitiating gdes only one expressly addressed gde research additionally most studies were conducted in temperate latitudes mainly in europe and north america other gde studies employing different methods were also conducted in these forested biomes dominated ecoregions e g howard merrifield 2010 gou et al 2015 pérez hoyos et al 2016 whiteman et al 2010 spałek pro ków 2011 chen et al

discharge regimes linked to ecosystems were grouped into categories and mapped groundwater ecosystems interactions were not investigated but rather recommended for local scale research eamus froend 2006 developed a gde identification method using geographical information systems gis tools spatial data and other instruments that can resolve the location and type of vegetation useful in inferring shallow watertables green 2016 barron et al 2014 recommended a method based on interpretation of the land surface response to the drying process derived from combined changes in two multispectral indices derived from normalised difference vegetation index ndvi and the normalised difference wetness index landsat imagery but its limitation is the applicability to regions with distinct drying

pérez hoyos et al 2016 developed a method to determine ecosystems groundwater dependency probability in nevada dominated by desert and xeric shrublands biomes the study modelled the relationship between the known gde locations and factors influencing dependence researchers recommended frameworks development able to provide quantitative tools to investigate interactions between shallow aquifers and soil moisture dynamics for gde eco hydrology characterization notwithstanding the study findings perhaps these investigative tools capabilities should be inclusive of deep shallow aquifer interconnectedness too where applicable considering that terrestrial vegetation of desert shrublands could be supported by deep aquifers 2 2 1 conceptual modelling of groundwater ecosystems interactions conceptual models are valuable tools in groundwater resources management and are needed together with quantitative assessments of how groundwater interacts with the environment kløve et al 2011a richardson et al 2011 in australia developed gde assessment guidelines incorporating conceptual modelling and glanville et al 2016 developed a catchment scale mapping method where each mapped gde was linked to a pictorial conceptual model and a mapping rule set this provided nature and extent of gdes in a landscape for catchment management various case studies elsewhere developed conceptual models to understand groundwater ecosystems interactions for specific gdes for instance in ghana nonterah et al 2019 developed a conceptual flow model representing the physical characteristics of sakumo wetland to explain the groundwater flow system and quantifying water fluxes contributing to the wetland water storage the results confirmed that wetland water fluxes are predominantly associated with local shallow groundwater flows without hydraulic links between the wetland and the underlying deep basement aquifer the development of detailed future predictive models was recommended since wachniew et al 2014 in an overview of current knowledge of the functioning of gdes and their relations with groundwater found that adequate representation of gdes in conceptual and numerical models of groundwater systems is a major scientific challenge perhaps these recommended future predictive models should incorporate this component towards comprehensive assessments according to howard et al 2006 models inclusive of gdes need to represent all water budget components relevant to groundwater surface water interactions including precipitation infiltration through unsaturated zones river bank filtration hyporheic fluxes and evapotranspiration under variable landuse schemes and changes of climate examples of integrated modelling include mirosław świątek okruszko 2011 for the narew catchment in poland refsgaard et al 2010 in denmark and krogulec 2003 2013 and kopeć et al 2013 for the kampinos national park in poland obstacles in this modelling kind are related to the wide range of time scales involved e g from hours exchange between groundwater and surface water to months hyporheic exchange and decades flow through the saturated zone howard et al 2006 wachniew et al 2014 indicated that modelling of interactions between groundwater and gdes requires a more comprehensive approach than is typically applied in flow and transport models which usually include only the saturated zone groundwater surface water interaction is a crucial component to maintenance of ecosystems and different models have been developed towards understanding it mainly on unconfined or shallow aquifers since ecosystems widely depend on shallow groundwater for instance pulido velazquez et al 2007 presented a methodology that simulates groundwater flow through linearization of unconfined aquifer flow problem based on boussinesq equation where a reference level is adopted also considering the required spatially variant parameters this methodology was applied in selected case studies and results also compared to outputs from other linearization techniques e g mcdonald harbaugh 1988 the study found that the methodology is applicable to any aquifer geometry including non horizontal bottoms hydrodynamic properties and boundary conditions even different prescribed head values and more accurate than classical approaches assuming invariant transmissivity in essence gde characterization tools exist however some may require expansion to enhance functionalities 3 review of the assessments of impacts of climate change on gdes effective incorporation of gdes into the policy and practice of water resources management depends on thorough understanding of how hydrogeological processes and external impacts influence quantity and quality of groundwater available to ecosystems wachniew et al 2014 gde services provision is threatened by climate change groundwater abstraction and other activities that alter flow regimes kath et al 2018 but research on how altered groundwater regimes affect the ecology and ecosystem services is currently fragmented with little integration across different gdes which hampers the ability to understand and manage ecological responses to changes in groundwater regimes kløve et al 2011b kath et al 2018 3 1 climate change impact assessments a major part of southern africa falls within the desert to semi arid zones trabucco zomer 2018 recent temperature 1981 2014 was dominated by positive anomalies fig 3 while precipitation anomalies did not show a distinct trend fig 4 but skewed towards positive temperature anomaly this implies likeliness of hotter climate conditions corresponding with high evaporation and evapotranspiration receding water bodies and declining groundwater levels davis reddy vincent 2017 on a global scale the groundwater response time to climate change in aquifers of the sadc is more than 100 years cuthbert et al 2019 depending on the subsurface hydraulic properties and the connectedness between groundwater and land surface several studies e g chiew mcmahon 2002 legesse et al 2003 scibek et al 2007 found that climate change can alter soil water storage and groundwater recharge rates such alterations influence groundwater hydraulics affecting watertable levels and aquifer dynamics jyrkama sykes 2007 ficklin et al 2010 including ecosystem functions johnson et al 2012 raymondi et al 2013 therefore aquifer properties are essential because according to dwire et al 2018 small shallow unconfined aquifers may respond rapidly to climate change than larger confined systems changes in vegetation land cover could also occur bates et al 2008 affecting runoff and recharge recent hydrogeological studies propose a more interdisciplinary approach and integration of various natural science fields similar to gde studies conducted in the middle vistula river valley kampinoski national park poland krogulec 2016 such studies results can provide informed outputs that can form an important input to various environmental and assessment studies 3 1 1 modelling approaches to impact assessment unfortunately not many climate change impact assessment studies incorporating gdes beyond just groundwater were found in literature nonetheless groundwater focused assessment studies provided insights into spatio temporal groundwater accessibility to gdes hence the inclusion of both groundwater focused and gde incorporative components in this review assuming that alterations in groundwater regimes affect gdes too the general approach to monthly temperature and precipitation simulations is the use of global circulation climate models gcms with the application of bias correction techniques essential for impact assessment studies of climate change watanabe et al 2012 in an attempt to deal with the changes of statistics of bias corrected variables from the historical to future simulations proposed a new method which conserves the changes of mean and standard deviation of the uncorrected model simulation data and compared it to five other bias correction methods these methods were applied to monthly temperature and precipitation data simulated from 12 gcms in the coupled model inter comparison project cmip3 archives the historical data were divided into two periods namely 1948 1972 for baseline calibration and 1974 1998 for validation where bias corrected data are compared with the observed data then the methods were applied to gcm future simulations for 2073 2097 the inter comparison showed no significant differences for historical simulations while large differences vary with characteristics of each method were observed in future simulations nonetheless the new method successfully conserved the changes in the mean standard deviation and the coefficient of variation however the authors concede that different characteristics may be identified if similar inter comparison was conducted on smaller scales the study recommended the use of multiple bias correction methods and evaluation of the associated sensitivity in the specific target regions with the aim of producing better approximations to historical basic and drought statistics for alto genil basin southern spain collados lara et al 2018 investigated different methods used to generate future monthly potential climatic scenarios temperature and precipitation further considering the meteorological droughts component where the standard precipitation index was adopted to perform drought analysis in this case historical climatic information and simulations were acquired from nine regional climatic models rcms for a future period 2071 2100 assuming potential emission scenario and bias correction and delta change conceptual approaches were applied using five statistical transformation techniques for each the reference period is from 1971 to 2000 and a multi objective analysis approach was followed moreover sensitivity analysis of the overall results obtained at catchment scale using a lumped derived from single series for the whole study or a distributed defined by applying the correction techniques in each cell by using the historical and rcm series available for the cell approach was undertaken the study found that the method allows improvement of the definition of local climate scenarios from the rcm simulation considering drought statistics extreme climate events floods and droughts can affect river baseflow dynamics soil water capacity and moisture content evaporation and evapotranspiration non linear vegetation responses infiltration and percolation rates depth to groundwater recharge and discharge which would affect groundwater availability to supported ecosystems quantification vicente serrano et al 2013 forecasting pozzi et al 2013 and prediction of droughts and their impacts e g environmental are difficult and the complex underlying processes driving drought exacerbate the situation under future climate change scenarios cook et al 2018 dai et al 2018 scheff 2019 resulting in future uncertainties therefore integrated approaches to drought modelling and forecasting closer to actual impacts are required tramblay et al 2020 provided an assessment of the complexity of the drought phenomenon in the mediterranean region and presented various perspectives on drought in the present and under future climate change scenarios to assist improve resilience and adaptive capacities of drought faced environments this overview concluded that future research should be extended to selected representative locations covering the mediterranean basin countries without exception through integrated appraisal of drought however scarcity of data and homogenous datasets were highlighted as a major challenge in this regard one example of a flood related study was conducted by senent aparicio et al 2018 in the ladra river basin in spain which is characterised by a quick rainfall to runoff response due to a predominantly low permeable bedrock and a moderate slope and dominated by an oceanic climate with all year round mild temperatures and dry summer seasons machine learning techniques were coupled with the soil and water assessment tool swat it concluded that swat simulations can be used in combination with machine learning models e g extreme learning machine to estimate instantaneous peak flows thus reducing uncertainty especially where sub daily observation data is scarce this is crucial towards flood risk assessment historically gcm simulated precipitation rates have been used to predict inflow to calibrated hydrological and hydrogeological models the gcms however were found to be more successful in simulating temperature extremes than precipitation extremes especially at local scale randall et al 2007 tadross et al 2011 their raw output cannot be used at higher spatial resolutions limiting usefulness in specific regions other sources of uncertainty include the choice of climate models historical data quality and boundary uncertainty hewitson tadross 2011 fortunately the downscaling techniques are available for application towards bridging the spatial resolution gaps and producing realistic local projections green 2016 by addressing the disparity between gcms coarse spatial scale and observations from local meteorological stations wilby wigley 1997 hewitson crane 2006 the state of the art downscaling techniques were used by allen et al 2010 to predict variation in recharge in the trans national abbotsford sumas aquifer between canada and usa representing a wet coastal climate the study found that the variability in recharge predictions indicated that seasonal performance of downscaling tool is important and a range of gcms should be considered for water management planning according to hashemi et al 2015 a coupled surface groundwater modelling approach similar to that used by barron et al 2012 is the most appropriate for arid regions especially data scarce areas provided an appropriate groundwater model is selected regarding hydrological models various water balance models have been developed pérez sánchez et al 2019 compared six such models témez abcd gr2m awbm guo 5p and thornthwaite mather in sixteen basins with different climatic conditions based on aridity index within spain the 1977 2010 period and six statistical indices were used to compare results of different models it was found that lumped hydrological balance models performed well in humid and sub humid regions regardless of the area moreover models complexity and higher resolution does not guarantee improved performance of the model rather the climatic characteristics of the watershed are the most important in this case gr2m model outperformed based on uncertainty analysis using fiteval software the results discourage the reliance on a single hydrological model especially because the driving climatic characteristics of different regions are diverse e g arid to semi arid southern africa where none of these models were tested for applicability therefore the selection of appropriate hydrological model aligned to local basin or catchment conditions is crucial some examples of studies that utilized assessment methods in different regions are briefly discussed below melo wendland 2016 assessed climate change impacts on the guarani aquifer outcrop zone using gcm outputs as water balance model inputs to estimate recharge across different landuse types for a groundwater model the study found that recharge will be reduced and the watertable lowered under most scenarios in turkey ertük et al 2014 evaluated the impact of climate change on groundwater resources in part of köyceğiz dalyan watershed because decrease in annual and winter precipitation as well as an increase in temperature were observed since the 1960s hydrological modelling using swat model was conducted to quantify impacts on water budget components the simulation results indicated that almost all water budget components have decreased together with a significant decrease in groundwater recharge and storage this could be detrimental to groundwater supported ecosystems dams et al 2010 developed a methodology to predict the potential impact of climate change on quantitative groundwater characteristics determining terrestrial gdes and tested it in kleine nete basin belgium the tool included coupling of a distributed hydrological model wetspa a gis based model suitable for use of flood prediction and watershed management on catchment scale able to simulate hydrological processes of precipitation snowmelt interception depression surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration percolation interflow groundwater flow etc continuously both in time and space with a transient groundwater flow model which was developed with a high temporal and spatial distribution using modflow modular finite difference flow model which simulates groundwater flow through aquifers an ensemble of 28 climate scenarios was selected to compensate for high uncertainty in future climate components predictions projections indicated that potential evapotranspiration rises in summer and decreases in winter precipitation decreases in summer and increases in winter groundwater recharge decreases on average 20 mm per year and groundwater discharge dropped by 4 therefore the terrestrial gdes would likely diminish due to future climate changes because of low discharge received dwire et al 2018 assessed potential effects of climate change on riparian areas wetlands and other gdes in the blue mountains oregon state using regional predictions of vulnerability from brown et al 2011 published scientific studies and different datasets empirical data scarcity on specific mechanisms through which climate change influences riparian and wetland plant communities led to uncertainty in projections nonetheless the results indicated that increased warming will influence groundwater recharge and discharge permeability and porosity of rocks affect the vulnerability and sensitivity of gdes to warmer climates and small unconfined aquifers may respond rapidly to climate change than large confined aquifers these concur with bertrand et al 2012 and aldous et al 2015 who found that climate change effects on gdes are influenced by aquifer size and location this study concluded that specific effects of climate change will vary depending on local hydrology topography streamside micro climates and landuse peterson halofsky 2017 recommended climate change inclusion in resource management to refine and prioritize current gde practices kløve et al 2014 reviewed climate change effects on groundwater and gdes by summarizing relevant information based on studies from different hydrogeological strata and climate zones the impacts on ecosystems were discussed based on findings on factors influencing their biodiversity and functioning at the time the review concluded that the impacts will vary depending on ecosystem type the amount and changes in water input smaller aquifers information scarcity was a challenge because monitoring on ecosystems scale lacks in most cases the study recommended scientific methodologies and monitoring activities development because the uncertainty associated with analysis techniques remains high due to lack of understanding of several key processes although kløve et al 2014 synthesizes the effects of climate change on gdes this review is the first to the authors knowledge to consider gdes in a transboundary aquifer setting from a southern african sub tropical ecoregion perspective in the netherlands van engelenburg et al 2018 undertook to understand how climate change affects a groundwater system to develop adaptation measures for secured drinking water supply from sandy veluwe aquifer of up to 200 m depth some existing groundwater extractions were reportedly affecting nearby gdes to reduce projected impact uncertainty they employed azure model detailed and well calibrated hydrological model to study the projected impact of climate change scenarios and adaptation measures findings were in a slowly responding large aquifer projected climate change may cause rising groundwater levels despite the projected increase in summer dryness simulated climate change impact differs for each studied ecosystem therefore the combined effect strongly depends on local conditions highlighting the local scale modelling requirement in china desert oases exist around inland river basins alluvial fans in arid areas where vegetation growth is wholly groundwater dependent due to low rainfall and arid environment xu su 2019 evaluated vegetative growth using the ndvi hydrometeorological data and the exploitation of water resources of the nalenggele alluvial fan northwest china correlation analysis results indicated that climatic factors shared little direct correlation with the ndvis whilst depth to groundwater table and shallow groundwater distribution are the direct influencing factors of vegetation growth additionally shallow groundwater distribution area with the ecological water level 4 m in 2020 will decrease to approximately 78 86 of that in 2019 therefore vegetation may face degradation risk from combined climate change and human activities influence warranting improved gde protection through management strategy and legislation in similar areas havril et al 2018 evaluated the influence of climate change impacted recharge on groundwater levels and interconnected groundwater flow patterns at the tihany peninsula hungary using two dimensional transient numerical simulations based on site specific measurements and climatic prediction results indicated that future trends can cause dynamic evolution and dissipation of transient groundwater flow systems and the characteristic flow system hierarchy can change from nested flow systems to a set of single flow cells this could have a negative impact on associated gdes preservation since long term climate change could potentially have serious consequences including wetland desiccation larocque et al 2019 in canada reviewed twenty two studies to identify climate change impacts on groundwater recharge and river baseflow reviewed studies differed in findings attributed to different modelling approaches and no trend in recharge changes was observed from west to east climatic conditions in different geographical location not highlighted here could have affected these findings too as per reviewed studies above the reviewers strongly recommended i the use of a variety of climate models preferably integrated models and emission scenarios and ii studying of long term climate change impacts on groundwater resources at different scales another review kusangaya 2014 which focused on scale sub regional to country level and gcm projections from previous studies concluded that catchment level studies are necessary for southern africa especially because water resource management decisions are taken accordingly using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data resende et al 2019 found a good correlation between changes in total groundwater storage and climate variability for shallow aquifers and that inter annual groundwater dynamics are driven by el niño southern oscillation enso in southern africa climate change may influence groundwater temperature and flow rates which may in turn impact riverine ecosystems and gdes dependent on surface expression of groundwater kurylyk et al 2014 evaluated the potential impact of climate change on the timing magnitude and temperature of groundwater discharge from small unconfined aquifers that undergo seasonal freezing and thawing seven downscaled climate scenarios for 2046 2065 were utilized to drive surficial water and energy balance models help3 and forhym2 to obtain future projections for daily ground surface temperature and groundwater recharge future surface conditions were applied as boundary conditions to drive subsurface simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow and energy transport using sutra a usgs finite element model simulations indicated a potential rise in the magnitude up to 34 and temperature up to 3 6 c of groundwater discharge into the adjacent river during summer months due to projected increases in air temperature and precipitation this demonstrated the complexity of thermal sensitivity of aquifers and baseflow dominated streams to decadal climate change it was concluded that the thermal response of groundwater to climate change is strongly dependent on the aquifer dimensions this conclusion resonates with that of climate change impacts on gdes jyväsjärvi et al 2015 investigated long term water temperature trends in 66 cold water springs using bryophyte and macro invertebrate species data from finnish springs and spring fed streams to assess ecological impacts of the predicted warming mean spring water temperatures were closely related to regional air temperature and global radiative forcing of the corresponding year based on low rcp2 6 intermediate rcp6 and high emission rcp8 5 climate scenarios the study estimated that an increase in mean spring water temperature is likely to range from 0 67 c rcp2 6 to 5 94 c rcp8 5 by 2086 for the worst case scenario ecosystems water temperature may exceed 12 c by the end of the 21st century about 3 times the late 1970s original mean it was concluded that an increase in spring water temperature will likely have substantial biodiversity impacts whereas species diversity of headwater generalists is likely to increase even a slight increase by 1 c in water temperature may eliminate endemic spring species thus altering bryophyte and macroinvertebrate assemblages of spring fed streams it is widely known that gde services are threatened by climate change because groundwater flow regimes are altered but how ecosystems are affected is less understood kløve et al 2011b orwig 2014 recently kath et al 2018 developed a framework for assessing ecological responses to groundwater regime alteration fergra it is designed to understand how the timing variability duration frequency and magnitude of groundwater connections to different gdes are affected in turn affecting their ecological processes and ecosystem service provision integrated management is optimized this way because multiple gdes can be assessed concurrently across the landscape it can be deduced from reviewed studies that an integrated model or a combination of models that can address uncertainties to a certain extent with the application of downscaling techniques appropriate for specific study area or aquifer conditions at a local scale would be the most appropriate to enhance reliability of assessment results although data scarcity could be a hindrance 4 assessments in transboundary aquifers settings the key international groundwater issues are availability metrics water depletion water quality degradation water energy nexus and transboundary water conflicts fienen arshad 2016 water availability stress conditions are expected to worsen due to climate change and this could be further affected by transboundary water issues since according to burak margat 2016 38 of available fresh water resources is transboundary groundwater quality issues are already observed in the border between northeastern greece vryzas et al 2012 and russia zektser 2012 and the ceylanpinar aquifer in turkey with ras al ain springs in syria this is possibly the case with most tbas but has not been investigated comprehensively more than seventy tbas have been mapped in africa and despite their importance only eleven have been subjected to more detailed studies whilst groundwater demand is expected to increase due to climate change and population growth nijsten et al 2018 only one stampriet transboundary aquifer system out of about 30 tbas in the sadc region 8 out of 600 internationally has a co governance and co management agreement and gde research is still to be undertaken since most ecosystems investigations were mainly from a botanical wildlife natural environment perspective braune xu 2011 this lack is attributed to enabling scientific knowledge scarcity currently in southern africa protective measures for ecosystems are country specific and do not consider activities of neighbouring countries these measures are based on low flow requirements through baseflow excluding terrestrial gdes to a large extent pietersen beekman 2016 assessed groundwater management in the region and concluded that climate change implications for groundwater are unknown but may be considerable and recommended groundwater behaviour evaluation under different climate and abstraction scenarios an overview by cobbing et al 2008 suggested that each aquifer s development potential should be assessed against factors such as interactions between groundwater surface water and gdes before establishing sustainable transboundary resource utilization moreover altchenko villholth 2013 highlighted the importance of implementing frameworks for managing the already stressed shared groundwater resources and associated ecosystems a council for scientific and industrial research environmentek csir environmentek 2003 study to assess groundwater resources protection and strategic uses in the transboundary limpopo basin recommended a framework development to assess gde occurrence and importance tbas not managed cooperatively face an over exploitation risk to the detriment of other sharing state s godfrey van dyk 2002 jarvis et al 2005 and ecosystems services not many gde inclusive studies undertaken in tbas were found from literature but sections above show that alterations on groundwater regime will most probably affect gdes this knowledge gap and fragmented information necessitate more research in order achieve integrated resource management collaboratively this is especially true for transboundary aquifers where existing agreements on the use of groundwater generally assume a degree of stationarity cooley et al 2011 several conceptual models can apply to transboundary aquifers even where implications differ for each sharing country e g eckstein eckstein 2005 groundwater surface water interconnectedness is very important because the source of water and water users human or ecological may be in different countries data sharing and integration are more challenging across national borders but extremely important to reduce the uncertainties surrounding integrated management the sadc 2011 report recommended the inclusion of environmental monitoring in tbas which encompasses all gde types clearly more investigations regarding transboundary aquifer gdes still need to be conducted let alone the impacts assessment in the face of global environmental changes 4 1 tuli karoo tba in relation to gdes the tuli karoo tba has a possibility of cross border negative impacts on respective groundwater resources and gdes with its interlinked system between riparian countries but these countries have no co governance and co management agreements in place gomo vermeulen 2017 semi arid climate characterizes the area with mean annual precipitation reducing from 400 500 mm in the upper reaches to 200 300 mm in the lower reaches midgley et al 1994 le baron et al 2011 rainfall is highly seasonal with rain days seldom exceeding 50 annually the mean daily minimum temperatures range from 10 c in the interior to 12 c whilst the mean maximum temperature in

minimum temperatures joubert kohler 1996 with potential evaporation expected to increase by 6 to 8 over most of the limpopo basin schulze et al 2001 which could result in increased evapotranspiration stream flow reduction and less recharge to unconfined alluvial aquifers along the riparian zones groundwater recharge can only occur during extremely large storms sadc 2011 based on sharif singh 1999 findings for semi arid unconfined aquifers a general drying trend under most climate change forecasts is expected for this tba limpopo river and its tributaries have become ephemeral and flow

national park wetlands fig 6 where permanent kolope wetlands and maloutswa pan are seasonally groundwater supported davies et al 2013 identified this tba as one of those requiring international collaborative management and further research with both gde types existing conceptual modelling is required to define sub surface flow dynamics that control groundwater accessibility to them considering the scarcity of required scientific information climate change related research is near non existent here while projections suggest negative impacts for groundwater supported ecosystems 5 discussions and conclusion this paper aims to comprehensively review current knowledge regarding the assessment of climate change impacts on gdes in terms of methods applicability and outputs reliability especially in transboundary aquifer settings 5 1 knowledge gaps in the past decade there has been a gradual increase in the body of knowledge in terms of climate change assessment studies incorporating gdes however some knowledge gaps are identified assessment studies of climate change effects on gdes have not been undertaken in transboundary aquifer settings while ecosystems of strategic and socio economics importance exist in these environments ecosystems protective measures in most southern african tbas are country specific and do not consider neighbouring countries activities which could be detrimental to discharge zones and aligned gdes therefore collaborative research and integrated resource management are required among riparian countries data scarcity time series data or skewed spatial distribution or both most assessment studies highlight scarcity especially at local ecosystems scale due to lack of monitoring despite the uniqueness of individual aquifer hydraulics presenting a challenge for inductive research explicit validation of models and reduction of uncertainties are compromised therefore an urgent need to build basic scientific information and databases e g delineation mapping conceptualization inventory climate etc through monitoring exists this will enable the development of non existent co governance and co management mechanisms of shared resources in transboundary aquifer settings integrated conjunctive management of surface water groundwater and gdes ecological approaches are rare in groundwater management knüppe 2011 while the integrated water resource management principle requires coordinated development of water land and related resources without compromising on the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 therefore sustainable gde management lies in their integration into groundwater resources geographical realms detailed research is mainly concentrated in temperate latitudes of europe and north america with none in the afrotropic realms of subtropical ecoregion characterised by arid to semi arid climate by implication the applicability of reviewed assessment methods scenario generation and downscaling techniques has not been tested widely in different climatic regimes thus comprehensive general conclusions cannot be drawn groundwater quality may also be a limiting factor for the long term sustainability of groundwater resources worldwide gurdak et al 2012 and there is a need to intensify research on climate change effects on groundwater quality because gde sustenance relies on this aspect too 6 conclusions literature indicates that climate change does impact groundwater resulting in altered recharge discharge and groundwater levels due to changing rainfall patterns e g chiew mcmahon 2002 legesse et al 2003 scibek et al 2007 this affects gdes because for their sustenance groundwater availability should not change beyond its normal range of fluctuation colvin et al 2003 more research is required to improve understanding of climate and groundwater interactions and to guide integrated groundwater management green 2016 modelling studies highlighted uncertainties in gcm outputs and projections e g randall et al 2007 tadross et al 2011 hewitson tadross 2011 which are inputs into coupling hydrogeological models therefore researchers e g howard et al 2006 mirosław świątek okruszko 2011 refsgaard et al 2010 krogulec 2003 2013 kopeć et al 2013 wachniew et al 2014 larocque et al 2019 strongly recommend the use of integrated models or a combination of models and study area appropriate downscaling techniques there is no all encompassing approach to assessment studies especially at local scale because aquifer properties are unique the research question is what groundwater processes control the effects of climate change induced impacts on gdes within a specific aquifer the understanding of interactions between ecosystems groundwater and climate change is crucial towards such comprehensive assessments there is a dire lack of similar research in southern africa and in transboundary aquifer settings hence the initiation of the tuli karoo study to enable collaborative resource management and protection inclusive of ecosystems groundwater requirements and the development of joint adaptation strategies against climate change impacts on groundwater and groundwater supported ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

976,climate change effects on groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes are a function of interaction mechanisms between aquifers with unique hydraulic properties and ecosystems it is currently difficult to determine the magnitude and direction of impacts and to achieve integrated groundwater resources management partly because most impact assessments do not incorporate gdes this review aims to present existing knowledge regarding the assessment of gdes resilience to climate change in terms of methods applicability and outputs reliability in reference to transboundary aquifer tba settings climate change impacts estimation on groundwater includes future scenarios utilization through global climate models gcm to produce atmospheric forcing for hydrogeological models to provide independent recharge estimates local level studies are recommended to rectify gcm projections scale coarseness through downscaling techniques available for application towards bridging the spatial resolution gaps catering for decision making many studies highlight output uncertainties stemming from e g the selection of downscaling methods and compatibility with coupling models application of a combination of models and different scenarios is recommended to avoid a single non representative outcome ecosystems protective measures in most tbas are country specific in southern africa and do not consider neighbouring countries activities while based on low flow requirements through baseflow excluding terrestrial gdes to a large extent therefore a collaborative approach to resource management and research is required among riparian states but the understanding of groundwater ecosystems climate change interactions is poor hence a study was initiated in semi arid tuli karoo tba shared between botswana south africa and zimbabwe to address this scientific knowledge gap keywords groundwater dependent ecosystems climate change transboundary aquifers 1 introduction climate change induced hydrological variability can affect groundwater groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes and associated services the annual loss of essential ecosystem services value is high esteban dinar 2016 and gde services are normally disregarded while ecological approaches are rare in groundwater management knüppe 2011 despite gde ecosystem services significance their long term spatio temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate and groundwater huntington et al 2016 potential effects of climate change on groundwater and sustainability are poorly understood kumar 2012 loukas et al 2015 however there has been a gradual knowledge increase even from different geohydrological environments e g in detrital plana oropesa torreblanca aquifer pulido velazquez et al 2018 and the sierra de las nieves karst aquifer pardo iguzquiza et al 2019 notwithstanding the amount of knowledge generated in recent studies such investigations are mainly concentrated in europe and america with very few undertaken in the southern african complex geology groundwater levels decline and change in groundwater flow regimes and storage could alter groundwater accessibility patterns to gdes and according to tartasky 2007 could result in water quality deterioration economically important ecosystems could occur in transboundary environments e g kgalagadi transfrontier park shared between botswana namibia and south africa the great limpopo transfrontier conservation area shared between botswana mozambique south africa and zimbabwe and the greater mapungubwe transfrontier conservation area shared between botswana south africa and zimbabwe regrettably ecosystems protective measures in many tbas are country specific and do not consider activities of neighbouring countries they are further based on low flow requirements through baseflow thus largely excluding terrestrial gdes a collaborative approach to shared aquifers and supported ecosystems is critical in integrated management and scientific research previous studies called for gde identification and protection zones delineation in transboundary aquifers tbas of southern africa e g cobbing et al 2008 department of water affairs dwa 2011 altchenko villholth 2013 but little has happened not many gde related studies in literature were undertaken in tba settings therefore this review includes studies from non transboundary aquifers too a study has been initiated in the tuli karoo tba around the confluence of shashe and limpopo rivers in the southern african development community sadc region fig 1 which falls in semi arid climatic region and sub tropical ecoregion it is aimed at conceptualizing groundwater ecosystems interactions and applying appropriate modelling methods through downscaling techniques to assess the impacts of climate change on gdes here gdes have not been delineated groundwater is extensively utilized but abstraction has not been quantified and the impacts of climate change are unknown pietersen beekman 2016 although drier and hotter conditions are projected for the basin joubert kohler 1996 these knowledge gaps will be addressed to enable monitoring and evaluation of the associated impacts however the details of the initiated study are not the focus of this review also due to the absence of tba specific eco hydrogeological and climate change impact assessments studies on groundwater and gdes similar studies conducted elsewhere in the sadc region are included in this review this review therefore aims to comprehensively present the existing knowledge regarding the assessment of impacts of climate change on gdes in terms of methods models used applicability and outputs reliability in transboundary aquifer settings 2 gde classification and characterization 2 1 classification ecosystems are divided into aquatic e g wetlands springs and lakes and terrestrial e g forests and grasslands types both types comprise partly or entirely groundwater supported species seasonally or all year round in arid and semi arid regions with non perennial rivers many gdes e g seepage wetlands are seasonally supported wrp 1993 mccartney 2000 groundwater definition for ecological and environmental requirements extends to water from unconfined and perched aquifers interflow and soil water of the unsaturated zone hatton evans 1998 classified gdes into directly and indirectly dependent species table 1 subsequently there have been various gdes definitions e g colvin et al 2003 springer stevens 2009 aldous bach 2011 brown et al 2011 blevins aldous 2011 for the purpose of this review gdes are defined as ecosystems that depend on groundwater such that they would be negatively impacted if groundwater was inaccessible in terms of quantity quality and time 2 2 characterization the true characterization and optimal management of gdes require the understanding of encompassing ecological hydrological and physico chemical links between surface water groundwater and supported ecosystems currently very limited hunt et al 2016 necessitating improved understanding of groundwater ecosystems linkages paz et al 2017 reviewed current uses of ground penetrating radar in gde characterization through the construction of a database comprising ninety one worldwide case studies the review found that despite almost all case studies propitiating gdes only one expressly addressed gde research additionally most studies were conducted in temperate latitudes mainly in europe and north america other gde studies employing different methods were also conducted in these forested biomes dominated ecoregions e g howard merrifield 2010 gou et al 2015 pérez hoyos et al 2016 whiteman et al 2010 spałek pro ków 2011 chen et al

lags severely a south african study by colvin et al 2007 mapped national potential gdes whereby broadly similar habitat types e g riparian and hydrogeological characteristics that control aquifer discharge regimes linked to ecosystems were grouped into categories and mapped groundwater ecosystems interactions were not investigated but rather recommended for local scale research eamus froend 2006 developed a gde identification method using geographical information systems gis tools spatial data and other instruments that can resolve the location and type of vegetation useful in inferring shallow watertables green 2016 barron et al 2014 recommended a method based on interpretation of the land surface response to the drying process derived from combined changes in two multispectral indices derived from normalised difference vegetation index ndvi and the normalised difference wetness index landsat imagery but its limitation is the applicability to regions with distinct drying periods only with the aim of understanding the wetland spatial dynamics of kattankulathur block in india to develop a mitigation plan to save it sivakumar ghosh 2016 analysed the multi dated satellite

pérez hoyos et al 2016 developed a method to determine ecosystems groundwater dependency probability in nevada dominated by desert and xeric shrublands biomes the study modelled the relationship between the known gde locations and factors influencing dependence researchers recommended frameworks development able to provide quantitative tools to investigate interactions between shallow aquifers and soil moisture dynamics for gde eco hydrology characterization notwithstanding the study findings perhaps these investigative tools capabilities should be inclusive of deep shallow aquifer interconnectedness too where applicable considering that terrestrial vegetation of desert shrublands could be supported by deep aquifers 2 2 1 conceptual modelling of groundwater ecosystems interactions conceptual models are valuable tools in groundwater resources management and are needed together with quantitative assessments of how groundwater interacts with the environment kløve et al 2011a richardson et al 2011 in australia developed gde assessment guidelines incorporating conceptual modelling and glanville et al 2016 developed a catchment scale mapping method where each mapped gde was linked to a pictorial conceptual model and a mapping rule set this provided nature and extent of gdes in a landscape for catchment management various case studies elsewhere developed conceptual models to understand groundwater ecosystems interactions for specific gdes for instance in ghana nonterah et al 2019 developed a conceptual flow model representing the physical characteristics of sakumo wetland to explain the groundwater flow system and quantifying water fluxes contributing to the wetland water storage the results confirmed that wetland water fluxes are predominantly associated with local shallow groundwater flows without hydraulic links between the wetland and the underlying deep basement aquifer the development of detailed future predictive models was recommended since wachniew et al 2014 in an overview of current knowledge of the functioning of gdes and their relations with groundwater found that adequate representation of gdes in conceptual and numerical models of groundwater systems is a major scientific challenge perhaps these recommended future predictive models should incorporate this component towards comprehensive assessments according to howard et al 2006 models inclusive of gdes need to represent all water budget components relevant to groundwater surface water interactions including precipitation infiltration through unsaturated zones river bank filtration hyporheic fluxes and evapotranspiration under variable landuse schemes and changes of climate examples of integrated modelling include mirosław świątek okruszko 2011 for the narew catchment in poland refsgaard et al 2010 in denmark and krogulec 2003 2013 and kopeć et al 2013 for the kampinos national park in poland obstacles in this modelling kind are related to the wide range of time scales involved e g from hours exchange between groundwater and surface water to months hyporheic exchange and decades flow through the saturated zone howard et al 2006 wachniew et al 2014 indicated that modelling of interactions between groundwater and gdes requires a more comprehensive approach than is typically applied in flow and transport models which usually include only the saturated zone groundwater surface water interaction is a crucial component to maintenance of ecosystems and different models have been developed towards understanding it mainly on unconfined or shallow aquifers since ecosystems widely depend on shallow groundwater for instance pulido velazquez et al 2007 presented a methodology that simulates groundwater flow through linearization of unconfined aquifer flow problem based on boussinesq equation where a reference level is adopted also considering the required spatially variant parameters this methodology was applied in selected case studies and results also compared to outputs from other linearization techniques e g mcdonald harbaugh 1988 the study found that the methodology is applicable to any aquifer geometry including non horizontal bottoms hydrodynamic properties and boundary conditions even different prescribed head values and more accurate than classical approaches assuming invariant transmissivity in essence gde characterization tools exist however some may require expansion to enhance functionalities 3 review of the assessments of impacts of climate change on gdes effective incorporation of gdes into the policy and practice of water resources management depends on thorough understanding of how hydrogeological processes and external impacts influence quantity and quality of groundwater available to ecosystems wachniew et al 2014 gde services provision is threatened by climate change groundwater abstraction and other activities that alter flow regimes kath et al 2018 but research on how altered groundwater regimes affect the ecology and ecosystem services is currently fragmented with little integration across different gdes which hampers the ability to understand and manage ecological responses to changes in groundwater regimes kløve et al 2011b kath et al 2018 3 1 climate change impact assessments a major part of southern africa falls within the desert to semi arid zones trabucco zomer 2018 recent temperature 1981 2014 was dominated by positive anomalies fig 3 while precipitation anomalies did not show a distinct trend fig 4 but skewed towards positive temperature anomaly this implies likeliness of hotter climate conditions corresponding with high evaporation and evapotranspiration receding water bodies and declining groundwater levels davis reddy vincent 2017 on a global scale the groundwater response time to climate change in aquifers of the sadc is more than 100 years cuthbert et al 2019 depending on the subsurface hydraulic properties and the connectedness between groundwater and land surface several studies e g chiew mcmahon 2002 legesse et al 2003 scibek et al 2007 found that climate change can alter soil water storage and groundwater recharge rates such alterations influence groundwater hydraulics affecting watertable levels and aquifer dynamics jyrkama sykes 2007 ficklin et al 2010 including ecosystem functions johnson et al 2012 raymondi et al 2013 therefore aquifer properties are essential because according to dwire et al 2018 small shallow unconfined aquifers may respond rapidly to climate change than larger confined systems changes in vegetation land cover could also occur bates et al 2008 affecting runoff and recharge recent hydrogeological studies propose a more interdisciplinary approach and integration of various natural science fields similar to gde studies conducted in the middle vistula river valley kampinoski national park poland krogulec 2016 such studies results can provide informed outputs that can form an important input to various environmental and assessment studies 3 1 1 modelling approaches to impact assessment unfortunately not many climate change impact assessment studies incorporating gdes beyond just groundwater were found in literature nonetheless groundwater focused assessment studies provided insights into spatio temporal groundwater accessibility to gdes hence the inclusion of both groundwater focused and gde incorporative components in this review assuming that alterations in groundwater regimes affect gdes too the general approach to monthly temperature and precipitation simulations is the use of global circulation climate models gcms with the application of bias correction techniques essential for impact assessment studies of climate change watanabe et al 2012 in an attempt to deal with the changes of statistics of bias corrected variables from the historical to future simulations proposed a new method which conserves the changes of mean and standard deviation of the uncorrected model simulation data and compared it to five other bias correction methods these methods were applied to monthly temperature and precipitation data simulated from 12 gcms in the coupled model inter comparison project cmip3 archives the historical data were divided into two periods namely 1948 1972 for baseline calibration and 1974 1998 for validation where bias corrected data are compared with the observed data then the methods were applied to gcm future simulations for 2073 2097 the inter comparison showed no significant differences for historical simulations while large differences vary with characteristics of each method were observed in future simulations nonetheless the new method successfully conserved the changes in the mean standard deviation and the coefficient of variation however the authors concede that different characteristics may be identified if similar inter comparison was conducted on smaller scales the study recommended the use of multiple bias correction methods and evaluation of the associated sensitivity in the specific target regions with the aim of producing better approximations to historical basic and drought statistics for alto genil basin southern spain collados lara et al 2018 investigated different methods used to generate future monthly potential climatic scenarios temperature and precipitation further considering the meteorological droughts component where the standard precipitation index was adopted to perform drought analysis in this case historical climatic information and simulations were acquired from nine regional climatic models rcms for a future period 2071 2100 assuming potential emission scenario and bias correction and delta change conceptual approaches were applied using five statistical transformation techniques for each the reference period is from 1971 to 2000 and a multi objective analysis approach was followed moreover sensitivity analysis of the overall results obtained at catchment scale using a lumped derived from single series for the whole study or a distributed defined by applying the correction techniques in each cell by using the historical and rcm series available for the cell approach was undertaken the study found that the method allows improvement of the definition of local climate scenarios from the rcm simulation considering drought statistics extreme climate events floods and droughts can affect river baseflow dynamics soil water capacity and moisture content evaporation and evapotranspiration non linear vegetation responses infiltration and percolation rates depth to groundwater recharge and discharge which would affect groundwater availability to supported ecosystems quantification vicente serrano et al 2013 forecasting pozzi et al 2013 and prediction of droughts and their impacts e g environmental are difficult and the complex underlying processes driving drought exacerbate the situation under future climate change scenarios cook et al 2018 dai et al 2018 scheff 2019 resulting in future uncertainties therefore integrated approaches to drought modelling and forecasting closer to actual impacts are required tramblay et al 2020 provided an assessment of the complexity of the drought phenomenon in the mediterranean region and presented various perspectives on drought in the present and under future climate change scenarios to assist improve resilience and adaptive capacities of drought faced environments this overview concluded that future research should be extended to selected representative locations covering the mediterranean basin countries without exception through integrated appraisal of drought however scarcity of data and homogenous datasets were highlighted as a major challenge in this regard one example of a flood related study was conducted by senent aparicio et al 2018 in the ladra river basin in spain which is characterised by a quick rainfall to runoff response due to a predominantly low permeable bedrock and a moderate slope and dominated by an oceanic climate with all year round mild temperatures and dry summer seasons machine learning techniques were coupled with the soil and water assessment tool swat it concluded that swat simulations can be used in combination with machine learning models e g extreme learning machine to estimate instantaneous peak flows thus reducing uncertainty especially where sub daily observation data is scarce this is crucial towards flood risk assessment historically gcm simulated precipitation rates have been used to predict inflow to calibrated hydrological and hydrogeological models the gcms however were found to be more successful in simulating temperature extremes than precipitation extremes especially at local scale randall et al 2007 tadross et al 2011 their raw output cannot be used at higher spatial resolutions limiting usefulness in specific regions other sources of uncertainty include the choice of climate models historical data quality and boundary uncertainty hewitson tadross 2011 fortunately the downscaling techniques are available for application towards bridging the spatial resolution gaps and producing realistic local projections green 2016 by addressing the disparity between gcms coarse spatial scale and observations from local meteorological stations wilby wigley 1997 hewitson crane 2006 the state of the art downscaling techniques were used by allen et al 2010 to predict variation in recharge in the trans national abbotsford sumas aquifer between canada and usa representing a wet coastal climate the study found that the variability in recharge predictions indicated that seasonal performance of downscaling tool is important and a range of gcms should be considered for water management planning according to hashemi et al 2015 a coupled surface groundwater modelling approach similar to that used by barron et al 2012 is the most appropriate for arid regions especially data scarce areas provided an appropriate groundwater model is selected regarding hydrological models various water balance models have been developed pérez sánchez et al 2019 compared six such models témez abcd gr2m awbm guo 5p and thornthwaite mather in sixteen basins with different climatic conditions based on aridity index within spain the 1977 2010 period and six statistical indices were used to compare results of different models it was found that lumped hydrological balance models performed well in humid and sub humid regions regardless of the area moreover models complexity and higher resolution does not guarantee improved performance of the model rather the climatic characteristics of the watershed are the most important in this case gr2m model outperformed based on uncertainty analysis using fiteval software the results discourage the reliance on a single hydrological model especially because the driving climatic characteristics of different regions are diverse e g arid to semi arid southern africa where none of these models were tested for applicability therefore the selection of appropriate hydrological model aligned to local basin or catchment conditions is crucial some examples of studies that utilized assessment methods in different regions are briefly discussed below melo wendland 2016 assessed climate change impacts on the guarani aquifer outcrop zone using gcm outputs as water balance model inputs to estimate recharge across different landuse types for a groundwater model the study found that recharge will be reduced and the watertable lowered under most scenarios in turkey ertük et al 2014 evaluated the impact of climate change on groundwater resources in part of köyceğiz dalyan watershed because decrease in annual and winter precipitation as well as an increase in temperature were observed since the 1960s hydrological modelling using swat model was conducted to quantify impacts on water budget components the simulation results indicated that almost all water budget components have decreased together with a significant decrease in groundwater recharge and storage this could be detrimental to groundwater supported ecosystems dams et al 2010 developed a methodology to predict the potential impact of climate change on quantitative groundwater characteristics determining terrestrial gdes and tested it in kleine nete basin belgium the tool included coupling of a distributed hydrological model wetspa a gis based model suitable for use of flood prediction and watershed management on catchment scale able to simulate hydrological processes of precipitation snowmelt interception depression surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration percolation interflow groundwater flow etc continuously both in time and space with a transient groundwater flow model which was developed with a high temporal and spatial distribution using modflow modular finite difference flow model which simulates groundwater flow through aquifers an ensemble of 28 climate scenarios was selected to compensate for high uncertainty in future climate components predictions projections indicated that potential evapotranspiration rises in summer and decreases in winter precipitation decreases in summer and increases in winter groundwater recharge decreases on average 20 mm per year and groundwater discharge dropped by 4 therefore the terrestrial gdes would likely diminish due to future climate changes because of low discharge received dwire et al 2018 assessed potential effects of climate change on riparian areas wetlands and other gdes in the blue mountains oregon state using regional predictions of vulnerability from brown et al 2011 published scientific studies and different datasets empirical data scarcity on specific mechanisms through which climate change influences riparian and wetland plant communities led to uncertainty in projections nonetheless the results indicated that increased warming will influence groundwater recharge and discharge permeability and porosity of rocks affect the vulnerability and sensitivity of gdes to warmer climates and small unconfined aquifers may respond rapidly to climate change than large confined aquifers these concur with bertrand et al 2012 and aldous et al 2015 who found that climate change effects on gdes are influenced by aquifer size and location this study concluded that specific effects of climate change will vary depending on local hydrology topography streamside micro climates and landuse peterson halofsky 2017 recommended climate change inclusion in resource management to refine and prioritize current gde practices kløve et al 2014 reviewed climate change effects on groundwater and gdes by summarizing relevant information based on studies from different hydrogeological strata and climate zones the impacts on ecosystems were discussed based on findings on factors influencing their biodiversity and functioning at the time the review concluded that the impacts will vary depending on ecosystem type the amount and changes in water input smaller aquifers information scarcity was a challenge because monitoring on ecosystems scale lacks in most cases the study recommended scientific methodologies and monitoring activities development because the uncertainty associated with analysis techniques remains high due to lack of understanding of several key processes although kløve et al 2014 synthesizes the effects of climate change on gdes this review is the first to the authors knowledge to consider gdes in a transboundary aquifer setting from a southern african sub tropical ecoregion perspective in the netherlands van engelenburg et al 2018 undertook to understand how climate change affects a groundwater system to develop adaptation measures for secured drinking water supply from sandy veluwe aquifer of up to 200 m depth some existing groundwater extractions were reportedly affecting nearby gdes to reduce projected impact uncertainty they employed azure model detailed and well calibrated hydrological model to study the projected impact of climate change scenarios and adaptation measures findings were in a slowly responding large aquifer projected climate change may cause rising groundwater levels despite the projected increase in summer dryness simulated climate change impact differs for each studied ecosystem therefore the combined effect strongly depends on local conditions highlighting the local scale modelling requirement in china desert oases exist around inland river basins alluvial fans in arid areas where vegetation growth is wholly groundwater dependent due to low rainfall and arid environment xu su 2019 evaluated vegetative growth using the ndvi hydrometeorological data and the exploitation of water resources of the nalenggele alluvial fan northwest china correlation analysis results indicated that climatic factors shared little direct correlation with the ndvis whilst depth to groundwater table and shallow groundwater distribution are the direct influencing factors of vegetation growth additionally shallow groundwater distribution area with the ecological water level 4 m in 2020 will decrease to approximately 78 86 of that in 2019 therefore vegetation may face degradation risk from combined climate change and human activities influence warranting improved gde protection through management strategy and legislation in similar areas havril et al 2018 evaluated the influence of climate change impacted recharge on groundwater levels and interconnected groundwater flow patterns at the tihany peninsula hungary using two dimensional transient numerical simulations based on site specific measurements and climatic prediction results indicated that future trends can cause dynamic evolution and dissipation of transient groundwater flow systems and the characteristic flow system hierarchy can change from nested flow systems to a set of single flow cells this could have a negative impact on associated gdes preservation since long term climate change could potentially have serious consequences including wetland desiccation larocque et al 2019 in canada reviewed twenty two studies to identify climate change impacts on groundwater recharge and river baseflow reviewed studies differed in findings attributed to different modelling approaches and no trend in recharge changes was observed from west to east climatic conditions in different geographical location not highlighted here could have affected these findings too as per reviewed studies above the reviewers strongly recommended i the use of a variety of climate models preferably integrated models and emission scenarios and ii studying of long term climate change impacts on groundwater resources at different scales another review kusangaya 2014 which focused on scale sub regional to country level and gcm projections from previous studies concluded that catchment level studies are necessary for southern africa especially because water resource management decisions are taken accordingly using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data resende et al 2019 found a good correlation between changes in total groundwater storage and climate variability for shallow aquifers and that inter annual groundwater dynamics are driven by el niño southern oscillation enso in southern africa climate change may influence groundwater temperature and flow rates which may in turn impact riverine ecosystems and gdes dependent on surface expression of groundwater kurylyk et al 2014 evaluated the potential impact of climate change on the timing magnitude and temperature of groundwater discharge from small unconfined aquifers that undergo seasonal freezing and thawing seven downscaled climate scenarios for 2046 2065 were utilized to drive surficial water and energy balance models help3 and forhym2 to obtain future projections for daily ground surface temperature and groundwater recharge future surface conditions were applied as boundary conditions to drive subsurface simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow and energy transport using sutra a usgs finite element model simulations indicated a potential rise in the magnitude up to 34 and temperature up to 3 6 c of groundwater discharge into the adjacent river during summer months due to projected increases in air temperature and precipitation this demonstrated the complexity of thermal sensitivity of aquifers and baseflow dominated streams to decadal climate change it was concluded that the thermal response of groundwater to climate change is strongly dependent on the aquifer dimensions this conclusion resonates with that of climate change impacts on gdes jyväsjärvi et al 2015 investigated long term water temperature trends in 66 cold water springs using bryophyte and macro invertebrate species data from finnish springs and spring fed streams to assess ecological impacts of the predicted warming mean spring water temperatures were closely related to regional air temperature and global radiative forcing of the corresponding year based on low rcp2 6 intermediate rcp6 and high emission rcp8 5 climate scenarios the study estimated that an increase in mean spring water temperature is likely to range from 0 67 c rcp2 6 to 5 94 c rcp8 5 by 2086 for the worst case scenario ecosystems water temperature may exceed 12 c by the end of the 21st century about 3 times the late 1970s original mean it was concluded that an increase in spring water temperature will likely have substantial biodiversity impacts whereas species diversity of headwater generalists is likely to increase even a slight increase by 1 c in water temperature may eliminate endemic spring species thus altering bryophyte and macroinvertebrate assemblages of spring fed streams it is widely known that gde services are threatened by climate change because groundwater flow regimes are altered but how ecosystems are affected is less understood kløve et al 2011b orwig 2014 recently kath et al 2018 developed a framework for assessing ecological responses to groundwater regime alteration fergra it is designed to understand how the timing variability duration frequency and magnitude of groundwater connections to different gdes are affected in turn affecting their ecological processes and ecosystem service provision integrated management is optimized this way because multiple gdes can be assessed concurrently across the landscape it can be deduced from reviewed studies that an integrated model or a combination of models that can address uncertainties to a certain extent with the application of downscaling techniques appropriate for specific study area or aquifer conditions at a local scale would be the most appropriate to enhance reliability of assessment results although data scarcity could be a hindrance 4 assessments in transboundary aquifers settings the key international groundwater issues are availability metrics water depletion water quality degradation water energy nexus and transboundary water conflicts fienen arshad 2016 water availability stress conditions are expected to worsen due to climate change and this could be further affected by transboundary water issues since according to burak margat 2016 38 of available fresh water resources is transboundary groundwater quality issues are already observed in the border between northeastern greece vryzas et al 2012 and russia zektser 2012 and the ceylanpinar aquifer in turkey with ras al ain springs in syria this is possibly the case with most tbas but has not been investigated comprehensively more than seventy tbas have been mapped in africa and despite their importance only eleven have been subjected to more detailed studies whilst groundwater demand is expected to increase due to climate change and population growth nijsten et al 2018 only one stampriet transboundary aquifer system out of about 30 tbas in the sadc region 8 out of 600 internationally has a co governance and co management agreement and gde research is still to be undertaken since most ecosystems investigations were mainly from a botanical wildlife natural environment perspective braune xu 2011 this lack is attributed to enabling scientific knowledge scarcity currently in southern africa protective measures for ecosystems are country specific and do not consider activities of neighbouring countries these measures are based on low flow requirements through baseflow excluding terrestrial gdes to a large extent pietersen beekman 2016 assessed groundwater management in the region and concluded that climate change implications for groundwater are unknown but may be considerable and recommended groundwater behaviour evaluation under different climate and abstraction scenarios an overview by cobbing et al 2008 suggested that each aquifer s development potential should be assessed against factors such as interactions between groundwater surface water and gdes before establishing sustainable transboundary resource utilization moreover altchenko villholth 2013 highlighted the importance of implementing frameworks for managing the already stressed shared groundwater resources and associated ecosystems a council for scientific and industrial research environmentek csir environmentek 2003 study to assess groundwater resources protection and strategic uses in the transboundary limpopo basin recommended a framework development to assess gde occurrence and importance tbas not managed cooperatively face an over exploitation risk to the detriment of other sharing state s godfrey van dyk 2002 jarvis et al 2005 and ecosystems services not many gde inclusive studies undertaken in tbas were found from literature but sections above show that alterations on groundwater regime will most probably affect gdes this knowledge gap and fragmented information necessitate more research in order achieve integrated resource management collaboratively this is especially true for transboundary aquifers where existing agreements on the use of groundwater generally assume a degree of stationarity cooley et al 2011 several conceptual models can apply to transboundary aquifers even where implications differ for each sharing country e g eckstein eckstein 2005 groundwater surface water interconnectedness is very important because the source of water and water users human or ecological may be in different countries data sharing and integration are more challenging across national borders but extremely important to reduce the uncertainties surrounding

collaborative management and further research with both gde types existing conceptual modelling is required to define sub surface flow dynamics that control groundwater accessibility to them considering the scarcity of required scientific information climate change related research is near non existent here while projections suggest negative impacts for groundwater supported ecosystems 5 discussions and conclusion this paper aims to comprehensively review current knowledge regarding the assessment of climate change impacts on gdes in terms of methods applicability and outputs reliability especially in transboundary aquifer settings 5 1 knowledge gaps in the past decade there has been a gradual increase in the body of knowledge in terms of climate change assessment studies incorporating gdes however some knowledge gaps are identified assessment studies of climate change effects on gdes have not been undertaken in transboundary aquifer settings while ecosystems of strategic and socio economics importance exist in these environments ecosystems protective measures in most southern african tbas are country specific and do not consider neighbouring countries activities which could be detrimental to discharge zones and aligned gdes therefore collaborative research and integrated resource management are required among riparian countries data scarcity time series data or skewed spatial distribution or both most assessment studies highlight scarcity especially at local ecosystems scale due to lack of monitoring despite the uniqueness of individual aquifer hydraulics presenting a challenge for inductive research explicit validation of models and reduction of uncertainties are compromised therefore an urgent need to build basic scientific information and databases e g delineation mapping conceptualization inventory climate etc through monitoring exists this will enable the development of non existent co governance and co management mechanisms of shared resources in transboundary aquifer settings integrated conjunctive management of surface water groundwater and gdes ecological approaches are rare in groundwater management knüppe 2011 while the integrated water resource management principle requires coordinated development of water land and related resources without compromising on the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 therefore sustainable gde management lies in their integration into groundwater resources geographical realms detailed research is mainly concentrated in temperate latitudes of europe and north america with none in the afrotropic realms of subtropical ecoregion characterised by arid to semi arid climate by implication the applicability of reviewed assessment methods scenario generation and downscaling techniques has not been tested widely in different climatic regimes thus comprehensive general conclusions cannot be drawn groundwater quality may also be a limiting factor for the long term sustainability of groundwater resources worldwide gurdak et al 2012 and there is a need to intensify research on climate change effects on groundwater quality because gde sustenance relies on this aspect too 6 conclusions literature indicates that climate change does impact groundwater resulting in altered recharge discharge and groundwater levels due to changing rainfall patterns e g chiew mcmahon 2002 legesse et al 2003 scibek et al 2007 this affects gdes because for their sustenance groundwater availability should not change beyond its normal range of fluctuation colvin et al 2003 more research is required to improve understanding of climate and groundwater interactions and to guide integrated groundwater management green 2016 modelling studies highlighted uncertainties in gcm outputs and projections e g randall et al 2007 tadross et al 2011 hewitson tadross 2011 which are inputs into coupling hydrogeological models therefore researchers e g howard et al 2006 mirosław świątek okruszko 2011 refsgaard et al 2010 krogulec 2003 2013 kopeć et al 2013 wachniew et al 2014 larocque et al 2019 strongly recommend the use of integrated models or a combination of models and study area appropriate downscaling techniques there is no all encompassing approach to assessment studies especially at local scale because aquifer properties are unique the research question is what groundwater processes control the effects of climate change induced impacts on gdes within a specific aquifer the understanding of interactions between ecosystems groundwater and climate change is crucial towards such comprehensive assessments there is a dire lack of similar research in southern africa and in transboundary aquifer settings hence the initiation of the tuli karoo study to enable collaborative resource management and protection inclusive of ecosystems groundwater requirements and the development of joint adaptation strategies against climate change impacts on groundwater and

977,in the present study 6 water and 16 sediment samples were collected from hashilan wetland kermanshah province iran to specify physio chemical properties of water and sediment and to evaluate the water pollution load with reference to the water physicochemical parameters according to the piper diagram ca2 mg2 hco3 hydrochemical facies is dominant due to calcium carbonate dissolution in the geological formations of the study area the wetland water had a natural to slightly alkaline ph although tds and ec of the water samples fall under freshwater category their values were higher downstream of the wetland as a result of stagnant water low water depth more evaporation and impact of agricultural runoff based on the water quality index wqi all water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes while 50 of the samples were unsuitable for drinking comprehensive pollution index cpi and sodium adsorption ratio sar also indicated suitability of the wetland water for irrigation according to the wilcox diagram salinity is higher downstream of the wetland due to introduction of agricultural runoff it can be concluded that the wetland water could be used for irrigational purposes but regular monitoring is recommended to promote sustainable use of natural resources and conserve the vulnerable aquatic ecosystem keywords water sediment physiochemical parameters irrigation hashilan wetland heritage 1 introduction wetlands a significant part of the whole biosphere are important ecotones that promote not only high exchange rates of gases solids and water with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the atmosphere and groundwater but also provide various services such as filtering the contaminants and nutrients maintenance of biological diversity flood control carbon sequestration and food provision megonigal and neubauer 2019 silva et al 2016 wen et al 2018 in natural conditions wetlands provide essential habitats for the wildlife including mammal amphibian bird and fish species and harbour a rich diversity of plant species rameshkumar et al 2019 during the last decades wetlands have suffered from fragmentation due to land use change and land reclamation increasing input of contaminated sediment and water of industrial and agricultural origin and intensified eutrophication chai et al 2019 duhamel et al 2017 wetlands are considered eco friendly systems suitable for improving water quality coming from diffuse and point sources in catchments with intensive use tercero et al 2017 in particular it is well known that wetland sediments act as sinks of different pollutants because of their special properties such as anoxic environment the fine grain of wetland soil organic rich sediments and high productivity zhang et al 2019 variation of the bottom sediment characteristics such as grain size demonstrates the transport processes selective entrainment transport and deposition le roux et al 2002 as well as the ability of the sediments to absorb organic matter and nutrients onto mineral surfaces hedges keil 1995 despite being an arid country iran possesses various types of wetland ecosystems from the south caspian area and alborz mts in the north to the southern and western parts of the country mehravaran naqinezhad 2016 many of which registered in the ramsar convention on wetlands of international importance frazier 1999 no comprehensive information exists regarding the physicochemical characteristics of the sediments and water of hashilan wetland kermanshah province western iran despite the importance of its ecosystem and the existence of birds mammals aquatics reptiles and plants hashilan wetland has received less attention the area of hashilan wetland is 450 hectares and its land consists of peat coal which is specific to polar regions and many environmental experts consider its existence in hot and dry regions to be only one nature understanding almasi et al 2020 and karami et al 2001 it seems that agricultural activities include irrigation the use of pesticides and fertilizers significantly impact the distribution of various contaminants yang et al 2013 agricultural activities in the hashilan ecosystem are common increasing pollutant inputs to the ecosystem mohamadi et al 2013 hence high pollutant content in hashilan provides a constant ecological and health risk to the wetland mortazavi et al 2016 in general changing of physicochemical parameters of water and sediments of hashilan wetland can affect its ecology and adsorption desorption fate and degradation of pollutants recentrly abbasi 2021 indicated that the concentration of microplastic particles has a significant correlation with sediment texture in the hashilan wetland and as the percentage of clay increases the microplastic concentration also increases thus intensive human activity around the wetland has certainly altered its ecological features because the growth of crops or raising of livestock necessitates reclamation measures like tillage or drainage indeed in such a wetland ecosystem biodiversity has been so severely impacted by human activities that large parts can no longer even be qualified as wetlands verhoeven setter 2010 therefore in the current study a comparative evaluation of different physicochemical parameters of the sediments and water is performed to assess water and sediment quality in hashilan wetland and to investigate the chemical threats to the wetland health 2 study area hashilan wetland is a freshwater wetland with an area of 450 ha located 36 km northwest of kermanshah province west of iran 46 51 to 46 54 e and 34 34 to 35 34 n hashilan wetland constitutes a unique feature in the middle east which is called karstic spring wetland an ecosystem mostly found in the zagros mountains of iran djamali et al 2018 the wetland has 120 islands with surface areas ranging from 100 square meters to one hectare and an average depth of three meters which cover 30 of the wetland s area it s elevation from sea level is 1310 m the average temperature and annual rainfall are 13 9 c and 451 mm respectively according to the nearest meteorological station to the wetland i e the kermanshah station mean annual evaporation is 1747 2 mm which mostly happens during summer most of the precipitation occurs during winter and early spring the wetland is affected by climate change in fact as fig 1 shows the wetland has been experiencing general decreasing and increasing trends in climate variables of the annual rainfall and mean annual temperature respectively accordingly it is absolutely crucial to manage water resources in this region geologically its catchment basin and the aquifers of its water sources are located in the limestone formations of triassic jurassic age liberating very high percentages of calcium carbonate into the groundwater and sediments namdadi et al 2016 hashilan wetland is located in a syncline bordered by two anticlines in the northeast khorin anticline and southwest biston anticline fig 2 surveying the wetland on a large scale it is a part of the miandarband plain which surrounds the two anticlines contains several other wetlands and has two rivers namely razavar in the north and gareso in the south average flow rate of the razavar and gareso rivers is 4864 to 4423 l s respectively these rivers and also runoffs coming from the anticlines are loaded with sediments the types of these sediments on the wetland surface are clay sand and gravel likewise from surface to depth the hydro stratigraphy of the wetland based on the drilling logs of the exploration wells includes four layers clay sand clay gravel clay and the deepest layer is gravel and rock the infiltration rate is estimated about 0 085 based on precipitation temperature and evaporation data gozin saze company 2017 the wetland is recharged by a limestone formation biston formation triassic jurassic which makes the khorin karstic system faults and fractures in the anticline are the major groundwater pathways through which springs emerge several springs including sabzali manmey shele and jelogire are the inputs of the wetland among them the sabzali spring has the greatest discharge of about 323 l s two karstic springs sabzali and man e may originating from the khorein mountains located on the northern border of the wetland supplied 95 and 5 of the wetland s water respectively the total mean volume of water in the wetland is estimated to be over 1 02 107 cubic meters the runoff of the khorin anticline and some surface water from the irrigation of the northern farm lands are the other water inputs of the wetland because of unique ecological characteristics of the wetland in order to protect it from going dry in the event of dry years some water is provided from gavshan dam to feed the wetland from the perspective of discharging the wetland the main output on the surface is a natural drainage which joins the razavar river in the south of the wetland the mean flow rate of the wetland output which occurs through a canal on the surface is about 35 l s a numerical model was built to simulate the groundwater flow in the miandarband watershed gozin saze company 2017 three types of boundary conditions were considered including no flow fluid transfer and river based on pumping test conducted in the wetland the transmissivity and storativity coefficients are 1200 m2 s and 0 40 respectively the bedrock type is marl which can be considered as a no flow boundary the calibrated hydraulic gradient of the hydro stratigraphical layers clay sand clay gravel clay and gravel rock was achieved to be 0 05 1 2 and 0 01 m d these results are rather acceptable taking into account that the hydro stratigraphical materials are largely of small size with mixture of various particles ranging from clay to gravel according to this model and water table measurements of observation wells and piezometers the groundwater direction is from north west to south east of the wetland indicating that some water of the wetland is drained in the south east by the groundwater the hydraulic head in north west and south east is about 1314 and 1308 meters above sea level therefore the average hydraulic gradient of water table is about 0 001 0 002 the average wetland depth is about 3 m with an elevation of 1310 meters above sea level hence hashilan wetland is thus a marsh formed because of shallow aquifer in the region the watershed basin of the wetland is situated in the zagros mountain range where the depth of soil varies from 10 to 90 cm due to the natural conditions of the ecosystem this wetland is a habitat for many native stationary and migratory birds from the northern hemisphere during the cold season plants growing in the wetland can be classified into halophytes hydrophytes and plants growing along the banks of wetlands different fish species inhabit the wetland and wolf fox rabbit jackal wild cat and goat can be found in the highlands of the region therefore because of its importance hashilan wetland should be immune from any hydrological intervention e g digging wells draining by artificial canals etc and the input of agricultural industrial waste waters and actions such as the digging of wells and agricultural activities karami et al 2001 mortazavi 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sediment sampling and analysis sediment samples were collected at 16 locations from the top 5 cm of wetland topmost sediments in september 2019 using a stainless van veen grab and sampling location and characteristics are depicted in fig 3 and table 1 all samples were transferred into the air tight polyethylene bags and transported to the laboratory in the laboratory the samples were first air dried at room temperature and then larger debris such as plant leaves and pieces of glass were removed mechanically by passing each sample through a 2 mm sieve the measurements of ph and electrical conductivity ec were done with a ph ec meter eutech instrument waterproof cyberscan pcd 650 singapor as outlined by ryan et al ryan et al 2007 the organic matter om and calcium carbonate were also evaluated by the loss on ignition loi procedure heiri et al 2001 furthermore the grain size analysis and texture of sediment samples were determined using the hydrometer method hakanson 1980 minasny mcbratney 2001 3 2 water sampling and analysis in this study 6 water samples in hashilan wetland were collected in polythene bottles fig 3 and table 1 which were rinsed several times using the same water and transported to the laboratory refrigerator on the same day and kept at 4 c physicochemical properties of water samples including temperature ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were estimated in situ using portable measuring devices eutech instruments pcd650 calibrated with standard solutions turbidity was measured immediately via hand held turbidity meter eutech tn 100 singapore in the laboratory the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in water samples were estimated titrimetrically against standard na2 edta solution singh et al 1999 also flame emission spectrophotometer determined the contents of na and k ions jenway pfp7 uk the amounts of chloride carbonate and bicarbonate were determined titrimetrically using standard agno3 and h2so4 solution respectively based on the methodology defined by singh et al 1999 the spectrophotometric method was also applied to determine the so4 2 concentration in water samples 3 3 calculation of water quality indices water quality index is a measure which incorporates different physicochemical parameters into one single value reflecting the water quality level chen et al 2020 in the present study 11 water quality parameters were applied to obtain a comprehensive assessment system by referring to the basic items of surface water quality standards for agriculture usages fao 1992 the indices like comprehensive pollution index cpi and weighted arithmetic water quality index wqi were used to estimate the overall status of water quality level in the hashilan wetland the parameters covered in these indices are ec eh tds ph hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k 3 3 1 comprehensive pollution index cpi a comprehensive pollution index is the most trusted index applied to estimate the overall water quality in a water media matta et al 2020 chaudhary et al 2016 in this study for the classification of pollution level we used all the water quality variables whose concentration limit for irrigation purposes has been recommended by food and agriculture organization fao 1992 the calculation of cpi was performed using the following eq 1 1 cpi 1 n i 1 n c i s i ci is the measured concentration of the ith variable si represents the standard permissible concentration of the ith variable proposed by fao 1992 for water quality and n is the number of selected parameters ultimately the values cpi could be applied for rating the water quality of the wetland which are as follows 0 20 excellent quality 0 21 0 40 good quality 0 41 1 00 slight pollution 1 01 2 0 moderate pollution and 2 01 severe pollution zhao et al 2012 mishra kumar 2020 3 3 2 weighted arithmetic water quality index wqi wqi was proposed by brown et al 1970 aiming at the assessment of water quality status for general use in freshwater systems around the world its application is on the basis of the determination of a weighting factor for each quality variable contained in the index according to its relative importance for the overall quality the variables concentration after being normalized through sub index functions introduced by the methodology are aggregated to create the final index as weighted arithmetic mean zotou et al 2019 for a detailed description of its calculating framework one can refer to the corresponding publications shah joshi 2017 singh et al 2020 tyagi et al 2013 al othman 2019 the wqi was computed using the standards of water quality recommended by the world health organization who and fao the mathematical equation used to calculate wqi is expressed as 2 wqi i 1 n w i q i w i where n is the total number of water quality variables wi is the weightage factor of the ith water quality variable and qi is the sub index of the ith water quality variable the overall water quality on the basis of wqi is categorized as excellent quality 0 25 good quality 26 50 poor quality 51 75 very poor quality 76 100 and unsuitable for drinking purpose 100 akoteyon et al 2011 tyagi et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics of water samples the water chemistry of wetland ecosystems is primarily controlled by the quality of inflowing water water balance geologic setting type of vegetation and soils and human activity near or within the wetland somay et al 2008 furthermore the causes of water contamination can be categorized as natural and anthropogenic hence it is essential to know the chemical characteristics and quality of water for the environmental assessment and management of wetlands varol şekerci 2018 therefore in the current study we have attempted to determine the physicochemical characteristics and quality of surface water in the study area descriptive statistics of major ions concentration and physicochemical parameters in water samples of hashilan wetland are summarized in table 2 it is important to determine the quality of water for agriculture irrigation purposes and other usages in this section water quality parameters and analytical results were compared with world standard values of food and agriculture organization fao 1992 for agriculture irrigation purposes as are represented in table 2 water ph gives important information in many types of solubility calculations or geochemical equilibrium to limit corrosion and fouling of pumping irrigation and stock watering systems the permissible limit of ph value for wetland water is specified between 6 and 8 5 anzecc armcanz 2000 the ph of the water samples in hashilan wetland ranged from 7 42 to 7 85 and the mean ph was found to be 7 7 indicating the neutral nature of the water samples also the results indicated that ph value in all water samples fell under the permissible limit electrical conductivity ec indicates the conducting capacity of water which in turn is specified by the presence of dissolved ions ec is a measure of total dissolved solids tds which depends upon the ionic strength of the solution tiwari et al 2017 the ec can be grouped into low salinity waters ec 1500 μs cm medium salinity waters ec 1500 and 3000 μs cm and high salinity waters ec 3000 μs cm krishna kumar et al 2015 the measured ec value ranged from 395 to 883 μs cm with a mean value of 576 83 μs cm based on this classification all of the water samples belong to low salinity waters category tds concentration of all waters varied from 299 8 to 669 21 mg l with a mean value of 432 65 mg l according to these data all the water samples are freshwater tds 1000 mg l somay 2016 ec and tds indicated similar gradients of significant increases from upstream to downstream according to fig s1 in the supplementary information there is a direct relationship between ec and tds the high ec and tds values observed in some sites s8 and s12 sites are due to low water depth and excessive evaporation these sites are located close to agricultural lands and mainly affected by the application of pesticides and fertilizer the permissible limit of ec and tds in the surface water is 3000 mg l and 2000 mg l respectively fao 1992 therefore all of the measured values in the study area are below the fao standard oxidation reduction potential eh in the water of the study area varied from 38 2 to 525 6 mv with an average of 260 07 mv the mean value of soluble sodium percentage ssp sodium adsorption ratio sar total alkalinity ta and turbidity jtu in the hashilan wetland were measured 12 78 0 48 232 08 mg l and 58 7 respectively table 2 the turbidity is one of the important physical parameters for water quality defining the presence of suspended matter such as colloid organic matter microscopic organisms and clay and silt particles in water and causes the muddy or turbid appearance of water body tiwari et al 2017 the turbidity ranged from 0 35 to 175 and minimum and maximum value of turbidity were detected at the s2 and s5 stations respectively also water turbidity depends partly on water depth and vegetation for example low turbidity at the s1 and s2 sites is due to high water depth and dense vegetation respectively the dense vegetation and low water depth at s2 lead to accumulation of large amounts of organic matter resulting from the decomposition of plant residues this process leads to oxygen depletion and reduction in water oxidation reduction potential eh 38 2 mv according to sawyer et al 2003 water can be categorized as soft 75 mg l moderately hard 75 to 150 mg l hard 150 to 300 mg l and very hard above 300 mg l in the current study total hardness th varied from 175 to 350 mg l with a mean value of 250 mg l indicating the hard nature of water two samples s8 and s12 had hardness higher than 300 mg l which is a limiting value for drinking purposes the relative abundance of main cations in the water of hashilan wetland was shown in the following order ca2 mg2 na k while that of anion contents was in the order of hco3 so4 2 cl it can be seen that ca2 dominates the major cation chemistry of the water in the study area while k is detected at the lowest level calcium and magnesium are directly related to water hardness chapman 1996 all sampling sites showed approximately similar th within the study area with the maximum in the s8 and s12 sites the ca2 and mg2 concentrations ranged from 1 3 to 5 0 meq l and from 1 0 to 3 7 meq l with mean values of 2 72 meq l and 2 28 meq l respectively the slight increase in the cations was as a result of evaporation na and k normally originate from weathering products of igneous rocks clay minerals and evaporites but concentrations of k are usually much lower than those of na in natural water davraz et al 2019 the concentration of na varied between 0 31 and 1 92 meq l with a mean value of 0 78 meq l and concentration of k ranged from 0 02 to 0 04 mg l mean value of 0 027 meq l the range of hco3 so4 2 and cl were found to vary from 3 0 to 7 5 meq l 0 33 to1 4 meq l and 0 25 to 0 75 meq l respectively bicarbonate is the dominant form of inorganic carbon the freshwater from ph 7 to 9 eby 2004 dominance of hco3 and so4 2 together with high calcium and magnesium levels in the water samples might reveal dissolution of carbonates and sulfates abuncdance of these minerals the common ion effect and other geochemical factors probably influence dissolution rate of each mineral fertilizers can also be another source for the elevated so4 2 values in the study area varol şekerci 2018 the natural sources of cl are irrigation return flow salt domes and interbedded salt layers raeisi nejati 2000 while anthropogenic sources include synthetic fertilizer along with municipal effluents khatri tyagi 2015 hashilan wetland is characterized by low cl concentrations likely originated from dissolution of salts and application of fertilizers overall concentration of major cations and anions were lower than the recommended limit by fao table 2 showing that groundwater and precipitation are more contributing to the ions contents of the wetland data on the hydrogeochemistry characteristics of water samples from hashilan wetland were compared with those from other wetlands in the world table 3 the mean ec in the water samples was higher than its concentration in miangaran wetland iran and jaboque wetland colombia tds in nalban wetland india twenty four wetlands of hiroshima japan and choghakhor wetland iran also show a lower mean compared with the hashilan wetland the mean eh value in the current study was higher than all other mentioned wetlands the mean ph value in all water samples like other wetlands except for miangaran wetland iran fall within the optimum range 6 8 5 proposed by the canadian water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life ccme 2007 other comparisons are given in table 3 the piper 1944 diagram is extensively used to determine similarities and differences in the chemistry of water samples and classification of water on the basis of its chemical composition based on the dominant cations ca2 mg2 na and anions hco3 so4 2 cl concentrations in the water samples the piper diagram was plotted fig 4 and the water types in hashilan wetland were determined in all of the water samples the cations ca 2 and mg 2 alkaline earth exceed the cations na and k alkali and hco3 weak acid dominates over so4 2 and cl strong acid the high concentration of alkaline earth elements is usually stating the dissolution of ca and mg bearing minerals in geological formations therefore ca2 mg2 hco3 is the principal hydrogeochemical facies which indicates that carbonate hardness exceeds 50 in the study area the dissolution of calcium carbonate in the limestone formations and sediment water interactions are significantly responsible for this water type this is in agreement with chemical compositon of the springs and qanats in karstified formations of zagros that are not influenced by saltwater intrusion raeisi nejati 2000 the results of pearson correlation indicated a strong correlation between tds and ec p value 0 01 across the study stations table s1 hco3 cl k th and ta recorded a good positive relationship with tds and ec while a negative correlation existed between so4 2 and that of ec and tds it is evident that the major elements contribute to surface water salinity in hashilan wetland it would be expected that surface water salinization is affected through ionic content increment because of interactions between the geological formations and the water in the study area the cl na correlation is mainly applied to identify mechanisms related to salinity in semi arid regions nematollahi et al 2016 a relatively high positive relationship between cl and na explained the dominance of the evaporation process and the dissolution of chloride salts in the study area the so4 2 showed a negative correlation with ca2 suggesting that so4 2 and ca2 are not contained in the same geochemical processes in fact ca2 could precipitate as calcite and or undergo a ca2 na base exchange between clay minerals and water while sulfates are mainly found in a dissolved form desbarats 2009 raeisi nejati 2000 there was a significant positive correlation between hco3 and ca2 that showing that the dissolution of calcium carbonate is responsible for the excess hco3 4 3 water quality indices for the evaluation of site pollution level a comprehensive pollution index cpi was calculated and represented in fig 5 the cpi values indicated that the water of hashilan wetland at all sampling points has a good quality i e cpi range 0 21 0 40 as it varied between 0 21 and 0 34 in fact the water quality estimated at these stations appeared not to be impacted by pollutant sources table 4 indicates the results of the water quality index wqi for irrigational and drinking purposes the calculated wqi indicated that surface water quality in stations of s1 to s5 was excellent quality for irrigational purposes the wetland water was of good quality in s8 and s12 sites for irrigational purposes the wqi was also calculated at all sampling sites which indicates good water quality at sampling sites s1 s2 and s5 poor water quality at s3 while very poor water quality at the other sites for drinking high ec and tds in s8 and s12 sites could have contributed to the high wqi in this ecosystem however there is a need for routine monitoring of the different anthropogenic activities within the wetland catchment particularly the downstream to measure the salinity in general we concluded that the overall water quality in the hashilan wetland is excellent and poor for irrigational and drinking respectively 4 4 irrigational quality parameters the sodium ion is especially hazardous for irrigation and sodium excess must be highlighted when waters are evaluated for irrigation purposes thus various equations are applied depending on the na concentration somay 2016 sodium adsorption ratio sar is used to express the relative activity of na ions in exchange reactions within the soil it is a measure of the relative concentration of na detrimental element to ca and mg beneficial elements according to sar water can be classified as excellent 10 good 10 18 doubtful 18 26 and unsuitable 26 richards 1954 the values of sar ranged from 0 20 to 1 03 and classification of water samples with respect to sar indicated that all of the samples with sar 10 have excellent irrigation quality fig s2 in general all samples had sar values well below the fao fao 1992 as shown in table 2 the amount of soil exchange capacity occupied by na is commonly measured as soluble sodium percentage ssp as the ssp goes up more exchangeable na is available and the greater the potential for negative plant and soil effects water consisting of high percentage of na can result in stunting of plants and reduces soil permeability aboyeji ogunkoya 2017 the ssp values in water samples ranged from 5 85 to 21 43 with a mean value of 12 79 table 2 in situations where the ssp in irrigation water is greater than 60 there may result in sodium accumulations in soil that will cause the soil s physical properties deterioration and low water oxygen permeability fipps 2003 also the following terminology is used for the classification of irrigation water based on soluble sodium percentage ssp excellent 20 good 20 40 permissible 40 60 doubtful 60 80 and unsuitable 80 aboyeji ogunkoya 2017 based on the classification all of the water samples fall within excellent quality this result revealed that water of the study area is suitable for irrigation with no danger of exchangeable na wilcox diagram is used to evaluate the water quality for agriculture uses using parameters including sar and electrical conductivity ec the most important agricultural water quality parameters are ec and sar alavi et al 2016 in the wilcox diagram sar as a risk of alkalinity and ec as a risk of salinity are considered in this diagram s and c represent the sar and the salinity respectively qishlaqi et al 2017 classification of 6 stations in the hashilan wetland based on wilcox diagram is represented in fig s3 according to wilcox diagram water samples have two classes c2s1 and c3s1 as seen from fig s3 s1 s2 s3 and s5 stations indicate the best water quality for irrigation usages they are classified as c2s1 class with low hazard sodium and medium salinity on the other hand the quality of water at s1 s2 and s3 sites is good because they are fed with good quality water from the karstic spring of sabzali and this area is known as calcium carbonate formations other samples s8 and s12 are categorized as c3s1 with low hazard sodium and high salinity in the wilcox diagram these water samples show that the water quality by applying some necessary measures is suitable for agriculture 4 5 physicochemical characteristics of sediment samples table 5 represents the physicochemical properties in sediment samples these characteristics such as om cec ph ec carbonate calcium and grain size often provide important data on the sediment provenance depositional conditions and transport history aly salem et al 2014 calcium carbonate contents range between 3 77 and 23 69 with an average of 11 60 and accounted for a ph in the neutral range 7 42 7 85 the maximum and minimum ph values were observed at s15 and s3 sites respectively mean minimum and maximum values of ec were 334 75 111 3 and 632 5 µs cm respectively which demonstrated very low salinity in sediment samples in general the ec data are consistent with the information found from the hydrogeochemistry of water in section 3 1 as mentioned hashilan wetland is characterized by low salinity indicating that groundwater and precipitation have more effect on the water quality of the wetland in addition to providing nutrients and habitat to organisms living in the sediment organic matter om also binds sediment particles into aggregates and improves the water holding capacity of sediment bot 2005 om contents range between 4 31 and 40 16 with a mean value of 18 44 the maximum om value measured at the site s3 which can be due to high vegetation cover organic matter and clay contents were low to moderate values in hashilan wetland which also resulted in the relatively medium cec cec varied from 7 90 to 46 70 meq 100gr with a mean value of 14 74 meq 100gr the lowest cec value was measured at site s3 which had high percentage of sand 58 76 and the low percentage of silt and clay the average amounts of the particle size fractions of the sediment samples are 31 35 clay 31 03 silt and 37 62 of sand classifying them as clay loam it should be noted that the highest amount of clay was observed in sampling sites such as s3 s4 s9 s10 s12 s15 near agricultural areas that have standing water which could be due to the leaching of these particles by high discharge water flow sabzali spring in the wetland a comparison of mean values of physicochemical characteristics of sediments from this study in contrast with those from other wetlands are also represented in table 3 overall the mean values of ec and om showed higher levels in the hashilan wetland compared with other wetlands while the cec value was lower in the study area higher contents of om and ec in the hashilan wetland could be related to the entrance of agricultural runoff and dense vegetation in some situations however the sediments receiving agricultural runoff indicated sandy loam and loam textures due to reduced wastewater velocity entering the wetland which cause the lower cec of the wetland sediment compared to the other wetlands 5 conclusion for the first time physicochemical properties of water of the heshilan wetland and their influence on water quality were investigated the main hydrochemical facies was ca mg hco3 due to weathering and dissolution of the carbonate formations in the study area according to wqi the downstream stations of the wetland which receive agricultural wastewater are unsafe for drinking usage due to high ec and tds nevertheless irrigation water quality parameters such as sar and spp revealed water suitablity for agricultural practices while our study showed the good quality of the wetland water for irrigational purposes this should not by any means be interpreted as a suggestion of the exploitation of its water resources for agriculture the results are indeed showing that the hydrochemistry of the wetland is still healthy to sustain the flora and fauna of this unique wetland system water quality indices defined to assess the quality for irrigation purposes can also be used as proxies to show how the water quality is also sufficiently good for the wetland s wilde plants the reduction of water quality was observed in the stations located downstream of the study area which is related to agricultural runoff input to the wetland while water samples upstream of the wetland showed acceptable water quality which are fed by springs overall according to the ion concentrations and other physiochemical parameters groundwater and precipitation were the main sources contributing to the cations and anions of the wetland water finally this research was produced original new data on the physicochemical properties of water and sediment of the hashilan wetland which are considered as one of the major factors that affect the distribution periodicity and quantitative and qualitative composition of the wetland biota variations in these parameters have a substantial impact on the species that live in this ecosystem thus policy makers must monitor the physicochemical parameters and water quality of this wetland to do the urgent actions for greater protection of the environmental health also agricultural activities around the hashilan wetland should be done with more supervision because it can increase the rate of erosion of surrounding soil and ultimately change the physical and chemical properties of the water and soil of the wetland declaration of

977,in the present study 6 water and 16 sediment samples were collected from hashilan wetland kermanshah province iran to specify physio chemical properties of water and sediment and to evaluate the water pollution load with reference to the water physicochemical parameters according to the piper diagram ca2 mg2 hco3 hydrochemical facies is dominant due to calcium carbonate dissolution in the geological formations of the study area the wetland water had a natural to slightly alkaline ph although tds and ec of the water samples fall under freshwater category their values were higher downstream of the wetland as a result of stagnant water low water depth more evaporation and impact of agricultural runoff based on the water quality index wqi all water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes while 50 of the samples were unsuitable for drinking comprehensive pollution index cpi and sodium adsorption ratio sar also indicated suitability of the wetland water for irrigation according to the wilcox diagram salinity is higher downstream of the wetland due to introduction of agricultural runoff it can be concluded that the wetland water could be used for irrigational purposes but regular monitoring is recommended to promote sustainable use of natural resources and conserve the vulnerable aquatic ecosystem keywords water sediment physiochemical parameters irrigation hashilan wetland heritage 1 introduction wetlands a significant part of the whole biosphere are important ecotones that promote not only high exchange rates of gases solids and water with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the atmosphere and groundwater but also provide various services such as filtering the contaminants and nutrients maintenance of biological diversity flood control carbon sequestration and food provision megonigal and neubauer 2019 silva et al 2016 wen et al 2018 in natural conditions wetlands provide essential habitats for the wildlife including mammal amphibian bird and fish species and harbour a rich diversity of plant species rameshkumar et al 2019 during the last decades wetlands have suffered from fragmentation due to land use change and land reclamation increasing input of contaminated sediment and water of industrial and agricultural origin and intensified eutrophication chai et al 2019 duhamel et al 2017 wetlands are considered eco friendly systems suitable for improving water quality coming from diffuse and point sources in catchments with intensive use tercero et al 2017 in particular it is well known that wetland sediments act as sinks of different pollutants because of their special properties such as anoxic environment the fine grain of wetland soil organic rich sediments and high productivity zhang et al 2019 variation of the bottom sediment characteristics such as grain size demonstrates the transport processes selective entrainment transport and deposition le roux et al 2002 as well as the ability of the sediments to absorb organic matter and nutrients onto mineral surfaces hedges keil 1995 despite being an arid country iran possesses various types of wetland ecosystems from the south caspian area and alborz mts in the north to the southern and western parts of the country mehravaran naqinezhad 2016 many of which registered in the ramsar convention on wetlands of international importance frazier 1999 no comprehensive information exists regarding the physicochemical characteristics of the sediments and water of hashilan wetland kermanshah province western iran despite the importance of its ecosystem and the existence of birds mammals aquatics reptiles and plants hashilan wetland has received less attention the area of hashilan wetland is 450 hectares and its land consists of peat coal which is specific to polar regions and many environmental experts consider its existence in hot and dry regions to be only one nature understanding almasi et al 2020 and karami et al 2001 it seems that agricultural activities include irrigation the use of pesticides and fertilizers significantly impact the distribution of various contaminants yang et al 2013 agricultural activities in the hashilan ecosystem are common increasing pollutant inputs to the ecosystem mohamadi et al 2013 hence high pollutant content in hashilan provides a constant ecological and health risk to the wetland mortazavi et al 2016 in general changing of physicochemical parameters of water and sediments of hashilan wetland can affect its ecology and adsorption desorption fate and degradation of pollutants recentrly abbasi 2021 indicated that the concentration of microplastic particles has a significant correlation with sediment texture in the hashilan wetland and as the percentage of clay increases the microplastic concentration also increases thus intensive human activity around the wetland has certainly altered its ecological features because the growth of crops or raising of livestock necessitates reclamation measures like tillage or drainage indeed in such a wetland ecosystem biodiversity has been so severely impacted by human activities that large parts can no longer even be qualified as wetlands verhoeven setter 2010 therefore in the current study a comparative evaluation of different physicochemical parameters of the sediments and water is performed to assess water and sediment quality in hashilan wetland and to investigate the chemical threats to the wetland health 2 study area hashilan wetland is a freshwater wetland with an area of 450 ha located 36 km northwest of kermanshah province west of iran 46 51 to 46 54 e and 34 34 to 35 34 n hashilan wetland constitutes a unique feature in the middle east which is called karstic spring wetland an ecosystem mostly found in the zagros mountains of iran djamali et al 2018 the wetland has 120 islands with surface areas ranging from 100 square meters to one hectare and an average depth of three meters which cover 30 of the wetland s area it s elevation from sea level is 1310 m the average temperature and annual rainfall are 13 9 c and 451 mm respectively according to the nearest meteorological station to the wetland i e the kermanshah station mean annual evaporation is 1747 2 mm which mostly happens during summer most of the precipitation occurs during winter and early spring the wetland is affected by climate change in fact as fig 1 shows the wetland has been experiencing general decreasing and increasing trends in climate variables of the annual rainfall and mean annual temperature respectively accordingly it is absolutely crucial to manage water resources in this region geologically its catchment basin and the aquifers of its water sources are located in the limestone formations of triassic jurassic age liberating very high percentages of calcium carbonate into the groundwater and sediments namdadi et al 2016 hashilan wetland is located in a syncline bordered by two anticlines in the northeast khorin anticline and southwest biston anticline fig 2 surveying the wetland on a large scale it is a part of the miandarband plain which surrounds the two anticlines contains several other wetlands and has two rivers namely razavar in the north and gareso in the south average flow rate of the razavar and gareso rivers is 4864 to 4423 l s respectively these rivers and also runoffs coming from the anticlines are loaded with sediments the types of these sediments on the wetland surface are clay sand and gravel likewise from surface to depth the hydro stratigraphy of the wetland based on the drilling logs of the exploration wells includes four layers clay sand clay gravel clay and the deepest layer is gravel and rock the infiltration rate is estimated about 0 085 based on precipitation temperature and evaporation data gozin saze company 2017 the wetland is recharged by a limestone formation biston formation triassic jurassic which makes the khorin karstic system faults and fractures in the anticline are the major groundwater pathways through which springs emerge several springs including sabzali manmey shele and jelogire are the inputs of the wetland among them the sabzali spring has the greatest discharge of about 323 l s two karstic springs sabzali and man e may originating from the khorein mountains located on the northern border of the wetland supplied 95 and 5 of the wetland s water respectively the total mean volume of water in the wetland is estimated to be over 1 02 107 cubic meters the runoff of the khorin anticline and some surface water from the irrigation of the northern farm lands are the other water inputs of the wetland because of unique ecological characteristics of the wetland in order to protect it from going dry in the event of dry years some water is provided from gavshan dam to feed the wetland from the perspective of discharging the wetland the main output on the surface is a natural drainage which joins the razavar river in the south of the wetland the mean flow rate of the wetland output which occurs through a canal on the surface is about 35 l s a numerical model was built to simulate the groundwater flow in the miandarband watershed gozin saze company 2017 three types of boundary conditions were considered including no flow fluid transfer and river based on pumping test conducted in the wetland the transmissivity and storativity coefficients are 1200 m2 s and 0 40 respectively the bedrock type is marl which can be considered as a no flow boundary the calibrated hydraulic gradient of the hydro stratigraphical layers clay sand clay gravel clay and gravel rock was achieved to be 0 05 1 2 and 0 01 m d these results are rather acceptable taking into account that the hydro stratigraphical materials are largely of small size with mixture of various particles ranging from clay to gravel according to this model and water table measurements of observation wells and piezometers the groundwater direction is from north west to south east of the wetland indicating that some water of the wetland is drained in the south east by the groundwater the hydraulic head in north west and south east is about 1314 and 1308 meters above sea level therefore the average hydraulic gradient of water table is about 0 001 0 002 the average wetland depth is about 3 m with an elevation of 1310 meters above sea level hence hashilan wetland is thus a marsh formed because of shallow aquifer in the region the watershed basin of the wetland is situated in the zagros mountain range where the depth of soil varies from 10 to 90 cm due to the natural conditions of the ecosystem this wetland is a habitat for many native stationary and migratory birds from the northern hemisphere during the cold season plants growing in the wetland can be classified into halophytes hydrophytes and plants growing along the banks of wetlands different fish species inhabit the wetland and wolf fox rabbit jackal wild cat and goat can be found in the highlands of the region therefore because of its importance hashilan wetland should be immune from any hydrological intervention e g digging wells draining by artificial canals etc and the input of agricultural industrial waste waters and actions such as the digging of wells and agricultural activities karami et al 2001 mortazavi 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sediment sampling and analysis sediment samples were collected at 16 locations from the top 5 cm of wetland topmost sediments in september 2019 using a stainless van veen grab and sampling location and characteristics are depicted in fig 3 and table 1 all samples were transferred into the air tight polyethylene bags and transported to the laboratory in the laboratory the samples were first air dried at room temperature and then larger debris such as plant leaves and pieces of glass were removed mechanically by passing each sample through a 2 mm sieve the measurements of ph and electrical conductivity ec were done with a ph ec meter eutech instrument waterproof cyberscan pcd 650 singapor as outlined by ryan et al ryan et al 2007 the organic matter om and calcium carbonate were also evaluated by the loss on ignition loi procedure heiri et al 2001 furthermore the grain size analysis and texture of sediment samples were determined using the hydrometer method hakanson 1980 minasny mcbratney 2001 3 2 water sampling and analysis in this study 6 water samples in hashilan wetland were collected in polythene bottles fig 3 and table 1 which were rinsed several times using the same water and transported to the laboratory refrigerator on the same day and kept at 4 c physicochemical properties of water samples including temperature ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were estimated in situ using portable measuring devices eutech instruments pcd650 calibrated with standard solutions turbidity was measured immediately via hand held turbidity meter eutech tn 100 singapore in the laboratory the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in water samples were estimated titrimetrically against standard na2 edta solution singh et al 1999 also flame emission spectrophotometer determined the contents of na and k ions jenway pfp7 uk the amounts of chloride carbonate and bicarbonate were determined titrimetrically using standard agno3 and h2so4 solution respectively based on the methodology defined by singh et al 1999 the spectrophotometric method was also applied to determine the so4 2 concentration in water samples 3 3 calculation of water quality indices water quality index is a measure which incorporates different physicochemical parameters into one single value reflecting the water quality level chen et al 2020 in the present study 11 water quality parameters were applied to obtain a comprehensive assessment system by referring to the basic items of surface water quality standards for agriculture usages fao 1992 the indices like comprehensive pollution index cpi and weighted arithmetic water quality index wqi were used to estimate the overall status of water quality level in the hashilan wetland the parameters covered in these indices are ec eh tds ph hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k 3 3 1 comprehensive pollution index cpi a comprehensive pollution index is the most trusted index applied to estimate the overall water quality in a water media matta et al 2020 chaudhary et al 2016 in this study for the classification of pollution level we used all the water quality variables whose concentration limit for irrigation purposes has been recommended by food and agriculture organization fao 1992 the calculation of cpi was performed using the following eq 1 1 cpi 1 n i 1 n c i s i ci is the measured concentration of the ith variable si represents the standard permissible concentration of the ith variable proposed by fao 1992 for water quality and n is the number of selected parameters ultimately the values cpi could be applied for rating the water quality of the wetland which are as follows 0 20 excellent quality 0 21 0 40 good quality 0 41 1 00 slight pollution 1 01 2 0 moderate pollution and 2 01 severe pollution zhao et al 2012 mishra kumar 2020 3 3 2 weighted arithmetic water quality index wqi wqi was proposed by brown et al 1970 aiming at the assessment of water quality status for general use in freshwater systems around the world its application is on the basis of the determination of a weighting factor for each quality variable contained in the index according to its relative importance for the overall quality the variables concentration after being normalized through sub index functions introduced by the methodology are aggregated to create the final index as weighted arithmetic mean zotou et al 2019 for a detailed description of its calculating framework one can refer to the corresponding publications shah joshi 2017 singh et al 2020 tyagi et al 2013 al othman 2019 the wqi was computed using the standards of water quality recommended by the world health organization who and fao the mathematical equation used to calculate wqi is expressed as 2 wqi i 1 n w i q i w i where n is the total number of water quality variables wi is the weightage factor of the ith water quality variable and qi is the sub index of the ith water quality variable the overall water quality on the basis of wqi is categorized as excellent quality 0 25 good quality 26 50 poor quality 51 75 very poor quality 76 100 and unsuitable for drinking purpose 100 akoteyon et al 2011 tyagi et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics of water samples the water chemistry of wetland ecosystems is primarily controlled by the quality of inflowing water water balance geologic setting type of vegetation and soils and human activity near or within the wetland somay et al 2008 furthermore the causes of water contamination can be categorized as natural and anthropogenic hence it is essential to know the chemical characteristics and quality of water for the environmental assessment and management of wetlands varol şekerci 2018 therefore in the current study we have attempted to determine the physicochemical characteristics and quality of surface water in the study area descriptive statistics of major ions concentration and physicochemical parameters in water samples of hashilan wetland are summarized in table 2 it is important to determine the quality of water for agriculture irrigation purposes and other usages in this section water quality parameters and analytical results were compared with world standard values of food and agriculture organization fao 1992 for agriculture irrigation purposes as are represented in table 2 water ph gives important information in many types of solubility calculations or geochemical equilibrium to limit corrosion and fouling of pumping irrigation and stock watering systems the permissible limit of ph value for wetland water is specified between 6 and 8 5 anzecc armcanz 2000 the ph of the water samples in hashilan wetland ranged from 7 42 to 7 85 and the mean ph was found to be 7 7 indicating the neutral nature of the water samples also the results indicated that ph value in all water samples fell under the permissible limit electrical conductivity ec indicates the conducting capacity of water which in turn is specified by the presence of dissolved ions ec is a measure of total dissolved solids tds which depends upon the ionic strength of the solution tiwari et al 2017 the ec can be grouped into low salinity waters ec 1500 μs cm medium salinity waters ec 1500 and 3000 μs cm and high salinity waters ec 3000 μs cm krishna kumar et al 2015 the measured ec value ranged from 395 to 883 μs cm with a mean value of 576 83 μs cm based on this classification all of the water samples belong to low salinity waters category tds concentration of all waters varied from 299 8 to 669 21 mg l with a mean value of 432 65 mg l according to these data all the water samples are freshwater tds 1000 mg l somay 2016 ec and tds indicated similar gradients of significant increases from upstream to downstream according to fig s1 in the supplementary information there is a direct relationship between ec and tds the high ec and tds values observed in some sites s8 and s12 sites are due to low water depth and excessive evaporation these sites are located close to agricultural lands and mainly affected by the application of pesticides and fertilizer the permissible limit of ec and tds in the surface water is 3000 mg l and 2000 mg l respectively fao 1992 therefore all of the measured values in the study area are below the fao standard oxidation reduction potential eh in the water of the study area varied from 38 2 to 525 6 mv with an average of 260 07 mv the mean value of soluble sodium percentage ssp sodium adsorption ratio sar total alkalinity ta and turbidity jtu in the hashilan wetland were measured 12 78 0 48 232 08 mg l and 58 7 respectively table 2 the turbidity is one of the important physical parameters for water quality defining the presence of suspended matter such as colloid organic matter microscopic organisms and clay and silt particles in water and causes the muddy or turbid appearance of water body tiwari et al 2017 the turbidity ranged from 0 35 to 175 and minimum and maximum value of turbidity were detected at the s2 and s5 stations respectively also water turbidity depends partly on water depth and vegetation for example low turbidity at the s1 and s2 sites is due to high water depth and dense vegetation respectively the dense vegetation and low water depth at s2 lead to accumulation of large amounts of organic matter resulting from the decomposition of plant residues this process leads to oxygen depletion and reduction in water oxidation reduction potential eh 38 2 mv according to sawyer et al 2003 water can be categorized as soft 75 mg l moderately hard 75 to 150 mg l hard 150 to 300 mg l and very hard above 300 mg l in the current study total hardness th varied from 175 to 350 mg l with a mean value of 250 mg l indicating the hard nature of water two samples s8 and s12 had hardness higher than 300 mg l which is a limiting value for drinking purposes the relative abundance of main cations in the water of hashilan wetland was shown in the following order ca2 mg2 na k while that of anion contents was in the order of hco3 so4 2 cl it can be seen that ca2 dominates the major cation chemistry of the water in the study area while k is detected at the lowest level calcium and magnesium are directly related to water hardness chapman 1996 all sampling sites showed approximately similar th within the study area with the maximum in the s8 and s12 sites the ca2 and mg2 concentrations ranged from 1 3 to 5 0 meq l and from 1 0 to 3 7 meq l with mean values of 2 72 meq l and 2 28 meq l respectively the slight increase in the cations was as a result of evaporation na and k normally originate from weathering products of igneous rocks clay minerals and evaporites but concentrations of k are usually much lower than those of na in natural water davraz et al 2019 the concentration of na varied between 0 31 and 1 92 meq l with a mean value of 0 78 meq l and concentration of k ranged from 0 02 to 0 04 mg l mean value of 0 027 meq l the range of hco3 so4 2 and cl were found to vary from 3 0 to 7 5 meq l 0 33 to1 4 meq l and 0 25 to 0 75 meq l respectively bicarbonate is the dominant form of inorganic carbon the freshwater from ph 7 to 9 eby 2004 dominance of hco3 and so4 2 together with high calcium and magnesium levels in the water samples might reveal dissolution of carbonates and sulfates abuncdance of these minerals the common ion effect and other geochemical factors probably influence dissolution rate of each mineral fertilizers can also be another source for the elevated so4 2 values in the study area varol şekerci 2018 the natural sources of cl are irrigation return flow salt domes and interbedded salt layers raeisi nejati 2000 while anthropogenic sources include synthetic fertilizer along with municipal effluents khatri tyagi 2015 hashilan wetland is characterized by low cl concentrations likely originated from dissolution of salts and application of fertilizers overall concentration of major cations and anions were lower than the recommended limit by fao table 2 showing that groundwater and precipitation are more contributing to the ions contents of the wetland data on the hydrogeochemistry characteristics of water samples from hashilan wetland were compared with those from other wetlands in the world table 3 the mean ec in the water samples was higher than its concentration in miangaran wetland iran and jaboque wetland colombia tds in nalban wetland india twenty four wetlands of hiroshima japan and choghakhor wetland iran also show a lower mean compared with the hashilan wetland the mean eh value in the current study was higher than all other mentioned wetlands the mean ph value in all water samples like other wetlands except for miangaran wetland iran fall within the optimum range 6 8 5 proposed by the canadian water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life ccme 2007 other comparisons are given in table 3 the piper 1944 diagram is extensively used to determine similarities and differences in the chemistry of water samples and classification of water on the basis of its chemical composition based on the dominant cations ca2 mg2 na and anions hco3 so4 2 cl concentrations in the water samples the piper diagram was plotted fig 4 and the water types in hashilan wetland were determined in all of the water samples the cations ca 2 and mg 2 alkaline earth exceed the cations na and k alkali and hco3 weak acid dominates over so4 2 and cl strong acid the high concentration of alkaline earth elements is usually stating the dissolution of ca and mg bearing minerals in geological formations therefore ca2 mg2 hco3 is the principal hydrogeochemical facies which indicates that carbonate hardness exceeds 50 in the study area the dissolution of calcium carbonate in the limestone formations and sediment water interactions are significantly responsible for this water type this is in agreement with chemical compositon of the springs and qanats in karstified formations of zagros that are not influenced by saltwater intrusion raeisi nejati 2000 the results of pearson correlation indicated a strong correlation between tds and ec p value 0 01 across the study stations table s1 hco3 cl k th and ta recorded a good positive relationship with tds and ec while a negative correlation existed between so4 2 and that of ec and tds it is evident that the major elements contribute to surface water salinity in hashilan wetland it would be expected that surface water salinization is affected through ionic content increment because of interactions between the geological formations and the water in the study area the cl na correlation is mainly applied to identify mechanisms related to salinity in semi arid regions nematollahi et al 2016 a relatively high positive relationship between cl and na explained the dominance of the evaporation process and the dissolution of chloride salts in the study area the so4 2 showed a negative correlation with ca2 suggesting that so4 2 and ca2 are not contained in the same geochemical processes in fact ca2 could precipitate as calcite and or undergo a ca2 na base exchange between clay minerals and water while sulfates are mainly found in a dissolved form desbarats 2009 raeisi nejati 2000 there was a significant positive correlation between hco3 and ca2 that showing that the dissolution of calcium carbonate is responsible for the excess hco3 4 3 water quality indices for the evaluation of site pollution level a comprehensive pollution index cpi was calculated and represented in fig 5 the cpi values indicated that the water of hashilan wetland at all sampling points has a good quality i e cpi range 0 21 0 40 as it varied between 0 21 and 0 34 in fact the water quality estimated at these stations appeared not to be impacted by pollutant sources table 4 indicates the results of the water quality index wqi for irrigational and drinking purposes the calculated wqi indicated that surface water quality in stations of s1 to s5 was excellent quality for irrigational purposes the wetland water was of good quality in s8 and s12 sites for irrigational purposes the wqi was also calculated at all sampling sites which indicates good water quality at sampling sites s1 s2 and s5 poor water quality at s3 while very poor water quality at the other sites for drinking high ec and tds in s8 and s12 sites could have contributed to the high wqi in this ecosystem however there is a need for routine monitoring of the different anthropogenic activities within the wetland catchment particularly the downstream to measure the salinity in general we concluded that the overall water quality in the hashilan wetland is excellent and poor for irrigational and drinking respectively 4 4 irrigational quality parameters the sodium ion is especially hazardous for irrigation and sodium excess must be highlighted when waters are evaluated for irrigation purposes thus various equations are applied depending on the na concentration somay 2016 sodium adsorption ratio sar is used to express the relative activity of na ions in exchange reactions within the soil it is a measure of the relative concentration of na detrimental element to ca and mg beneficial elements according to sar water can be classified as excellent 10 good 10 18 doubtful 18 26 and unsuitable 26 richards 1954 the values of sar ranged from 0 20 to 1 03 and classification of water samples with respect to sar indicated that all of the samples with sar 10 have excellent irrigation quality fig s2 in general all samples had sar values well below the fao fao 1992 as shown in table 2 the amount of soil exchange capacity occupied by na is commonly measured as soluble sodium percentage ssp as the ssp goes up more exchangeable na is available and the greater the potential for negative plant and soil effects water consisting of high percentage of na can result in stunting of plants and reduces soil permeability aboyeji ogunkoya 2017 the ssp values in water samples ranged from 5 85 to 21 43 with a mean value of 12 79 table 2 in situations where the ssp in irrigation water is greater than 60 there may result in sodium accumulations in soil that will cause the soil s physical properties deterioration and low water oxygen permeability fipps 2003 also the following terminology is used for the classification of irrigation water based on soluble sodium percentage ssp excellent 20 good 20 40 permissible 40 60 doubtful 60 80 and unsuitable 80 aboyeji ogunkoya 2017 based on the classification all of the water samples fall within excellent quality this result revealed that water of the study area is suitable for irrigation with no danger of exchangeable na wilcox diagram is used to evaluate the water quality for agriculture uses using parameters including sar and electrical conductivity ec the most important agricultural water quality parameters are ec and sar alavi et al 2016 in the wilcox diagram sar as a risk of alkalinity and ec as a risk of salinity are considered in this diagram s and c represent the sar and the salinity respectively qishlaqi et al 2017 classification of 6 stations in the hashilan wetland based on wilcox diagram is represented in fig s3 according to wilcox diagram water samples have two classes c2s1 and c3s1 as seen from fig s3 s1 s2 s3 and s5 stations indicate the best water quality for irrigation usages they are classified as c2s1 class with low hazard sodium and medium salinity on the other hand the quality of water at s1 s2 and s3 sites is good because they are fed with good quality water from the karstic spring of sabzali and this area is known as calcium carbonate formations other samples s8 and s12 are categorized as c3s1 with low hazard sodium and high salinity in the wilcox diagram these water samples show that the water quality by applying some necessary measures is suitable for agriculture 4 5 physicochemical characteristics of sediment samples table 5 represents the physicochemical properties in sediment samples these characteristics such as om cec ph ec carbonate calcium and grain size often provide important data on the sediment provenance depositional conditions and transport history aly salem et al 2014 calcium carbonate contents range between 3 77 and 23 69 with an average of 11 60 and accounted for a ph in the neutral range 7 42 7 85 the maximum and minimum ph values were observed at s15 and s3 sites respectively mean minimum and maximum values of ec were 334 75 111 3 and 632 5 µs cm respectively which demonstrated very low salinity in sediment samples in general the ec data are consistent with the information found from the hydrogeochemistry of water in section 3 1 as mentioned hashilan wetland is characterized by low salinity indicating that groundwater and precipitation have more effect on the water quality of the wetland in addition to providing nutrients and habitat to organisms living in the sediment organic matter om also binds sediment particles into aggregates and improves the water holding capacity of sediment bot 2005 om contents range between 4 31 and 40 16 with a mean value of 18 44 the maximum om value measured at the site s3 which can be due to high vegetation cover organic matter and clay contents were low to moderate values in hashilan wetland which also resulted in the relatively medium cec cec varied from 7 90 to 46 70 meq 100gr with a mean value of 14 74 meq 100gr the lowest cec value was measured at site s3 which had high percentage of sand 58 76 and the low percentage of silt and clay the average amounts of the particle size fractions of the sediment samples are 31 35 clay 31 03 silt and 37 62 of sand classifying them as clay loam it should be noted that the highest amount of clay was observed in sampling sites such as s3 s4 s9 s10 s12 s15 near agricultural areas that have standing water which could be due to the leaching of these particles by high discharge water flow sabzali spring in the wetland a comparison of mean values of physicochemical characteristics of sediments from this study in contrast with those from other wetlands are also represented in table 3 overall the mean values of ec and om showed higher levels in the hashilan wetland compared with other wetlands while the cec value was lower in the study area higher contents of om and ec in the hashilan wetland could be related to the entrance of agricultural runoff and dense vegetation in some situations however the sediments receiving agricultural runoff indicated sandy loam and loam textures due to reduced wastewater velocity entering the wetland which cause the lower cec of the wetland sediment compared to the other wetlands 5 conclusion for the first time physicochemical properties of water of the heshilan wetland and their influence on water quality were investigated the main hydrochemical facies was ca mg hco3 due to weathering and dissolution of the carbonate formations in the study area according to wqi the downstream stations of the wetland which receive agricultural wastewater are unsafe for drinking usage due to high ec and tds nevertheless irrigation water quality parameters such as sar and spp revealed water suitablity for agricultural practices while our study showed the good quality of the wetland water for irrigational purposes this should not by any means be interpreted as a suggestion of the exploitation of its water resources for agriculture the results are indeed showing that the hydrochemistry of the wetland is still healthy to sustain the flora and fauna of this unique wetland system water quality indices defined to assess the quality for irrigation purposes can also be used as proxies to show how the water quality is also sufficiently good for the wetland s wilde plants the reduction of water quality was observed in the stations located downstream of the study area which is related to agricultural runoff input to the wetland while water samples upstream of the wetland showed acceptable water quality which are fed by springs overall according to the ion concentrations and other physiochemical parameters groundwater and precipitation were the main sources contributing to the cations and anions of the wetland water finally this research was produced original new data on the physicochemical properties of water and sediment of the hashilan wetland which are considered as one of the major factors that affect the distribution periodicity and quantitative and qualitative composition of the wetland biota variations in these parameters have a substantial impact on the species that live in this ecosystem thus policy makers must monitor the physicochemical parameters and water quality of this wetland to do the urgent actions for greater protection of the environmental health also agricultural activities around the hashilan wetland should be done with more supervision because it can increase the rate of erosion of surrounding soil and ultimately change the physical and chemical properties of the water and soil of the wetland declaration of

978,environmental flows are unanimously considered to be one of the most comprehensive indicators of the rivers health and their capacities to provide ecosystem goods and services in this study the objective was to predict the response of environmental flow components in a typical north african rivers network to future climate change the study watershed is bouregreg watershed bw in morocco to achieve this objective a hybrid approach was build based on the semi distributed model soil and water assessment tool swat and the indicators of hydrologic alteration program iha data of two emissions scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from a downscaled global circulation model were used to force the hybrid swat iha to calculate modifications of bw s environmental flow components in 2085 2100 period results showed that bw will experience climatic changes under both scenarios most of the environmental flow attributes will be modified within the study period loss of natural flow variability due to shift in exceedance probability of low flows up to 40 decrease of monthly low flows forward shift in high flow timing up to 50 and alteration of both the duration and the rise rates of floods bw s streams responded unequally to the simulated changes in terms of the altered attributes as well as the degree of the alteration this study confirmed the ability of the developed modeling approach to monitor environmental flow parameters for the first time in morocco and contributed in highlighting the necessity of proactive long term strategies to protect riverine ecosystems in north africa watersheds key words climate change environmental flow bouregreg watershed swat iha 1 introduction ecosystems and water depend unarguably on each other for the ecological integrity and sustainability gibson et al 2005 richter et al 1996 both freshwater ecosystems as well as coastal and marine areas require adequate quantities frequency and quality of freshwater to maintain their functioning and production of environmental goods and services in the other hand much terrestrial and freshwater systems are essential for water supply ex clouds aquifer recharge areas springs poff et al 2007 rivers are generally considered as a key element in this equilibrium since they govern many essential ecological balances in the riverine ecosystems dyer et al 2014 furthermore and in addition to their central role in maintaining biodiversity riverine ecosystems provide a set of services and goods to human societies some of which such as the supply of drinking water represent a vital need for humans poff zimmerman 2010 spatiotemporal changes of river s flow regimes are generally in response to different factors associated to climate variability and or change watershed controls land cover geology topography and human intervention water collection infrastructure water diversion poff et al 2010 richter et al 1998 doll and zhang 2010 proved that climate change will have more significant impacts on river s flow regimes than water regulation effects especially in areas where intensity of climate change is expected to be high being located in one of global climate change hotspots northern africa is one of the most water stressed regions worldwide bzioui 2005 climate change has already been noticed in this region and most projections are showing an increasing alteration intensity of the local hydrologic components in the future which might lead to discharge reduction by more than 20 in some scenarios waha et al 2017 under such critical situation decision makers are challenged to cope with the growing demand for water and the preservation of freshwater ecosystems richter et al 2011 birsbane declaration 2007 defined the environmental flows as the quantity timing and quality of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well being that depend on these ecosystems the environmental flows are generally considered in policies and plans related to water planning and allocation as a key component for biodiversity protection and human water based activities poff zimmerman 2010 quesada alvarado et al 2021 due to the importance of this component forecasting its response to future climate patterns with as much details about its spatial sensitivity as possible is crucial to build sustainable water use and preservation strategies in this context the primary purpose of this study is to assess the potential impact of climate change on environmental flows during the last fifteen years of this century in a strategic watershed located in north africa morocco bouregreg watershed bw by combining a gis based semi distributed model meteorological data from two emission scenarios of coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment model and a hydrologic alteration software we aimed specifically to 1 understand climate and water balance within the end of the century in the study watershed 2 assess the alteration of environmental flows to projected climate and 3 identify the spatial variability of the environmental flows due to climate change across the rivers network outcomes of this study will help to prioritize the most vulnerable areas for potential strategies addressing future climate induced alteration to hydrology under north africa context 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the bouregreg watershed bw is located in the north western part of morocco and is sharing most ecological features with the major watersheds in northern africa fig 1 with a total drainage area of 9656km2 bw is playing key ecological and socio economic roles in the country by securing ecological integrity of the area providing drinking water for major cities and urban centres within and around its territory and hosting different activities farming pastoralism forestry abhbc 2011 altitudes in bw are diverse and are following a gradient ranging from 1726m in the mountainous eastern part to the sea level in the extreme western part fig 1 bounouira 2007 forests pasture and range lands and agricultural lands are the three major land use classes in bw with respectively 24 30 and 28 cover of the total watershed surface the rest of the study watershed area is covered by bare lands 14 urban centre 3 and water bodies 1 the study watershed is considered as a mediterranean climate watershed with the influence of the ocean in the extreme west and the one of atlas mountains in the east khomsi et al 2013 under the effect of ocean currents that are acting as conveyer belts of mainly cold water the western plateau of bw records average annual rainfall of 400 mm to 500 mm and low temperature amplitudes average annual mean temperature of 18 c the highland part in the extreme east and due to the elevation effect is usually recording an average annual rainfall exceeding 600 mm with occasional snowfall average annual mean temperature of 15 c khomsi et al 2013 abhbc 2018 surface water component is dominating the water budget in the study watershed by 90 the water potential of bw is estimated at 720 mm3 belmatrik 2010 rivers network is formed by four non perennial streams korifla and machraa streams with average daily streamflow of 1 2m3 s and 0 76m3 s measured at ain loudah and s m chrif streamgauges respectively and the two major ones bouregreg and grou with average daily streamflow of 5 24m3 s and 5 63m3 s recorded at aguibat ziar and ras fathia streamgauges respectively abhbc 2011 the both large rivers are taking origin from the atlas mountains in the east fig 1 maximum streamflow is usually recorded in winter season with the lowest streamflow occurring in summer season fig 2 from ecological perspective the very few investigations of freshwater ecosystems in the bw revealed high diversity in macro invertebrate fish and non swimming waterbirds species in this watershed arifi et al 2019 el asri 2006 2 2 models 2 2 1 hydrologic model in order to simulate the hydrological processes in the study watershed we used the semi distributed model soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 considering the extensive and the successful use on different geo physical and climatic conditions including in northern africa brouziyne et al 2017 abouabdillah et al 2014 and over various hydrological and climate change related aspects climate change induced hydrologic alteration of hydrology mittal et al 2014 arnold et al 2012 teklay et al 2021 swat model has been selected to simulate the hydrology of the bw rivers network swat model is a conceptual basin scale model developed to investigate climate scenarios and large variety of strategies related to land use crops management and water infrastructure on hydrology water quality and crops production li et al 2017 neitsch et al 2002 arnold et al 1993 spatially and by relying on gis platform swat called arcswat by some specialists is dividing the basin into units called hydrologic response units hrus each hru represents a unique combination of soil slope and land use classes the different physical processes that are simulated by swat are reproduced within each hru allowing wide possibilities to understand the spatial distribution of different processes occurring within the watershed at each time step of the simulation arnold et al 1993 to calibrate the hydrologic component of swat over bw we used sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 of swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup program abbaspour et al 2007 three statistical indicators nash sutcliffe coefficient nse the determination coefficient r2 and percent bias pbias were adopted to measure the goodness of fit of simulated streamflow compared to the recorded one at the four streamgauges while adjusting the most sensitive parameters 2 2 2 hydrologic alteration calculator indicators of hydrologic alteration iha program was developed by richter et al 1996 of the nature conservancy this software is a suite of metrics commonly used to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration caused by various forms of river regulation in environmental flow studies in this study iha was used to compute the potential alteration of environmental flow components efcs under projected climate change impacts in iha the efcs parameters were developed based on their ecological relevance they are calculated based on a complex algorithm that parses the relevance of a set of flow conditions or flow events to ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems the flow events that were monitored in our study at each stream gauge during the climate change impact investigations are monthly low flows high flow pulses small floods and large floods they are calculated based on fifteen year s baseline daily streamflow data pre impact and the daily streamflow data of the last fifteen years of this century post impact more details about the calculation method are presented in richter et al 1996 in this study the efcs parameters were analyzed while comparing the pre impact to the post impact streamflow data at the four streamgauges of bw alteration of efcs was estimated through the calculation of the change in mean values from the pre impact to the post impact period as a deviation factor df richter et al 1996 d f p o s t i m p a c t v a l u e p r e i m p a c t v a l u e p r e i m p a c t v a l u e 100 2 3 datasets swat model requires significant amount of input data to reproduce the different processes within the study watershed to build the swat hydrologic module for bw we used the following data 2 3 1 spatial dataset spatial input dataset were obtained from open source websites 1 a digital elevation model dem with 30m spatial resolution provided from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm database of nasa s space endeavour flight it was used to delineate bw s sub basins and to build the hydrographic network based on the discretization tool of arcgis software then four monitoring points were placed in the real locations of the four bw streamgauges aguibat ziar ras fathia ain loudah and s m chrif 2 a soil map of 1km resolution with its related attributes details provided from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 21 fao 2013 further soil conductivity related parameters were computed using soil water characteristics program saxton rawls 2006 and 3 three high quality landsat 8 satellite images downloaded from the earth explorer database of us geological survey to create specific land cover map for bw with 30m resolution based on supervised classification algorithms landsat 8 is using the recently developed sensors operational imager oli and thermal infrared sensor tris for enhanced scenes acquirement atmospheric and geometric corrections of bw s satellite images were carried out using image processing software erdas imagine v 2015 in order to develop specific spectral signatures of the major land cover classes in bw field visits were performed during full vegetation period to collect reference points coordinates of parcels hosting the different land cover classes signatures assignment in the created land cover map was performed then with certainty kappa coefficient 86 2 3 2 hydro meteorological dataset local climate and water management authority provided daily temperatures max min and precipitation series from january 1985 to december 2005 obtained from 12 weather stations across bw daily streamflow datasets from january 1990 to december 2005 at the four streamgauges of bw provided by the local climate and water management authority and were used to calibrate and validate swat hydrologic module 2 3 3 projection dataset as per future climate scenarios daily climate variables precipitation and max min temperature of two emissions scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from the global climate model cnrm cm5 were used to investigate future climate and hydrology the cnrm cm5 model is a member of the 5th version of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and was widely used in climate change studies in north africa due to its low uncertainty over this region balaghi 2017 hadour et al 2020 the considered future climate variables datasets cover the period from january 2080 to december 2100 to correct for bias and perform spatial downscaling of the cnrm cm5 simulations 25km resolution data from global land data assimilation system gldas were used the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method wood et al 2004 was selected for this purpose this method is based on both statistical bias correction as well as spatial disaggregation to transform bias corrected future model simulations from coarse scale to fine scale to assess the performance of the climate downscaling approach averaged downscaled historical precipitation and temperature data from the climate model were compared to averaged observed precipitation and temperature data respectively across the study watershed fig 3 summarizes the results compared to observations overall the adopted downscaling approach succeeded in capturing the general trend of monthly temperature as well as the seasonal variability of precipitation in bw including during both rainy and dry periods winter and summer seasons respectively fig 3 2 4 approach the adopted hybrid swat iha approach shown in fig 4 can be stated as the following steps a the swat model was set up by using input geospatial and metrological dataset over the period 1985 to 2005 while dedicating the first five years to warm up the model we then obtain simulated daily streamflow data at the four streamgauges over the period 1990 to 2005 b the swat cup program was run to obtain the best agreement between simulated and observed streamflow data at the four streamgauges the process is achieved as soon as the best satisfactory values of the adopted goodness of fit indicators nse pbias and r2 are reached more details on the calibration and validation efforts of streamflow module of swat on bw are presented in brouziyne et al 2020 c the calibrated swat model was run using the projected climatic data of the selected two emissions scenarios rcp4 5 rcp8 5 over the period 2080 to 2100 while dedicating the first five years to warm up the model we then obtain simulated future daily streamflow at the four streamgauges over the period 2085 to 2100 hereinafter referred to as 2090s d the iha program was used for the calculation of efcs based on the daily observed and simulated future streamflow data in this study the pre impact period or baseline is corresponding to the 1990 2005 period while the post impact period is referring to 2085 2100 period 2090s e the efcs analysis gave the final results of the hybrid swat iha approach 3 results discussion 3 1 hydrologic model calibration daily streamflow data simulated at the four streamgauges from 1990 to 2005 were confronted to the recorded ones while observing the adopted goodness of fit parameters r2 nse and pbias to perform this task the calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was used four swat hydrologic parameters were revealed influencing the hydrologic systems in the four streams namely cn2 initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii sol awc available water capacity of the soil layer esco soil evaporation compensation factor and gwqmn threshold depth of water return in shallow flow to occur all the four parameters were adjusted accordingly at the four streamgauges to reach the best reproduction of recorded streamflows more details about the sensitivity analysis was described in brouziyne et al 2020 considering that r 2 and nse coefficient start to indicate acceptable agreement between recorded and simulated streamflow at the values 0 5 and 0 36 respectively wherein the pbias value needs to be 25 moriasi et al 2007 van liew et al 2003 the daily streamflow calibration and validation results indicated a satisfactory model performance for hydrological processes over all bw streams fig 5 hydrographs of simulated and recorded streamflows at the four gauging stations confirmed the ability of swat model to successfully mimic the recorded flow in overall fig 5 most of peaks and low flows were in reasonable agreement with the recorded data along the simulation periods at all the four streamflow gauging stations due to the importance of seasonal variability of flows in the present study swat model performances in representing specifically this variability in the bw were investigated streamflow simulation during low flow summer season and high flow winter season periods separately at the four streamgauges were confronted to their respective recorded data during the same periods two agreement metrics were selected for this investigation the pbias and nse the table 1 represents the results of this investigation van liew et al 2003 reported that with an absolute value of pbias less than 25 and or nse greater than 0 36 the performance of the swat model can be considered satisfactory especially under arid semi arid contexts and in focused investigation on specific extreme flow regimes based on nse and pbias values at almost all bw s streamgauges table 1 the swat model performance showed satisfactory compromise under both extreme flow regimes in the study watershed despite the intermittent feature of the streamflow network this investigation also helped in examining the risks of inability of the selected goodness of fit parameters to measure model performance under extreme flow regimes when applied during calibration over continuous long term hydrological conditions therefore the simulations of bw s hydrologic systems by the calibrated swat model can be considered with confidence to investigate future hydrologic alteration in the study watershed 3 2 projected climate based on future temperature analysis and compared to baseline period temperatures bw will experience clear increase of mean temperature by the end of the century by 1 44 c and 2 7 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 6 summarizes the monthly distribution of mean temperature during 2090s 1985 to 2100 compared to baseline the expected change in monthly temperature over bw should follow the same increasing trend across all months and it is expected to be higher under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 under both emission scenarios the highest increase is projected during bw s dry season from june to september concerning precipitation fig 7 projections show that equivalent annual precipitation to the baseline s one 460mm is expected under the rcp4 5 455mm and lesser under the rcp8 5 307mm however the estimated standard deviations of future annual precipitation are 158 mm and 171 mm under the scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively while the baseline s standard deviation is 102mm this suggests a higher fluctuation of precipitation on year to year basis compared to the baseline situation the other important change as per 2090 s precipitation will concern the monthly distribution as shown in the figure 7 the main change in the pattern of bw s monthly precipitation during 2090s is the reduction of monthly averages of november to january under both rcps this period covers the rainy season in baseline precipitation in march and april are expected to exceed the baseline averages under both scenarios similar concentration of precipitation in spring season in comparison to baseline have been projected in other studies over the mediterranean region and confirmed that rainfall events are likely to be rarer but with larger daily amounts during spring season goubanova li 2007 the most consistent explanation for this shift was provided by meehl et al 2005 as the modification of advective effects associated with changes in atmospheric circulation over some part of the mediterranean region as per consequence on the hydrologic process such shifts in the monthly distribution of precipitation might have significant impacts on the different hydrologic regimes in the study watershed as proved in similar contexts by de girolamo et al 2015 and porthoghese et al 2013 3 3 future water balance once swat model is calibrated over baseline situation more details on swat model performance are presented in brouziyne et al 2020 it was run to simulate the water balance components in bw under baseline and 2090s rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 situations using their respective climate variables the main water balance components that are simulated by swat are potential evapotranspiration pet actual evapotranspiration et lateral flow latq surface runoff surfq and total water yield twyd which represents the total amount of water entering main channel covering surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater less transmission losses to the aquifer bed fig 8 shows the comparison between the different water balance components during each simulation scenario compared to baseline twyd reduction during 2090s is almost the major development the reduction is expected to be by 7 under rcp4 5 and by 45 under rcp8 5 the dramatic reduction in bw s twyd especially under rcp8 5 could be directly linked to the predicted decrease of annual precipitation 33 the reduction in precipitation might be the key factor also behind the predicted decrease in et during 2090s compared to baseline nevertheless actual evapotranspiration will keep being the predominant component in the water balance at the end of the century respectively 60 and 72 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 pet increase in the future by 6 rcp4 5 and 17 rcp8 5 could be linked to the predicted increase of temperature in the study watershed the identified changes are consistent with the results obtained by other studies over similar watersheds in northern africa such as in merguellil watershed in tunisia abouabdillah et al 2010 and in r dom watershed in morocco watershed brouziyne et al 2018 3 4 efcs analysis 3 4 1 flow duration curves being one of the widely used techniques to characterize hydrological regime of watersheds the flow duration curve fdc is computed by iha program by analysing the pre impact streamflow time series and then the post impact ones through a probabilistic approach further description of the computing method is available at richter et al 1996 fig 9 represents annual fdcs analysis for the two 2090 s scenarios compared to the reference fdc of baseline at the four streamgauges based on fdc analysis bw s flows regimes are expected to experience alterations during 2090s a partial change of exceedance probability shape of low flows was predicted under rcp4 5 in almost all streamgauges with less incidence in machraa and korifla streams while the change will be general and more severe under the rcp8 5 with more impact in the bouregreg and grou streams bw s largest streams since the probability of lower flow at pre impact period is supposed to increase under rcp4 5 the observed shift of the shape of 2090 s low flow rcp4 5 to right indicates a potential increase in low flow regimes variability however the natural variability should be preserved in moderate and high flows under rcp8 5 flow variability pattern was predicted to be altered under 2090 s climate at all streamgauges the shift to left of flow probability pattern across all flow rates means that the same flow rate will occur less frequently than in baseline this situation will be leading to natural variability loss which is expected to occur severely at all the four streamgauges levels this flow modification could be explained by the decrease of flow assurance due to the previously revealed change in future climate across the four streamgauges and the two rcps the most severe modification of fdc was predicted at the streamgauges of the two largest streams with changes of extreme exceedance probability of 38 in bouregreg stream rcp4 5 and 40 in grou stream rcp4 5 similar modifications of fdcs were simulated in investigations of future climate change impact on flow regime in watersheds located in southern italy pumo et al 2016 the studied watersheds are similar to bw in terms of major physical and hydro climatic characteristics and will experience changes of climate patterns equivalently to bw the authors reported that the fcds will be downshifted under the future climate change scenarios but with uneven rates across the sub watersheds pumo et al 2016 the main interpretation is the variability in terms of local micro climate topography as well as the dimensions of the tributaries which can be applicable on bw situation also to understand the variable response of fdcs within the streamflow network 3 4 2 monthly low flows due to its importance to the ecosystems the monitoring of low flow parameter especially at monthly wise provides useful indication about the river health institute of hydrology 1980 indeed some of the key roles of monthly low flows include providing adequate habitat for aquatic organisms maintaining suitable temperatures and dissolved oxygen and maintaining water table levels in floodplain and soil moisture for plants arnell 2003 gibson et al 2005 fig 10 summarize deviation factor percentages of monthly low flow mean under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in overall there will be a reduction of mean low flows in 2090s compared to baseline at the four streamgauges most of bw s streams will experience a decrease in low flow means especially under the rcp8 5 except in july and august also in june under rcp4 5 where an increase has been predicted at ain loudah and s m chrif gauges in the merguellil watershed a typical mediterranean watershed extending over an area of 1200 km2 in tunisia abouabdillah et al 2010 have found equivalent results after combining swat model and iha program to understand the response of flow regime to climate change in this watershed under most of climate change scenarios where temperatures will increase and rainfall to decrease monthly flows in merguellil are expected to decrease expect in july and august under some scenarios where positive deviations have been computed the computed high positive deviations for july and august can be explained by the very low values of baseline flows during these months at loudah and s m chrif gauges which amplified the deviation even if the change is small as per the ywo largest streams bouregreg and grou gauged by aguibat ziar and ras fathia no flows are generally recorded during july and august and no change was predicted during 2090s the most significant negative deviations have been estimated again at agibat ziar and ras fathia streamgauges 3 4 3 high flows iha program computes high flow pulses events as any rise of water level after a rainstorm that does not exceed the river channel banks richter et al 1996 fig 11 represents the deviations in post impact s high flow characteristics against the ones in baseline situation across both rcps all high flow characteristics will be altered in 2090s but the most significant deviation is relative to the timing the positive deviation in timing of high flows means that their occurrence is expected to be later across the year s julian days than in baseline in overall and except the duration and peak in some streamgauges rcp4 5 a general reduction of fall and rise rate and frequency was predicted under both emissions scenarios the predicted alteration to high flows in bw are supposed to influence some balances of the riverine ecosystems as this environmental flow component helps in shaping the physical pattern of the river channel maintaining salinity levels in estuaries and restore normal water quality level after low flow period martin et al 2019 3 4 4 floods both small and large flood are important for the riverine and terrestrial ecosystems as they contribute in providing recharge opportunity for the floodplain s water table depositing nutrients on floodplain providing migration and new feeding opportunities for fish lynch et al 2019 small floods are defined by iha as river rises that overtop the main channel but does include more extreme floods richter et al 1996 as presented in fig 12 the main predicted alterations of this component of environmental flow under rcp4 5 are the very significant positive deviation of the duration more than 300 and the relative reduction in almost all the other characteristics including frequency in all bw s streams as per rcp8 5 the major changes are about the increase of the duration korifla and bouregreg streams the extending of the timing and the reduction of the frequency in all streams concerning the large floods characteristics fig 13 the main changes during 2090s under rcp4 5 are the very significant deviation of the duration in machraa stream gauged by s m chrif the increase in fall and rise rates in korifla stream gauged by ain loudah and the increase in the frequency by 100 in both machraa and korifla streams the two key alterations of large floods under rcp8 5 are about the increase in rise rate korifla stream and the increase in the duration in machraa stream similar flood modifications were projected by sellami et al 2016 in chiba and thau basins in north eastern tunisia and south of france respectively by 2071 the authors proved that the timing magnitude and frequencies of small and large floods are supposed to be altered at the both basins under the effects of changing climate in the same investigation the flow regime in the chiba basin has been revealed more vulnerable to climate change induced alteration than the thau basin since the modification of floods parameters will be larger in the tunisian basin 4 conclusion the overall objective of this study was to assess future climate change induced modifications of environmental flow component at bw like in most of the major north african watersheds bw s climate is expected to change by the end of the current century temperature wise 1 44 c and 2 7 c increase in mean temperature are projected by the used gcm over bw under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively concerning precipitation the significant change should be expected under the emission scenario rcp8 5 where a reduction of annual precipitation average is projected the simulation of future water balance in bw revealed that total water yield will drop down and the potential evapotranspiration will rise up under both emission scenarios actual evapotranspiration will keep being the major water balance component in the study watershed based on the analysis of bw s flows duration curves under 2090 s climate severe natural flow variability loss was predicted under rcp8 5 in all the four studied streams however the variability alteration is expected to affect mainly low flow regimes under the rcp4 5 in terms of monthly low flows the whole bw stream network will experience a negative deviation compared to baseline averages the highest deviations have been computed for bw s major streams bouregreg and grou furthermore forward shift in high flow timing was simulated at the four streamgauges under both emission scenarios as per floods component duration of small floods will be extended in most of bw s streams however it is mainly fall and rise rates korifla and duration machraa stream of large floods will be altered in overall bw s environmental flow components will be affected by the climate change at the end of this century this study revealed that the response of bw s streams will be different in terms of both the altered component and the degree of deviation these findings suggest the necessity to put in place appropriate strategies of environmental flow preservation taking into consideration the specificity of each stream this study confirmed the ability of the proposed approach hybrid swat iha in revealing the future response of bw s stream network toward the 21st century climate and might be used to address

978,environmental flows are unanimously considered to be one of the most comprehensive indicators of the rivers health and their capacities to provide ecosystem goods and services in this study the objective was to predict the response of environmental flow components in a typical north african rivers network to future climate change the study watershed is bouregreg watershed bw in morocco to achieve this objective a hybrid approach was build based on the semi distributed model soil and water assessment tool swat and the indicators of hydrologic alteration program iha data of two emissions scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from a downscaled global circulation model were used to force the hybrid swat iha to calculate modifications of bw s environmental flow components in 2085 2100 period results showed that bw will experience climatic changes under both scenarios most of the environmental flow attributes will be modified within the study period loss of natural flow variability due to shift in exceedance probability of low flows up to 40 decrease of monthly low flows forward shift in high flow timing up to 50 and alteration of both the duration and the rise rates of floods bw s streams responded unequally to the simulated changes in terms of the altered attributes as well as the degree of the alteration this study confirmed the ability of the developed modeling approach to monitor environmental flow parameters for the first time in morocco and contributed in highlighting the necessity of proactive long term strategies to protect riverine ecosystems in north africa watersheds key words climate change environmental flow bouregreg watershed swat iha 1 introduction ecosystems and water depend unarguably on each other for the ecological integrity and sustainability gibson et al 2005 richter et al 1996 both freshwater ecosystems as well as coastal and marine areas require adequate quantities frequency and quality of freshwater to maintain their functioning and production of environmental goods and services in the other hand much terrestrial and freshwater systems are essential for water supply ex clouds aquifer recharge areas springs poff et al 2007 rivers are generally considered as a key element in this equilibrium since they govern many essential ecological balances in the riverine ecosystems dyer et al 2014 furthermore and in addition to their central role in maintaining biodiversity riverine ecosystems provide a set of services and goods to human societies some of which such as the supply of drinking water represent a vital need for humans poff zimmerman 2010 spatiotemporal changes of river s flow regimes are generally in response to different factors associated to climate variability and or change watershed controls land cover geology topography and human intervention water collection infrastructure water diversion poff et al 2010 richter et al 1998 doll and zhang 2010 proved that climate change will have more significant impacts on river s flow regimes than water regulation effects especially in areas where intensity of climate change is expected to be high being located in one of global climate change hotspots northern africa is one of the most water stressed regions worldwide bzioui 2005 climate change has already been noticed in this region and most projections are showing an increasing alteration intensity of the local hydrologic components in the future which might lead to discharge reduction by more than 20 in some scenarios waha et al 2017 under such critical situation decision makers are challenged to cope with the growing demand for water and the preservation of freshwater ecosystems richter et al 2011 birsbane declaration 2007 defined the environmental flows as the quantity timing and quality of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well being that depend on these ecosystems the environmental flows are generally considered in policies and plans related to water planning and allocation as a key component for biodiversity protection and human water based activities poff zimmerman 2010 quesada alvarado et al 2021 due to the importance of this component forecasting its response to future climate patterns with as much details about its spatial sensitivity as possible is crucial to build sustainable water use and preservation strategies in this context the primary purpose of this study is to assess the potential impact of climate change on environmental flows during the last fifteen years of this century in a strategic watershed located in north africa morocco bouregreg watershed bw by combining a gis based semi distributed model meteorological data from two emission scenarios of coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment model and a hydrologic alteration software we aimed specifically to 1 understand climate and water balance within the end of the century in the study watershed 2 assess the alteration of environmental flows to projected climate and 3 identify the spatial variability of the environmental flows due to climate change across the rivers network outcomes of this study will help to prioritize the most vulnerable areas for potential strategies addressing future climate induced alteration to hydrology under north africa context 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the bouregreg watershed bw is located in the north western part of morocco and is sharing most ecological features with the major watersheds in northern africa fig 1 with a total drainage area of 9656km2 bw is playing key ecological and socio economic roles in the country by securing ecological integrity of the area providing drinking water for major cities and urban centres within and around its territory and hosting different activities farming pastoralism forestry abhbc 2011 altitudes in bw are diverse and are following a gradient ranging from 1726m in the mountainous eastern part to the sea level in the extreme western part fig 1 bounouira 2007 forests pasture and range lands and agricultural lands are the three major land use classes in bw with respectively 24 30 and 28 cover of the total watershed surface the rest of the study watershed area is covered by bare lands 14 urban centre 3 and water bodies 1 the study watershed is considered as a mediterranean climate watershed with the influence of the ocean in the extreme west and the one of atlas mountains in the east khomsi et al 2013 under the effect of ocean currents that are acting as conveyer belts of mainly cold water the western plateau of bw records average annual rainfall of 400 mm to 500 mm and low temperature amplitudes average annual mean temperature of 18 c the highland part in the extreme east and due to the elevation effect is usually recording an average annual rainfall exceeding 600 mm with occasional snowfall average annual mean temperature of 15 c khomsi et al 2013 abhbc 2018 surface water component is dominating the water budget in the study watershed by 90 the water potential of bw is estimated at 720 mm3 belmatrik 2010 rivers network is formed by four non perennial streams korifla and machraa streams with average daily streamflow of 1 2m3 s and 0 76m3 s measured at ain loudah and s m chrif streamgauges respectively and the two major ones bouregreg and grou with average daily streamflow of 5 24m3 s and 5 63m3 s recorded at aguibat ziar and ras fathia streamgauges respectively abhbc 2011 the both large rivers are taking origin from the atlas mountains in the east fig 1 maximum streamflow is usually recorded in winter season with the lowest streamflow occurring in summer season fig 2 from ecological perspective the very few investigations of freshwater ecosystems in the bw revealed high diversity in macro invertebrate fish and non swimming waterbirds species in this watershed arifi et al 2019 el asri 2006 2 2 models 2 2 1 hydrologic model in order to simulate the hydrological processes in the study watershed we used the semi distributed model soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 considering the extensive and the successful use on different geo physical and climatic conditions including in northern africa brouziyne et al 2017 abouabdillah et al 2014 and over various hydrological and climate change related aspects climate change induced hydrologic alteration of hydrology mittal et al 2014 arnold et al 2012 teklay et al 2021 swat model has been selected to simulate the hydrology of the bw rivers network swat model is a conceptual basin scale model developed to investigate climate scenarios and large variety of strategies related to land use crops management and water infrastructure on hydrology water quality and crops production li et al 2017 neitsch et al 2002 arnold et al 1993 spatially and by relying on gis platform swat called arcswat by some specialists is dividing the basin into units called hydrologic response units hrus each hru represents a unique combination of soil slope and land use classes the different physical processes that are simulated by swat are reproduced within each hru allowing wide possibilities to understand the spatial distribution of different processes occurring within the watershed at each time step of the simulation arnold et al 1993 to calibrate the hydrologic component of swat over bw we used sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 of swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup program abbaspour et al 2007 three statistical indicators nash sutcliffe coefficient nse the determination coefficient r2 and percent bias pbias were adopted to measure the goodness of fit of simulated streamflow compared to the recorded one at the four streamgauges while adjusting the most sensitive parameters 2 2 2 hydrologic alteration calculator indicators of hydrologic alteration iha program was developed by richter et al 1996 of the nature conservancy this software is a suite of metrics commonly used to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration caused by various forms of river regulation in environmental flow studies in this study iha was used to compute the potential alteration of environmental flow components efcs under projected climate change impacts in iha the efcs parameters were developed based on their ecological relevance they are calculated based on a complex algorithm that parses the relevance of a set of flow conditions or flow events to ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems the flow events that were monitored in our study at each stream gauge during the climate change impact investigations are monthly low flows high flow pulses small floods and large floods they are calculated based on fifteen year s baseline daily streamflow data pre impact and the daily streamflow data of the last fifteen years of this century post impact more details about the calculation method are presented in richter et al 1996 in this study the efcs parameters were analyzed while comparing the pre impact to the post impact streamflow data at the four streamgauges of bw alteration of efcs was estimated through the calculation of the change in mean values from the pre impact to the post impact period as a deviation factor df richter et al 1996 d f p o s t i m p a c t v a l u e p r e i m p a c t v a l u e p r e i m p a c t v a l u e 100 2 3 datasets swat model requires significant amount of input data to reproduce the different processes within the study watershed to build the swat hydrologic module for bw we used the following data 2 3 1 spatial dataset spatial input dataset were obtained from open source websites 1 a digital elevation model dem with 30m spatial resolution provided from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm database of nasa s space endeavour flight it was used to delineate bw s sub basins and to build the hydrographic network based on the discretization tool of arcgis software then four monitoring points were placed in the real locations of the four bw streamgauges aguibat ziar ras fathia ain loudah and s m chrif 2 a soil map of 1km resolution with its related attributes details provided from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 21 fao 2013 further soil conductivity related parameters were computed using soil water characteristics program saxton rawls 2006 and 3 three high quality landsat 8 satellite images downloaded from the earth explorer database of us geological survey to create specific land cover map for bw with 30m resolution based on supervised classification algorithms landsat 8 is using the recently developed sensors operational imager oli and thermal infrared sensor tris for enhanced scenes acquirement atmospheric and geometric corrections of bw s satellite images were carried out using image processing software erdas imagine v 2015 in order to develop specific spectral signatures of the major land cover classes in bw field visits were performed during full vegetation period to collect reference points coordinates of parcels hosting the different land cover classes signatures assignment in the created land cover map was performed then with certainty kappa coefficient 86 2 3 2 hydro meteorological dataset local climate and water management authority provided daily temperatures max min and precipitation series from january 1985 to december 2005 obtained from 12 weather stations across bw daily streamflow datasets from january 1990 to december 2005 at the four streamgauges of bw provided by the local climate and water management authority and were used to calibrate and validate swat hydrologic module 2 3 3 projection dataset as per future climate scenarios daily climate variables precipitation and max min temperature of two emissions scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from the global climate model cnrm cm5 were used to investigate future climate and hydrology the cnrm cm5 model is a member of the 5th version of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and was widely used in climate change studies in north africa due to its low uncertainty over this region balaghi 2017 hadour et al 2020 the considered future climate variables datasets cover the period from january 2080 to december 2100 to correct for bias and perform spatial downscaling of the cnrm cm5 simulations 25km resolution data from global land data assimilation system gldas were used the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method wood et al 2004 was selected for this purpose this method is based on both statistical bias correction as well as spatial disaggregation to transform bias corrected future model simulations from coarse scale to fine scale to assess the performance of the climate downscaling approach averaged downscaled historical precipitation and temperature data from the climate model were compared to averaged observed precipitation and temperature data respectively across the study watershed fig 3 summarizes the results compared to observations overall the adopted downscaling approach succeeded in capturing the general trend of monthly temperature as well as the seasonal variability of precipitation in bw including during both rainy and dry periods winter and summer seasons respectively fig 3 2 4 approach the adopted hybrid swat iha approach shown in fig 4 can be stated as the following steps a the swat model was set up by using input geospatial and metrological dataset over the period 1985 to 2005 while dedicating the first five years to warm up the model we then obtain simulated daily streamflow data at the four streamgauges over the period 1990 to 2005 b the swat cup program was run to obtain the best agreement between simulated and observed streamflow data at the four streamgauges the process is achieved as soon as the best satisfactory values of the adopted goodness of fit indicators nse pbias and r2 are reached more details on the calibration and validation efforts of streamflow module of swat on bw are presented in brouziyne et al 2020 c the calibrated swat model was run using the projected climatic data of the selected two emissions scenarios rcp4 5 rcp8 5 over the period 2080 to 2100 while dedicating the first five years to warm up the model we then obtain simulated future daily streamflow at the four streamgauges over the period 2085 to 2100 hereinafter referred to as 2090s d the iha program was used for the calculation of efcs based on the daily observed and simulated future streamflow data in this study the pre impact period or baseline is corresponding to the 1990 2005 period while the post impact period is referring to 2085 2100 period 2090s e the efcs analysis gave the final results of the hybrid swat iha approach 3 results discussion 3 1 hydrologic model calibration daily streamflow data simulated at the four streamgauges from 1990 to 2005 were confronted to the recorded ones while observing the adopted goodness of fit parameters r2 nse and pbias to perform this task the calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was used four swat hydrologic parameters were revealed influencing the hydrologic systems in the four streams namely cn2 initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii sol awc available water capacity of the soil layer esco soil evaporation compensation factor and gwqmn threshold depth of water return in shallow flow to occur all the four parameters were adjusted accordingly at the four streamgauges to reach the best reproduction of recorded streamflows more details about the sensitivity analysis was described in brouziyne et al 2020 considering that r 2 and nse coefficient start to indicate acceptable agreement between recorded and simulated streamflow at the values 0 5 and 0 36 respectively wherein the pbias value needs to be 25 moriasi et al 2007 van liew et al 2003 the daily streamflow calibration and validation results indicated a satisfactory model performance for hydrological processes over all bw streams fig 5 hydrographs of simulated and recorded streamflows at the four gauging stations confirmed the ability of swat model to successfully mimic the recorded flow in overall fig 5 most of peaks and low flows were in reasonable agreement with the recorded data along the simulation periods at all the four streamflow gauging stations due to the importance of seasonal variability of flows in the present study swat model performances in representing specifically this variability in the bw were investigated streamflow simulation during low flow summer season and high flow winter season periods separately at the four streamgauges were confronted to their respective recorded data during the same periods two agreement metrics were selected for this investigation the pbias and nse the table 1 represents the results of this investigation van liew et al 2003 reported that with an absolute value of pbias less than 25 and or nse greater than 0 36 the performance of the swat model can be considered satisfactory especially under arid semi arid contexts and in focused investigation on specific extreme flow regimes based on nse and pbias values at almost all bw s streamgauges table 1 the swat model performance showed satisfactory compromise under both extreme flow regimes in the study watershed despite the intermittent feature of the streamflow network this investigation also helped in examining the risks of inability of the selected goodness of fit parameters to measure model performance under extreme flow regimes when applied during calibration over continuous long term hydrological conditions therefore the simulations of bw s hydrologic systems by the calibrated swat model can be considered with confidence to investigate future hydrologic alteration in the study watershed 3 2 projected climate based on future temperature analysis and compared to baseline period temperatures bw will experience clear increase of mean temperature by the end of the century by 1 44 c and 2 7 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 6 summarizes the monthly distribution of mean temperature during 2090s 1985 to 2100 compared to baseline the expected change in monthly temperature over bw should follow the same increasing trend across all months and it is expected to be higher under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 under both emission scenarios the highest increase is projected during bw s dry season from june to september concerning precipitation fig 7 projections show that equivalent annual precipitation to the baseline s one 460mm is expected under the rcp4 5 455mm and lesser under the rcp8 5 307mm however the estimated standard deviations of future annual precipitation are 158 mm and 171 mm under the scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively while the baseline s standard deviation is 102mm this suggests a higher fluctuation of precipitation on year to year basis compared to the baseline situation the other important change as per 2090 s precipitation will concern the monthly distribution as shown in the figure 7 the main change in the pattern of bw s monthly precipitation during 2090s is the reduction of monthly averages of november to january under both rcps this period covers the rainy season in baseline precipitation in march and april are expected to exceed the baseline averages under both scenarios similar concentration of precipitation in spring season in comparison to baseline have been projected in other studies over the mediterranean region and confirmed that rainfall events are likely to be rarer but with larger daily amounts during spring season goubanova li 2007 the most consistent explanation for this shift was provided by meehl et al 2005 as the modification of advective effects associated with changes in atmospheric circulation over some part of the mediterranean region as per consequence on the hydrologic process such shifts in the monthly distribution of precipitation might have significant impacts on the different hydrologic regimes in the study watershed as proved in similar contexts by de girolamo et al 2015 and porthoghese et al 2013 3 3 future water balance once swat model is calibrated over baseline situation more details on swat model performance are presented in brouziyne et al 2020 it was run to simulate the water balance components in bw under baseline and 2090s rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 situations using their respective climate variables the main water balance components that are simulated by swat are potential evapotranspiration pet actual evapotranspiration et lateral flow latq surface runoff surfq and total water yield twyd which represents the total amount of water entering main channel covering surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater less transmission losses to the aquifer bed fig 8 shows the comparison between the different water balance components during each simulation scenario compared to baseline twyd reduction during 2090s is almost the major development the reduction is expected to be by 7 under rcp4 5 and by 45 under rcp8 5 the dramatic reduction in bw s twyd especially under rcp8 5 could be directly linked to the predicted decrease of annual precipitation 33 the reduction in precipitation might be the key factor also behind the predicted decrease in et during 2090s compared to baseline nevertheless actual evapotranspiration will keep being the predominant component in the water balance at the end of the century respectively 60 and 72 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 pet increase in the future by 6 rcp4 5 and 17 rcp8 5 could be linked to the predicted increase of temperature in the study watershed the identified changes are consistent with the results obtained by other studies over similar watersheds in northern africa such as in merguellil watershed in tunisia abouabdillah et al 2010 and in r dom watershed in morocco watershed brouziyne et al 2018 3 4 efcs analysis 3 4 1 flow duration curves being one of the widely used techniques to characterize hydrological regime of watersheds the flow duration curve fdc is computed by iha program by analysing the pre impact streamflow time series and then the post impact ones through a probabilistic approach further description of the computing method is available at richter et al 1996 fig 9 represents annual fdcs analysis for the two 2090 s scenarios compared to the reference fdc of baseline at the four streamgauges based on fdc analysis bw s flows regimes are expected to experience alterations during 2090s a partial change of exceedance probability shape of low flows was predicted under rcp4 5 in almost all streamgauges with less incidence in machraa and korifla streams while the change will be general and more severe under the rcp8 5 with more impact in the bouregreg and grou streams bw s largest streams since the probability of lower flow at pre impact period is supposed to increase under rcp4 5 the observed shift of the shape of 2090 s low flow rcp4 5 to right indicates a potential increase in low flow regimes variability however the natural variability should be preserved in moderate and high flows under rcp8 5 flow variability pattern was predicted to be altered under 2090 s climate at all streamgauges the shift to left of flow probability pattern across all flow rates means that the same flow rate will occur less frequently than in baseline this situation will be leading to natural variability loss which is expected to occur severely at all the four streamgauges levels this flow modification could be explained by the decrease of flow assurance due to the previously revealed change in future climate across the four streamgauges and the two rcps the most severe modification of fdc was predicted at the streamgauges of the two largest streams with changes of extreme exceedance probability of 38 in bouregreg stream rcp4 5 and 40 in grou stream rcp4 5 similar modifications of fdcs were simulated in investigations of future climate change impact on flow regime in watersheds located in southern italy pumo et al 2016 the studied watersheds are similar to bw in terms of major physical and hydro climatic characteristics and will experience changes of climate patterns equivalently to bw the authors reported that the fcds will be downshifted under the future climate change scenarios but with uneven rates across the sub watersheds pumo et al 2016 the main interpretation is the variability in terms of local micro climate topography as well as the dimensions of the tributaries which can be applicable on bw situation also to understand the variable response of fdcs within the streamflow network 3 4 2 monthly low flows due to its importance to the ecosystems the monitoring of low flow parameter especially at monthly wise provides useful indication about the river health institute of hydrology 1980 indeed some of the key roles of monthly low flows include providing adequate habitat for aquatic organisms maintaining suitable temperatures and dissolved oxygen and maintaining water table levels in floodplain and soil moisture for plants arnell 2003 gibson et al 2005 fig 10 summarize deviation factor percentages of monthly low flow mean under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in overall there will be a reduction of mean low flows in 2090s compared to baseline at the four streamgauges most of bw s streams will experience a decrease in low flow means especially under the rcp8 5 except in july and august also in june under rcp4 5 where an increase has been predicted at ain loudah and s m chrif gauges in the merguellil watershed a typical mediterranean watershed extending over an area of 1200 km2 in tunisia abouabdillah et al 2010 have found equivalent results after combining swat model and iha program to understand the response of flow regime to climate change in this watershed under most of climate change scenarios where temperatures will increase and rainfall to decrease monthly flows in merguellil are expected to decrease expect in july and august under some scenarios where positive deviations have been computed the computed high positive deviations for july and august can be explained by the very low values of baseline flows during these months at loudah and s m chrif gauges which amplified the deviation even if the change is small as per the ywo largest streams bouregreg and grou gauged by aguibat ziar and ras fathia no flows are generally recorded during july and august and no change was predicted during 2090s the most significant negative deviations have been estimated again at agibat ziar and ras fathia streamgauges 3 4 3 high flows iha program computes high flow pulses events as any rise of water level after a rainstorm that does not exceed the river channel banks richter et al 1996 fig 11 represents the deviations in post impact s high flow characteristics against the ones in baseline situation across both rcps all high flow characteristics will be altered in 2090s but the most significant deviation is relative to the timing the positive deviation in timing of high flows means that their occurrence is expected to be later across the year s julian days than in baseline in overall and except the duration and peak in some streamgauges rcp4 5 a general reduction of fall and rise rate and frequency was predicted under both emissions scenarios the predicted alteration to high flows in bw are supposed to influence some balances of the riverine ecosystems as this environmental flow component helps in shaping the physical pattern of the river channel maintaining salinity levels in estuaries and restore normal water quality level after low flow period martin et al 2019 3 4 4 floods both small and large flood are important for the riverine and terrestrial ecosystems as they contribute in providing recharge opportunity for the floodplain s water table depositing nutrients on floodplain providing migration and new feeding opportunities for fish lynch et al 2019 small floods are defined by iha as river rises that overtop the main channel but does include more extreme floods richter et al 1996 as presented in fig 12 the main predicted alterations of this component of environmental flow under rcp4 5 are the very significant positive deviation of the duration more than 300 and the relative reduction in almost all the other characteristics including frequency in all bw s streams as per rcp8 5 the major changes are about the increase of the duration korifla and bouregreg streams the extending of the timing and the reduction of the frequency in all streams concerning the large floods characteristics fig 13 the main changes during 2090s under rcp4 5 are the very significant deviation of the duration in machraa stream gauged by s m chrif the increase in fall and rise rates in korifla stream gauged by ain loudah and the increase in the frequency by 100 in both machraa and korifla streams the two key alterations of large floods under rcp8 5 are about the increase in rise rate korifla stream and the increase in the duration in machraa stream similar flood modifications were projected by sellami et al 2016 in chiba and thau basins in north eastern tunisia and south of france respectively by 2071 the authors proved that the timing magnitude and frequencies of small and large floods are supposed to be altered at the both basins under the effects of changing climate in the same investigation the flow regime in the chiba basin has been revealed more vulnerable to climate change induced alteration than the thau basin since the modification of floods parameters will be larger in the tunisian basin 4 conclusion the overall objective of this study was to assess future climate change induced modifications of environmental flow component at bw like in most of the major north african watersheds bw s climate is expected to change by the end of the current century temperature wise 1 44 c and 2 7 c increase in mean temperature are projected by the used gcm over bw under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively concerning precipitation the significant change should be expected under the emission scenario rcp8 5 where a reduction of annual precipitation average is projected the simulation of future water balance in bw revealed that total water yield will drop down and the potential evapotranspiration will rise up under both emission scenarios actual evapotranspiration will keep being the major water balance component in the study watershed based on the analysis of bw s flows duration curves under 2090 s climate severe natural flow variability loss was predicted under rcp8 5 in all the four studied streams however the variability alteration is expected to affect mainly low flow regimes under the rcp4 5 in terms of monthly low flows the whole bw stream network will experience a negative deviation compared to baseline averages the highest deviations have been computed for bw s major streams bouregreg and grou furthermore forward shift in high flow timing was simulated at the four streamgauges under both emission scenarios as per floods component duration of small floods will be extended in most of bw s streams however it is mainly fall and rise rates korifla and duration machraa stream of large floods will be altered in overall bw s environmental flow components will be affected by the climate change at the end of this century this study revealed that the response of bw s streams will be different in terms of both the altered component and the degree of deviation these findings suggest the necessity to put in place appropriate strategies of environmental flow preservation taking into consideration the specificity of each stream this study confirmed the ability of the proposed approach hybrid swat iha in revealing the future response of bw s stream network toward the 21st century climate and might be used to address the climate change induced modification of the environmental flows in similar watersheds in north africa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

rainfall for the site was 404 mm and 852 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively the 30 year mean annual rainfall at the site is approximately 514 mm showing that 2014 received 21 below average rainfall and 2015 received 67 above average rainfall similarly cumulative rainfall during the active growing season may to october of giant reed was 188 and 264 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively average temperatures for this period closely followed 30 year averages average daily temperatures peaked in august 31 c in both years monthly mean daily average temperatures from may to october were similar

peak growing season may october are shown in figure 3 the le dominated throughout giant reed s growing season in 2014 showing a peak growth in july 2014 in 2015 le was the dominant turbulent flux in the beginning of the peak growing season may july however h increased substantially during august and september following the reductions in vegetative growth this is consistent with findings from other studies that link energy partitioning to vegetative growth or plant phenology wagle et al 2016 figure 3 shows a reduction of le during the months of may july 2015 coinciding with an increase in the density of arundo wasp consecutive rainfall events and warming temperatures that associated with arundo wasp activity moran and goolsby 2009 racelis et al 2009 3 4 seasonal patterns and magnitudes of et as depicted in figure 3a there is a noticeable decrease in et from 2014 to 2015 during the peak growing season the maximum et rates were 7 7 and 6 07 mm day 1 during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively monthly et was higher in each month of the growing season from may to october in 2014 than in 2015 fig 4 as a result seasonal doy 121 304 et was significantly higher in 2014 842 mm than in 2015 625 mm the observed maximum et during this study of 7 7 mm day 1 is comparable to et values reported in major productive agricultural and natural ecosystems in the southcentral u s 6 7

wagle et al 2018 logically et should have increased in 2015 since the site received higher rainfall that year fig 4b consistent with the findings of watts et al 2011 that water use of giant reed increases during periods of high rainfall air temperature was also similar in both growing seasons figs s1 and 4b since air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd are tightly correlated i e increase or decrease together to each other vpd could not be a limiting factor for et during the wetter growing season of 2015 however our results showed the opposite result i e smaller magnitudes of et in 2015 than in 2014 figs 4a and 5 as et is known to be strongly correlated with precipitation our results suggest that the difference in the magnitudes of et between the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons was not caused by differences in weather conditions between years based on the accumulated degree days model spencer et al 2006 demonstrated that phenology of giant reed was closely related with temperature there was no difference in degree day accumulation for eagle pass texas from 2014 and 2015 fig s2 projecting that giant reed growth is maximized during doy 121 304 consistent with its high demand for water during this high growth period as a highly managed riparian area riverbank areas along the rio grande that are dominated by giant reed often experience minor periodic flooding via releases of water for agriculture or municipal needs or through minor storm events that raise the water table and provide excess water resources for giant reed an isotopic study by moore et al 2015 suggested that the dominant source of water used by giant reed was not tapping deeply into the water table but rather from flooding events thus demonstrating the efficiency of giant reed to use ground water and retain it over long periods of time the overall increase in precipitation and reduction in et in 2015 as depicted in figure 4 illustrated that neither precipitation nor climate accounted for the interannual variation of et 3 5 population dynamics of a biological control agent and its influence on biomass production and et previous studies suggested that herbivory associated with the arundo wasp effectively reduced rates of leaf level physiological processes in giant reed moore et al 2010 watts and moore 2011 the plant level effect of the wasp increased with density effectively reducing photosynthesis by moderating co2 fixation moore et al 2010 the galling associated with the arundo wasps were nutrient sinks raman et al 2005 effectively decreasing arundo leaf size and increasing the formation of lateral shoots and ultimately reducing overall growth rates goolsby et al 2009 at this site we found a general increase in populations of the stem galling wasp from 2014 to 2015 fig 6 although there were no significant differences found between years in the average number of wasps captured each month there was a considerable increase in the number of wasps captured during the months of may june and july the peak growing season of giant reed in 2015 where we recorded an increase in wasps of 28 6 53 5 and 44 respectively the proliferation of the arundo wasp is not unique to this site goolsby et al 2016 but its increased abundance may explain in part this reduction in et from 2014 to 2015 watts and moore 2011 found that in high densities the galls induced by the arundo wasp can have a significant impact on et of giant reed by moderating the movement of water in plant phloem it is possible that generally higher population levels of the arundo wasp found in 2015 reduced the ability of the plant to uptake and move water in its tissues resulting in reduced et rates during the 2015 growing season fig 4a the association between an increase in arundo wasps and a decrease in et presented in this study warrants further long term study especially since the population increases of this biocontrol agent has been documented across the state of texas and in northern mexico goolsby et al 2014 studies conducted before and 7 years after the permitted release of the arundo wasp documented an impact on both dominance and competitiveness of giant reed goolsby et al 2016 found significant reductions in above ground biomass correlated with increases in the density of the arundo wasp and this impact was strongly associated with an increase of native and non giant reed plant diversity across multiple sites along the rio grande river moran et al 2017 martinez jimenez et al 2017 4 conclusions this study presents the first continuous field scale measurement of water use of giant reed using the eddy covariance technique results indicate that giant reed may rank among the most prolific water using weeds in the world the general reduction in evapotranspiration et observed from 2014 to 2015 is not easily explained by interannual variations in weather conditions as the 2015 growing season was wetter than the 2014 growing season and air temperature was similar while observed increases in arundo wasp population from 2014 to 2015 in the study area most likely contributed to reductions in et in 2015 further investigations are needed to compare changes in et with both the population of arundo wasp and associated damage to the weed however our preliminary results suggest that management of invasive plants such as giant reed can lead to significant conservation of water resources in arid regions like south texas and the bi national rio grande basin as we continue to see the reduction in dominance of this non native weed and the passive restoration in these areas long term studies of water use of giant reed using eddy covariance systems can allow for a more detailed analysis of how et in giant reed dominated areas is affected by both abiotic and biotic factors and how these et rates change as these systems transition to native vegetation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

2015 received 67 above average rainfall similarly cumulative rainfall during the active growing season may to october of giant reed was 188 and 264 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively average temperatures for this period closely followed 30 year averages average daily temperatures peaked in august 31 c in both years monthly mean daily average temperatures from may to october were similar in both years with no more than 1 2 c difference in any months fig s1 3 2 energy balance closure energy balance closure ebc was used to test the quality of data collected from eddy covariance measurements using a linear regression of the sum of half hourly values of turbulent fluxes h and le vs the available energy rn g the ebc was calculated for both 2014 august october and 2015 fig 2 we did not have all energy balance components before august 2014 for both the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the ebc slope of the regression line was 0 82 indicating that the measured turbulent fluxes h le accounted for 82 of the available energy rn g the ebc of 0 82 in this study falls well within the typical range of eddy covariance experiments and co2 flux networks which is about 0 80 aubinet et al 1999 wilson et al 2002 due to potential errors in the ebc caused by the mismatch of footprints for rn g i e point measurements near eddy covariance systems and h le i e aggregated fluxes for the entire upwind area we did not attempt to close the surface energy balance wagle et al 2021 3 3 energy partitioning peak diurnal values monthly average of le and h fluxes in eagle pass texas across the peak growing season may october are shown in figure 3 the le dominated throughout giant reed s growing season in 2014 showing a peak growth in july 2014 in 2015 le was the dominant turbulent flux in the beginning of the peak growing season may july however h increased substantially during august and september following the reductions in vegetative growth this is consistent with findings from other studies that link energy partitioning to vegetative growth or plant phenology wagle et al 2016 figure 3 shows a reduction of le during the months of may july 2015 coinciding with an increase in the density of arundo wasp consecutive rainfall events and warming temperatures that associated with arundo wasp activity moran and goolsby 2009 racelis et al 2009 3 4 seasonal patterns and magnitudes of et as depicted in figure 3a there is a noticeable decrease in et from 2014 to 2015 during the peak growing season the maximum et rates were 7 7 and 6 07 mm day 1 during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively monthly et was higher in each month of the growing season from may to october in 2014 than in 2015 fig 4 as a result seasonal doy 121 304 et was significantly higher in 2014 842 mm than in 2015 625 mm the observed maximum et during this study of 7 7 mm day 1 is comparable to et values reported in major productive agricultural and natural ecosystems in the southcentral u s 6 7 mm day 1 for high biomass sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and 6 2 mm day 1 for switchgrass panicum virgatum l wagle et al 2016 and 8 3 mm day 1 for johnson grass sorghum halepense l pers wagle et al 2020 in south central oklahoma 7 mm day 1 for wheat triticum aestivum l in north central oklahoma burba and verma 2005 7 5 mm day 1 for irrigated maize and soybean glycine max l in nebraska suyker and verma 2008 wagle et al 2016 6 6 mm day 1 for native prairie at konza prairie in kansas verma et al 1992 and 6 5 and 7 3 mm day 1 for irrigated grain sorghum and maize respectively in bushland texas wagle et al 2018 logically et should have increased in 2015 since the site received higher rainfall that year fig 4b consistent with the findings of watts et al 2011 that water use of giant reed increases during periods of high rainfall air temperature was also similar in both growing seasons figs s1 and 4b since air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd are tightly correlated i e increase or decrease together to each other vpd could not be a limiting factor for et during the wetter growing season of 2015 however our results showed the opposite result i e smaller magnitudes of et in 2015 than in 2014 figs 4a and 5 as et is known to be strongly correlated with precipitation our results suggest that the difference in the magnitudes of et between the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons was not caused by differences in weather conditions between years based on the accumulated degree days model spencer et al 2006 demonstrated that phenology of giant reed was closely related with temperature there was no difference in degree day accumulation for eagle pass texas from 2014 and 2015 fig s2 projecting that giant reed growth is maximized during doy 121 304 consistent with its high demand for water during this high growth period as a highly managed riparian area riverbank areas along the rio grande that are dominated by giant reed often experience minor periodic flooding via releases of water for agriculture or municipal needs or through minor storm events that raise the water table and provide excess water resources for giant reed an isotopic study by moore et al 2015 suggested that the dominant source of water used by giant reed was not tapping deeply into the water table but rather from flooding events thus demonstrating the efficiency of giant reed to use ground water and retain it over long periods of time the overall increase in precipitation and reduction in et in 2015 as depicted in figure 4 illustrated that neither precipitation nor climate accounted for the interannual variation of et 3 5 population dynamics of a biological control agent and its influence on biomass production and et previous studies suggested that herbivory associated with the arundo wasp effectively reduced rates of leaf level physiological processes in giant reed moore et al 2010 watts and moore 2011 the plant level effect of the wasp increased with density effectively reducing photosynthesis by moderating co2 fixation moore et al 2010 the galling associated with the arundo wasps were nutrient sinks raman et al 2005 effectively decreasing arundo leaf size and increasing the formation of lateral shoots and ultimately reducing overall growth rates goolsby et al 2009 at this site we found a general increase in populations of the stem galling wasp from 2014 to 2015 fig 6 although there were no significant differences found between years in the average number of wasps captured each month there was a considerable increase in the number of wasps captured during the months of may june and july the peak growing season of giant reed in 2015 where we recorded an increase in wasps of 28 6 53 5 and 44 respectively the proliferation of the arundo wasp is not unique to this site goolsby et al 2016 but its increased abundance may explain in part this reduction in et from 2014 to 2015 watts and moore 2011 found that in high densities the galls induced by the arundo wasp can have a significant impact on et of giant reed by moderating the movement of water in plant phloem it is possible that generally higher population levels of the arundo wasp found in 2015 reduced the ability of the plant to uptake and move water in its tissues resulting in reduced et rates during the 2015 growing season fig 4a the association between an increase in arundo wasps and a decrease in et presented in this study warrants further long term study especially since the population increases of this biocontrol agent has been documented across the state of texas and in northern mexico goolsby et al 2014 studies conducted before and 7 years after the permitted release of the arundo wasp documented an impact on both dominance and competitiveness of giant reed goolsby et al 2016 found significant reductions in above ground biomass correlated with increases in the density of the arundo wasp and this impact was strongly associated with an increase of native and non giant reed plant diversity across multiple sites along the rio grande river moran et al 2017 martinez jimenez et al 2017 4 conclusions this study presents the first continuous field scale measurement of water use of giant reed using the eddy covariance technique results indicate that giant reed may rank among the most prolific water using weeds in the world the general reduction in evapotranspiration et observed from 2014 to 2015 is not easily explained by interannual variations in weather conditions as the 2015 growing season was wetter than the 2014 growing season and air temperature was similar while observed increases in arundo wasp population from 2014 to 2015 in the study area most likely contributed to reductions in et in 2015 further investigations are needed to compare changes in et with both the population of arundo wasp and associated damage to the weed however our preliminary results suggest that management of invasive plants such as giant reed can lead to significant conservation of water resources in arid regions like south texas and the bi national rio grande basin as we continue to see the reduction in dominance of this non native weed and the passive restoration in these areas long term studies of water use of giant reed using eddy covariance systems can allow for a more detailed analysis of how et in giant reed dominated areas is affected by both abiotic and biotic factors and how these et rates change as these systems transition to native vegetation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
