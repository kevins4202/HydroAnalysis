19035,dissolved carbon dc is a critical component of the global carbon c cycle dc transport occurs through water driven erosion and infiltration during rain storms to explore the specific role of dc flux in topsoil c pool dynamics during rainfall events and predict the trend of ratios of lateral versus vertical dc efflux from topsoil in a vegetation restoration area we measured the major dc fluxes at four runoff plots during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape on the chinese loess plateau the results show that topsoil vertical dc efflux into deep soil layers accounted for approximately 98 7 1 0 of the total dissolved carbon efflux in plots with vegetation versus 95 3 in a plot without vegetation the carbon sequestration capacity of the top soil would be underestimated by up to 38 5 if the vertical dc efflux was omitted the ratios of lateral versus vertical dc efflux tended to increase with rainfall intensity the results of this study improve understanding of the carbon cycle processes during rainfall events in general and estimation of carbon sequestration rates in vegetation restoration regions such as the chinese loess plateau in particular graphical

component of the global carbon c cycle it is a potential source of both co2 and the stabilized c present in subsoil kalbitz and kaiser 2008 van hees et al 2005 although a comparatively small fraction of the soil carbon sc pool 10 dc transport is a good pathway between the terrestrial and components of the aquatic c cycle and operates at scales from the local jansen et al 2014 to the global regnier et al 2013 the dc fluxes induced by rain storms in an eroding soil landscape can be divided into two forms lateral dc flux including c flux by runoff and vertical dc flux including c fluxes by infiltration and rainfall gerke et al 2016 showed that hydrological paths and fluxes greatly affect the dc fluxes in a catchment suffering water driven erosion jacinthe et al 2004 reported 29 35 of c transported in runoff has the potential to be mineralized the mineralizable c in runoff and deposition sediment are mostly labile carbon especially for dissolved organic carbon doc lal 2003 using s simulated rainfall experiment jin et al 2010 have shown that the positive relationship between soil c loss and surface runoff and sediment yield is mainly due to the solubility characteristics of soil organic carbon soc while a large amount of studies have focused on the dynamics of mineral associated carbon mc and particulate carbon pc fluxes during soil redistribution lal 2003 van oost et al 2007 few studies have researched the link between erosion and dc fluxes doetterl et al 2016 in addition most studies brye et al 2001 kindler et al 2011 on dc export from soil have been carried out in forested ecosystems which are mostly not subject to erosion the number of studies on lateral dc fluxes in an eroding soil landscape is thus rather limited the dc flux by infiltration or leaching also leads to topsoil c loss dlugoβ et al 2012 rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 leaching of dc increases the terrestrial c storage and plays an important role in c sequestration dlugoβ et al 2012 rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 however there is little existing data on the vertical distribution of dc or on the vertical dc flux through the soil profile of an eroding soil landscape chaplot and poesen 2012 zhang et al 2006 distinguishing between lateral and vertical dc fluxes is still a crucial step when considering the effect of soil erosion on dc flux the influencing factors related to runoff and infiltration like rainfall characteristics rainfall duration soil properties topography vegetation cover soil water content etc affect the dc fluxes greatly foster and wischmeier 1974 nearing et al 2005 for example the doc concentration in the surface runoff of one study changed with rainfall duration and rainfall intensity ma et al 2014 polyakov and lal 2004 found that doc concentration in surface runoff decreased with increasing rainfall duration rainfall intensity had a larger effect on lateral doc transport than vertical doc the lateral doc export reached a maximum level under high intensity rainfall but the vertical doc reached a maximum under low intensity rainfall in the control plot of tillage treatment ma et al 2014 soil water content affected the doc concentrations significantly higher doc concentrations at higher water contents found in soil water content curves was consistent with previous studies falkengrengrerup and tyler 1993 in many cases doetterl et al 2016 anaerobic conditions induced by soil water saturation also accelerated the doc release from soils with the soil surface becoming sealed after water driven erosion wischmeier and mannering 1969 fiedler and kalbitz 2003 analyzed the relationship between doc concentration and redox conditions they found doc concentrations were lowest in aerobic soil and highest in highly anaerobic soil fluxes of dc have been the most important biophysical c flux in ecological restoration areas like the chinese loess plateau the increased vegetation cover due to grain for green project has substantially reduced soil erosion in the region fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 under the grain for green project the average fractional vegetation coverage fvc on the chinese loess plateau increased from about 56 in 1999 to nearly 60 in 2010 fu et al 2017 the fvc on more than 90 of the total area of the chinese loess plateau increased considerably especially in areas with initially low coverage xin et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 lü et al 2012 evaluated the decrease in regional water yield after the implementation of the grain for green project and an estimate of 10 3 mm yr 1 was found across the whole loess plateau between 2002 and 2008 feng et al 2012 this change in the hydrology fluxes affected the dc dynamics during each rainfall event the division of lateral and vertical dc fluxes during water driven erosion was expected to have changed as a consequence however the lack of observation data on the dc fluxes in the vegetation restoration area limited our study and thus did not provide an understanding of the dc dynamics during rain storms after the changing of an underlying surface induced by water driven erosion the purpose of our study was to investigate the relationship between lateral and vertical dc flux from topsoil in an eroding soil landscape in a vegetation restoration area and to predict the trend of division of lateral and vertical dc effluxes from topsoil on the loess plateau we address the research questions 1 what is the role of dc flux in topsoil c pool dynamics and 2 how much lateral versus vertical dc effluxes occur from topsoil in a vegetation restoration area like the chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the yangjuangou catchment 36 42 n and 109 31 e in yan an city of shaanxi province china the catchment is 2 02 km2 and ranges in elevation ranging from 1050 to 1298 m the soil is calcaric cambisol typically with uniform texture and weak structure li et al 2003 table 1 this hill and gully landscape gully density is 2 74 km km 2 one of the typical landscapes on the chinese loess plateau is notorious for soil erosion due to high soil erodibility widespread vegetation destruction and intensive cultivation it has been designated as a typical vegetation restoration area in china particularly with the implementation of the grain for green project since 1999 fu et al 2017 the regional climate is semiarid with a mean annual air temperature and precipitation of 9 8 0 8 c and 531 0 mm respectively the growing season is from may to september and the average growing season precipitation is 422 mm accounting for 79 of the annual precipitation jiao et al 2016 2 2 measurement and collection of samples to measure the impacts of vegetation restoration on the hillslope hydrology and biogeochemical cycles four runoff plots were set up on a slope of about 20 three of the vegetated plots were respectively with cover fig 1 of robinia pseudoacacia 2 10 m spiraea salicifolia 2 10 m stipa bungeana community 3 10 m and a plot with bare soil was the control 3 10 m table 1 these runoff plots are named a s h and ck respectively to separate the sediment yield and surface runoff in and out of the plots polyvinyl chloride pvc boards were inserted into the soil 500 mm deep as the boundary of the plots a u shaped pvc runoff gathering pit was installed to transfer the surface runoff to a collecting bucket at the bottom edge of each runoff plot a total of 19 rainfall events numbered from 1 to 19 sequentially by date were recorded between june through october in 2016 nine rainfall events and 2017 ten rainfall events after each rainfall event the surface runoff volume r was measured and the runoff accumulated in buckets was collected in 250 ml plastic bottles the water samples were then chilled at 4 c in a refrigerator and transported to the laboratory for measuring the dissolved carbon concentration in runoff dccr jacinthe et al 2004 liu and sheu 2003 this dccr includes both the dissolved organic carbon concentration doccr and the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration diccr one set of rain gauges was installed in each plot that had no rainfall

rings slip over the folded neoprene tubing to seal the sampler an extraction kit is required for sample retrieval and a vacuum pump is required to evacuate the sampler the soil water sampler designed for near surface installation was installed at 50 mm soil depth in our study two soil water samplers were installed in each plot one was 2 5 m and the other 7 5 m from the top edge of the plot the collected infiltration water samples were bottled and kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for later measurement of the dissolved carbon concentration of the infiltration water dcci including the dissolved organic carbon concentration docci and the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration dicci 2 3 laboratory analysis laboratory analysis was conducted at the state key laboratory of urban and regional ecology research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences the dccp dccr and dcci were estimated using a vario toc analyzer filtered samples through filter membrane of 0 45 μm bore diameter were analyzed immediately after sampling or in the event of a backlog refrigerated at 4 c until analysis could proceed standard solutions of 0 10 50 and 100 ppm of c were made using 0 1

instrument was dissolved carbon concentration dcc and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration dicc the dissolved organic carbon concentration docc was estimated as the difference of dcc and dicc 2 4 data analyses statistical analysis was performed using spss 21 0 for windows linear regression analysis were used to analyze the relationship between dissolved carbon input fluxes by rainfall and rainfall throughfall amount the ratios of the lateral versus the vertical dc effluxes from topsoil and rainfall intensity and the ratios of the lateral versus the vertical dc effluxes from topsoil and antecedent soil water content statistical significance tests of the results were evaluated at α 0 05 the infiltration volume i below 50 mm depth in each plot was calculated through the water balance

hydrological fluxes during water driven erosion the hydrological fluxes during water driven erosion are listed in fig 2 the total rainfall during the observation period was 254 1 mm and 331 1 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively rainfall intensity ranged from to 0 9 12 5 mm h 1 the largest rainfall 76 7 mm occurred in rainfall event 16 23 august 2017 while the smallest 2 8 mm occurred in rainfall event 19 22 september 2017 the rainfall interception was 26 13 in plot a and 45 16 in plot s vegetation greatly reduced surface runoff the reduction was 80 4 15 6 88 1 14 5 and 90 2 9 5 in plots a s and h respectively compared with that in ck the surface runoff in each plot was relatively small compared to rainfall throughfall it amounted to 1 1 1 5 1 0 1 7 0 5 0 8 and 4 3 6 0 of rainfall throughfall in plots a s h and ck respectively compared to rainfall throughfall most of water infiltrated from the topsoil layer 0 50 mm to the deeper soil layer the infiltration amounted to 91 6 9 0 91 7 7 5 90 5 6 9 and 85 3 9 4 of rainfall throughfall in plots a s h and ck respectively these figures illustrate that the vegetation cover resulted in a considerable decreas in the proportion of surface runoff and increased in the proportion of infiltration 3 2 topsoil dissolved carbon fluxes 3 2 1 topsoil dissolved carbon input flux by rainfall the relationships between the rainfall throughfall amount and the dc input fluxes are shown in fig 3 the dissolved organic carbon input fluxes by rainfall docp all tended to increase with the rainfall throughfall amount in each plot the relationships table 2 between docp and rainfall throughfall amount were all extremely significant p 0 01 the closest relationship occurred in plot s however the relationship between the dissolved inorganic carbon input fluxes by rainfall dicp and the rainfall throughfall amount was not significant for plot s table 2 fig 3d shows that the total dissolved carbon input flux by rainfall tdcp was the most in plot a 2 45 g m 2 in 2016 3 09 g m 2 in 2017 while it was the least in plot s 1 65 g m 2 in 2016 1 16 g m 2 in 2017 the tdcp in 2016 was more than that in 2017 except for plot a the organic tdcp was much more than inorganic tdcp 3 2 2 total dissolved carbon effluxes from topsoil the total dissolved carbon efflux from topsoil tdce can be divided into two forms lateral tdce total dissolved carbon flux by runoff tdcr and vertical tdce total dissolved carbon flux by infiltration tdci the vertical tdce were mainly in the form of doc fig 4 b and c the vertical tdce in plots a and s were less than that in the plot ck in both 2016 and 2017 the reductions compared to plot ck for vertical organic tdce from topsoil were 19 7 and 27 8 in plots a and s in 2016 and 31 9 and 47 5 in 2017 respectively for vertical inorganic tdce the reductions compared to plot ck were 27 6 and 14 1 in plots a and s in 2016 and 10 1 and 35 3 in 2017 respectively it can be seen that the reductions in 2016 were less than those in 2017 the main reason for the yearly differences in reduction was the different amounts of the rain falling in the two years in the different plots with vegetation the vertical tdce changed greatly the least amount of vertical tdce occurred in plot s during both 2016 and 2017 followed by plots a and h the lateral organic tdce were much more than the lateral inorganic tdce in all of the plots meaning that lateral organic tdce was the main form of lateral tdce the lateral tdce in plot ck was much more than that in the plots with vegetation fig 4 the vegetation cover reduced the lateral organic tdce by 66 5 74 4 and 82 2 in plots a s and h in 2016 and by 77 7 89 8 and 90 8 in 2017 respectively the lateral inorganic tdce in plots a s and h were reduced by 67 2 83 7 and 89 5 in 2016 and by 61 7 87 4 and 88 2 in 2017 respectively compared to plot ck the reduction in 2017 was more than that in 2016 perhaps a result of the higher rainfall amount in 2017 than 2016 the differences in reduction were also caused by the different vegetation cover in each plot the least reduction occurred in plot a and most reduction occurred in plot h this means that out of all the vegetation types the herbaceous had the most effect on the lateral tdce 3 2 3 total net dissolved carbon fluxes the total net dc fluxes were carbon losses from topsoil in each of the plots the total net doc fluxes were more than the total net dic fluxes the total net doc fluxes in 2017 20 3 6 3 g m 2 were more than in 2016 16 7 3 1 g m 2 the total net dic fluxes had a similar trend to the total net doc fluxes 6 5 1 2 g m 2 in 2017 3 5 0 6 g m 2 in 2016 the total net dc fluxes in the plots with vegetation were less than that in the plot without vegetation in the plots with vegetation plot h had the most total net dc fluxes followed by plots a and s the total net dc fluxes in 2017 were more than in 2016 3 3 partitioning of the total dissolved carbon effluxes from topsoil it can be seen that the fraction of lateral tdce in total tdce was small compared to the fraction of vertical tdce fig 4 in the plots with vegetation the lateral organic tdce occupied 2 3 0 9 of tdce in 2016 and 0 8 0 4 in 2017 in addition lateral inorganic tdce accounted for 1 0 0 7 of tdce in 2016 and 0 3 0 1 in 2017 the lateral tdce varied greatly with the different vegetation cover the percentage of lateral tdce in tdce in the plots with vegetation was highest in plot a and least in plot h the differences in the percentage of lateral tdce between plots with and without vegetation organic tdce 6 9 in 2016 and 3 5 in 2017 inorganic tdce 3 7 in 2016 and 1 0 in 2017 showed that the vegetation cover reduced the fraction of lateral tdce and increased the fraction of vertical tdce the percentage of lateral tdce in total tdce in 2016 was more than that in 2017 in addition the arboreal vegetation had the effect of reducing the contribution of vertical tdce to tdce and the herbaceous vegetation had the effect of reducing the contribution of lateral tdce to tdce 3 4 the ratio of lateral versus vertical dissolved carbon effluxes from topsoil the ratios of the lateral versus the vertical dc effluxes from topsoil l v during each rainfall event are listed in fig 5 it can be seen that the ratios in different plots all tended to increase with rainfall intensity the ratios in the plot without vegetation were generally higher than those in the plots with vegetation in the plots with vegetation the average ratios in plot h organic carbon 0 007 0 012 inorganic carbon 0 003 0 005 were the lowest and the average ratios in plot a organic carbon 0 017 0 026 inorganic carbon 0 009 0 012 were the highest on average however the ratios of l v changed greatly under different rainfall events the ratios of l v were affected by antecedent soil water content swcb in the text and they tended to increase with antecedent soil water content fig 6 the relationship between the ratios of l v and the antecedent soil water content was not significant p 0 05 in any of the plots 4 discussion 4 1 the role of dissolved carbon fluxes in a vegetation restoration area estimates of the dc fluxes ranged from 1 to 10 g c m 2 y 2 for many ecosystems brye et al 2001 kindler et al 2011 neff and asner 2001 compared to c fluxes associated with primary productivity or heterotrophic respiration in terrestrial systems dc fluxes is a relatively small fraction and generally not considered important kalbitz and kaiser 2008 schimel 1995 however this and previous studies have shown that the important role of dc flux played in ecosystems cannot be ignored for several reasons 1 dc flux is a vector for the loss of c from topsoil kindler et al 2011 and 2 dc flux is an important source of organic matter in subsoils rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 which can be substantial for carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level the dc input flux by rainfall in topsoil was relatively small compared to the dce the differences in carbon input fluxes were caused by the vegetation cover the rainfall interception varied with vegetation cover cook et al 2006 shachnovich et al 2008 leaf washing different volumes of rainfall and leaching resulted in the changes of dcc between throughfall and rainfall liu and sheu 2003 which causing the associated changes of dccp in different runoff plot fig 7 according to the overlap and similar trends of carbon fluxes hydrological fluxes and carbon concentration in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that the hydrological flux rainfall throughfall made a greater contribution than dccp to affect the dcp doetterl et al 2016 also found that dc fluxes are closely associated with the magnitude of water flow different fvc and community function and structure in the different plots table 1 changed the rainfall throughfall the dcp will also be changed correspondingly the reduction of dce in the plots with vegetation compared to that in the plot without vegetation has been widely observed in the study area vegetation cover can reduce surface runoff li et al 2015 marques et al 2007 in the plots with vegetation the surface runoff was reduced in comparison to plot ck fig 2 as dc fluxes are closely associated with the magnitude of water flow the lateral dce decreased with the corresponding reduced surface runoff jacinthe et al 2004 from the water balance equation applied to rainfall events the infiltration will increase as the surface runoff decreases plot h li et al 2015 however in plots a and s the rainfall interception by the canopy reduced the infiltration compared to plot ck fig 2 community functional composition and structure play an important role in reducing surface runoff in semi arid restored areas zhu et al 2015 the vertical dce in plots a and s was reduced with a corresponding reduced infiltration volume the differences between plots a and s were caused by the different community functional compositions and structures within them table 1 however the vertical dce was less in plot h than it was in plot ck although the infiltration in plot h was more than it was in plot ck the dcci in plot h docci 84 7 12 8 mg l 1 dicci 18 7 5 5 mg l 1 was less than that in plot ck docci 95 5 16 6 mg l 1 dicci 23 8 6 8 mg l 1 and this was the main reason that the vertical tdce in plot h was less than that in plot ck the dcci was affected by soil water content soil ph infiltration volume etc ma et al 2014 michalzik et al 2001 the different conditions caused by vegetation cover may be the reason for the lower dcci in the plots with vegetation in a vegetation restoration area the surface runoff becomes less and less during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape fu et al 2017 as a consequence the portion of vertical dce increases with reduced lateral dce compared to bare soil in the study area the vertical dce accounted for more and more of the dce and its contribution will continue to become more important as vegetation restoration continues in the future vertical dce is not only a c loss from topsoil but also a c input for the deeper soil layers rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 dc transport has mainly been studied in temperate forest soils michalzik et al 2001 and has been thought to be the main source of subsoil organic carbon under such conditions kaiser and guggenberger 2000 as the percentage of the vertical dce in the csr was large 63 13 in our study vertical dce may play a critical role in soil carbon sequestration in a vegetation restoration area on the other hand the vegetation cover is good for carbon fixing for the increased portion of vertical dce from topsoil in vegetation restoration areas the ecosystem of the chinese loess plateau transformed from a net carbon source in 2000 to a net carbon sink in 2008 this change was mainly a result of the increased net primary productivity npp following the vegetation restoration feng et al 2013 however the reduction of lateral dce and increased portion of vertical dce compared to bare soil may be another important reason 4 2 a potentially underestimated carbon sequestration capacity induced by the topsoil vertical dissolved carbon efflux estimates of csr are typically estimated by measuring changes in the carbon storage of topsoil layers deng et al 2017 wang et al 2011b the dc fluxes in soil layers particularly dc percolation from topsoil to deeper soil layers were not considered in the estimation of carbon sequestration due to challenges in direct measurement doetterl et al 2016 lal 2003 yue et al 2016 through the partitioning of the tdce our study clearly shows that the topsoil vertical tdce accounting for 98 7 1 0 of the tdce was the main dce in our vegetation restoration area the topsoil vertical tdce occupied 59 4 11 0 in 2016 and 66 7 15 5 in 2017 of the csr on average the vertical tdce from topsoil to the deep soil layers was so large that it cannot be ignored the fate of infiltrated c from topsoil to deeper soil layers is not certain it is likely some of the infiltrated c materials would be decomposed by mineralization as they move down the soil profile deng et al 2014a neff and asner 2001 and some may be drained out by base flow on the other hand it is still possible that some of the infiltrated c might be retained and protected from decomposition in the deeper soil layers ma et al 2014 rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 on the basis of the above processes the actual carbon sequestration rate csra 46 8 g c m 2 yr 1 in plot a 43 7 g c m 2 yr 1 in plot s 51 3 g c m 2 yr 1 in plot h in the study area could be the sum of the csr and the vertical tdce from topsoil if 1 all the infiltrated c is protected from decomposition in the deep layers and 2 the dynamic replacement hypothesis of c in the topsoil layer harden et al 1999 stallard 1998 holds as an important source of subsoil c the vertical dce should be included in the calculation of the carbon sequestration capacity rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 the c sequestration capacity in the vegetation restoration area might be underestimated by up to 37 1 4 2 in 2016 and 39 7 5 6 in 2017 in the plots with vegetation if the vertical tdce from topsoil to subsoil was not factored into the estimates osher et al 2003 also observed some of the photosynthesis generated c3 molecules in the subsoil layers that had been lost from surface horizons this provides supporting evidence that the carbon flux from topsoil to subsoil exists without measuring and tabulating the c accumulated in the subsoil horizons lost from topsoil we would have overestimated the loss of c due to microbial degradation and underestimated the c sequestration capacity 4 3 the trend of dissolved carbon loss from soil on the chinese loess plateau the ratios of l v can help us predict the amount of dc loss from soils on the chinese loess plateau an important area undergone vegetation restoration fu et al 2017 as the dc fluxes were closely associated with water flow doetterl et al 2016 the ratios of l v could also be closely related to the hydrological fluxes including surface runoff and infiltration during rainfall events in the eroding soil landscape it can be verified that these hydrological fluxes were actually the main factor affecting the dc fluxes see fig 8 the carbon concentration in the hydrological fluxes made a smaller contribution to the dynamics of dc fluxes than the hydrological fluxes themselves with an increase of rainfall intensity the surface runoff increases which agrees with previous observations chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 ziadat and taimeh 2013 suggesting the existence of the infiltration limited runoff generation mechanism in the region the loess is believed to have a rather loose structure with adequate water infiltration capacity that should promote a water storage limited runoff generation mechanism liu 1985 the appearance of infiltration limited runoff generation under high rainfall intensity has important implications for future dc fluxes more surface runoff therefore more lateral dc efflux would be generated under future climate regimes in some regions of the loess plateau where storms are expected to intensify dawson and smith 2007 müller nedebock and chaplot 2015 the differences between the plots with and without vegetation elucidated how the role of vegetation cover affected the ratios of l v the vegetation cover will protect the soil aggregate from break down during soil erosion and prevent soil sealing which can reduce the surface runoff and increase the infiltration mohammad and adam 2010 puigdefábregas 2005 víctor hugo durán zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 however the canopy of shrubs and trees can also intercept rainfall shachnovich et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 which may reduce the infiltration these findings are closely associated with hydrological fluxes for these reasons the affected ratios of l v in soil with vegetation cover were and generally lower than those for bare soil on the other hand the vegetation type will also influence the ratios of l v much the highest average ratios of l v occurred in arboreal plot a it was for the low fvc that induced the most runoff among the plots with vegetation cover in addition the rainfall interception in arboreal plot was moderate for its low fvc among the plots with vegetation cover these combined effects made the highest average ratios of l v occur in the arboreal plot the lowest average ratios of l v occurred in the herbage plot h the main reason was for its highest infiltration there was no rainfall interception by canopy that making the infiltration in shrub plot s much more than that in herbage that resulted in the lower ratios of l v in herbage than shrub which make the lowest ratios of l v in herbage plot among the plots with vegetation cover on the chinese loess plateau the most significant climate change in the holocene was a progressive drying and more frequently years of drought fu et al 2017 various climate change patterns have been observed in recent decades across the loess plateau for example the precipitation decreased from 1961 to 2010 at a rate of 11 03 13 mm per decade with large spatial variations sun et al 2015 rainfall amount frequency and intensity all decreased in about 38 of the whole area while in another approximately 37 of the area the rainfall amount and frequency deceased but intensity increased fu et al 2017 the changes in rainfall intensity would induce changes in surface runoff generation as shown previously and in ratios of l v see fig 5 increasing rainfall intensity in an eroding landscape means higher ratios of l v or more surface runoff during rainfall events in the future than before one the contrary decreasing rainfall intensity in some regions would produce lower ratios of l v and less surface runoff in the future higher ratios of l v mean higher proportions of dc would be lost from the terrestrial ecosystems via lateral movement which would decrease carbon sequestration in the whole terrestrial ecosystem lower ratios of l v would promote soil carbon sequestration naturally on site vegetation restoration efforts such as the grain for green project implemented since 1999 have increased and will continue to increase vegetation coverage in the study area improving vegetation conditions will alter various hydrological processes including increasing rainfall interception increasing evapotranspiration improving the infiltration rate and reducing surface runoff wang et al 2011a it was observed that more than half of the vegetation restoration area northeast to southwest of the loess plateau experienced a decrease of 2 37 mm yr 1 in surface runoff the ratios of l v were generally lower under improved vegetation conditions implying that the corresponding lateral dce from topsoil would decrease and more dc would infiltrate into the soil with increased infiltration in the future some of the infiltrated carbon that is not decomposed would accumulate in deep soil layers ma et al 2014 facilitating soil carbon sequestration the above analysis reveals the emergence of two opposing forces at least in some regions of the loess plateau on the one hand the widespread continuous vegetation improvement in the region would alter the hydrological cycle and reduce future lateral dce on the other hand the projected intensified rain storms at least in certain subregions will promote runoff generation and lateral dce how these two opposing forces play out in determining the hydrological carbon fluxes is still an open question apparently answering this question properly needs a long term observation network in the field particularly in the vegetation restoration areas as there is a large amount of complexity associated with dc flux dynamics in terrestrial systems more field observations and integrated analysis are needed to unravel that complexity including nonlinear responses of the dc fluxes to rainfall characteristics climate and vegetation restoration 5 conclusions we observed various topsoil dc fluxes in the field over two growing seasons to better understand the role of dc fluxes in topsoil carbon pool dynamics and predict the trend in the ratios of l v in the loess plateau and led to three major findings first vertical dce from topsoil was the most important dce it accounted for approximately 98 7 1 0 of the total dc effluxes second it is important to consider the topsoil dc fluxes in the estimation of soil carbon sequestration capacity as it may be underestimated by up to 38 5 otherwise the vertical dc flux is a c loss from the topsoil layer but at the same time a gain at the ecosystem level as it might not be lost after entering deep layers third the ratios of lateral compared to vertical dissolved carbon efflux from topsoil tend to increase with rainfall intensity our research provides information on the magnitude of dissolved carbon fluxes during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape under various vegetations this information is valuable for improving understanding the carbon cycle processes in general and

19035,dissolved carbon dc is a critical component of the global carbon c cycle dc transport occurs through water driven erosion and infiltration during rain storms to explore the specific role of dc flux in topsoil c pool dynamics during rainfall events and predict the trend of ratios of lateral versus vertical dc efflux from topsoil in a vegetation restoration area we measured the major dc fluxes at four runoff plots during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape on the chinese loess plateau the results show that topsoil vertical dc efflux into deep soil layers accounted for approximately 98 7 1 0 of the total dissolved carbon efflux in plots with vegetation versus 95 3 in a plot without vegetation the carbon sequestration capacity of the top soil would be underestimated by up to 38 5 if the vertical dc efflux was omitted the ratios of lateral versus vertical dc efflux tended to increase with rainfall intensity the results of this study improve understanding of the carbon cycle processes during rainfall events in general and estimation of carbon sequestration rates in vegetation restoration regions such as the chinese loess plateau in particular graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved carbon flux rainfall events soil carbon sequestration vegetation restoration water driven erosion soil carbon loss 1 introduction dissolved carbon dc is a critical component of the global carbon c cycle it is a potential source of both co2 and the stabilized c present in subsoil kalbitz and kaiser 2008 van hees et al 2005 although a comparatively small fraction of the soil carbon sc pool 10 dc transport is a good pathway between the terrestrial and components of the aquatic c cycle and operates at scales from the local jansen et al 2014 to the global regnier et al 2013 the dc fluxes induced by rain storms in an eroding soil landscape can be divided into two forms lateral dc flux including c flux by runoff and vertical dc flux including c fluxes by infiltration and rainfall gerke et al 2016 showed that hydrological paths and fluxes greatly affect the dc fluxes in a catchment suffering water driven erosion jacinthe et al 2004 reported 29 35 of c transported in runoff has the potential to be mineralized the mineralizable c in runoff and deposition sediment are mostly labile carbon especially for dissolved organic carbon doc lal 2003 using s simulated rainfall experiment jin et al 2010 have shown that the positive relationship between soil c loss and surface runoff and sediment yield is mainly due to the solubility characteristics of soil organic carbon soc while a large amount of studies have focused on the dynamics of mineral associated carbon mc and particulate carbon pc fluxes during soil redistribution lal 2003 van oost et al 2007 few studies have researched the link between erosion and dc fluxes doetterl et al 2016 in addition most studies brye et al 2001 kindler et al 2011 on dc export from soil have been carried out in forested ecosystems which are mostly not subject to erosion the number of studies on lateral dc fluxes in an eroding soil landscape is thus rather limited the dc flux by infiltration or leaching also leads to topsoil c loss dlugoβ et al 2012 rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 leaching of dc increases the terrestrial c storage and plays an important role in c sequestration dlugoβ et al 2012 rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 however there is little existing data on the vertical distribution of dc or on the vertical dc flux through the soil profile of an eroding soil landscape chaplot and poesen 2012 zhang et al 2006 distinguishing between lateral and vertical dc fluxes is still a crucial step when considering the effect of soil erosion on dc flux the influencing factors related to runoff and infiltration like rainfall characteristics rainfall duration soil properties topography vegetation cover soil water content etc affect the dc fluxes greatly foster and wischmeier 1974 nearing et al 2005 for example the doc concentration in the surface runoff of one study changed with rainfall duration and rainfall intensity ma et al 2014 polyakov and lal 2004 found that doc concentration in surface runoff decreased with increasing rainfall duration rainfall intensity had a larger effect on lateral doc transport than vertical doc the lateral doc export reached a maximum level under high intensity rainfall but the vertical doc reached a maximum under low intensity rainfall in the control plot of tillage treatment ma et al 2014 soil water content affected the doc concentrations significantly higher doc concentrations at higher water contents found in soil water content curves was consistent with previous studies falkengrengrerup and tyler 1993 in many cases doetterl et al 2016 anaerobic conditions induced by soil water saturation also accelerated the doc release from soils with the soil surface becoming sealed after water driven erosion wischmeier and mannering 1969 fiedler and kalbitz 2003 analyzed the relationship between doc concentration and redox conditions they found doc concentrations were lowest in aerobic soil and highest in highly anaerobic soil fluxes of dc have been the most important biophysical c flux in ecological restoration areas like the chinese loess plateau the increased vegetation cover due to grain for green project has substantially reduced soil erosion in the region fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 under the grain for green project the average fractional vegetation coverage fvc on the chinese loess plateau increased from about 56 in 1999 to nearly 60 in 2010 fu et al 2017 the fvc on more than 90 of the total area of the chinese loess plateau increased considerably especially in areas with initially low coverage xin et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 lü et al 2012 evaluated the decrease in regional water yield after the implementation of the grain for green project and an estimate of 10 3 mm yr 1 was found across the whole loess plateau between 2002 and 2008 feng et al 2012 this change in the hydrology fluxes affected the dc dynamics during each rainfall event the division of lateral and vertical dc fluxes during water driven erosion was expected to have changed as a consequence however the lack of observation data on the dc fluxes in the vegetation restoration area limited our study and thus did not provide an understanding of the dc dynamics during rain storms after the changing of an underlying surface induced by water driven erosion the purpose of our study was to investigate the relationship between lateral and vertical dc flux from topsoil in an eroding soil landscape in a vegetation restoration area and to predict the trend of division of lateral and vertical dc effluxes from topsoil on the loess plateau we address the research questions 1 what is the role of dc flux in topsoil c pool dynamics and 2 how much lateral versus vertical dc effluxes occur from topsoil in a vegetation restoration area like the chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the yangjuangou catchment 36 42 n and 109 31 e in yan an city of shaanxi province china the catchment is 2 02 km2 and ranges in elevation ranging from 1050 to 1298 m the soil is calcaric cambisol typically with uniform texture and weak structure li et al 2003 table 1 this hill and gully landscape gully density is 2 74 km km 2 one of the typical landscapes on the chinese loess plateau is notorious for soil erosion due to high soil erodibility widespread vegetation destruction and intensive cultivation it has been designated as a typical vegetation restoration area in china particularly with the implementation of the grain for green project since 1999 fu et al 2017 the regional climate is semiarid with a mean annual air temperature and precipitation of 9 8 0 8 c and 531 0 mm respectively the growing season is from may to september and the average growing season precipitation is 422 mm accounting for 79 of the annual precipitation jiao et al 2016 2 2 measurement and collection of samples to measure the impacts of vegetation restoration on the hillslope hydrology and biogeochemical cycles four runoff plots were set up on a slope of about 20 three of the vegetated plots were respectively with cover fig 1 of robinia pseudoacacia 2 10 m spiraea salicifolia 2 10 m stipa bungeana community 3 10 m and a plot with bare soil was the control 3 10 m table 1 these runoff plots are named a s h and ck respectively to separate the sediment yield and surface runoff in and out of the plots polyvinyl chloride pvc boards were inserted into the soil 500 mm deep as the boundary of the plots a u shaped pvc runoff gathering pit was installed to transfer the surface runoff to a collecting bucket at the bottom edge of each runoff plot a total of 19 rainfall events numbered from 1 to 19 sequentially by date were recorded between june through october in 2016 nine rainfall events and 2017 ten rainfall events after each rainfall event the surface runoff volume r was measured and the runoff accumulated in buckets was collected in 250 ml plastic bottles the water samples were then chilled at 4 c in a refrigerator and transported to the laboratory for measuring the dissolved carbon concentration in runoff dccr jacinthe et al 2004 liu and sheu 2003

for near surface installation was installed at 50 mm soil depth in our study two soil water samplers were installed in each plot one was 2 5 m and the other 7 5 m from the top edge of the plot the collected infiltration water samples were bottled and kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for later measurement of the dissolved carbon concentration of the infiltration water dcci including the dissolved organic carbon concentration docci and the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration dicci 2 3 laboratory analysis laboratory analysis was conducted at the state key laboratory of urban and regional ecology research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences the dccp dccr and dcci were estimated using a vario toc analyzer filtered samples through filter membrane of 0 45 μm

instrument was dissolved carbon concentration dcc and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration dicc the dissolved organic carbon concentration docc was estimated as the difference of dcc and dicc 2 4 data analyses statistical analysis was performed using spss 21 0 for windows linear regression analysis were used to analyze the relationship between dissolved carbon input fluxes by rainfall and rainfall throughfall amount the ratios of the lateral versus the vertical dc effluxes from topsoil and rainfall intensity and the ratios of the lateral versus the vertical dc effluxes from topsoil and antecedent soil water content statistical significance tests of the results were evaluated at α 0 05 the infiltration volume i below 50 mm depth in each plot was calculated through the water balance

hydrological fluxes during water driven erosion the hydrological fluxes during water driven erosion are listed in fig 2 the total rainfall during the observation period was 254 1 mm and 331 1 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively rainfall intensity ranged from to 0 9 12 5 mm h 1 the largest rainfall 76 7 mm occurred in rainfall event 16 23 august 2017 while the smallest 2 8 mm occurred in rainfall event 19 22 september 2017 the rainfall interception was 26 13 in plot a and 45 16 in plot s vegetation greatly reduced surface runoff the reduction was 80 4 15 6 88 1 14 5 and 90 2 9 5 in plots a s and h respectively compared with that in ck the surface runoff in each plot was relatively small compared to rainfall throughfall it amounted to 1 1 1 5 1 0 1 7 0 5 0 8 and 4 3 6 0 of rainfall throughfall in plots a s h and ck respectively compared to rainfall throughfall most of water infiltrated from the topsoil layer 0 50 mm to the deeper soil layer the infiltration amounted to 91 6 9 0 91 7 7 5 90 5 6 9 and 85 3 9 4 of rainfall throughfall in plots a s h and ck respectively these figures illustrate that the vegetation cover resulted in a considerable decreas in the proportion of surface runoff and increased in the proportion of infiltration 3 2 topsoil dissolved carbon fluxes 3 2 1 topsoil dissolved carbon input flux by rainfall the relationships between the rainfall throughfall amount and the dc input fluxes are shown in fig 3 the dissolved organic carbon input fluxes by rainfall docp all tended to increase with the rainfall throughfall amount in each plot the relationships table 2 between docp and rainfall throughfall amount were all extremely significant p 0 01 the closest relationship occurred in plot s however the relationship between the dissolved inorganic carbon input fluxes by rainfall dicp and the rainfall throughfall amount was not significant for plot s table 2 fig 3d shows that the total dissolved carbon input flux by rainfall tdcp was the most in plot a 2 45 g m 2 in 2016 3 09 g m 2 in 2017 while it was the least in plot s 1 65 g m 2 in 2016 1 16 g m 2 in 2017 the tdcp in 2016 was more than that in 2017 except for plot a the organic tdcp was much more than inorganic tdcp 3 2 2 total dissolved carbon effluxes from topsoil the total dissolved carbon efflux from topsoil tdce can be divided into two forms lateral tdce total dissolved carbon flux by runoff tdcr and vertical tdce total dissolved carbon flux by infiltration tdci the vertical tdce were mainly in the form of doc fig 4 b and c the vertical tdce in plots a and s were less than that in the plot ck in both 2016 and 2017 the reductions compared to plot ck for vertical organic tdce from topsoil were 19 7 and 27 8 in plots a and s in 2016 and 31 9 and 47 5 in 2017 respectively for vertical inorganic tdce the reductions compared to plot ck were 27 6 and 14 1 in plots a and s in 2016 and 10 1 and 35 3 in 2017 respectively it can be seen that the reductions in 2016 were less than those in 2017 the main reason for the yearly differences in reduction was the different amounts of the rain falling in the two years in the different plots with vegetation the vertical tdce changed greatly the least amount of vertical tdce occurred in plot s during both 2016 and 2017 followed by plots a and h the lateral organic tdce were much more than the lateral inorganic tdce in all of the plots meaning that lateral organic tdce was the main form of lateral tdce the lateral tdce in plot ck was much more than that in the plots with vegetation fig 4 the vegetation cover reduced the lateral organic tdce by 66 5 74 4 and 82 2 in plots a s and h in 2016 and by 77 7 89 8 and 90 8 in 2017 respectively the lateral inorganic tdce in plots a s and h were reduced by 67 2 83 7 and 89 5 in 2016 and by 61 7 87 4 and 88 2 in 2017 respectively compared to plot ck the reduction in 2017 was more than that in 2016 perhaps a result of the higher rainfall amount in 2017 than 2016 the differences in reduction were also caused by the different vegetation cover in each plot the least reduction occurred in plot a and most reduction occurred in plot h this means that out of all the vegetation types the herbaceous had the most effect on the lateral tdce 3 2 3 total net dissolved carbon fluxes the total net dc fluxes were carbon losses from topsoil in each of the plots the total net doc fluxes were more than the total net dic fluxes the total net doc fluxes in 2017 20 3 6 3 g m 2 were more than in 2016 16 7 3 1 g m 2 the total net dic fluxes had a similar trend to the total net doc fluxes 6 5 1 2 g m 2 in 2017 3 5 0 6 g m 2 in 2016 the total net dc fluxes in the plots with vegetation were less than that in the plot without vegetation in the plots with vegetation plot h had the most total net dc fluxes followed by plots a and s the total net dc fluxes in 2017 were more than in 2016 3 3 partitioning of the total dissolved carbon effluxes from topsoil it can be seen that the fraction of lateral tdce in total tdce was small compared to the fraction of vertical tdce fig 4 in the plots with vegetation the lateral organic tdce occupied 2 3 0 9 of tdce in 2016 and 0 8 0 4 in 2017 in addition lateral inorganic tdce accounted for 1 0 0 7 of tdce in 2016 and 0 3 0 1 in 2017 the lateral tdce varied greatly with the different vegetation cover the percentage of lateral tdce in tdce in the plots with vegetation was highest in plot a and least in plot h the differences in the percentage of lateral tdce between plots with and without vegetation organic tdce 6 9 in 2016 and 3 5 in 2017 inorganic tdce 3 7 in 2016 and 1 0 in 2017 showed that the vegetation cover reduced the fraction of lateral tdce and increased the fraction of vertical tdce the percentage of lateral tdce in total tdce in 2016 was more than that in 2017 in addition the arboreal vegetation had the effect of reducing the contribution of vertical tdce to tdce and the herbaceous vegetation had the effect of reducing the contribution of lateral tdce to tdce 3 4 the ratio of lateral versus vertical dissolved carbon effluxes from topsoil the ratios of the lateral versus the vertical dc effluxes from topsoil l v during each rainfall event are listed in fig 5 it can be seen that the ratios in different plots all tended to increase with rainfall intensity the ratios in the plot without vegetation were generally higher than those in the plots with vegetation in the plots with vegetation the average ratios in plot h organic carbon 0 007 0 012 inorganic carbon 0 003 0 005 were the lowest and the average ratios in plot a organic carbon 0 017 0 026 inorganic carbon 0 009 0 012 were the highest on average however the ratios of l v changed greatly under different rainfall events the ratios of l v were affected by antecedent soil water content swcb in the text and they tended to increase with antecedent soil water content fig 6 the relationship between the ratios of l v and the antecedent soil water content was not significant p 0 05 in any of the plots 4 discussion 4 1 the role of dissolved carbon fluxes in a vegetation restoration area estimates of the dc fluxes ranged from 1 to 10 g c m 2 y 2 for many ecosystems brye et al 2001 kindler et al 2011 neff and asner 2001 compared to c fluxes associated with primary productivity or heterotrophic respiration in terrestrial systems dc fluxes is a relatively small fraction and generally not considered important kalbitz and kaiser 2008 schimel 1995 however this and previous studies have shown that the important role of dc flux played in ecosystems cannot be ignored for several reasons 1 dc flux is a vector for the loss of c from topsoil kindler et al 2011 and 2 dc flux is an important source of organic matter in subsoils rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 which can be substantial for carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level the dc input flux by rainfall in topsoil was relatively small compared to the dce the differences in carbon input fluxes were caused by the vegetation cover the rainfall interception varied with vegetation cover cook et al 2006 shachnovich et al 2008 leaf washing different volumes of rainfall and leaching resulted in the changes of dcc between throughfall and rainfall liu and sheu 2003 which causing the associated changes of dccp in different runoff plot fig 7 according to the overlap and similar trends of carbon fluxes hydrological fluxes and carbon concentration in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that the hydrological flux rainfall throughfall made a greater contribution than dccp to affect the dcp doetterl et al 2016 also found that dc fluxes are closely associated with the magnitude of water flow different fvc and community function and structure in the different plots table 1 changed the rainfall throughfall the dcp will also be changed correspondingly the reduction of dce in the plots with vegetation compared to that in the plot without vegetation has been widely observed in the study area vegetation cover can reduce surface runoff li et al 2015 marques et al 2007 in the plots with vegetation the surface runoff was reduced in comparison to plot ck fig 2 as dc fluxes are closely associated with the magnitude of water flow the lateral dce decreased with the corresponding reduced surface runoff jacinthe et al 2004 from the water balance equation applied to rainfall events the infiltration will increase as the surface runoff decreases plot h li et al 2015 however in plots a and s the rainfall interception by the canopy reduced the infiltration compared to plot ck fig 2 community functional composition and structure play an important role in reducing surface runoff in semi arid restored areas zhu et al 2015 the vertical dce in plots a and s was reduced with a corresponding reduced infiltration volume the differences between plots a and s were caused by the different community functional compositions and structures within them table 1 however the vertical dce was less in plot h than it was in plot ck although the infiltration in plot h was more than it was in plot ck the dcci in plot h docci 84 7 12 8 mg l 1 dicci 18 7 5 5 mg l 1 was less than that in plot ck docci 95 5 16 6 mg l 1 dicci 23 8 6 8 mg l 1 and this was the main reason that the vertical tdce in plot h was less than that in plot ck the dcci was affected by soil water content soil ph infiltration volume etc ma et al 2014 michalzik et al 2001 the different conditions caused by vegetation cover may be the reason for the lower dcci in the plots with vegetation in a vegetation restoration area the surface runoff becomes less and less during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape fu et al 2017 as a consequence the portion of vertical dce increases with reduced lateral dce compared to bare soil in the study area the vertical dce accounted for more and more of the dce and its contribution will continue to become more important as vegetation restoration continues in the future vertical dce is not only a c loss from topsoil but also a c input for the deeper soil layers rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 dc transport has mainly been studied in temperate forest soils michalzik et al 2001 and has been thought to be the main source of subsoil organic carbon under such conditions kaiser and guggenberger 2000 as the percentage of the vertical dce in the csr was large 63 13 in our study vertical dce may play a critical role in soil carbon sequestration in a vegetation restoration area on the other hand the vegetation cover is good for carbon fixing for the increased portion of vertical dce from topsoil in vegetation restoration areas the ecosystem of the chinese loess plateau transformed from a net carbon source in 2000 to a net carbon sink in 2008 this change was mainly a result of the increased net primary productivity npp following the vegetation restoration feng et al 2013 however the reduction of lateral dce and increased portion of vertical dce compared to bare soil may be another important reason 4 2 a potentially underestimated carbon sequestration capacity induced by the topsoil vertical dissolved carbon efflux estimates of csr are typically estimated by measuring changes in the carbon storage of topsoil layers deng et al 2017 wang et al 2011b the dc fluxes in soil layers particularly dc percolation from topsoil to deeper soil layers were not considered in the estimation of carbon sequestration due to challenges in direct measurement doetterl et al 2016 lal 2003 yue et al 2016 through the partitioning of the tdce our study clearly shows that the topsoil vertical tdce accounting for 98 7 1 0 of the tdce was the main dce in our vegetation restoration area the topsoil vertical tdce occupied 59 4 11 0 in 2016 and 66 7 15 5 in 2017 of the csr on average the vertical tdce from topsoil to the deep soil layers was so large that it cannot be ignored the fate of infiltrated c from topsoil to deeper soil layers is not certain it is likely some of the infiltrated c materials would be decomposed by mineralization as they move down the soil profile deng et al 2014a neff and asner 2001 and some may be drained out by base flow on the other hand it is still possible that some of the infiltrated c might be retained and protected from decomposition in the deeper soil layers ma et al 2014 rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 on the basis of the above processes the actual carbon sequestration rate csra 46 8 g c m 2 yr 1 in plot a 43 7 g c m 2 yr 1 in plot s 51 3 g c m 2 yr 1 in plot h in the study area could be the sum of the csr and the vertical tdce from topsoil if 1 all the infiltrated c is protected from decomposition in the deep layers and 2 the dynamic replacement hypothesis of c in the topsoil layer harden et al 1999 stallard 1998 holds as an important source of subsoil c the vertical dce should be included in the calculation of the carbon sequestration capacity rumpel and kogel knabner 2011 the c sequestration capacity in the vegetation restoration area might be underestimated by up to 37 1 4 2 in 2016 and 39 7 5 6 in 2017 in the plots with vegetation if the vertical tdce from topsoil to subsoil was not factored into the estimates osher et al 2003 also observed some of the photosynthesis generated c3 molecules in the subsoil layers that had been lost from surface horizons this provides supporting evidence that the carbon flux from topsoil to subsoil exists without measuring and tabulating the c accumulated in the subsoil horizons lost from topsoil we would have overestimated the loss of c due to microbial degradation and underestimated the c sequestration capacity 4 3 the trend of dissolved carbon loss from soil on the chinese loess plateau the ratios of l v can help us predict the amount of dc loss from soils on the chinese loess plateau an important area undergone vegetation restoration fu et al 2017 as the dc fluxes were closely associated with water flow doetterl et al 2016 the ratios of l v could also be closely related to the hydrological fluxes including surface runoff and infiltration during rainfall events in the eroding soil landscape it can be verified that these hydrological fluxes were actually the main factor affecting the dc fluxes see fig 8 the carbon concentration in the hydrological fluxes made a smaller contribution to the dynamics of dc fluxes than the hydrological fluxes themselves with an increase of rainfall intensity the surface runoff increases which agrees with previous observations chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 ziadat and taimeh 2013 suggesting the existence of the infiltration limited runoff generation mechanism in the region the loess is believed to have a rather loose structure with adequate water infiltration capacity that should promote a water storage limited runoff generation mechanism liu 1985 the appearance of infiltration limited runoff generation under high rainfall intensity has important implications for future dc fluxes more surface runoff therefore more lateral dc efflux would be generated under future climate regimes in some regions of the loess plateau where storms are expected to intensify dawson and smith 2007 müller nedebock and chaplot 2015 the differences between the plots with and without vegetation elucidated how the role of vegetation cover affected the ratios of l v the vegetation cover will protect the soil aggregate from break down during soil erosion and prevent soil sealing which can reduce the surface runoff and increase the infiltration mohammad and adam 2010 puigdefábregas 2005 víctor hugo durán zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 however the canopy of shrubs and trees can also intercept rainfall shachnovich et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 which may reduce the infiltration these findings are closely associated with hydrological fluxes for these reasons the affected ratios of l v in soil with vegetation cover were and generally lower than those for bare soil on the other hand the vegetation type will also influence the ratios of l v much the highest average ratios of l v occurred in arboreal plot a it was for the low fvc that induced the most runoff among the plots with vegetation cover in addition the rainfall interception in arboreal plot was moderate for its low fvc among the plots with vegetation cover these combined effects made the highest average ratios of l v occur in the arboreal plot the lowest average ratios of l v occurred in the herbage plot h the main reason was for its highest infiltration there was no rainfall interception by canopy that making the infiltration in shrub plot s much more than that in herbage that resulted in the lower ratios of l v in herbage than shrub which make the lowest ratios of l v in herbage plot among the plots with vegetation cover on the chinese loess plateau the most significant climate change in the holocene was a progressive drying and more frequently years of drought fu et al 2017 various climate change patterns have been observed in recent decades across the loess plateau for example the precipitation decreased from 1961 to 2010 at a rate of 11 03 13 mm per decade with large spatial variations sun et al 2015 rainfall amount frequency and intensity all decreased in about 38 of the whole area while in another approximately 37 of the area the rainfall amount and frequency deceased but intensity increased fu et al 2017 the changes in rainfall intensity would induce changes in surface runoff generation as shown previously and in ratios of l v see fig 5 increasing rainfall intensity in an eroding landscape means higher ratios of l v or more surface runoff during rainfall events in the future than before one the contrary decreasing rainfall intensity in some regions would produce lower ratios of l v and less surface runoff in the future higher ratios of l v mean higher proportions of dc would be lost from the terrestrial ecosystems via lateral movement which would decrease carbon sequestration in the whole terrestrial ecosystem lower ratios of l v would promote soil carbon sequestration naturally on site vegetation restoration efforts such as the grain for green project implemented since 1999 have increased and will continue to increase vegetation coverage in the study area improving vegetation conditions will alter various hydrological processes including increasing rainfall interception increasing evapotranspiration improving the infiltration rate and reducing surface runoff wang et al 2011a it was observed that more than half of the vegetation restoration area northeast to southwest of the loess plateau experienced a decrease of 2 37 mm yr 1 in surface runoff the ratios of l v were generally lower under improved vegetation conditions implying that the corresponding lateral dce from topsoil would decrease and more dc would infiltrate into the soil with increased infiltration in the future some of the infiltrated carbon that is not decomposed would accumulate in deep soil layers ma et al 2014 facilitating soil carbon sequestration the above analysis reveals the emergence of two opposing forces at least in some regions of the loess plateau on the one hand the widespread continuous vegetation improvement in the region would alter the hydrological cycle and reduce future lateral dce on the other hand the projected intensified rain storms at least in certain subregions will promote runoff generation and lateral dce how these two opposing forces play out in determining the hydrological carbon fluxes is still an open question apparently answering this question properly needs a long term observation network in the field particularly in the vegetation restoration areas as there is a large amount of complexity associated with dc flux dynamics in terrestrial systems more field observations and integrated analysis are needed to unravel that complexity including nonlinear responses of the dc fluxes to rainfall characteristics climate and vegetation restoration 5 conclusions we observed various topsoil dc fluxes in the field over two growing seasons to better understand the role of dc fluxes in topsoil carbon pool dynamics and predict the trend in the ratios of l v in the loess plateau and led to three major findings first vertical dce from topsoil was the most important dce it accounted for approximately 98 7 1 0 of the total dc effluxes second it is important to consider the topsoil dc fluxes in the estimation of soil carbon sequestration capacity as it may be underestimated by up to 38 5 otherwise the vertical dc flux is a c loss from the topsoil layer but at the same time a gain at the ecosystem level as it might not be lost after entering deep layers third the ratios of lateral compared to vertical dissolved carbon efflux from topsoil tend to increase with rainfall intensity our research provides information on the magnitude of dissolved carbon fluxes during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape under various vegetations this information is valuable for improving understanding the carbon cycle processes in general and estimating carbon sequestration rates in vegetation restoration regions such as the chinese loess plateau in particular acknowledgements this work was funded by the national key research and

19036,urine is a major biomass resource and its excessive discharge would lead to severe aquatic nitrogen pollution and even eutrophication in this study we designed an innovative denitrifying fuel cell dfc under illumination to purify urine and convert its chemical energy into electricity the central ideas include the following 1 on the anode chlorine radicals cl and hydroxyl ho radicals were induced to react with amine or ammonia in urine into n2 and to mineralize organics into co2 respectively 2 on the cathode no2 or no3 generated in the cell was selectively reduced to n2 and tiny nh4 by pd au nf 3 nh4 was further oxidized to n2 by cl according to process 1 then the total nitrogen tn was ultimately removed by a continuous redox loop between anode and cathode 4 the separation and migration of charges were strengthened by a self bias poly si wo3 photoanode result indicated that the dfc showed an efficient yield of electricity and almost completely n removing properties power density of 2 24 mw cm 2 total nitrogen and total organic carbon toc removal efficiency respectively 99 02 and 50 76 for artificial urine and power density of 2 51 mw cm 2 tn and toc removal efficiency respectively 98 60 and 54 55 for actual urine the study proposes a potential and environment friendly approach by using novel dfc to purify urine and generate electricity graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrifying fuel cell electricity generating self bias system urine purification 1 introduction urine is a major biomass resource that contains a large amount of organic matter urea polysaccharide etc maurer et al 2006 nevertheless with the evolution of urbanization urine as fertilizer is no longer sustainable for agriculture wang et al 2012 kim et al 2012 king and botte 2011 agricultural urine possibly result in a risk of contamination to soil and groundwater maurer et al 2006 in addition billions of tons of human urine has been generated every year the excessive discharge of urine would lead to serious aquatic nitrogen contamination and even eutrophication more profoundly excessive urine turns into sewage and contributes high nitrogen and total organic carbon toc concentrations giving birth to a persistent challenge in wastewater treatment plants and total environment another side urine also contains abundant chemical energy since it has urea and organics as main ingredients taking the examples of urea and glucose in eqs 1 and 2 to simultaneously realize urine purification and the recycling of chemical energy fuel cell can be proposed as an available approach based on the equations for the reason that the greatest ability of fuel cell lies in the use of wastewater as a substrate fuel which breaks the traditional concept of sewage treatment and permits combining wastewater treatment with power generation liu et al 2011 1 2co nh2 2 3o2 2co2 n2 4h2o δg0 1343 2 kj mol 1 e0 1 16 v 2 c6h12o6 6o2 6co2 6h2o δg0 2840 kj mol 1 e0 1 23 v microbial fuel cells mfcs have ever been found to directly obtain electricity while treating sewage he et al 2016 studies discussed mfcs with urine as a substrate kuntke et al 2012 indicating that urine can be used to produce electricity however the mfcs are easily inhibited due to high ammonia nitrogen concentration limits the development of mfcs for urine treatment feng et al 2015 additionally there still exist some drawbacks in mfcs such as electron transfer low electrogenesis efficiency long start up time and complicated operation liu and logan 2004 logan et al 2006 recently photocatalytic fuel cell pfcs technology seger and kamat 2009 yang et al 2014 has been highlighted in the energy and environment because of the stronger oxidation capacities of photo generated holes and the faster process of charge transfer under illumination compared with mfcs pfcs have a distinct merit in rapid transfer of electron and mineralizing the organics sharply enhancing electrogenesis by 2 3 orders of magnitude liu et al 2011 kuntke et al 2012 santoro et al 2013 the production of electricity and mineralizing organics can be greatly improved by extending the radicals chain reactions to the entire pfcs system which considerably reduces the dependence of pfcs on light conditions and electrode area zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 but simple pfc is unsuitable to denitrify since ammonia nitrogen is easily oxidized to no3 or no2 zhang et al 2018 virtually the current approaches including microbial and chemical methods for urine denitrification hörold et al 1993 kim and benjamin 2004 zeng et al 2017a öznülüer et al 2013 xie et al 2014 both have disadvantages in oxidizing urea to no3 or no2 failing to eliminate the total nitrogen load biological technology is a conventional and mature method to decompose nitrogen chemical process zeng et al 2017a öznülüer et al 2013 can rapidly dispose organic compounds to simple inorganic substance however these measures lead to huge energy consumption and floor space in most cases cho and hoffmann 2014 hence to build efficient dfc system two consequential issues must be settled 1 the chemical energy released from the denitrification and purification process can be effectively collected 2 the nitrogen containing substance can be specifically converted to n2 3 wo3 hν h e 4 cl h cl 5 h2o h oh 6 co nh2 2 8cl 2h2o n2 co2 8cl 8h 7 organics oh co2 h2o 8

purify urine by dislodging tn and toc and convert its chemical energy into electricity the key ideas included 1 on the anode the photo generated holes h produced on the wo3 electrode had a strong oxidation capacity under visible light illumination eqs 3 5 cl and ho induced by h are prone to react with urea or amine generated in the cell into n2 eq 6 and to mineralize organics into co2 eq 7 respectively since the cl radical has highly efficient conversion of ammonium nitrogen into n2 zhang et al 2018 charrois and hrudey 2007 xiao et al 2009 and ho radical has stronger oxidation capacities of organics 2 on the cathode slight no2 or no3 over oxidized by radicals in the cell eq 8 was selectively reduced into n2 and tiny nh4 by pd au nf cathode eqs 9 and 10 in which bimetallic catalysts deposited on ni foam such as pd and au could efficiently reduce nitric nitrogen to n2 devard et al 2016 hou et al 2008 tada et al 2004 3 tiny nh4 was further oxidized to n2 by cl according to process 1 subsequently tn was ultimately removed by continuous redox loop between anode and cathode in the process of producing electricity 4 performance of dfc was further enhanced by a self bias applied wo3 photoanode with polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic cell poly si pvc due to their mismatched fermi levels in which wo3 sintering on fto was prepositioned and poly si pvc acted as postpositional electrode successfully harvesting a significant portion of the solar spectrum and transferring photocurrent to strengthen the separation and migration of charge in the cell zeng et al 2017b the results illustrate that the dfc reached an efficient yield of electricity almost completely removing the tn and considerable degrading the efficiency of the toc 2 24 mw cm 2 99 02 and 50 76 for artificial urine and 2 51 mw cm 2 98 60 and 54 55 for actual urine respectively this work elucidates an efficient potential and sustainably energy recovering approach of dfc to purify urine 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all of analytically pure reagents used in this work were ordered from sinopharm group co ltd porous metallic ni foam sheets nf 3 mm thin which were used as the

preparation of electrode materials and the combination of wo3 anode and poly si pvc the reductive cathode was produced with the bimetallic plating method zhang et al 2018 whose detailed procedure was provided in the supporting information the innovative wo3 nanoanode was improved in this work according to previous researches zeng et al 2017c kalanur et al 2013 and the detailed procedure was displayed in the supporting information the polycrystalline silicon solar panel poly si is one kind of materials that effectively captures light wo3 photoanode and poly si panel 40 mm 15 mm constitute co electrode which can be considered as a power supply as well as the hybrid anode in dfc system a high performance poly si panel was chosen to provide electric bias potential and the poly si pack was composed an array of eight single poly si junctions poly si 2 40 mm2 arrays which were attached to printed circuit board side by side wo3 was glued together with wire by silver epoxy adhesive and the poly si was soldered new wires to connect processed wo3 electrode then poly si panel was adhering to the back of the wo3 photoanode and sealed by using silicone rubber to build a co electrode the detailed information of wo3 poly si co electrode is shown in of supplementary materials fig s1 2 3 the constructing of denitrifying fuel cell system dfc system was constituted by a self bias poly si wo3 photoanode a selectively reductive pd au nf cathode and a reaction tank made of quartz shape cube available working volume of 50 ml the poly si wo3 anode was a two part combination whose prepositioned electrode was wo3 and postpositioned material was poly si pvc which effectively strengthens the separation and migration of charges to maintain the operation of system pd au nf cathode essentially a catalyst of pd and au attached to ni foam substrate could specifically reduce nitrate to present the properties of materials the anode and cathode are characterized in figs s2 3 2 4 the treatment of urine wastewater a novel pd au nf cathode and a poly si wo3 coelectrode constituted single compartment wastewater denitrifying fuel cells the light source was a 350 w xe lamp with an am 1 5 filter all experiments unless otherwise specified were performed under visible light light intensity 100 mw cm 2 with illuminated area of 16 cm2 in the reactor moderately stirring with the application of an external constant potential the artificial urine wastewater was described in table s1 actual urine was collected from twenty healthy volunteers ten men and ten women healthy and young adults fifty milliliter aliquots of artificial and real urine wastewater were diluted appropriately and used as samples under the potentiometric conditions tethering the chi electrochemical analyzer chi 660c chenhua instrument co ltd china to monitor the current and potential 2 5 analytical method the surface morphology of the prepared materials was characterized using a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss supra55 vp equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer the phase of the samples was determined with an x ray diffractometer xps shimadzu x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max b was used to identify the elements characteristic peak of products the ph of solutions before and after the treatment was measured by a ph meter a301681 shanghai the high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2010plus shimadzu method was introduced to detect the concentration of urea the toc and tn load were analyzed by toc analyzer multi 3100 germany nitrate and nitrite content were determined by ion chromatography dionex usa and ammonia was determined by uv visible spectrophotometer 752n inesa shanghai at 420 nm radicals species were measured by electron spin resonance esr spectra with a bruker electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer esp 300e gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms qp2010 ultra approach was operated for detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons the other details were displayed in the supporting materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of denitrifying fuel cell system to verify the novel dfc system we used the diluted artificial urine the dilution factor is 1 100 as the sample to clearly study the reaction mechanism a pool of 50 ml artificial urine sample was poured into the reaction tank exposed to illumination the entire cell continued to operate for 120 min at a ph of 7 and thereafter electricity generation nitrogen and toc removal efficiencies were measured the 50 ml blank solution with sole electrolyte was used as a contrast to conduct repeated operation in the course of the reaction the oxidation of tn and organic matter is the exothermic process which indicates that the energy of organic pollutants in wastewater can be converted into electric current liu et al 2011 electricity generation was investigated by evaluating the output power density of the dfc system in fig 1 hence the power density was introduced as parameter to characterize electric intensity produced in the cell fill factor ff is actually the ratio of a maximum electric power output per theoretical maximum power output and is calculated by the following equation pmax ff ioc usc here p max is the maximum power density yield by the denitrifying fuel cell system ioc represents open circuit voltage and uoc refers to short circuit current density with the method we calculated the yield of generated electricity in the dfc system the i oc and usc were respectively shown in fig 1 a and b obviously instantaneous current in urine was more than that in blank solution while the open circuit voltages of these two were similar fig 1 c suggests that the trend of power density displayed a single peak shape as the potential continually varies in order to determine the energy production we compared the electricity production of two systems one system contains pure electrolyte without urine another system adds urine in the urine free system electricity is mainly derived from the conversion of solar energy from poli si pvc while energy production in the system containing organic matter consists of two parts the conversion of solar energy by poli si and the chemical energy in organic degradation the difference between purple line and green line is the electricity generated by oxidizing organic matter which is also the promotion of electricity therefore the p max of the two curves were just the electricity producing quantity when organic waste in urine was sustainably degrading the treatment group with artificial urine obviously had a much greater electronic productivity than the group without urine to confirm that the degradation of tn urea n and nh4 n rather than salts in urine resulted in the generation of electricity we set the treatment group with urine and the blank group without urine only electrolyte thus the electrolyte in line 202 included the salts nahco3 na2so4 nacl kcl and nah2po4 the recipe of electrolyte is showed in table s2 and the conductivity values for experimental group and the blank group have been displayed in table s3 just as shown in table s3 the urine sample in the treatment group shows a conductivity value of 12 24 ms cm 1 which is similar to that of electrolyte 12 06 ms cm 1 in blank group although similar conductivity value the two kinds of samples owned their values of pmax were quite different thus it s the removal of tn and toc that devoted chemical energy to the part of electricity energy the fig 1 c allows the more intuitive observation the purple line represents the pmax in treatment group with urine the green one reflects the pmax in blank group without urine only electrolyte the difference between purple line and green line is the electricity generated by oxidizing tn and toc which is also the promotion of electricity by the detailed numerical calculation the electricity production performance of the former 2 24 mw cm 2 increased 51 35 more than the latter 1 48 mw cm 2 sufficiently illustrating that chemical energy of effluents in urine was efficiently converted into electricity this result proved the dfc even if with the sample of diluted urine is also higher by two orders of magnitude than that of the mfc as well as pfc in related studies kuntke et al designed a mfc to achieve ammonium recovery and energy production from urine measuring a power density of 222 mw m 2 with the generation of a current density of 0 47 a m 2 under the given operational conditions santoro et al studied the power generation and contaminant removal in single chamber microbial fuel cells scmfcs treating human urine only a higher power generation of 2 33 μw cm 2 was obtained kuntke et al 2012 santoro et al 2013 liu et al also reported that different from traditional mfc the generation of electrons in the pfc system comes from photoexcitation which is a much fast and direct process liu et al 2011 fig 1 d shows tn and toc load in artificial urine continue to drop within the 120 min until the maximum degradation rates of 99 02 and 50 76 respectively were achieve due to the cyclic denitrification between anode and cathode dfc reached an approximately complete removal of tn which is progress compared with current approaches in sewage treatment cho and hoffmann 2014 zollig et al 2015 meanwhile toc as a parameter harder to remove in wastewater treatment was also achieved an effective declination in this study zhang et al reported that the total organic carbon content of coking wastewater was only reduced by 33 with c3n4 sio2 photocatalysts in nilsson s study the two mineral based materials polonite and sorbulite were used to dispose on site wastewater treatment by decreasing the toc load whose removal rate was only 23 with sorbulite zhang et al 2016 nilsson et al 2013 the farady current efficiency fce is calculated in accordance with the following formula in supplementary information in fig 1d the case of poli si wo3 pd au nf shows an optimum fce of 76 96 these facts further proved the high efficiency of the dfc system in producing electricity and urine purification 3 2 influence factors on the performance of dfc 3 2 1 effect of self bias poly si wo3 photoanode self bias poly si wo3 photoanode includes prepositioned wo3 electrode and postpositioned poly si pvc material particularly poly si pvc has a dominant influence on successfully harvesting solar spectrum to accelerate the separation and migration of charge in the cell hence it s essential to investigate poly si pvc with different properties setting 100 fold diluted artificial urine as study focus we compared four kinds of poly si cells with different number of series in this work fig 2 a displays how much power the each kind of poly si cell produced in urine sewage which in order were 0 88 1 41 1 96 2 24 mw cm 2 and the corresponding power densities in solution without urine were respectively 0 75 1 28 1 44 1 48 mw cm 2 herein the power density of four cells could be calculated with a promotion of 17 33 10 16 36 11 and 51 35 the distribution of nitrogen tn nitrate n and ammonia n can also be observed in fig 2 a the stripping rate of nitrogen load were 99 02 51 26 9 84 3 97 after 90 min and analogously the average reaction speed were 0 629 0 321 0 058 0 015 mg l 1 min 1 given the above the poly si of 8 cells in series had more optimized properties when the reactor was working its denitrifying performance could improve 93 17 than 6 cells in series indicating the validity of the pvc meanwhile the images also illustrated the feature of electricity production was positively correlated with the decrease of nitrogen load the higher the power generation the better the denitrification rate was the result suggested that the photoelectric conversion efficiency could be enhanced using a poly si cell with a suitable series number as it forms an external electric field to restrain the recovery of the hole electron pairs driven by illumination the excellent property of poly si cell with 8 series was the optimum to conduct the research 3 2 2 effect of the solution ph the ph of solution has a strong impact on experimental results by the cyclic process of cl and oh a series of experiments solution 100 fold diluted artificial urine materials poly si wo3 anode with optimum poly si cell material and pd au nf cathode were set at various ph values of 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 in fig 2 b the power density and the distribution of nitrogen at different ph value were revealed after 90 min fig 2 b indicates that there was only slight impact on the electricity generation when a change of ph occurred from 1 99 to 2 24 mw cm 2 meanwhile it also illustrates that the generation efficiency of electricity could be maximized when the ph was 7 moreover from 3 to 11 of initial ph of solution the tn removal firstly increased and then decreased with increase in ph arriving peak value when ph 7 fig 2 b shows that the proportion of tn no3 n and nh4 n were described at various ph values the tn load had been completely degraded with little reserve after 90 min at ph of 7 no3 and nh4 as two by products were ultimately exhaustive at low ph values acidity in the solution motivated reducibility in the system leading to the higher concentration of ammonium in the alkaline solution the higher the ph was the fewer h could be utilized the weakly reductive solution couldn t inhibit the generation of nitrate therefore the neutral of ph range was feasible for the study and based on a comprehensive analysis of all factors the ph of 7 should be chosen to optimize the results in the experiment meanwhile from 5 to 10 of initial ph of solution the tn removal slightly waved with the change in ph but it would also turn out phenomenally good results if we extend reaction time as is shown in fig s4 although in actual program of urine sewage there might be a little variation of ph value the performance of dfc will also be up to a satisfactory result 3 2 3 effect of the cl n ratio the cl n ratio wields significant impact on experimental result according to our previous work ji et al 2017 thus it is of fundamental importance for us to regulate the cl n ratio well the dfc was used in the 100 fold diluted artificial urine consisted of poly si wo3 electrode with best material of poly si pvc and pd au nf cathode a series of cl n ratio were set from 0 to 100 with an interval of 25 the results showed that a certain amount of chlorine contributed to improving power efficiency generated in process when the ratio exceeded the value of 50 the power density had a slight decline instead as displayed in fig 2 c additionally the degradation rate of tn and three kinds of nitrogen containing forms were reviewed for the various cl n ratio experiments the homologous images also could be observed in fig 2 c which illustrates the degradation of urine varies considerably with different proportions cl and n as presented the conversion of nitrogen was very poor achieving 26 08 in the reaction system without cl when the proportion of cl to n was 50 the percentage was nearly maximized basically realizing the purpose of nitrogen elimination this phenomenon explains that cl was absolutely dominant in the oxidizing reactions of radicals as the proportion of cl n continually increased however the rate of urine degradation dropped slightly therefore the denitrification efficiency would be inhibited if the concentration of cl as well as the electricity production was extremely high these results were also visual reflection that vividly indicated the applicability study with optimum condition of cl n 50 in conclusion as described in fig 2 d the best experimental conditions with greatest result were obtained poly si material with optimum performance ph of 7 cl n ratio of 50 under these conditions not only the electricity generation was maximized but also the purification efficiency was the optimum here only tn parameter was studied to character the purification of urine the tn had been degraded with little reserve after 90 min whose removal rate was 99 02 within 30 min no3 and nh4 were both up to maximum concentrations of 7 92 mg l 1 and 5 93 mg l 1 respectively but encouragingly the two by products essentially depleted as time proceeded accomplishing the whole cyclic process of stripping nitrogen and maximum electrogenesis ultimately 3 3 the mechanism of denitrifying fuel cell system according to aforementioned experimental results we tentatively propose the function mechanism of dfc system in scheme 1 on the anode wo3 lost electrons and synchronously produced photogenerated holes h under illumination thereby promoting the radicals production therefore cl and h2o were rapidly oxidized to cl e0 2 47 v vs nhe and oh e0 2 8 v vs nhe respectively reaction 1 and 4 as shown in fig s5 quartet peaks of dmpo oh with 1 2 2 1 intensity were detected in the absence of cl while an eleven line epr spectra was obtained in the existence of cl previous studies riesz 1995 demonstrated that a seven line esr spectra corresponds to dmpo x which indicates that both cl and oh were generated in the dfc in this process a little cl2 and hclo were also produced which had the same properties as cl as shown in scheme 2 a the urea was first attacked by cl cl2 hclo to nh2 and nhcl as reaction intermediates then in reaction 2 amines or chloramines were finally converted by the cl to n2 main product and trace nitrate over oxidized by product by cl simultaneously organics were mainly mineralized by oh to co2 reaction 5 in the dfc on the cathode it has been confirmed that nitrate could be selectively reduced to n2 and slight nh4 by metallic catalyst the nh4 and no3 generated in the solution were measured by hplc method just as displayed in fig 2d according to our previous research zhang et al 2018 therefore we adopted pd au nf as cathode due to quick adsorption and conversion of nitrate through the positive charge to confirm the species near the cathode during reaction we scan the cyclic voltammetry curves in fig s6 the peak near 0 25 v may be attributed to the formation of the palladium ii oxide layer on the surface of the catalysts the peak in the potential range between 0 80 and 0 75 v is due to the oxidation of the absorbed and adsorbed hydrogen the peak at 0 4 v was due to the adsorption of nitrate which is consistent with the results of lsv xu et al 2010 li et al 2009 after adsorption on au site no3 was reduced to slight intermediate no2 and then further reduced to n2 on the pd sites reaction 3 when combined no2 pd extremely tended to reduce no2 to n2 which was rate limiting step in the whole process of converting no3 to n2 meanwhile the au played a major role on the process of transforming no3 to no2 zhang et al 2018 additionally trace nitrates could also be directly reduced to nh4 by pd au nf and subsequently transformed to n2 by cl herein we demonstrate a removal loop of nitrogen between anode and cathode performance of dfc would be further enhanced by a self bias combination of wo3 photoanode and poly si pvc due to their mismatched fermi levels zeng et al 2017b which could successfully harvest a significant portion of the solar spectrum and transfer photocurrent to strengthen the separation and migration of charge in the system improving the efficiency of dfc 3 4 chlorine cycle for urine dfc system recycling cl occupies an important position in sustained and steady denitrification and electricity generation luan et al 2012 according to the reaction pathway we proposed in scheme 2 b it could be concluded that there exists a circulation of cl originally cl converts to cl under illumination of visible light and cl could ultimately oxidize urea n or nh4 n to n2 and nitrate n and synchronously be reduced to cl taken together our results reveal that reductive nitrogen could be removed continuously by cl in the cell during the denitrification reaction cl essentially underwent a cyclic catalysis of cl cl cl an ongoing test was performed to confirm this in the dfc system when the parameters were cl n 50 the ph of 7 and reaction time of 6 h with 90 min intervals 100 fold diluted artificial urine was poured into the system without cl in fig 3 it shows the removal efficiency of tn in four consecutive sections was 99 02 98 25 96 43 and 95 01 respectively demonstrating the circulative cl additionally it was almost superfluous to supplement cl during the whole experiment moreover facts have proved that cl was the species doing exist in the cell fig s4 and the reactive chlorine species rcs was brought in the system to measure the amount of oxidizing chlorine because of there being no means to quantify cl the quantity of the rcs generation is detected by the standard solution of dpd shang c 2000 the results were supplemented in fig s7 the results of ion chromatography method table 1 indicated that clo4 whose residual concentration was 0 065 mm appeared in the solution as the end product initially slight ch2cl2 and chcl3 were measured in the reaction process by gc ms technique 5 55 and 1 76 μm and after experiment just 4 21 μm chcl3 remained which confirms the reaction trace of chlorine table 2 thus combining experimental results and the research of cho and hoffmann 2014 we presume the reaction pathways in the experimental process in scheme 2 however in this cell the clo4 was the main by product probably generated by the active chlorine which was also studied in some works cho et al 2014a 2014b the clo4 rose approximately linearly with the reaction time until the breakpoint after which the generation leveled off as a whole clo4 occurred very rarely in the process only 1 30 compared with cl we included in the cell tank before reaction likewise only a little chcl3 as another inevitable end product was also examined in the reaction tank according to the relevant experimental results and extremely tiny clo4 and chcl3 were not enough to destabilize the whole system based on some documents lin et al 2016 jung et al 2010 4 the application in actual urine to clarify the viability of the cycle system of dfc based on cl and oh in practical application the direct treatment of actual urine was conducted under the appropriate conditions the optimum poly si cell material the ph of 7 and reaction time of 3 h we obtained the fresh urine containing approximately 0 31 m urea 462 4 mm of cl electrolytes po4 3 of 60 9 mm and so4 2 of 36 5 mm and other organics from twenty volunteers ten men and ten women healthy adults in general approximately 0 33 m urea an average value is present in a normal man s urine as well as 169 2 mm of cl wang et al 2012 cho and hoffmann 2014 boggs et al 2009 urine acquired by collecting from volunteers was first filtered and was subsequently diluted with deionized water to a more appropriate desaturation multiple the degradation experiment was performed in urine denitrifying fuel cell fig 4 a reflects the power density quantity of cell p max value in 100 fold diluted artificial urine was 2 51 mw cm 2 which was slightly more than that in artificial urine due to a stronger concentration and more variety of waste in the former even if fresh urine had been suitably diluted it would still contain relatively higher quantities of nitrogen load and toc which was why it generated more energy than artificial urine the image in fig 4 a reveals the specific data about p max values in urine sample and electrolyte solution by calculation the difference between two solutions was the pure generated electricity of 1 03 mw cm 2 fig 3 b shows total nitrogen and simultaneous total organic carbon dislodging from the practical urine the columns represent removal rate of organics and trend lines referred to the kinetic curves of tn and toc extraction tn could still be mostly removed with a higher amount decreasing from initial 63 875 mg l 1 to 0 895 mg l 1 with an efficiency of 98 60 after 3 h with an average speed of 0 350 mg l 1 min 1 meanwhile because of the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals li et al 2016 the toc was also decreased by 54 55 with corresponding degradation speed of 0 208 mg l 1 min 1 which was a nice advantage of the novel dfc to demonstrate the bearing capacity of dfc in disposal with high nitrogen urine we also complemented the relevant experiments as displayed in fig s8 the original urine samples whose concentration was about 6436 18 mg l by detection 10 fold diluted urine samples and 40 fold diluted urine samples were incessantly degraded in dfc system for 8 h the removal rate of tn in 40 fold diluted urine samples was 96 5 with a reaction rate constant of 0 3676 mg l 1 min 1 and an approximately consistent current of 2 01 ma cm 2 in the samples of original urine and 10 fold diluted urine the denitrification efficiencies were lower after 8 h which were 9 51 and 39 59 respectively nevertheless the total nitrogen in the two samples could be running uninterruptedly to generate electricity with the average current of 2 36 and 3 27 ma cm 2 respectively which also achieved the goals of producing electricity by the urine purification herein this study was especially significant for indicating the system of self providing electricity could be applied in denitrification and toc removal of urine an important note about this process was that urine could be considered as source of electrolyte as well as the source of free chlorine achieving the actual application of the urine treatment in the proposed system without externally added salinity 5 conclusions this work reported an attractive dfc system composed of a self bias poly si wo3 photoanode and a novel pd au material and highlighted an innovative route of using urine sewage to produce electricity and simultaneously completely remove tn by circulative reaction of radicals in this process we achieved a significant performance of dfc under optimal conditions ph value of 7 cl n 50 results indicated the power density generation in urine was 2 24 mw cm 2 which improved by one or two orders of magnitude than mfc system it could be proved that tn and toc were transformed into n2 and co2 by chlorine and hydroxyl radicals respectively combined with the analysis of esr and free radical capture experiments the nitrate n was efficiently reduced to n2 on a highly selective cathode pd au bimetallic catalyst deposited on ni foam to achieve completely conversion of nitrogen to n2 whose efficiency was 99 02 during the denitrification reaction we confirmed that cl essentially underwent a cyclic catalysis of cl cl cl and ultimately the feasibility of dfc system for actual urine treatment was verified showing an excellent generated power of 2 51 mw cm 2 synchronously a denitrification rate of tn up to 98 60 and stripping efficiency of toc up to 54 55 these results demonstrated dfc driven by cyclic cl and oh reaction under solar radiation a more reliable and available way to treat total nitrogen and toc load and more importantly a potential approach of comprehensive utilization to dispose urine acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the national nature science foundation of china no 21875139 21776177 and sjtu aemd for support appendix

19036,urine is a major biomass resource and its excessive discharge would lead to severe aquatic nitrogen pollution and even eutrophication in this study we designed an innovative denitrifying fuel cell dfc under illumination to purify urine and convert its chemical energy into electricity the central ideas include the following 1 on the anode chlorine radicals cl and hydroxyl ho radicals were induced to react with amine or ammonia in urine into n2 and to mineralize organics into co2 respectively 2 on the cathode no2 or no3 generated in the cell was selectively reduced to n2 and tiny nh4 by pd au nf 3 nh4 was further oxidized to n2 by cl according to process 1 then the total nitrogen tn was ultimately removed by a continuous redox loop between anode and cathode 4 the separation and migration of charges were strengthened by a self bias poly si wo3 photoanode result indicated that the dfc showed an efficient yield of electricity and almost completely n removing properties power density of 2 24 mw cm 2 total nitrogen and total organic carbon toc removal efficiency respectively 99 02 and 50 76 for artificial urine and power density of 2 51 mw cm 2 tn and toc removal efficiency respectively 98 60 and 54 55 for actual urine the study proposes a potential and environment friendly approach by using novel dfc to purify urine and generate electricity graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrifying fuel cell electricity generating self bias system urine purification 1 introduction urine is a major biomass resource that contains a large amount of organic matter urea polysaccharide etc maurer et al 2006 nevertheless with the evolution of urbanization urine as fertilizer is no longer sustainable for agriculture wang et al 2012 kim et al 2012 king and botte 2011 agricultural urine possibly result in a risk of contamination to soil and groundwater maurer et al 2006 in addition billions of tons of human urine has been generated every year the excessive discharge of urine would lead to serious aquatic nitrogen contamination and even eutrophication more profoundly excessive urine turns into sewage and contributes high nitrogen and total organic carbon toc concentrations giving birth to a persistent challenge in wastewater treatment plants and total environment another side urine also contains abundant chemical energy since it has urea and organics as main ingredients taking the examples of urea and glucose in eqs 1 and 2 to simultaneously realize urine purification and the recycling of chemical energy fuel cell can be proposed as an available approach based on the equations for the reason that the greatest ability of fuel cell lies in the use of wastewater as a substrate fuel which breaks the traditional concept of sewage treatment and permits combining wastewater treatment with power generation liu et al 2011 1 2co nh2 2 3o2 2co2 n2 4h2o δg0 1343 2 kj mol 1 e0 1 16 v 2 c6h12o6 6o2 6co2 6h2o δg0 2840 kj mol 1 e0 1 23 v microbial fuel cells mfcs have ever been found to directly obtain electricity while treating sewage he et al 2016 studies discussed mfcs with urine as a substrate kuntke et al 2012 indicating that urine can be used to produce electricity however the mfcs are easily inhibited due to high ammonia nitrogen concentration limits the development of mfcs for urine treatment feng et al 2015 additionally there still exist some drawbacks in mfcs such as electron transfer low electrogenesis efficiency long start up time and complicated operation liu and logan 2004 logan et al 2006 recently photocatalytic fuel cell pfcs technology seger and kamat 2009 yang et al 2014 has been highlighted in the energy and environment because of the stronger oxidation capacities of photo generated holes and the faster process of charge transfer under illumination compared with mfcs pfcs have a distinct merit in rapid transfer of electron and mineralizing the organics sharply enhancing electrogenesis by 2 3 orders of magnitude liu et al 2011 kuntke et al 2012 santoro et al 2013 the production of electricity and mineralizing organics can be greatly improved by extending the radicals chain reactions to the entire pfcs system which considerably reduces the dependence of pfcs on light conditions and electrode area zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 but simple pfc is unsuitable to denitrify since ammonia nitrogen is easily oxidized to no3 or no2 zhang et al 2018 virtually the current approaches including microbial and chemical methods for urine denitrification hörold et al 1993 kim and benjamin 2004 zeng et al 2017a öznülüer et al 2013 xie et al 2014 both have disadvantages in oxidizing urea to no3 or no2 failing to eliminate the total nitrogen load biological technology is a conventional and mature method to decompose nitrogen chemical process zeng et al 2017a öznülüer et al 2013 can rapidly dispose organic compounds to simple inorganic substance however these measures lead to huge energy consumption and floor space in most cases cho and hoffmann 2014 hence to build efficient dfc system two consequential issues must be settled 1 the chemical energy released from the denitrification and purification process can be effectively collected 2 the nitrogen containing substance can be specifically converted to n2 3 wo3 hν h e 4 cl h cl 5 h2o h oh 6 co nh2 2 8cl 2h2o n2 co2 8cl 8h 7 organics oh co2 h2o 8

purify urine by dislodging tn and toc and convert its chemical energy into electricity the key ideas included 1 on the anode the photo generated holes h produced on the wo3 electrode had a strong oxidation capacity under visible light illumination eqs 3 5 cl and ho induced by h are prone to react with urea or amine generated in the cell into n2 eq 6 and to mineralize organics into co2 eq 7 respectively since the cl radical has highly efficient conversion of ammonium nitrogen into n2 zhang et al 2018 charrois and hrudey 2007 xiao et al 2009 and ho radical has stronger oxidation capacities of organics 2 on the cathode slight no2 or no3 over oxidized by radicals in the cell eq 8 was selectively reduced into n2 and tiny nh4 by pd au nf cathode eqs 9 and 10 in which bimetallic catalysts deposited on ni foam such as pd and au could efficiently reduce nitric nitrogen to n2 devard et al 2016 hou et al 2008 tada et al 2004 3 tiny nh4 was further oxidized to n2 by cl according to process 1 subsequently tn was ultimately removed by continuous redox loop between anode and cathode in the process of producing electricity 4 performance of dfc was further enhanced by a self bias applied wo3 photoanode with polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic cell poly si pvc due to their mismatched fermi levels in which wo3 sintering on fto was prepositioned and poly si pvc acted as postpositional electrode successfully harvesting a significant portion of the solar spectrum and transferring photocurrent to strengthen the separation and migration of charge in the cell zeng et al 2017b the results illustrate that the dfc reached an efficient yield of electricity almost completely removing the tn and considerable degrading the efficiency of the toc 2 24 mw cm 2 99 02 and 50 76 for artificial urine and 2 51 mw cm 2 98 60 and 54 55 for actual urine respectively this work elucidates an efficient potential and sustainably energy recovering approach of dfc to purify urine 2

preparation of electrode materials and the combination of wo3 anode and poly si pvc the reductive cathode was produced with the bimetallic plating method zhang et al 2018 whose detailed procedure was provided in the supporting information the innovative wo3 nanoanode was improved in this work according to previous researches zeng et al 2017c kalanur et al 2013 and the detailed procedure was displayed in the supporting information the polycrystalline silicon solar panel poly si is one kind of materials that effectively captures light wo3 photoanode and poly si panel 40 mm 15 mm constitute co electrode which can be considered as a power supply as well as the hybrid anode in dfc system a high performance poly si panel was chosen to provide electric bias potential and the poly si pack was composed an array of eight single poly si junctions poly si 2 40 mm2 arrays which were attached to printed circuit board side by side wo3 was glued together with wire by silver epoxy adhesive and the poly si was soldered new wires to connect processed wo3 electrode then poly si panel was adhering to the back of the wo3 photoanode and sealed by using silicone rubber to build a co electrode the detailed information of wo3 poly si co electrode is shown in of supplementary materials fig s1 2 3 the constructing of denitrifying fuel cell system dfc system was constituted by a self bias poly si wo3 photoanode a selectively reductive pd au nf cathode and a reaction tank made of quartz shape cube available working volume of 50 ml the poly si wo3 anode was a two part combination whose prepositioned electrode was wo3 and postpositioned material was poly si pvc which effectively strengthens the separation and migration of charges to maintain the operation of system pd au nf cathode essentially a catalyst of pd and au attached to ni foam substrate could specifically reduce nitrate to present the properties of materials the anode and cathode are characterized in figs s2 3 2 4 the treatment of urine wastewater a novel pd au nf cathode and a poly si wo3 coelectrode constituted single compartment wastewater denitrifying fuel cells the light source was a 350 w xe lamp with an am 1 5 filter all experiments unless otherwise specified were performed under visible light light intensity 100 mw cm 2 with illuminated area of 16 cm2 in the reactor moderately stirring with the application of an external constant potential the artificial urine wastewater was described in table s1 actual urine was collected from twenty healthy volunteers ten men and ten women healthy and young adults fifty milliliter aliquots of artificial and real urine wastewater were diluted appropriately and used as samples under the potentiometric conditions tethering the chi electrochemical analyzer chi 660c chenhua instrument co ltd china to monitor the current and potential 2 5 analytical method the surface morphology of the prepared materials was characterized using a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss supra55 vp equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer the phase of the samples was determined with an x ray diffractometer xps shimadzu x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max b was used to identify the elements characteristic peak of products the ph of solutions before and after the treatment was measured by a ph meter a301681 shanghai the high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2010plus shimadzu method was introduced to detect the concentration of urea the toc and tn load were analyzed by toc analyzer multi 3100 germany nitrate and nitrite content were determined by ion chromatography dionex usa and ammonia was determined by uv visible spectrophotometer 752n inesa shanghai at 420 nm radicals species were measured by electron spin resonance esr spectra with a bruker electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer esp 300e gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms qp2010 ultra approach was operated for detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons the other details were displayed in the supporting materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of denitrifying fuel cell system to verify the novel dfc system we used the diluted artificial urine the dilution factor is 1 100 as the sample to clearly study the reaction mechanism a pool of 50 ml artificial urine sample was poured into the reaction tank exposed to illumination the entire cell continued to operate for 120 min at a ph of 7 and thereafter electricity generation nitrogen and toc removal efficiencies were measured the 50 ml blank solution with sole electrolyte was used as a contrast to conduct repeated operation in the course of the reaction the oxidation of tn and organic matter is the exothermic process which indicates that the energy of organic pollutants in wastewater can be converted into electric current liu et al 2011 electricity generation was investigated by evaluating the output power density of the dfc system in fig 1 hence the power density was introduced as parameter to characterize electric intensity produced in the cell fill factor ff is actually the ratio of a maximum electric power output per theoretical maximum power output and is calculated by the following equation pmax ff ioc usc here p max is the maximum power density yield by the denitrifying fuel cell system ioc represents open circuit voltage and uoc refers to short circuit current density with the method we calculated the yield of generated electricity in the dfc system the i oc and usc were respectively shown in fig 1 a and b obviously instantaneous current in urine was more than that in blank solution while the open circuit voltages of these two were similar fig 1 c suggests that the trend of power density displayed a single peak shape as the potential continually varies in order to determine the energy production we compared the electricity production of two systems one system contains pure electrolyte without urine another system adds urine in the urine free system electricity is mainly derived from the conversion of solar energy from poli si pvc while energy production in the system containing organic matter consists of two parts the conversion of solar energy by poli si and the chemical energy in organic degradation the difference between purple line and green line is the electricity generated by oxidizing organic matter which is also the promotion of electricity therefore the p max of the two curves were just the electricity producing quantity when organic waste in urine was sustainably degrading the treatment group with artificial urine obviously had a much greater electronic productivity than the group without urine to confirm that the degradation of tn urea n and nh4 n rather than salts in urine resulted in the generation of electricity we set the treatment group with urine and the blank group without urine only electrolyte thus the electrolyte in line 202 included the salts nahco3 na2so4 nacl kcl and nah2po4 the recipe of electrolyte is showed in table s2 and the conductivity values for experimental group and the blank group have been displayed in table s3 just as shown in table s3 the urine sample in the treatment group shows a conductivity value of 12 24 ms cm 1 which is similar to that of electrolyte 12 06 ms cm 1 in blank group although similar conductivity value the two kinds of samples owned their values of pmax were quite different thus it s the removal of tn and toc that devoted chemical energy to the part of electricity energy the fig 1 c allows the more intuitive observation the purple line represents the pmax in treatment group with urine the green one reflects the pmax in blank group without urine only electrolyte the difference between purple line and green line is the electricity generated by oxidizing tn and toc which is also the promotion of electricity by the detailed numerical calculation the electricity production performance of the former 2 24 mw cm 2 increased 51 35 more than the latter 1 48 mw cm 2 sufficiently illustrating that chemical energy of effluents in urine was efficiently converted into electricity this result proved the dfc even if with the sample of diluted urine is also higher by two orders of magnitude than that of the mfc as well as pfc in related studies kuntke et al designed a mfc to achieve ammonium recovery and energy production from urine measuring a power density of 222 mw m 2 with the generation of a current density of 0 47 a m 2 under the given operational conditions santoro et al studied the power generation and contaminant removal in single chamber microbial fuel cells scmfcs treating human urine only a higher power generation of 2 33 μw cm 2 was obtained kuntke et al 2012 santoro et al 2013 liu et al also reported that different from traditional mfc the generation of electrons in the pfc system comes from photoexcitation which is a much fast and direct process liu et al 2011 fig 1 d shows tn and toc load in artificial urine continue to drop within the 120 min until the maximum degradation rates of 99 02 and 50 76 respectively were achieve due to the cyclic denitrification between anode and cathode dfc reached an approximately complete removal of tn which is progress compared with current approaches in sewage treatment cho and hoffmann 2014 zollig et al 2015 meanwhile toc as a parameter harder to remove in wastewater treatment was also achieved an effective declination in this study zhang et al reported that the total organic carbon content of coking wastewater was only reduced by 33 with c3n4 sio2 photocatalysts in nilsson s study the two mineral based materials polonite and sorbulite were used to dispose on site wastewater treatment by decreasing the toc load whose removal rate was only 23 with sorbulite zhang et al 2016 nilsson et al 2013 the farady current efficiency fce is calculated in accordance with the following formula in supplementary information in fig 1d the case of poli si wo3 pd au nf shows an optimum fce of 76 96 these facts further proved the high efficiency of the dfc system in producing electricity and urine purification 3 2 influence factors on the performance of dfc 3 2 1 effect of self bias poly si wo3 photoanode self bias poly si wo3 photoanode includes prepositioned wo3 electrode and postpositioned poly si pvc material particularly poly si pvc has a dominant influence on successfully harvesting solar spectrum to accelerate the separation and migration of charge in the cell hence it s essential to investigate poly si pvc with different properties setting 100 fold diluted artificial urine as study focus we compared four kinds of poly si cells with different number of series in this work fig 2 a displays how much power the each kind of poly si cell produced in urine sewage which in order were 0 88 1 41 1 96 2 24 mw cm 2 and the corresponding power densities in solution without urine were respectively 0 75 1 28 1 44 1 48 mw cm 2 herein the power density of four cells could be calculated with a promotion of 17 33 10 16 36 11 and 51 35 the distribution of nitrogen tn nitrate n and ammonia n can also be observed in fig 2 a the stripping rate of nitrogen load were 99 02 51 26 9 84 3 97 after 90 min and analogously the average reaction speed were 0 629 0 321 0 058 0 015 mg l 1 min 1 given the above the poly si of 8 cells in series had more optimized properties when the reactor was working its denitrifying performance could improve 93 17 than 6 cells in series indicating the validity of the pvc meanwhile the images also illustrated the feature of electricity production was positively correlated with the decrease of nitrogen load the higher the power generation the better the denitrification rate was the result suggested that the photoelectric conversion efficiency could be enhanced using a poly si cell with a suitable series number as it forms an external electric field to restrain the recovery of the hole electron pairs driven by illumination the excellent property of poly si cell with 8 series was the optimum to conduct the research 3 2 2 effect of the solution ph the ph of solution has a strong impact on experimental results by the cyclic process of cl and oh a series of experiments solution 100 fold diluted artificial urine materials poly si wo3 anode with optimum poly si cell material and pd au nf cathode were set at various ph values of 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 in fig 2 b the power density and the distribution of nitrogen at different ph value were revealed after 90 min fig 2 b indicates that there was only slight impact on the electricity generation when a change of ph occurred from 1 99 to 2 24 mw cm 2 meanwhile it also illustrates that the generation efficiency of electricity could be maximized when the ph was 7 moreover from 3 to 11 of initial ph of solution the tn removal firstly increased and then decreased with increase in ph arriving peak value when ph 7 fig 2 b shows that the proportion of tn no3 n and nh4 n were described at various ph values the tn load had been completely degraded with little reserve after 90 min at ph of 7 no3 and nh4 as two by products were ultimately exhaustive at low ph values acidity in the solution motivated reducibility in the system leading to the higher concentration of ammonium in the alkaline solution the higher the ph was the fewer h could be utilized the weakly reductive solution couldn t inhibit the generation of nitrate therefore the neutral of ph range was feasible for the study and based on a comprehensive analysis of all factors the ph of 7 should be chosen to optimize the results in the experiment meanwhile from 5 to 10 of initial ph of solution the tn removal slightly waved with the change in ph but it would also turn out phenomenally good results if we extend reaction time as is shown in fig s4 although in actual program of urine sewage there might be a little variation of ph value the performance of dfc will also be up to a satisfactory result 3 2 3 effect of the cl n ratio the cl n ratio wields significant impact on experimental result according to our previous work ji et al 2017 thus it is of fundamental importance for us to regulate the cl n ratio well the dfc was used in the 100 fold diluted artificial urine consisted of poly si wo3 electrode with best material of poly si pvc and pd au nf cathode a series of cl n ratio were set from 0 to 100 with an interval of 25 the results showed that a certain amount of chlorine contributed to improving power efficiency generated in process when the ratio exceeded the value of 50 the power density had a slight decline instead as displayed in fig 2 c additionally the degradation rate of tn and three kinds of nitrogen containing forms were reviewed for the various cl n ratio experiments the homologous images also could be observed in fig 2 c which illustrates the degradation of urine varies considerably with different proportions cl and n as presented the conversion of nitrogen was very poor achieving 26 08 in the reaction system without cl when the proportion of cl to n was 50 the percentage was nearly maximized basically realizing the purpose of nitrogen elimination this phenomenon explains that cl was absolutely dominant in the oxidizing reactions of radicals as the proportion of cl n continually increased however the rate of urine degradation dropped slightly therefore the denitrification efficiency would be inhibited if the concentration of cl as well as the electricity production was extremely high these results were also visual reflection that vividly indicated the applicability study with optimum condition of cl n 50 in conclusion as described in fig 2 d the best experimental conditions with greatest result were obtained poly si material with optimum performance ph of 7 cl n ratio of 50 under these conditions not only the electricity generation was maximized but also the purification efficiency was the optimum here only tn parameter was studied to character the purification of urine the tn had been degraded with little reserve after 90 min whose removal rate was 99 02 within 30 min no3 and nh4 were both up to maximum concentrations of 7 92 mg l 1 and 5 93 mg l 1 respectively but encouragingly the two by products essentially depleted as time proceeded accomplishing the whole cyclic process of stripping nitrogen and maximum electrogenesis ultimately 3 3 the mechanism of denitrifying fuel cell system according to aforementioned experimental results we tentatively propose the function mechanism of dfc system in scheme 1 on the anode wo3 lost electrons and synchronously produced photogenerated holes h under illumination thereby promoting the radicals production therefore cl and h2o were rapidly oxidized to cl e0 2 47 v vs nhe and oh e0 2 8 v vs nhe respectively reaction 1 and 4 as shown in fig s5 quartet peaks of dmpo oh with 1 2 2 1 intensity were detected in the absence of cl while an eleven line epr spectra was obtained in the existence of cl previous studies riesz 1995 demonstrated that a seven line esr spectra corresponds to dmpo x which indicates that both cl and oh were generated in the dfc in this process a little cl2 and hclo were also produced which had the same properties as cl as shown in scheme 2 a the urea was first attacked by cl cl2 hclo to nh2 and nhcl as reaction intermediates then in reaction 2 amines or chloramines were finally converted by the cl to n2 main product and trace nitrate over oxidized by product by cl simultaneously organics were mainly mineralized by oh to co2 reaction 5 in the dfc on the cathode it has been confirmed that nitrate could be selectively reduced to n2 and slight nh4 by metallic catalyst the nh4 and no3 generated in the solution were measured by hplc method just as displayed in fig 2d according to our previous research zhang et al 2018 therefore we adopted pd au nf as cathode due to quick adsorption and conversion of nitrate through the positive charge to confirm the species near the cathode during reaction we scan the cyclic voltammetry curves in fig s6 the peak near 0 25 v may be attributed to the formation of the palladium ii oxide layer on the surface of the catalysts the peak in the potential range between 0 80 and 0 75 v is due to the oxidation of the absorbed and adsorbed hydrogen the peak at 0 4 v was due to the adsorption of nitrate which is consistent with the results of lsv xu et al 2010 li et al 2009 after adsorption on au site no3 was reduced to slight intermediate no2 and then further reduced to n2 on the pd sites reaction 3 when combined no2 pd extremely tended to reduce no2 to n2 which was rate limiting step in the whole process of converting no3 to n2 meanwhile the au played a major role on the process of transforming no3 to no2 zhang et al 2018 additionally trace nitrates could also be directly reduced to nh4 by pd au nf and subsequently transformed to n2 by cl herein we demonstrate a removal loop of nitrogen between anode and cathode performance of dfc would be further enhanced by a self bias combination of wo3 photoanode and poly si pvc due to their mismatched fermi levels zeng et al 2017b which could successfully harvest a significant portion of the solar spectrum and transfer photocurrent to strengthen the separation and migration of charge in the system improving the efficiency of dfc 3 4 chlorine cycle for urine dfc system recycling cl occupies an important position in sustained and steady denitrification and electricity generation luan et al 2012 according to the reaction pathway we proposed in scheme 2 b it could be concluded that there exists a circulation of cl originally cl converts to cl under illumination of visible light and cl could ultimately oxidize urea n or nh4 n to n2 and nitrate n and synchronously be reduced to cl taken together our results reveal that reductive nitrogen could be removed continuously by cl in the cell during the denitrification reaction cl essentially underwent a cyclic catalysis of cl cl cl an ongoing test was performed to confirm this in the dfc system when the parameters were cl n 50 the ph of 7 and reaction time of 6 h with 90 min intervals 100 fold diluted artificial urine was poured into the system without cl in fig 3 it shows the removal efficiency of tn in four consecutive sections was 99 02 98 25 96 43 and 95 01 respectively demonstrating the circulative cl additionally it was almost superfluous to supplement cl during the whole experiment moreover facts have proved that cl was the species doing exist in the cell fig s4 and the reactive chlorine species rcs was brought in the system to measure the amount of oxidizing chlorine because of there being no means to quantify cl the quantity of the rcs generation is detected by the standard solution of dpd shang c 2000 the results were supplemented in fig s7 the results of ion chromatography method table 1 indicated that clo4 whose residual concentration was 0 065 mm appeared in the solution as the end product initially slight ch2cl2 and chcl3 were measured in the reaction process by gc ms technique 5 55 and 1 76 μm and after experiment just 4 21 μm chcl3 remained which confirms the reaction trace of chlorine table 2 thus combining experimental results and the research of cho and hoffmann 2014 we presume the reaction pathways in the experimental process in scheme 2 however in this cell the clo4 was the main by product probably generated by the active chlorine which was also studied in some works cho et al 2014a 2014b the clo4 rose approximately linearly with the reaction time until the breakpoint after which the generation leveled off as a whole clo4 occurred very rarely in the process only 1 30 compared with cl we included in the cell tank before reaction likewise only a little chcl3 as another inevitable end product was also examined in the reaction tank according to the relevant experimental results and extremely tiny clo4 and chcl3 were not enough to destabilize the whole system based on some documents lin et al 2016 jung et al 2010 4 the application in actual urine to clarify the viability of the cycle system of dfc based on cl and oh in practical application the direct treatment of actual urine was conducted under the appropriate conditions the optimum poly si cell material the ph of 7 and reaction time of 3 h we obtained the fresh urine containing approximately 0 31 m urea 462 4 mm of cl electrolytes po4 3 of 60 9 mm and so4 2 of 36 5 mm and other organics from twenty volunteers ten men and ten women healthy adults in general approximately 0 33 m urea an average value is present in a normal man s urine as well as 169 2 mm of cl wang et al 2012 cho and hoffmann 2014 boggs et al 2009 urine acquired by collecting from volunteers was first filtered and was subsequently diluted with deionized water to a more appropriate desaturation multiple the degradation experiment was performed in urine denitrifying fuel cell fig 4 a reflects the power density quantity of cell p max value in 100 fold diluted artificial urine was 2 51 mw cm 2 which was slightly more than that in artificial urine due to a stronger concentration and more variety of waste in the former even if fresh urine had been suitably diluted it would still contain relatively higher quantities of nitrogen load and toc which was why it generated more energy than artificial urine the image in fig 4 a reveals the specific data about p max values in urine sample and electrolyte solution by calculation the difference between two solutions was the pure generated electricity of 1 03 mw cm 2 fig 3 b shows total nitrogen and simultaneous total organic carbon dislodging from the practical urine the columns represent removal rate of organics and trend lines referred to the kinetic curves of tn and toc extraction tn could still be mostly removed with a higher amount decreasing from initial 63 875 mg l 1 to 0 895 mg l 1 with an efficiency of 98 60 after 3 h with an average speed of 0 350 mg l 1 min 1 meanwhile because of the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals li et al 2016 the toc was also decreased by 54 55 with corresponding degradation speed of 0 208 mg l 1 min 1 which was a nice advantage of the novel dfc to demonstrate the bearing capacity of dfc in disposal with high nitrogen urine we also complemented the relevant experiments as displayed in fig s8 the original urine samples whose concentration was about 6436 18 mg l by detection 10 fold diluted urine samples and 40 fold diluted urine samples were incessantly degraded in dfc system for 8 h the removal rate of tn in 40 fold diluted urine samples was 96 5 with a reaction rate constant of 0 3676 mg l 1 min 1 and an approximately consistent current of 2 01 ma cm 2 in the samples of original urine and 10 fold diluted urine the denitrification efficiencies were lower after 8 h which were 9 51 and 39 59 respectively nevertheless the total nitrogen in the two samples could be running uninterruptedly to generate electricity with the average current of 2 36 and 3 27 ma cm 2 respectively which also achieved the goals of producing electricity by the urine purification herein this study was especially significant for indicating the system of self providing electricity could be applied in denitrification and toc removal of urine an important note about this process was that urine could be considered as source of electrolyte as well as the source of free chlorine achieving the actual application of the urine treatment in the proposed system without externally added salinity 5 conclusions this work reported an attractive dfc system composed of a self bias poly si wo3 photoanode and a novel pd au material and highlighted an innovative route of using urine sewage to produce electricity and simultaneously completely remove tn by circulative reaction of radicals in this process we achieved a significant performance of dfc under optimal conditions ph value of 7 cl n 50 results indicated the power density generation in urine was 2 24 mw cm 2 which improved by one or two orders of magnitude than mfc system it could be proved that tn and toc were transformed into n2 and co2 by chlorine and hydroxyl radicals respectively combined with the analysis of esr and free radical capture experiments the nitrate n was efficiently reduced to n2 on a highly selective cathode pd au bimetallic catalyst deposited on ni foam to achieve completely conversion of nitrogen to n2 whose efficiency was 99 02 during the denitrification reaction we confirmed that cl essentially underwent a cyclic catalysis of cl cl cl and ultimately the feasibility of dfc system for actual urine treatment was verified showing an excellent generated power of 2 51 mw cm 2 synchronously a denitrification rate of tn up to 98 60 and stripping efficiency of toc up to 54 55 these results demonstrated dfc driven by cyclic cl and oh reaction under solar radiation a more reliable and available way to treat total nitrogen and toc load and more importantly a potential approach of comprehensive utilization to dispose urine acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the national nature science foundation of china no 21875139 21776177 and sjtu aemd for support appendix

protein for animal feed wastewater typically holds a complex mixture of organics posing a challenge to selectively produce heterotrophic biomass ensuring the product s quality could be achieved by anaerobic generation of volatile fatty acids vfas followed by photoheterotrophic production of purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb with infrared light this study aimed to determine the most suitable pnsb

land only 14 units are consumed by citizens coppens et al 2016 upgrading resources from wastewater to microbial biomass could improve the efficiency of the food chain with this protein rich product used as ingredient in animal feed preparations in this domain affordability implies the need for non axenic cultivation of microbial communities wastewater contains organics and heterotrophic microorganisms are therefore required to upgrade these streams to protein however wastewater typically holds a variable mixture of organic molecules of diverse complexity such as polysaccharides proteins fatty acids n acetylamino sugars dna and polyphenolic structures dignac et al 2000 posing a challenge to selectively and reproducibly produce heterotrophic biomass moreover from a market perspective resource recovery will be most attractive if microbial protein can be produced controllable with a constant quality verstraete et al 2016 therefore a two stage approach was conceptually proposed anaerobically converting organics to volatile fatty acids vfas followed by microbial protein production alloul et al 2018 anaerobic fermentation is defined as the conversion of more complex organics to a mixture of vfa rich in acetate propionate and butyrate agler et al 2011 cagnetta et al 2016 this conversion entails hydrolysis of particulate matter followed by the production of acids acidogenesis and acetogenesis and co2 and h2 methanogenesis i e ch4 formation is avoided agler et al 2011 this microbiological process allows to normalize the organic variability over time ahn et al 2001 banerjee et al 1999 and the produced vfa with the corresponding low ph might act as a means to reduce contamination of the influent the toxicity of vfa for microorganisms is well described in literature sun and o riordan 2013 and anaerobic digestion leads to a die off of pathogens wagner et al 2008 similar results might therefore be expected for anaerobic fermentation two metabolic types of heterotrophic bacteria are of particular interest for protein production namely aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and photoheterotropic bacteria verstraete et al 2016 aerobic heterotrophs have been explored for microbial protein production from the early 1950s vriens et al 1989 and are pioneering in both research and pilot implementation lee et al 2015 matassa et al 2016a they are characterized

protein they perform anoxygenic photosynthesis and use organics as electron donor and carbon source unlike algae they are not able to use water as electron donor but require molecules with lower redox potential than water such as vfas blankenship et al 1995 they grow at rates between 1 51 and 1 69 d 1 for mixed cultures hülsen et al 2014 kaewsuk et al 2010 and between 0 96 and 7 10 d 1 for pure

compared to aerobic heterotrophs pnsb offer an additional steering tool to manage the microbial selectivity due to their unique ability to grow under anaerobic conditions on infrared ir light in the case of sewage treatment for instance with ir irradiation a pnsb abundance of up to 90 was achieved hülsen et al 2016a 2016b to date there are a number of research articles focusing on one stage

solid streams implementing the fermentation stage as a liquefaction stage one study has investigated fecal matter and plant material clauwaert et al 2017 and another settled diluted kitchen waste wang et al 2016 on industrial wastewater from food beverage with the organics mainly in solution such two stage approach has not yet been explored previous studies that have investigated pnsb in a vfa based medium have studied the vfa biomass yield relationship for rhodobacter sphaeroides nakajima et al 1997 van niel 1944 the effect of a vfa mixture on polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation with an enrichment community holding rhodopseudomonas sp fradinho et al 2014 and the molecular mechanism of vfa assimilation for rhodospirillum rubrum de meur et al 2018 a broader screening of pnsb for vfa growth kinetics and microbial selectivity imposed by vfa during non axenic cultivation has according to the authors knowledge not been investigated therefore the first goal of this research was culture selection by determining the fastest growing pnsb on vfa along with their protein content and biomass yield six different cultures were investigated of which three pure cultures a 3 species synthetic community to study potential synergetic effects a community enriched on a vfa mixture to obtain a pnsb community specialized in vfa conversion and the isolated species to verify the findings of the latter secondly this research wanted to unravel whether individual vfa or a vfa mixture had an impact on growth kinetics since anaerobic fermented wastewater typically consists of a vfa mixture afterwards the enrichment community which had obtained a very good performance during the batch test was used as inoculum in a photobioreactor pbr here it was the objective to investigate the effect of sludge retention time srt on microbial community dynamics and protein productivity the findings of the pbr were finally used as input for an economic based optimization of the srt production cost for anaerobic fermentation of brewery wastewater pnsb cultivation harvesting and drying were estimated and operational strategies were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 psnb strains and communities to screen for the best pnsb culture for growth on vfa six cultures were pre selected i rhodopseudomonas palustris lmg 18881 ii rhodobacter sphaeroides lmg 2827 and iii rhodospirillum rubrum s1h along with iv a 3 species synthetic community i ii iii v an enrichment community and vi rb capsulatus isolated from the latter through dilution to extinction the pure cultures were axenically pre cultivated in a climate chamber snijders scientific with a pre autoclaved vfa based medium adapted from imhoff 2006 the details are presented in supplementary information s1 the enrichment community was obtained by incubating a 1 1 1 volatile suspended solids ratio 0 1 g vss l 1 each of activated sludge from a sewage treatment plant activated sludge from a dairy wastewater treatment plant and sediment from a local pond with a vfa mixture and ir light to acquire a pnsb culture specialized in vfa conversion after twenty four hours of incubation carotenoid 320 and 380 nm

presented in supplementary information s2 2 2 batch experiments the growth of the six abovementioned cultures four strains and two communities was examined in a 500 ml erlenmeyer with a working volume of 400 ml through batch incubation the experiments for the pure cultures and the 3 species synthetic community were performed in the climate chamber conditions ibid supplementary information s1 the experiment with the enrichment community was executed on a bench with ir transmission filters conditions ibid supplementary information s2 three individual vfa were tested in triplicate equal amount

basis 0 24 g acetic acid l 1 0 20 g propionic acid l 1 and 0 18 g butyric acid l 1 the ph was adjusted to 7 0 prior to the experiment by the addition of 12 m naoh the flasks were then inoculated at an optical density of 0 1 absorbance at 660 nm the growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 660 nm samples were taken at the start 15 ml and the end of the test 100 ml 2 3 photobioreactor experiment a non axenic semi continuous pbr was operated to study the effect of srt on microbial community dynamics and protein productivity the pbr was a vertical tubular vessel with a working volume of 2 75 l and an external diameter of 12 cm it was operated for 51 days at a temperature of 30 2 c and illuminated with two halogen lamps at a light intensity of 30 w m 2 covered with ir transmission filters stirring was done with a magnetic stirrer at 720 rpm fisher scientific usa the reactor was inoculated with biomass from the enrichment community the headspace of the reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas and the gas outlet was connected to a nitrogen gas expansion balloon in order to cope with underpressure and overpressure during withdrawal and fill influent and effluent tubing was covered with aluminum foil to minimize phototrophic growth a growth experiment of forty eight hours with a vfa mixture 1 1 1 ratio on carbon mass basis 0 73 g acetic acid l 1 0 60 g propionic acid l 1 and 0 54 g butyric acid l 1 was performed prior to reactor operation to determine the maximal possible biomass concentration before light limitations occurred supplementary information s3 the maximal biomass concentration was converted to a vfa concentration at which growth would not be limited by carbon i e 1 g chemical oxygen demand cod l 1 by assuming a yield of 1 g codbiomass g 1 codvfa the cod of the vfa mixture described in subsection 2 2 was adapted to 1 g cod l 1 and used as influent for the reactor the ph of the pbr was not controlled yet the influent ph was lowered with 12 m hcl in order to have a final ph of 7 0 in the effluent ph rises due to vfa consumption the reactor was operated at six different srt by altering the volumetric flow rate l d 1 an overview of reactor conditions during operation is presented in supplementary information s4 the volume exchange ratio was initially set at 13 and later on altered to 25 one up to four four at short srt samples were taken daily to monitor the optical density 660 nm ph temperature and electrical conductivity steady state conditions were defined as a maximal change of 10 in optical density proxy for biomass concentration ph temperature and electrical conductivity for three successive srt samples for further analyses were taken three sequential srt after steady state conditions were reached 2 4 analytical procedures the cod was measured using photometric test kits merck germany the biomass yield was determined by measuring removed cod i e soluble codstart minus soluble codend and biomass cod i e total

honeywell fluka in deionised water arium 611 with an injection volume of 20 μl and a sample flow rate of 0 6 ml min 1 total suspended solids tss and vss were determined according to standard methods greenberg et al 1992 handheld meters were used to measure ph hanna instruments usa and electrical conductivity hanna instruments usa 2 5 molecular microbial and phylogenetic analyses molecular microbial analysis was used to characterize the most abundant pnsb in the enrichment characterize the isolated species of the latter and follow up richness shannon index diversity and pnsb abundance during reactor operation phylogenetic relationships between the 16s rrna gene sequence of the isolated species was done in order to classify the species a sample for microbial analysis was taken after four days of incubation the most dominant species of the enrichment community was isolated using the dilution to extinction method biomass samples of the pbr were collected at three successive srt when steady state was reached dna was extracted using a powerfecal dna isolation kit qiagen germany according to the manufacturer s instruction the microbial community was analyzed using high throughput 16s amplicon sequencing and a dual index strategy as described by kozich et al 2013 a detailed description can be found in supplementary information s5 for the isolate pcr products were sequenced using sanger sequencing with both 8f and 1525r primers genetic service facility antwerp editing complete overlapping and consensus construction was performed with the geneious software the consensus sequences were annotated with sequences in the ezbiocloud database chunlab inc korea mega7 software was used to conduct phylogenetic analysis kumar et al 2016 the phylogenetic tree was built using the maximum likelihood method based on the general time reversible model nei and kumar 2000 the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the maximum parsimony method in total 1000 bootstrap replications were performed to test for branch robustness 2 6 statistical analyses multiple comparisons were performed using the parametric analysis of variance test and post hoc pairwise comparisons using the tukey s range test homogeneity of variances was verified by executing a levene s test and normality of data residuals using the shapiro wilk normality test the non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test and post hoc pairwise comparisons using the mann whitney u test p values were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg correction were performed when normality was rejected a significance level of p 0 05 was chosen all analyses were performed in r using rstudio rstudio usa for windows r core team 2017 2 7 economic estimation an economic evaluation was performed to validate the optimal srt for pnsb production according to a four step methodology which is thoroughly described in supplementary information s6 the following parameters were taken into account such as construction piping pbr circulation pump ultrafiltration unit centrifuge spray dryer etc an overview of all cost parameters is presented in supplementary information table s1 after pnsb production wastewater still need to be treated to reach effluent discharge limits the wastewater treatment cost that are prevented due to pnsb production remove part of cod are taken into account in the model yet valorization of biogas is not included process steps that are animal specific such as nucleic acid removal endotoxin removal and pasteurization were not taken into account in the estimation in addition our process is an open systems and thus potentially prone to pathogens therefore we opt for a multiple barrier principle as discussed by alloul et al 2018 which entails the following steps i inactivation of pathogens during anaerobic fermentation ii solid liquid separation after anaerobic fermentation iii selective culture conditions pnsb on infrared light iv drying and pasteurization of biomass the primary goal of this model was to determine the best srt to operate the pbr it was not intended to determine an accurate production cost of pnsb for brewery wastewater on full scale which than can be used for other research this cost estimation ought to be seen as a decision making tool for r d and the corresponding production scheme can be used as example for further research 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment community the results of the microbial community analysis of the pnsb enrichment can be found in supplementary information s5 and show an almost complete dominance of pnsb 85 relative abundance the community was dominated by an amplicon sequence variant with a relative abundance of 80 which was classified as rhodobacter gemmobacter ezbiocloud database two other pnsb genera were also present although in low abundance 3 rhodopseudomonas 2 pararhodospirillum of note the short v4 region of the 16s rrna gene probably does not allow to differentiate between some rhodobacter gemmobacter species to further characterize the most abundant pnsb and determine whether the amplicon sequence variant corresponds to rhodobacter or gemmobacter a dilution to extinction method was applied to obtain an isolate which was subjected to sanger sequencing of the full 16s rrna gene 1500 bp phylogenetic analysis of this sequence together with other closely related species showed that this isolate could be classified as a rhodobacter capsulatus strain fig 1 due to dominance of rb capsulatus in the enrichment we expected that growth performance of this strain would be above par growth rates for rb capsulatus between 4 9 and 5 4 d 1 are described in literature willison 1988 which are lower than values found for rb sphaeroides 7 4 d 1 sangkharak and prasertsan 2007 however both results are for pure cultures derived from mutant strains it is therefore difficult to draw conclusive statement about the growth performance of rb capsulatus on vfa therefore in section 3 2 we will compare growth rates for several culture on individual and combined vfas 3 2 pnsb growth kinetics for individual and combined vfa batch experiments were performed to explore the effect of individual and combined vfas on the biomass yield and growth rate and screen within the six cultures for the most productive i e fastest growing microorganism on vfa fig 2 presents the biomass yield which was overall between 0 9 and 1 1 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved there was no significant difference p 0 05 between individual vfa or individual and combined vfas or between different species and communities pnsb have a biomass yield equal to 1 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved and even higher due to photo assimilation of a highly reduced electron donor i e propionate and butyrate along with co2 that serves as electron sink to compensate for excess reducing power blankenship et al 1995 nakajima et al 1997 and van niel 1944 have also observed a biomass yield of respectively 0 8 and between 0 8 and 0 9 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved yet these researchers only studied rb sphaeroides the near perfect substrate to biomass conversion is a critical advantage of pnsb compared to aerobic heterotrophs as roughly a double production potential is possible with a given amount of cod in the wastewater yield 0 57 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved tchobanoglous et al 2003 for the growth rate a change in individual vfa had no effect as observed for all species and communities fig 2 the most remarkable observation during the batch test is the boost in growth rate when pnsb are fed with combined vfas this enhanced growth rate effect was noticeable for rps palustris rb sphaeroides rsp rubrum and the 3 species synthetic community the boost in growth rate was between 1 3 and 2 5 times higher compared too individual vfa most pronounced for rsp rubrum the absolute value for the enriched rb capsulatus and the isolated rb capsulatus was higher for combined vfas yet there was no significant difference between acetate and the vfa mixture p 0 05 the study of nakajima et al 1997 did not observe a growth rate enhancement effect for individual vfa acetate propionate and butyrate compared to three different combined vfa ratios 1 1 1 2 1 1 and 12 2 1 g carbon for respectively acetate propionate and butyrate this is probably due to the lack of sampling points during the exponential phase resulting in flattening down of the exponential correlation moreover only rb sphaeroides was tested without any replicates which makes it difficult to draw general conclusions more recently the study of fradinho et al 2014 has observed higher growth rates consumption rate multiplied by biomass yield for combined vfas 1 53 d 1 compared to acetate 1 22 d 1 in line with our results they studied the effect of a vfa mixture 4 1 1 g carbon on polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation with an enrichment community holding rhodopseudomonas spp the effect of combined vfas is probably due to the presence of acetate as co substrate without acetate the consumption of propionate and butyrate is limited by an internal acetyl coa deficit fradinho et al 2014 overall our study is the first broader screening of pnsb for growth on vfa the results highlight that a vfa mixture and therefore likely fermented wastewater is a more suitable substrate to produce pnsb at high rate compared to individual vfa however the vfa ratio can change for a fermentate depending on the operational conditions lee et al 2014 future research should therefore further unravel the effects of different vfa carbon ratios the isolated rb capsulatus had the highest growth rates for all individual and combined vfas therefore this culture might have the best potential to grow on fermentate due to the context of the application which is resource recovery on wastewater we choose to proceed with a non axenic reactor and non axenic culture which is the enriched rb capsulatus growth rates of the isolated rb capsulatus were 1 3 1 8 times higher compared to the enriched rb capsulatus a similar observation can be made for the 3 species synthetic community which was the mixture of rps palustris rb sphaeroides rsp rubrum growth rates of rb sphaeroides best individual performance of three species for acetate and the combined vfas were respectively 1 4 and 1 7 times higher compared to the 3 species synthetic community this compares to the results of the rb capsulatus isolate which also had higher growth rates compared to the enrichment community mixed culture pnsb species share the same resources therefore a competitive interaction in communities could be present which might result in detrimental effects for all species little et al 2008 the results of this study are also relevant for regenerative life support systems such as the melissa loop currently using the pnsb rsp rubrum for vfa conversion clauwaert et al 2017 our results point towards rb capsulatus as a more suitable culture for intensified protein production indeed rb capsulatus is 2 6 times faster compared to rsp rubrum and will allow for a more compact and lightweight bioreactor a key advantage for space missions however also other factors ought to be taken into account for culture selection such as the broader metabolic capabilities production of metabolites and the ability to maintain genetic stability under more severe radiation clauwaert et al 2017 fig 3 presents an overview of the biomass composition protein non protein vss and fixed suspended solids fss no general trend could be observed in protein content between individual or individual and combined vfas the overall protein content of rsp rubrum was significant higher than rps palustris rb sphaeroides and equal to the enriched rb capsulatus and isolated rb capsulatus and the 3 species synthetic community vrati 1984 observed protein levels that were between 1 and 2 times higher than our results growth in a medium with carbohydrates and a higher nitrogen concentration might potentially affect the protein content vrati 1984 used clarified cow dung slurry as medium which contained 4 g l 1 carbohydrates and 10 times more nitrogen than our medium on the contrary a vfa based medium was used in our tests the degree of biomass reduction or biomass cod vss ratio was on average 1 35 g cod g 1 vss fig 3 which is comparable with values of activated sludge 1 20 1 49 g cod g 1 vss contreras et al 2002 3 3 maximizing the protein productivity in a pbr on a vfa mixture a non axenic semi continuous pbr was operated as chemostat and the effect of srt on microbial community dynamics and protein productivity g protein l 1 d 1 was studied in the batch experiments the rb capsulatus cultures had growth rates of 3 8 d 1 on combined vfas therefore it was expected that pnsb would be washed out at the corresponding dilution rate representing a srt below 0 3 d however a shorter srt of even 0 19 d 4 6 h was achieved and rhodobacter was still abundantly present fig 4 it was anticipated that implementation of high rate conditions would impose an additional selective pressure on the microbial community favoring pnsb cf fast growth on vfa and ir light leading to washout of slow growing non pnsb microorganisms the minimal attainable srt of a species i e 1 μmax is during washout higher than the actual srt imposed on the reactor therefore production of new cells will be lower than the amount that is washed out saikaly and oerther 2004 this hypothesis was in line with the findings of matassa et al 2016b they have operated a continuous bioreactor using hydrogen oxidizing bacteria for protein production at a srt of 10 h the microbial community was almost completely dominated by hydrogen oxidizing bacteria however washout effects might be more complex for mixed cultures than for pure cultures for example the srt at which washout occurs can differ because the available cod for each species will be lowered by the presence of other species saikaly and oerther 2004 the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing showed relatively high pnsb dominance during operation relative abundance around 27 60 fig 4 albeit lower than the pnsb abundance in the inoculum enrichment community 85 supplementary information fig s3 species richness was highest at a srt of 2 d decreased to 8 at a srt of 0 5 d and finally increased again to 10 11 at srt values between 0 2 and 0 3 d no extra selective pressure favoring pnsb growth could be observed at shorter srt based on the results of the diversity index however a selective microbial community low diversity index with relatively high pnsb dominance could be maintained over several srt in the pbr three pnsb genera could be detected namely rhodobacter rhodopseudomonas and rubrivivax of which the former two were most abundant the srt had an effect on relative abundance between different pnsb genera the genus rhodopseudomonas was most dominant at long srt while rhodobacter at short srt a clear distinction between the enriched rb capsulatus community and the microbial community during reactor operation is the strong presence of acinetobacter relative abundance around 25 56 members of this genus were also found in other studies investigating open mixed pnsb cultures with relative abundances of 17 3 wang et al 2016 0 05 0 6 hülsen et al 2016a and qualitative detected through dgge followed by sequencing izu et al 2001 these gram negative bacteria are known for their ability to accumulate phosphate as employed in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process kim and pagilla 2000 as phosphate accumulating organisms are typically stimulated with alteration in anaerobic and aerobic conditions it is possible that oxygen entered the pbr during withdrawal of the effluent higher headspace to volume ratio fig 5 presents an overview of the effect of srt on protein concentration g protein l 1 and protein productivity g protein l 1 d 1 protein concentration multiplied by dilution rate a general trend that can be observed is the decrease in steady state protein concentration due to higher biomass washout imposed by shorter srt yet the protein productivity increased the highest protein productivity was 0 64 g protein l 1 d 1 or expressed in dry weight 1 7 g tss l 1 d 1 achieved at a srt of 4 6 h carlozzi and sacchi 2001 have also obtained high photoheterotrophic productivities 1 1 1 4 g tss l 1 d 1 in an outdoor pbr with rps palustris as inoculum on a vfa based medium yet results are still lower than our findings probably due to natural light dark cycles to conclude the tss productivity of 1 7 g tss l 1 d 1 is according to the authors knowledge the highest reported in a pbr for a pnsb enrichment community and the first research to realize high rate pnsb production short srt an important parameter in designing a pbr on fermented wastewater is the biomass specific removal rate which was 4 5 1 4 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 srt 4 6 h in literature values for acetate propionate and butyrate of respectively 1 5 2 4 2 0 1 3 0 1 1 7 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 are reported fradinho et al 2014 puyol et al 2017 these high specific removal rates make pnsb competitive to high rate aerobic heterotrophic bacteria 1 6 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 meerburg et al 2015 however the attainable biomass concentrations are higher for aerobic heterotrophs not limited by light and therefore the volumetric cod removal rates will also be higher compared to phototrophically grown pnsb fig 6 presents an overview of the vfa removal efficiency all vfa are consumed at a srt between 1 and 2 d yet acetate and butyrate are washed out at a srt of 0 5 d and lower on the contrary the removal efficiency for propionate remained almost unchanged at a srt of around 0 5 d and was still 74 g codremoved 100 g 1 codfed at a srt of 4 6 h hence these results show that the microbial community had a preference for propionate over butyrate and acetate de meur et al 2018 has studied binary vfa mixtures with rsp rubrum and observed a lag for butyrate uptake for the mixtures acetate butyrate and propionate butyrate yet acetate and propionate were simultaneous assimilated the lag in uptake is explained by de meur et al 2018 as a metabolic mismatch due to the fact that acetate and butyrate share acetyl coa and crotonyl coa as metabolic intermediates it probably exists for microorganisms that are isocytrate lyase negative icl and use other pathways for vfa assimilation ethylmalonyl coa pathway for example rsp rubrum and rb sphaeroides alber et al 2006 kornberg and lascelles 1960 it is difficult to extrapolate the findings of de meur et al 2018 to our results because it is not possible to verify which pnsb are icl icl on a genus level and it is not known how non pnsb species contribute to the specific vfa removal more research is still required to unravel this at metabolic level for different pnsb recently puyol et al 2017 have published a phototrophic model for domestic wastewater treatment in anaerobic conditions the effect of acetate propionate on butyrate uptake is not included yet our findings show that it can be crucial new models should take these effects into account these findings are also key when operating a pbr on fermented or on synthetic medium as acetate and butyrate washout can occur at short hydraulic retention time hrt or high loading rates full vfa removal 100 g codremoved 100 g 1 codfed at 1 and 2 d srt showed that pnsb were actually underfed and thus probably higher volumetric productivities are achievable at these srt this was initially not observed because the soluble cod at a srt of 1 and 2 d was around 230 mg cod l 1 yet vfa analysis showed that the vfa concentration was zero the excess in soluble cod could possibly be due to the production of extracellular enzymes e g vitamin lipase protease amylase etc chumpol et al 2017 3 4 economic tradeoff to determine optimal srt the reactor cultivation showed an opposite influence of srt on protein productivity and harvestibility biomass concentration fig 5 a cost estimation on brewery wastewater corrected for normal costs of wastewater treatment flow 1150 m3 d 1 and cod load 2427 kg cod d 1 was therefore performed to determine the optimum srt for reactor operation including anaerobic fermentation the pbr downstream processing harvesting and drying and final wastewater treatment after pnsb production to reach discharge limits a process scheme is presented in supplementary information s6 which depicts the production of pnsb and the brewery wastewater treatment system after pnsb production the share of capital and operational expenditure capex and opex relative to total cost was respectively between 51 59 and 41 49 in general both capex and opex were dominated by the cultivation stage i e the pbr fig 7 with decreasing srt biomass production increased from 107 to 342 tonnes m 3 yr 1 three production zones can be recognized i high productivity yet high expenses srt 0 5 d ii most economical production srt of 0 5 d and cost of 10 kg 1 dry weight dw and iii low productivity and high expenses srt 0 5 d the production cost of pnsb is comparable to microalgae 5 96 12 6 kg 1 dw acien et al 2012 norsker et al 2011 yet could be reduced if sunlight would be used the capex for the artificial light system is not costly 0 5 1 5 yet the energy for light is between 13 and 28 of the opex pnsb production on sunlight could theoretically lower the production cost to 9 kg 1 dw pnsb production on sunlight is possible at high productivities as proven by carlozzi et al 2006 however for temperate climates it should be demonstrated that these high productivities are still reached during colder and darker months pnsb production will reduce the cod concentration and therefore a portion of the wastewater treatment cost will be exempted overall savings due to avoided treatment cost were between 29 000 68 000 yr 1 which accounts to 13 31 of the wastewater treatment costs without pnsb production more savings are possible if productivities further increased because final wastewater treatment can then be simplified to aerobic treatment and no additional digester is needed decoupling srt from hrt by a membrane bioreactor for example hülsen et al 2016b could increase the productivity due to higher volumetric removal rates imposed by a higher biomass concentration for now wastewater treatment after pnsb production with merely aerobic treatment was not possible because the effluent cod concentration remained too high 1 54 g cod l 1 and nutrients too low 14 mg n l 1 and 0 3 mg p l 1 if pnsb production was optimized only aerobic treatment would be required this would result in 130 000 yr 1 extra savings for the treatment system no nutrient addition taken in to account overall this cost assessment shows that a srt of 0 5 d is most optimal for pnsb production and production costs could potentially be optimized by sunlight 4 conclusions i combining the vfas acetate propionate and butyrate resulted in a boost in growth rate compared to the individual vfa for all tested pnsb cultures anaerobic fermentate of wastewater consists of a vfa mixture and might result in the same effect ii pbr experiments showed that propionate was the preferential vfa source when dosing combined vfas there is hence no use in overdosing acetate or butyrate in a synthetic medium or to steer fermentation to butyrate production acetate and butyrate washout can be problematic for a pbr at short hrt or at high loading rates iii pnsb have a near perfect substrate to biomass cod conversion when grown on vfa this roughly doubles the production potential compared to aerobic heterotrophs iv this research is first to screen a broader range of pnsb for growth on vfa from six pnsb cultures the isolated and enriched rhodobacter capsulatus obtained the highest growth rates v a biomass productivity of 1 7 g dw l 1 d 1 was achieved in the pbr the highest rate reported for a phototrophic pnsb enrichment community with a focus on production vi biomass specific removal rates of 4 5 1 4 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 were observed in the pbr pnsb are therefore competitive to aerobic heterotrophic bacteria alternative source of microbial protein on a biomass specific basis yet cannot compete on a volumetric basis vii pnsb are able to cope with very short srt their relative abundance was between 26 and 60 and the community diversity index was low 3 7 vfa and ir therefore seem suitable tools to enhance selectivity in a non axenic pbr viii rb capsulatus might be a more suitable culture than rsp rubrum for regenerative life support systems for space with a focus on compact reactors ix the reactor cultivation showed an opposite influence of srt 0 19 1 85 d on protein productivity and harvestibility an economic estimation for pnsb production enabled to the derivation of 0 5 days srt as the most cost efficient for biomass production at a cost of 10 kg 1 dw

anaerobic generation of volatile fatty acids vfas followed by photoheterotrophic production of purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb with infrared light this study aimed to determine the most suitable pnsb

recovery from industrial wastewater enabling high rate pnsb production graphical abstract image 1 keywords short chain fatty acids single cell protein carboxylate platform phototrophic purple bacteria carbon capture 1 introduction the conventional fertilizer feed food fork chain is a cascade of inefficiencies steffen et al 2015 for every 100 units nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer applied to the land only 14 units are consumed by citizens coppens et al 2016 upgrading resources from wastewater to microbial biomass could improve the efficiency of the food chain with this protein rich product used as ingredient in animal feed preparations in this domain affordability implies the need for non axenic cultivation of microbial communities wastewater contains organics and heterotrophic microorganisms are therefore required to upgrade these streams to protein however wastewater typically holds a variable mixture of organic molecules of diverse complexity such as polysaccharides proteins fatty acids n acetylamino sugars dna and polyphenolic structures dignac et al 2000 posing a challenge to selectively and reproducibly produce heterotrophic biomass moreover from a market perspective resource recovery will be most attractive if microbial protein can be produced controllable with a constant quality verstraete et al 2016 therefore a two stage approach was conceptually proposed anaerobically converting organics to volatile fatty acids vfas followed by microbial protein production alloul et al 2018 anaerobic fermentation is defined as the conversion of more complex organics to a mixture of vfa rich in acetate propionate and butyrate agler et al 2011 cagnetta et al 2016 this conversion entails hydrolysis of particulate matter followed by the production of acids acidogenesis and acetogenesis and co2 and h2 methanogenesis i e ch4 formation is avoided agler et al 2011 this microbiological process allows to normalize the organic variability over time ahn et al 2001 banerjee et al 1999 and the produced vfa with the corresponding low ph might act as a means to reduce contamination of the influent the toxicity of vfa for microorganisms is well described in literature sun and o riordan 2013 and anaerobic digestion leads to a die off of pathogens wagner et al 2008 similar results might therefore be expected for anaerobic fermentation two metabolic types of heterotrophic bacteria are of particular interest for protein production namely aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and photoheterotropic bacteria verstraete et al 2016 aerobic heterotrophs have been explored for microbial protein production from the early 1950s vriens et al 1989 and are pioneering in both research and pilot implementation lee et al 2015 matassa et al 2016a they are characterized

protein they perform anoxygenic photosynthesis and use organics as electron donor and carbon source unlike algae they are not able to use water as electron donor but require molecules with lower redox potential than water such as vfas blankenship et al 1995 they grow at rates between 1 51 and 1 69 d 1 for mixed cultures hülsen et al 2014 kaewsuk et al 2010 and between 0 96 and 7 10 d 1 for pure

compared to aerobic heterotrophs pnsb offer an additional steering tool to manage the microbial selectivity due to their unique ability to grow under anaerobic conditions on infrared ir light in the case of sewage treatment for instance with ir irradiation a pnsb abundance of up to 90 was achieved hülsen et al 2016a 2016b to date there are a number of research articles focusing on one stage direct pnsb production on different types of industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater with pure cultures and open mixed cultures hülsen et al 2016b kornochalert et al 2014 liu et al 2016 loo et al 2013 lu et al 2013 ponsano et al 2011 wu et al 2015 for a two stage approach with anaerobic fermentation preceding the photoheterotrophic reactor only two approaches are available starting from solid streams implementing the fermentation stage as a liquefaction stage one study has investigated fecal matter and plant material clauwaert et al 2017 and another settled diluted kitchen waste wang et al 2016 on industrial wastewater from food beverage with the organics mainly in solution such two stage approach has not yet been explored previous studies that have investigated pnsb in a vfa based medium have studied the vfa biomass yield relationship for rhodobacter sphaeroides nakajima et al 1997 van niel 1944 the effect of a vfa mixture on polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation with an enrichment community holding rhodopseudomonas sp fradinho et al 2014 and the molecular mechanism of vfa assimilation for rhodospirillum rubrum de meur et al 2018 a broader screening of pnsb for vfa growth kinetics and microbial selectivity imposed by vfa during non axenic cultivation has according to the authors knowledge not been investigated therefore the first goal of this research was culture selection by determining the fastest growing pnsb on vfa along with their protein content and biomass yield six different cultures were investigated of which three pure cultures a 3 species synthetic community to study potential synergetic effects a community enriched on a vfa mixture to obtain a pnsb community specialized in vfa conversion and the isolated species to verify the findings of the latter secondly this research wanted to unravel whether individual vfa or a vfa mixture had an impact on growth kinetics since anaerobic fermented wastewater typically consists of a vfa mixture afterwards the enrichment community which had obtained a very good performance during the batch test was used as inoculum in a photobioreactor pbr here it was the objective to investigate the effect of sludge retention time srt on microbial community dynamics and protein productivity the findings of the pbr were finally used as input for an economic based optimization of the srt production cost for anaerobic fermentation of brewery wastewater pnsb cultivation harvesting and drying were estimated and operational strategies were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 psnb strains and communities to screen for the best pnsb culture for growth on vfa six cultures were pre selected i rhodopseudomonas palustris lmg 18881 ii rhodobacter sphaeroides lmg 2827 and iii rhodospirillum rubrum s1h along with iv a 3 species synthetic community i ii iii v an enrichment community and vi rb capsulatus isolated from the latter through dilution to extinction the pure cultures were axenically pre cultivated in a climate chamber snijders scientific with a pre autoclaved vfa based medium adapted from imhoff 2006 the details are presented in supplementary information s1 the enrichment community was obtained by incubating a 1 1 1 volatile suspended solids ratio 0 1 g vss l 1 each of activated sludge from a sewage treatment plant activated sludge from a dairy wastewater treatment plant and sediment from a local pond with a vfa mixture and ir light to acquire a pnsb culture specialized in vfa conversion after twenty four hours of incubation carotenoid 320 and 380 nm

presented in supplementary information s2 2 2 batch experiments the growth of the six abovementioned cultures four strains and two communities was examined in a 500 ml erlenmeyer with a working volume of 400 ml through batch incubation the experiments for the pure cultures and the 3 species synthetic community were performed in the climate chamber conditions ibid supplementary information s1 the experiment with the enrichment community was executed on a bench with ir transmission filters conditions ibid supplementary information s2 three individual vfa were tested in triplicate equal amount

basis 0 24 g acetic acid l 1 0 20 g propionic acid l 1 and 0 18 g butyric acid l 1 the ph was adjusted to 7 0 prior to the experiment by the addition of 12 m naoh the flasks were then inoculated at an optical density of 0 1 absorbance at 660 nm the growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 660 nm samples were taken at the start 15 ml and the end of the test 100 ml 2 3 photobioreactor experiment a non axenic semi continuous pbr was operated to study the effect of srt on microbial community dynamics and protein productivity the pbr was a vertical tubular vessel with a working volume of 2 75 l and an external diameter of 12 cm it was operated for 51 days at a temperature of 30 2 c and illuminated with two halogen lamps at a light intensity of 30 w m 2 covered with ir transmission filters stirring was done with a magnetic stirrer at 720 rpm fisher scientific usa the reactor was inoculated with biomass from the enrichment community the headspace of the reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas and the gas outlet was connected to a nitrogen gas expansion balloon in order to cope with underpressure and overpressure during withdrawal and fill influent and effluent tubing was covered with aluminum foil to minimize phototrophic growth a growth experiment of forty eight hours with a vfa mixture 1 1 1 ratio on carbon mass basis 0 73 g acetic acid l 1 0 60 g propionic acid l 1 and 0 54 g butyric acid l 1 was performed prior to reactor operation to determine the maximal possible biomass concentration before light limitations occurred supplementary information s3 the maximal biomass concentration was converted to a vfa concentration at which growth would not be limited by carbon i e 1 g chemical oxygen demand cod l 1 by assuming a yield of 1 g codbiomass g 1 codvfa the cod of the vfa mixture described in subsection 2 2 was adapted to 1 g cod l 1 and used as influent for the reactor the ph of the pbr was not controlled yet the influent ph was lowered with 12 m hcl in order to have a final ph of 7 0 in the effluent ph rises due to vfa consumption the reactor was operated at six different srt by altering the volumetric flow rate l d 1 an overview of reactor conditions during operation is presented in supplementary information s4 the volume exchange ratio was initially set at 13 and later on altered to 25 one up to four four at short srt samples were taken daily to monitor the optical density 660 nm ph temperature and electrical conductivity steady state conditions were defined as a maximal change of 10 in optical density proxy for biomass concentration ph temperature and electrical conductivity for three successive srt samples for further analyses were taken three sequential srt after steady state conditions were reached 2 4 analytical procedures the cod was measured using photometric test kits merck germany the biomass yield was determined by measuring removed cod i e soluble codstart minus soluble codend and biomass cod i e total cod minus soluble cod protein was determined according to an adapted lowry procedure markwell et al 1978 vfa were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography agilent technologies 1200 coupled with a diode array detector 210 nm a bio rad aminex column 300 mm 7 8 mm with bio rad micro guard cation h refill cartridges and a column temperature of 40 c the samples were injected into 50 mm h2so4 honeywell fluka in deionised water arium 611 with an injection volume of 20 μl and a sample flow rate of 0 6 ml min 1 total suspended solids tss and vss were determined according to standard methods greenberg et al 1992 handheld meters were used to measure ph hanna instruments usa and electrical conductivity hanna instruments usa 2 5 molecular microbial and phylogenetic analyses molecular microbial analysis was used to characterize the most abundant pnsb in the enrichment characterize the isolated species of the latter and follow up richness shannon index diversity and pnsb abundance during reactor operation phylogenetic relationships between the 16s rrna gene sequence of the isolated species was done in order to classify the species a sample for microbial analysis was taken after four days of incubation the most dominant species of the enrichment community was isolated using the dilution to extinction method biomass samples of the pbr were collected at three successive srt when steady state was reached dna was extracted using a powerfecal dna isolation kit qiagen germany according to the manufacturer s instruction the microbial community was analyzed using high throughput 16s amplicon sequencing and a dual index strategy as described by kozich et al 2013 a detailed description can be found in supplementary information s5 for the isolate pcr products were sequenced using sanger sequencing with both 8f and 1525r primers genetic service facility antwerp editing complete overlapping and consensus construction was performed with the geneious software the consensus sequences were annotated with sequences in the ezbiocloud database chunlab inc korea mega7 software was used to conduct phylogenetic analysis kumar et al 2016 the phylogenetic tree was built using the maximum likelihood method based on the general time reversible model nei and kumar 2000 the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the maximum parsimony method in total 1000 bootstrap replications were performed to test for branch robustness 2 6 statistical analyses multiple comparisons were performed using the parametric analysis of variance test and post hoc pairwise comparisons using the tukey s range test homogeneity of variances was verified by executing a levene s test and normality of data residuals using the shapiro wilk normality test the non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test and post hoc pairwise comparisons using the mann whitney u test p values were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg correction were performed when normality was rejected a significance level of p 0 05 was chosen all analyses were performed in r using rstudio rstudio usa for windows r core team 2017 2 7 economic estimation an economic evaluation was performed to validate the optimal srt for pnsb production according to a four step methodology which is thoroughly described in supplementary information s6 the following parameters were taken into account such as construction piping pbr circulation pump ultrafiltration unit centrifuge spray dryer etc an overview of all cost parameters is presented in supplementary information table s1 after pnsb production wastewater still need to be treated to reach effluent discharge limits the wastewater treatment cost that are prevented due to pnsb production remove part of cod are taken into account in the model yet valorization of biogas is not included process steps that are animal specific such as nucleic acid removal endotoxin removal and pasteurization were not taken into account in the estimation in addition our process is an open systems and thus potentially prone to pathogens therefore we opt for a multiple barrier principle as discussed by alloul et al 2018 which entails the following steps i inactivation of pathogens during anaerobic fermentation ii solid liquid separation after anaerobic fermentation iii selective culture conditions pnsb on infrared light iv drying and pasteurization of biomass the primary goal of this model was to determine the best srt to operate the pbr it was not intended to determine an accurate production cost of pnsb for brewery wastewater on full scale which than can be used for other research this cost estimation ought to be seen as a decision making tool for r d and the corresponding production scheme can be used as example for further research 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment community the results of the microbial community analysis of the pnsb enrichment can be found in supplementary information s5 and show an almost complete dominance of pnsb 85 relative abundance the community was dominated by an amplicon sequence variant with a relative abundance of 80 which was classified as rhodobacter gemmobacter ezbiocloud database two other pnsb genera were also present although in low abundance 3 rhodopseudomonas 2 pararhodospirillum of note the short v4 region of the 16s rrna gene probably does not allow to differentiate between some rhodobacter gemmobacter species to further characterize the most abundant pnsb and determine whether the amplicon sequence variant corresponds to rhodobacter or gemmobacter a dilution to extinction method was applied to obtain an isolate which was subjected to sanger sequencing of the full 16s rrna gene 1500 bp phylogenetic analysis of this sequence together with other closely related species showed that this isolate could be classified as a rhodobacter capsulatus strain fig 1 due to dominance of rb capsulatus in the enrichment we expected that growth performance of this strain would be above par growth rates for rb capsulatus between 4 9 and 5 4 d 1 are described in literature willison 1988 which are lower than values found for rb sphaeroides 7 4 d 1 sangkharak and prasertsan 2007 however both results are for pure cultures derived from mutant strains it is therefore difficult to draw conclusive statement about the growth performance of rb capsulatus on vfa therefore in section 3 2 we will compare growth rates for several culture on individual and combined vfas 3 2 pnsb growth kinetics for individual and combined vfa batch experiments were performed to explore the effect of individual and combined vfas on the biomass yield and growth rate and screen within the six cultures for the most productive i e fastest growing microorganism on vfa fig 2 presents the biomass yield which was overall between 0 9 and 1 1 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved there was no significant difference p 0 05 between individual vfa or individual and combined vfas or between different species and communities pnsb have a biomass yield equal to 1 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved and even higher due to photo assimilation of a highly reduced electron donor i e propionate and butyrate along with co2 that serves as electron sink to compensate for excess reducing power blankenship et al 1995 nakajima et al 1997 and van niel 1944 have also observed a biomass yield of respectively 0 8 and between 0 8 and 0 9 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved yet these researchers only studied rb sphaeroides the near perfect substrate to biomass conversion is a critical advantage of pnsb compared to aerobic heterotrophs as roughly a double production potential is possible with a given amount of cod in the wastewater yield 0 57 g codbiomass g 1 codremoved tchobanoglous et al 2003 for the growth rate a change in individual vfa had no effect as observed for all species and communities fig 2 the most remarkable observation during the batch test is the boost in growth rate when pnsb are fed with combined vfas this enhanced growth rate effect was noticeable for rps palustris rb sphaeroides rsp rubrum and the 3 species synthetic community the boost in growth rate was between 1 3 and 2 5 times higher compared too individual vfa most pronounced for rsp rubrum the absolute value for the enriched rb capsulatus and the isolated rb capsulatus was higher for combined vfas yet there was no significant difference between acetate and the vfa mixture p 0 05 the study of nakajima et al 1997 did not observe a growth rate enhancement effect for individual vfa acetate propionate and butyrate compared to three different combined vfa ratios 1 1 1 2 1 1 and 12 2 1 g carbon for respectively acetate propionate and butyrate this is probably due to the lack of sampling points during the exponential phase resulting in flattening down of the exponential correlation moreover only rb sphaeroides was tested without any replicates which makes it difficult to draw general conclusions more recently the study of fradinho et al 2014 has observed higher growth rates consumption rate multiplied by biomass yield for combined vfas 1 53 d 1 compared to acetate 1 22 d 1 in line with our results they studied the effect of a vfa mixture 4 1 1 g carbon on polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation with an enrichment community holding rhodopseudomonas spp the effect of combined vfas is probably due to the presence of acetate as co substrate without acetate the consumption of propionate and butyrate is limited by an internal acetyl coa deficit fradinho et al 2014 overall our study is the first broader screening of pnsb for growth on vfa the results highlight that a vfa mixture and therefore likely fermented wastewater is a more suitable substrate to produce pnsb at high rate compared to individual vfa however the vfa ratio can change for a fermentate depending on the operational conditions lee et al 2014 future research should therefore further unravel the effects of different vfa carbon ratios the isolated rb capsulatus had the highest growth rates for all individual and combined vfas therefore this culture might have the best potential to grow on fermentate due to the context of the application which is resource recovery on wastewater we choose to proceed with a non axenic reactor and non axenic culture which is the enriched rb capsulatus growth rates of the isolated rb capsulatus were 1 3 1 8 times higher compared to the enriched rb capsulatus a similar observation can be made for the 3 species synthetic community which was the mixture of rps palustris rb sphaeroides rsp rubrum growth rates of rb sphaeroides best individual performance of three species for acetate and the combined vfas were respectively 1 4 and 1 7 times higher compared to the 3 species synthetic community this compares to the results of the rb capsulatus isolate which also had higher growth rates compared to the enrichment community mixed culture pnsb species share the same resources therefore a competitive interaction in communities could be present which might result in detrimental effects for all species little et al 2008 the results of this study are also relevant for regenerative life support systems such as the melissa loop currently using the pnsb rsp rubrum for vfa conversion clauwaert et al 2017 our results point towards rb capsulatus as a more suitable culture for intensified protein production indeed rb capsulatus is 2 6 times faster compared to rsp rubrum and will allow for a more compact and lightweight bioreactor a key advantage for space missions however also other factors ought to be taken into account for culture selection such as the broader metabolic capabilities production of metabolites and the ability to maintain genetic stability under more severe radiation clauwaert et al 2017 fig 3 presents an overview of the biomass composition protein non protein vss and fixed suspended solids fss no general trend could be observed in protein content between individual or individual and combined vfas the overall protein content of rsp rubrum was significant higher than rps palustris rb sphaeroides and equal to the enriched rb capsulatus and isolated rb capsulatus and the 3 species synthetic community vrati 1984 observed protein levels that were between 1 and 2 times higher than our results growth in a medium with carbohydrates and a higher nitrogen concentration might potentially affect the protein content vrati 1984 used clarified cow dung slurry as medium which contained 4 g l 1 carbohydrates and 10 times more nitrogen than our medium on the contrary a vfa based medium was used in our tests the degree of biomass reduction or biomass cod vss ratio was on average 1 35 g cod g 1 vss fig 3 which is comparable with values of activated sludge 1 20 1 49 g cod g 1 vss contreras et al 2002 3 3 maximizing the protein productivity in a pbr on a vfa mixture a non axenic semi continuous pbr was operated as chemostat and the effect of srt on microbial community dynamics and protein productivity g protein l 1 d 1 was studied in the batch experiments the rb capsulatus cultures had growth rates of 3 8 d 1 on combined vfas therefore it was expected that pnsb would be washed out at the corresponding dilution rate representing a srt below 0 3 d however a shorter srt of even 0 19 d 4 6 h was achieved and rhodobacter was still abundantly present fig 4 it was anticipated that implementation of high rate conditions would impose an additional selective pressure on the microbial community favoring pnsb cf fast growth on vfa and ir light leading to washout of slow growing non pnsb microorganisms the minimal attainable srt of a species i e 1 μmax is during washout higher than the actual srt imposed on the reactor therefore production of new cells will be lower than the amount that is washed out saikaly and oerther 2004 this hypothesis was in line with the findings of matassa et al 2016b they have operated a continuous bioreactor using hydrogen oxidizing bacteria for protein production at a srt of 10 h the microbial community was almost completely dominated by hydrogen oxidizing bacteria however washout effects might be more complex for mixed cultures than for pure cultures for example the srt at which washout occurs can differ because the available cod for each species will be lowered by the presence of other species saikaly and oerther 2004 the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing showed relatively high pnsb dominance during operation relative abundance around 27 60 fig 4 albeit lower than the pnsb abundance in the inoculum enrichment community 85 supplementary information fig s3 species richness was highest at a srt of 2 d decreased to 8 at a srt of 0 5 d and finally increased again to 10 11 at srt values between 0 2 and 0 3 d no extra selective pressure favoring pnsb growth could be observed at shorter srt based on the results of the diversity index however a selective microbial community low diversity index with relatively high pnsb dominance could be maintained over several srt in the pbr three pnsb genera could be detected namely rhodobacter rhodopseudomonas and rubrivivax of which the former two were most abundant the srt had an effect on relative abundance between different pnsb genera the genus rhodopseudomonas was most dominant at long srt while rhodobacter at short srt a clear distinction between the enriched rb capsulatus community and the microbial community during reactor operation is the strong presence of acinetobacter relative abundance around 25 56 members of this genus were also found in other studies investigating open mixed pnsb cultures with relative abundances of 17 3 wang et al 2016 0 05 0 6 hülsen et al 2016a and qualitative detected through dgge followed by sequencing izu et al 2001 these gram negative bacteria are known for their ability to accumulate phosphate as employed in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process kim and pagilla 2000 as phosphate accumulating organisms are typically stimulated with alteration in anaerobic and aerobic conditions it is possible that oxygen entered the pbr during withdrawal of the effluent higher headspace to volume ratio fig 5 presents an overview of the effect of srt on protein concentration g protein l 1 and protein productivity g protein l 1 d 1 protein concentration multiplied by dilution rate a general trend that can be observed is the decrease in steady state protein concentration due to higher biomass washout imposed by shorter srt yet the protein productivity increased the highest protein productivity was 0 64 g protein l 1 d 1 or expressed in dry weight 1 7 g tss l 1 d 1 achieved at a srt of 4 6 h carlozzi and sacchi 2001 have also obtained high photoheterotrophic productivities 1 1 1 4 g tss l 1 d 1 in an outdoor pbr with rps palustris as inoculum on a vfa based medium yet results are still lower than our findings probably due to natural light dark cycles to conclude the tss productivity of 1 7 g tss l 1 d 1 is according to the authors knowledge the highest reported in a pbr for a pnsb enrichment community and the first research to realize high rate pnsb production short srt an important parameter in designing a pbr on fermented wastewater is the biomass specific removal rate which was 4 5 1 4 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 srt 4 6 h in literature values for acetate propionate and butyrate of respectively 1 5 2 4 2 0 1 3 0 1 1 7 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 are reported fradinho et al 2014 puyol et al 2017 these high specific removal rates make pnsb competitive to high rate aerobic heterotrophic bacteria 1 6 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 meerburg et al 2015 however the attainable biomass concentrations are higher for aerobic heterotrophs not limited by light and therefore the volumetric cod removal rates will also be higher compared to phototrophically grown pnsb fig 6 presents an overview of the vfa removal efficiency all vfa are consumed at a srt between 1 and 2 d yet acetate and butyrate are washed out at a srt of 0 5 d and lower on the contrary the removal efficiency for propionate remained almost unchanged at a srt of around 0 5 d and was still 74 g codremoved 100 g 1 codfed at a srt of 4 6 h hence these results show that the microbial community had a preference for propionate over butyrate and acetate de meur et al 2018 has studied binary vfa mixtures with rsp rubrum and observed a lag for butyrate uptake for the mixtures acetate butyrate and propionate butyrate yet acetate and propionate were simultaneous assimilated the lag in uptake is explained by de meur et al 2018 as a metabolic mismatch due to the fact that acetate and butyrate share acetyl coa and crotonyl coa as metabolic intermediates it probably exists for microorganisms that are isocytrate lyase negative icl and use other pathways for vfa assimilation ethylmalonyl coa pathway for example rsp rubrum and rb sphaeroides alber et al 2006 kornberg and lascelles 1960 it is difficult to extrapolate the findings of de meur et al 2018 to our results because it is not possible to verify which pnsb are icl icl on a genus level and it is not known how non pnsb species contribute to the specific vfa removal more research is still required to unravel this at metabolic level for different pnsb recently puyol et al 2017 have published a phototrophic model for domestic wastewater treatment in anaerobic conditions the effect of acetate propionate on butyrate uptake is not included yet our findings show that it can be crucial new models should take these effects into account these findings are also key when operating a pbr on fermented or on synthetic medium as acetate and butyrate washout can occur at short hydraulic retention time hrt or high loading rates full vfa removal 100 g codremoved 100 g 1 codfed at 1 and 2 d srt showed that pnsb were actually underfed and thus probably higher volumetric productivities are achievable at these srt this was initially not observed because the soluble cod at a srt of 1 and 2 d was around 230 mg cod l 1 yet vfa analysis showed that the vfa concentration was zero the excess in soluble cod could possibly be due to the production of extracellular enzymes e g vitamin lipase protease amylase etc chumpol et al 2017 3 4 economic tradeoff to determine optimal srt the reactor cultivation showed an opposite influence of srt on protein productivity and harvestibility biomass concentration fig 5 a cost estimation on brewery wastewater corrected for normal costs of wastewater treatment flow 1150 m3 d 1 and cod load 2427 kg cod d 1 was therefore performed to determine the optimum srt for reactor operation including anaerobic fermentation the pbr downstream processing harvesting and drying and final wastewater treatment after pnsb production to reach discharge limits a process scheme is presented in supplementary information s6 which depicts the production of pnsb and the brewery wastewater treatment system after pnsb production the share of capital and operational expenditure capex and opex relative to total cost was respectively between 51 59 and 41 49 in general both capex and opex were dominated by the cultivation stage i e the pbr fig 7 with decreasing srt biomass production increased from 107 to 342 tonnes m 3 yr 1 three production zones can be recognized i high productivity yet high expenses srt 0 5 d ii most economical production srt of 0 5 d and cost of 10 kg 1 dry weight dw and iii low productivity and high expenses srt 0 5 d the production cost of pnsb is comparable to microalgae 5 96 12 6 kg 1 dw acien et al 2012 norsker et al 2011 yet could be reduced if sunlight would be used the capex for the artificial light system is not costly 0 5 1 5 yet the energy for light is between 13 and 28 of the opex pnsb production on sunlight could theoretically lower the production cost to 9 kg 1 dw pnsb production on sunlight is possible at high productivities as proven by carlozzi et al 2006 however for temperate climates it should be demonstrated that these high productivities are still reached during colder and darker months pnsb production will reduce the cod concentration and therefore a portion of the wastewater treatment cost will be exempted overall savings due to avoided treatment cost were between 29 000 68 000 yr 1 which accounts to 13 31 of the wastewater treatment costs without pnsb production more savings are possible if productivities further increased because final wastewater treatment can then be simplified to aerobic treatment and no additional digester is needed decoupling srt from hrt by a membrane bioreactor for example hülsen et al 2016b could increase the productivity due to higher volumetric removal rates imposed by a higher biomass concentration for now wastewater treatment after pnsb production with merely aerobic treatment was not possible because the effluent cod concentration remained too high 1 54 g cod l 1 and nutrients too low 14 mg n l 1 and 0 3 mg p l 1 if pnsb production was optimized only aerobic treatment would be required this would result in 130 000 yr 1 extra savings for the treatment system no nutrient addition taken in to account overall this cost assessment shows that a srt of 0 5 d is most optimal for pnsb production and production costs could potentially be optimized by sunlight 4 conclusions i combining the vfas acetate propionate and butyrate resulted in a boost in growth rate compared to the individual vfa for all tested pnsb cultures anaerobic fermentate of wastewater consists of a vfa mixture and might result in the same effect ii pbr experiments showed that propionate was the preferential vfa source when dosing combined vfas there is hence no use in overdosing acetate or butyrate in a synthetic medium or to steer fermentation to butyrate production acetate and butyrate washout can be problematic for a pbr at short hrt or at high loading rates iii pnsb have a near perfect substrate to biomass cod conversion when grown on vfa this roughly doubles the production potential compared to aerobic heterotrophs iv this research is first to screen a broader range of pnsb for growth on vfa from six pnsb cultures the isolated and enriched rhodobacter capsulatus obtained the highest growth rates v a biomass productivity of 1 7 g dw l 1 d 1 was achieved in the pbr the highest rate reported for a phototrophic pnsb enrichment community with a focus on production vi biomass specific removal rates of 4 5 1 4 g codremoved g 1 codbiomass d 1 were observed in the pbr pnsb are therefore competitive to aerobic heterotrophic bacteria alternative source of microbial protein on a biomass specific basis yet cannot compete on a volumetric basis vii pnsb are able to cope with very short srt their relative abundance was between 26 and 60 and the community diversity index was low 3 7 vfa and ir therefore seem suitable tools to enhance selectivity in a non axenic pbr viii rb capsulatus might be a more suitable culture than rsp rubrum for regenerative life support systems for space with a focus on compact reactors ix the reactor cultivation showed an opposite influence of srt 0 19 1 85 d on protein productivity and harvestibility an economic estimation for pnsb production enabled to the derivation of 0 5 days srt as the most cost efficient for biomass production at a cost of 10 kg 1 dw

19038,advanced oxidation process is one of the important process to improve the efficiency of activated sludge dewatering and digestion in this study electro fenton ef was investigated as a pretreatment method for improving activated sludge dewatering and disintegration in terms of specific resistance to filtration volatile suspended solids removal and release of soluble organics the morphology of sludge flocs and properties of extracellular polymeric substance eps were investigated to understand the involved mechanisms the results showed that ef could increase the dewaterability of activated sludge effectively in 40 60 min the size of sludge flocs decreased after ef treatment but zeta potential was elevated to near zero and floc structure became coarser with bigger holes ef could enhance the sludge floc disintegration released protein and polysaccharide to soluble eps fraction and promote the humification process the kinetic analysis further indicated that ef increased the pseudo first order eps solubilization rate ef had high operational stability by retaining over 90 initial activity even after five repeated use of dewatering filtrate this study provides a rapid and efficient solution for improving sludge dewaterability by electro fenton graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge electro fenton dewaterability floc properties humification 1 introduction with the increasing demand for water source protection more and more industrial and municipal waste water are treated in waste water treatment plants wwtps and the production of activated sludge as continues to increase xu et al 2017 nowadays as treatment and disposal have become a bottleneck in wwtps operation for as disposal is costly and inappropriate disposal will cause environment pollution fytili and zabaniotou 2008 li et al 2009 vlyssides and karlis 2004 as it known to all high water content and poor dewaterability of as represent the main obstacle for as treatment as is mainly composed of organic matters including microbial cells extracellular polymer substance eps and residue organic pollutants from waste water eskicioglu et al 2006 navab et al 2012 and these organic matters attribute mainly to the difficulty in dewatering as in another aspect these organic matters render as as a kind of bio resource for reclaimation of bio energy carbon source nitrogen and phosphorus park and kim 2015 zahedi et al 2017 zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 to reduce as treatment cost and improve efficiency of following resource recovery processes many attentions had been focused on how to increase dewaterability and degradability of as through efficient pre treatment methods feki et al 2015 neyens et al 2004 yuan et al 2011b zahedi et al 2017 zhen et al 2014 various pre treatment technologies of as had been developed including mechanic zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 and thermal treatment abelleira et al 2012 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 enzyme chen et al 2015 chemicals cao et al 2016 zahedi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 microbiology lu et al 2018 ultrasound ning et al 2014 microwave liu et al 2016 and advanced oxidation processes aops anjum et al 2017 feki et al 2015 yuan et al 2011b these previous studies demonstrated that compressing of eps and disintegration of microbial cells in zoogloea could efficiently improve the dewaterability of as however most of these methods took a relative long time for several hours with the increasing amount of as there is a need to develop more efficient and rapid methods for the pre treatment of as among these pre treatment technologies aiming to accelerate the dewaterability and disintegration of as aops are quite effective and economical in aops highly reactive radicals oh so4 2 are generated

frequently used aops due to generation of homogenous oh divyapriya et al 2017 however the requirement of external addition of large amount of h2o2 limited its popularization in as treatment rosenfeldt et al 2006 to overcome the drawbacks of traditional fenton process electro fenton ef process was developed the continuous electro generation of h2o2 and simultaneous cathodic regeneration of ferrous ions make ef a more advantageous and eco friendly process compared to other aops mousset et al 2016 özcan et al 2009 sirés et al 2014 as a pre treatment for sludge dewatering and disintegration ef treatment might be a novel and efficient tool so far few studies had evaluated sludge pretreatment performance of ef process and investigated the effect of ef on as flocs thus the major objectives of this study are to i investigate the possibility of pre treatment of as by ef treatment ii optimize the operation parameters of ef and iii understand the effects of as conditioning with ef to unravel the reaction mechanisms involved 2 material and methods 2 1 source of activated sludge activated sludge was collected from the membrane bioreactor in bishuiyuan wwtp nanjing china the daily waste water treatment in bishuiyuan wwtp is 100 000 m³ d the collected sludge was immediately transferred to the lab and stored in refrigerator at 4 c for 24 h prior to use after 24 h of gravity sedimentation the concentrated as was used as raw sludge the characteristics of raw sludge was given in table 1 2 2 experimental reactors the experiment reactors with a total volume of 960 ml 150 mm l 80 mm w 80 mm h were made of polymethyl methacrylate there was no electrode in acid treatment at reactor a ruo2 coated titanium electrode was used for anode and ti mesh was used as cathode in anodic oxidation treatment ao reactor moreira et al 2017 in ef reactor ruo2 coated titanium and active carbon fiber acf were used as anode and cathode respectively all electrodes were in dimension of 100 mm 70 mm 2 3 experimental sets a series of bench scale experiments were conducted in the at ao and ef reactors separately three treatments were set as at ao and ef respectively each reactor contained 500 ml raw sludge mixture and agitated using magnetic stir the initial ph was adjusted to 3 0 with sulfuric acid in all the three treatments in ao and ef system a dc stabilized voltage source 5a 60 v dc power supply china was used for power supply and final concentration of 50 mmol l na2so4 was used as electrolyte additionally final concentration of 50 mmol l fe2 was added in ef and air was bubbled with an air pump at 3 l min for continuous h2o2 generation all experiments were conducted at room temperature in triplicate to investigate the suitable conditions for as conditioning by ef the sludge were treated with different ph values ph 2 3 4 5 and 6 and current densities current density 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 ma cm2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 specific resistance to filtration assessment specific resistance to filtration srf could represent sludge dewaterability srf was measured using the vacuum filtration method as described by yuan et al 2011b briefly an aliquot of 100 ml sludge mixture was poured into a buchner funnel with a quantitative filter paper and under a pressure of 60 kpa the volume of filtrate was collected every 15 s until 15 min had elapsed srf was calculated as the slope of a linear plot of volume vs time volume 2 4 2 particle size distribution the particle size distribution of sludge flocs was measured with malvern mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd uk the whole test period of one sample was around 5 min at which the particle size reached a steady state by an equilibrium of aggregation and breakage biggs and lant 2000 the results were recorded as the particle volume percent in 100 discrete size ranges between 0 02 and 2000 μm 2 4 3 scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscope sem images of sludge were collected following the protocol described by zheng et al 2014 raw sludge and sludge collected from the three treatments were washed with deionized water for several times and fixed with 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer containing 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 12 h after being washed three times with 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer the sludge were dehydrated through an ethyl alcohol series 50 70 80 90 and 95 for 10 min at each step after dehydration sludge was freeze dried and sputtered with gold prior to sem analysis sem images were collected using a high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy at an accelerating voltage of 3 0 kv sem fei quanta 250 feg usa 2 4 4 extraction and analysis of eps 2 4 4 1 eps extraction and composition analysis a heat extraction method ge et al 2006 was used to extract the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps from the sludge sludge suspension was centrifuged at 3 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as soluble eps seps the sludge pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of 0 05 nacl solution sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min shaken horizontally at 150 r min for 10 min and sonicated again for an additional 2 min the suspension was then centrifuged at 8 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as the lb eps the residual sludge pellet was resuspended again with 15 ml 0 05 nacl sonicated for 3 min heated at 80 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min to collect tb eps all of the eps fractions were filtered through 0 22 μm filter membrane to remove the particulates prior to analysis total eps content was quantified as chemical oxygen demand cod using hach dr2800 spectrophotometer hach usa with 1 5 h digestion polysaccharides ps in eps were quantified with phenol sulphuric acid method dubois et al 1956 protein pn content in eps was measured by total protein quantitative assay kit g 250 jiancheng nanjing the kinetic of eps variation in different treatments was modeled by equations 1 and 2 chen et al 2015 1 d x d t k x 2 lnx k t b where k denotes the eps variation rate constant b is the intercept 2 4 4 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis of eps 3d eem was measured by a horiba f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation range from 200 to 450 nm and an emission range from 250 to 550 nm the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 12 000 nm min using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm the data of fluorescence spectra were plotted by orginpro 2017 five dominant peaks represented different dissolved organic material components in general peak a which is characterized by an excitation emission of energy at an ex em wavelength pair of 320 340 380 500 and peak e which is located at ex em 260 280 420 480 are associated with humic acid like organics peak b at 200 250 350 450 is associated with fulvic acid like materials peak c is located at an ex em of 270 280 330 380 associated with soluble microbial byproduct like materials and peak d ex em 200 250 300 350 is associated with aromatic protein table s1 chen et al 2003 2 4 5 other indicators hq30d hach portable ph meter hach usa was used to measure ph zeta potential was measured on a zetasizer 2000 malvern instruments uk the sludge were sonicated at 20 khz for 3 min and then settled for 15 min the supernatant was collected and analyzed for zeta potential xu et al 2018 other sludge parameters including settling volume ratio at 30 min sv30 suspended solid ss volatile suspended solid vss total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were determined using standard methods of the national environmental bureau 2002 the relationship of scod with srf was analyzed through linear regression using graphpad prism 7 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ef on sludge dewatering and disintegration performance ef was examined for its effect on sludge dewatering and disintegration performance with ao and at treatment as control after 60 min treatment srf reached 6 19 0 22 1011 m kg 18 77 reduction 5 28 0 01 1011 m kg 30 17 reduction and 2 70 0 38 1011 m kg 64 57 reduction in at ao and ef respectively fig 1 a the variation of sv30 showed that at ao and ef could improve sludge sedimentation capacity by 2 77 20 88 and 35 97 respectively fig 1b furthermore vss of sludge reduced by 6 77 18 42 and 36 89 in at ao and ef respectively indicating the disintegration and reduction of sludge solid in all treatments especially in ef treatment fig 1c in consistent with the reduction of vss scod increased to 934 62 97 44 mg l 539 19 increase in ef after 60 min treatment followed by ao 535 43 3 41 mg l 474 31 increase and at 342 62 2 67 mg l 170 44 increase which demonstrated that as solids were solubilized during these treatments fig 1d the significantly negative relationship between srf and scod claimed that disintegration of as contributed to the improvement of dewaterability fig s1 previous studies also found that disruption of cells and eps affected sludge dewatering li et al 2018 zhen et al 2013 which was in consistent with our results in at strong acid could denature eps proteins and hydrolyze glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides in eps neyens et al 2004 resulting in the moderate increase of scod fig 1d in ao the surface hydroxyl radical oh produced from the oxidation of water on ruo2 ti anode eq 3 özcan et al 2009 made ao an efficient electrochemical aops for the degradation of organic compounds oturan et al 2015 the free radical of oh could react with the organics of microbial cells resulting in eps degradation disruption of cell membrane and release of intracellular organics into the filtrate obviously aop effect of ao on vss reduction and scod release was significantly higher than the acid lysis effect in at fig 1 however the shortcoming of ao is that the generated oh is bound on the surface of electrode özcan et al 2009 which limited the reaction of oh with bulk sludge because of the mass transport limitations overall the performance of srf sv30 vss and scod in ef was significantly better than those in at and ao in ef except for acid lysis effect and surface oh produced on ruo2 ti anode fenton s reaction eq 4 mousset et al 2016 sirés et al 2014 produces oh continuously and homogenously moreira et al 2017 the contribution of homogeneous oh in the oxidation of as was much higher than that of produced in heterogeneous way such as in ao treatment özcan et al 2016 the results showed that scod increased to 1268 83 102 12 mg l at 40 min in ef and then decreased to 934 62 97 44 mg l indicating that scod was furtherly mineralized in ef 3 m h2o m oh h e 4 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 3 2 effect of ef on physicochemical and morphology properties of sludge flocs 3 2 1 floc size the variation of particle size was shown in fig 2 a the d50 of sludge flocs in ef treatment 37 07 μm was significantly smaller than ao 44 27 μm at 48 43 μm and raw sludge 58 03 μm p 0 05 the d90 of sludge flocs in ef treatment was 75 97 μm which was also significantly smaller than 88 20 μm in ao 96 43 μm in at and 280 30 μm in raw sludge it was obviously that ef provoked the disintegration of large flocs into smaller ones normally in the coagulation and flocculation processes of sludge conditioning improvement of as dewaterability was accompanied by the formation of larger floc size zhen et al 2012 and the flocs in the range of 1 100 μm were reported to have negative effect on sludge dewaterability higgins and novak 1997 however previous study showed that fine particles of sludge flocs were formed after radical oxidation by oh wu et al 2018 which is inconsistent with our results 3 2 2 zeta potential zeta potential is a critical factor in influencing sludge dewaterability zhen et al 2012 all of the three treatments significantly increased zeta potential of sludge flocs and the zeta potential in ef approached zero along with the extension of processing time fig 2b previous studies also reported that the zeta potential of the sludge particle was closer to zero when the dewatering performance was better cao et al 2016 liu et al 2012 zhen et al 2012 the functional groups on the surface of the eps such as amino group or carboxyl group give negative charges to as particles raynaud et al 2012 which often prevent sludge particles aggregation and result in loose and high water content zoogloea zhang et al 2017 after treatment groups with negative charge on the sludge surface were reduced by oh oxidiation and or charge neutralization by acid which resulted in decreased electrostatic repulsion and lowered interaction energy among sludge flocs then the flocs could aggregate to improve dewatering properties mikkelsen and keiding 2002 normally the release of electro negative biopolymers and cellular content caused by cell disruption could furtherly reduce the zeta potential of sludge flocs laurent et al 2009 zhen et al 2012 however zeta potential after ef treatment was close to 0 mv although ef caused the reduction of sludge floc size and disintegration of microbial cells fig 2b the simultaneous effect of ef on improving dewaterability reducing floc size and elevating zeta potential could be contributed to the strong oxidation capability of oh produced in ef process free radical of oh was known for its high reaction activity in breaking chemical bonds and mineralization of organic matters olvera vargas et al 2018 the removal of functional groups with charges such as nh4 and cooh in the cell wall or membrane might cause disintegration of sludge flocs by weakening the interactions among microbial cell which explained the increasingly small floc size elevated zeta potential as well as improvement of dewaterability after ef treatment wu et al 2017 3 2 3 morphology of sludge flocs to verify the changes of morphology of as under different treatment conditions the sem images of sludge floc were shown in fig 3 compared with raw as the sludge floc became coarser and denser after the treatment of at which might be explained by the denaturalization of surface protein and polysaccharide under extreme acid condition after ao treatment the structure of sludge floc became smaller indicating that anodic oxidation could substantially change the structure of the sludge floc after ef treatment the sludge flocs became finer and irregular and coarser surface and bigger pores were observed the results demonstrated that ef process caused substantial changes in the surface morphology and floc structure the roughness and porosity structures could weaken the storage capacity for water molecules kept in the fine pores of sludge finally improving the dewaterability stabnikova et al 2005 wu et al 2017 3 3 effect of ef treatment on eps distribution tb eps is eps that tightly bounds and surrounds microbial cells chen et al 2015 which contributes to the water retention ability lb eps and seps which loosely bound microbial cells contribute to sludge dewaterability chen et al 2015 the content of tb eps in at ao and ef decreased significantly in all treatments whilst the contents of seps and lb eps increased fig 4 a c indicating that tb eps was converted into lb eps and seps after treatment in at the amount of tb eps reduction was almost equivalent to the sum of lb eps and seps increase and the increase of lb eps and seps in ao was about 2 4 times of tb eps reduction seps in ef increased sharply from 175 05 19 79 mg cod l to 1068 79 13 30 mg cod l which was 6 11 times of tb eps reduction these results indicated that acid treatment could redistribute tb eps to lb eps and seps whilst aops could accelerate the transformation of tb eps to more loosely bound and soluble matters as discussed above the homogenous oh could react with extra cellular polymers and produce soluble matters of lower molecular weight making eps easier to be extracted after ef treatment chen et al 2015 the dramatic increase of seps in ef might also be attributed to the fact that microbial cells trapped in sludge were broken down by homogeneous oh generated through electro fenton reaction and intracellular substance was released into seps fraction yuan et al 2011a contrary to the continuously increase of seps in at and ao seps in ef peaked at 40 min and then decreased slowly which once again indicated that mineralization of organic matters occurred in ef kinetics evolution of the obtained data in fig 4d showed pseudo first order eps components variation kinetics in all treatment which was in agreement with previous reports chen et al 2015 yang et al 2010 the obtained rate constants of tb eps decrease were 5 72 10 3 6 47 10 3 and 16 97 10 3 min 1 for at ao and ef respectively table s2 the decrease rate of tb eps in ef was almost 2 97 and 2 62 times of that in at and ao respectively mirroring the faster redistribution of eps in ef treatment it is well known that pn and ps are key organic compounds of as chen et al 2017 many previous studies have demonstrated that the variation of pn and ps of eps influenced sludge dewatering and settling capability chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 a the pn contents were 4 88 4 58 and 43 05 mg l in seps lb eps and tb eps fractions of raw as respectively after ef treatment the pn contents approximately increased by 1076 43 and 619 65 in seps and lb eps whilst decreased by 69 20 in tb eps the ps contents in seps and lb eps also increased by 948 39 and 486 05 after ef treatment fig 5b the increase of pn and ps in seps and lb eps after ef treatment indicated that ef could modify the composition of eps fractions it was noteworthy that in accordance with increasing scod ef caused more pn and ps redistributed to seps many studies have demonstrated that the high content of pn in seps was detrimental to sludge filterability probably because of the high viscosity caused by high concentration of pn zhang et al 2014 2017 however in the case of ef high contents of pn and ps in seps did not have negative effect on dewaterability of as as discussed above strong oxidation capacity of ef could cause the damage of the membrane and release of intracellular substances which might attribute to the dramatic increase of pn and ps in seps for the method of extracting seps cannot separate soluble eps from total soluble fraction of sludge mixed liquid furthermore the high reactive activity of oh could change the chemical structure of organic matters e g protein likes and prevented extracellular proteins from forming stable colloidal aggregation and accordingly eliminated the water affinity of extracellular proteins wu et al 2017 3 4 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps to furtherly analyze the detailed changes in chemical composition of eps 3d eem is used for characterization of organic matters with the advantages of high sensitivity and selectivity henderson et al 2009 five dominant peaks representing different dissolved organic material components were detected in eps fractions table 2 fig s2 in the fraction of tb eps organic matters in raw as at and ao treatments were all characterized by peak a and peak c whilst those in ef treatment were characterized by peak a and d this difference was also observed in the fraction of lb eps and seps consolidating that ef had different modification mechanism on sludge flocs it was obviously that most of the organic matters at least the ones with fluorescence redistributed from tb eps to seps especially for the microbial byproduct like substances represented by peak c table 2 furthermore the intensity of peak a and e increased sharply in the seps fraction in ef treatment indicating the amount of humic acid like organics in seps increased after ef treatment in ef treatment disruption of polymer of pn ps etc and conversion of organic matters into humic acid like organics occurred more rapidly through condensation route polyphenol theory veeken et al 2000 as free radicals are linked forming polymer products giannakopoulos et al 2017 the humification of as organics accelerated maturation of as through polymerization of organic matter into humic acid like organics which could decrease the amount of groups with negative charges on the surface of the sludge and promote the dewaterability of as 3 5 optimization of ef on activated sludge modification several parameters such as current intensity olvera vargas et al 2014 ph loaiza ambuludi et al 2013 and catalyst concentration ammar et al 2015 impact the effectiveness of ef due to their influence on oh generation our results showed that the generation of h2o2 in ef cells increased significantly with the increasing of current intensity from 10 ma cm2 to 40 ma cm2 p 0 01 and the generation of h2o2 increased insignificantly after that p 0 05 fig s3a meanwhile srf significantly lowered from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 whilst no significant difference was observed between 30 ma cm2 and 40 ma cm2 fig s3a indicating higher electric intensity above 40 ma cm2 could not furtherly improve the performance of srf for the generation of h2o2 is the key process in electro fenton reaction the electric energy utilization efficiency was calculated in term of h2o2 generation and the result showed that the electric energy utilization efficiency decreased continuously along with the increase of current density table s3 although there was no significant difference between ph 2 4 h2o2 generation reached the highest level at ph 3 in ef system fig s3b and dropped significantly at ph 5 and 6 meanwhile the srf reduced to the lowest at ph 3 and decreased along with the increasing of current intensity fig 6 in summary electric intensity of 40 ma cm2 and ph 3 was considered as the favored parameter in ef treatment for the sake of efficiency and economy the result of scod also supported the proper current intensity and ph on sludge disintegration fig 6 3 6 reusability of the dewatering filters in fenton process the requirement for the extremely acidic condition i e ph 2 0 3 0 to keep ferrous ion content steadily is the drawback zhang et al 2015 reuse of the acid dewatering filtrate might help to reduce the consumption of ph regulator and electrolytes as well as to reduce risk of second pollution cyclic tests were conducted to evaluate the dewaterability and disintegration performance of as when dewatering filtrate were reused after five cyclic use about 60 of srf reduction was achieved and the reduction ratio of ss and vss was 33 and 25 respectively fig 7 indicating that over 90 of the initial activity remained these results suggested that the acid dewatering filtrate could be reused and remained high catalytic activity which would cut off cost and second pollution the release of scod nitrogen and phosphorus showed that reuse of dewatering filtrate could also efficiently remain the cell disintegration effect of ef fig s4 the disintegration product of as could be used to improve denitrification efficiency zubrowska sudol 2018 zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 and pre treatment of as could help to produce methane in as anaerobic digestion zahedi et al 2017 furthermore most of the nitrogen and phosphorus in filtrate were in the form of nh4 n and po4 3 p fig s5 respectively which could be recovered through chemical participation or electro treatment park and kim 2015 therefore the pre treatment of ef and cyclic usage of filtrate could improve the dewaterability of as as well as the possibility of resource reutilization of as 3 7 mechanisms of ef in activated sludge pretreatment sludge dewaterability is difficult because sludge flocs trap a certain part of bounded water which behave differently from the free water furthermore bounded water is classified as interstitial water vicinal water and water of hydration wu et al 2018 in recent study eps was proven to influence different fractions of bounded water fixed in sludge floc wu et al 2018 in the ef treatment acid firstly played a role in sludge dewatering and sedimentation performance fig 1 chen et al 2001 just as that observed in at the positive charge neutralizes the negative charge on the surface of the sludge fig 2b raynaud et al 2012 and induced compaction of sludge flocs resulting in the release of interstitial water trapped in net like sludge flocs although the effect of acid treatment was relatively weak in sludge dewatering ph determined the production rate of oh and the concentration of soluble fe2 tokumura et al 2007 which in turn affected the efficiency of ef process fig s3 the disintegration of sludge flocs and increase of soluble organic matters were also observed in ao figs 1d 2a and 4d the higher zeta potential in ao reflected that some of the hydrophilic groups in sludge flocs were destroyed by the adsorbed hydroxyl radical mox oh and solid state active oxygen mox 1 with the reduction of hydrophilic groups more vicinal water attached on organic matters could be released to bulk water in ef except for the effect of acid and ao homogenous generation of oh contributed high oxidation activity to ef the strong oxidizing oh radicals reacted with extracellular macromolecules such as eps and microbial cells trapped in sludge directly and promoted the hydrolysis of sludge flocs and the disintegration of microbial cells vaxelaire and cézac 2004 once the eps structure of the sludge was destroyed figs 3 and 4 the hard to remove interstitial and vicinal water bounded in eps were converted into free water wu et al 2018 the high react activity of oh also helped to the humification of sludge organics the humification could reduce the negative charge content and viscosity of sludge mixed liquid which offset the disadvantages caused by high content of pn and ps released into seps through cell disintegration meanwhile the disintegration of bacterial cells in the zoogloea of sludge promoted to formation of macropores in sludge flocs fig 3 which also could help the rapid release of free water from sludge flocs and help to achieve a good performance of dewatering 4 conclusion in this study the effect of activated sludge pretreatment using eletro fenton on dewatering and disintegration performance was evaluated and the changes of sludge floc properties were investigated to unravel the mechanisms involved in ef treatment ef exhibited better performance in sludge dewaterability and disintegration than acid treatment and anodic oxidation by producing high reactive homogenous hydroxyl radicals sludge flocs after ef treatment were smaller coarser with bigger holes but zeta potential approached to near zero ef could compress eps more rapidly than acid and anodic oxidation treatments and ef could accelerate process of tb eps redistribution to seps and humification treatment with 40 ma cm2 and lower ph 3 was determined to be suitable condition based on the dewatering and disintegration of sludge the extreme acid dewatering filtrate could be reused for 5 times and the conditioning performance could remain up to 90 of the initial activity declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the national water pollution control and treatment science and technology major

19038,advanced oxidation process is one of the important process to improve the efficiency of activated sludge dewatering and digestion in this study electro fenton ef was investigated as a pretreatment method for improving activated sludge dewatering and disintegration in terms of specific resistance to filtration volatile suspended solids removal and release of soluble organics the morphology of sludge flocs and properties of extracellular polymeric substance eps were investigated to understand the involved mechanisms the results showed that ef could increase the dewaterability of activated sludge effectively in 40 60 min the size of sludge flocs decreased after ef treatment but zeta potential was elevated to near zero and floc structure became coarser with bigger holes ef could enhance the sludge floc disintegration released protein and polysaccharide to soluble eps fraction and promote the humification process the kinetic analysis further indicated that ef increased the pseudo first order eps solubilization rate ef had high operational stability by retaining over 90 initial activity even after five repeated use of dewatering filtrate this study provides a rapid and efficient solution for improving sludge dewaterability by electro fenton graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge electro fenton dewaterability floc properties humification 1 introduction with the increasing demand for water source protection more and more industrial and municipal waste water are treated in waste water treatment plants wwtps and the production of activated sludge as continues to increase xu et al 2017 nowadays as treatment and disposal have become a bottleneck in wwtps operation for as disposal is costly and inappropriate disposal will cause environment pollution fytili and zabaniotou 2008 li et al 2009 vlyssides and karlis 2004 as it known to all high water content and poor dewaterability of as represent the main obstacle for as treatment as is mainly composed of organic matters including microbial cells extracellular polymer substance eps and residue organic pollutants from waste water eskicioglu et al 2006 navab et al 2012 and these organic matters attribute mainly to the difficulty in dewatering as in another aspect these organic matters render as as a kind of bio resource for reclaimation of bio energy carbon source nitrogen and phosphorus park and kim 2015 zahedi et al 2017 zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 to reduce as treatment cost and improve efficiency of following resource recovery processes many attentions had been focused on how to increase dewaterability and degradability of as through efficient pre treatment methods feki et al 2015 neyens et al 2004 yuan et al 2011b zahedi et al 2017 zhen et al 2014 various pre treatment technologies of as had been developed including mechanic zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 and thermal treatment abelleira et al 2012 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 enzyme chen et al 2015

et al 2017 feki et al 2015 yuan et al 2011b these previous studies demonstrated that compressing of eps and disintegration of microbial cells in zoogloea could efficiently improve the dewaterability of as however most of these methods took a relative long time for several hours with the increasing amount of as there is a need to develop more efficient and rapid methods for the pre treatment of as among these pre treatment technologies aiming to accelerate the dewaterability and disintegration of as aops are quite effective and economical in aops highly reactive radicals oh so4 2 are generated

frequently used aops due to generation of homogenous oh divyapriya et al 2017 however the requirement of external addition of large amount of h2o2 limited its popularization in as treatment rosenfeldt et al 2006 to overcome the drawbacks of traditional fenton process electro fenton ef process was developed the continuous electro generation of h2o2 and simultaneous cathodic regeneration of ferrous ions make ef a more advantageous and eco friendly process compared to other aops mousset et al 2016 özcan et al 2009 sirés et al 2014 as a pre treatment for sludge dewatering and disintegration ef treatment might be a novel and efficient tool so far few studies had evaluated sludge pretreatment performance of ef process and investigated the effect of ef on as flocs thus the major objectives of this study are to i investigate the possibility of pre treatment of as by ef treatment ii optimize the operation parameters of ef and iii understand the effects of as conditioning with ef to unravel the reaction mechanisms involved 2 material and methods 2 1 source of activated sludge activated sludge was collected from the membrane bioreactor in bishuiyuan wwtp nanjing china the daily waste water treatment in bishuiyuan wwtp is 100 000 m³ d the collected sludge was immediately transferred to the lab and stored in refrigerator at 4 c for 24 h prior to use after 24 h of gravity sedimentation the concentrated as was used as raw sludge the characteristics of raw sludge was given in table 1 2 2 experimental reactors the experiment reactors with a total volume of 960 ml 150 mm l 80 mm w 80 mm h were made of polymethyl methacrylate there was no electrode in acid treatment at reactor a ruo2 coated titanium electrode was used for anode and ti mesh was used as cathode in anodic oxidation treatment ao reactor moreira et al 2017 in ef reactor ruo2 coated titanium and active carbon fiber acf were used as anode and cathode respectively all electrodes were in dimension of 100 mm

specific resistance to filtration srf could represent sludge dewaterability srf was measured using the vacuum filtration method as described by yuan et al 2011b briefly an aliquot of 100 ml sludge mixture was poured into a buchner funnel with a quantitative filter paper and under a pressure of 60 kpa the volume of filtrate was collected every 15 s until 15 min had elapsed srf was calculated as the slope of a linear plot of volume vs time volume 2 4 2 particle size distribution the particle size distribution of sludge flocs was measured with malvern mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd uk the whole test period of one sample was around 5 min at which the particle size reached a steady state by an equilibrium of aggregation and breakage biggs and lant 2000 the results were recorded as the particle volume percent in 100 discrete size ranges between 0 02 and 2000 μm 2 4 3 scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscope sem images of sludge were collected following the protocol described by zheng et al 2014 raw sludge and sludge collected from the three treatments were washed with deionized water for several times and fixed with 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer containing 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 12 h after being washed three times with 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer the sludge were dehydrated through an ethyl alcohol series 50 70 80 90 and 95 for 10 min at each step after dehydration sludge was freeze dried and sputtered with gold prior to sem analysis sem images were collected using a high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy at an accelerating voltage of 3 0 kv sem fei quanta 250 feg usa 2 4 4 extraction and analysis of eps 2 4 4 1 eps extraction and composition analysis a heat extraction method ge et al 2006 was used to extract the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps from the sludge sludge suspension was centrifuged at 3 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as soluble eps seps the sludge pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of 0 05 nacl solution sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min shaken horizontally at 150 r min for 10 min and sonicated again for an additional 2 min the suspension was then centrifuged at 8 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as the lb eps the residual sludge pellet was resuspended again with 15 ml 0 05 nacl sonicated for 3 min heated at 80 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min to collect tb eps all of the eps fractions were filtered through 0 22 μm filter membrane to remove the particulates prior to analysis total eps content was quantified as chemical oxygen demand cod using hach dr2800 spectrophotometer hach usa with 1 5 h digestion polysaccharides ps in eps were quantified with phenol sulphuric acid method dubois et al 1956 protein pn content in eps was measured by total protein quantitative assay kit g 250 jiancheng nanjing the kinetic of eps variation in different treatments was modeled by equations 1 and 2 chen et al 2015 1 d x d t k x 2 lnx k t b where k denotes the eps variation rate constant b is the intercept 2 4 4 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis of eps 3d eem was measured by a horiba f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation range from 200 to 450 nm and an emission range from 250 to 550 nm the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 12 000 nm min using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm the data of fluorescence spectra were plotted by orginpro 2017 five dominant peaks represented different dissolved organic material components in general peak a which is characterized by an excitation emission of energy at an ex em wavelength pair of 320 340 380 500 and peak e which is located at ex em 260 280 420 480 are associated with humic acid like organics peak b at 200 250 350 450 is associated with fulvic acid like materials peak c is located at an ex em of 270 280 330 380 associated with soluble microbial byproduct like materials and peak d ex em 200 250 300 350 is associated with aromatic protein table s1 chen et al 2003 2 4 5 other indicators hq30d hach portable ph meter hach usa was used to measure ph zeta potential was measured on a zetasizer 2000 malvern instruments uk the sludge were sonicated at 20 khz for 3 min and then settled for 15 min the supernatant was collected and analyzed for zeta potential xu et al 2018 other sludge parameters including settling volume ratio at 30 min sv30 suspended solid ss volatile suspended solid vss total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were determined using standard methods of the national environmental bureau 2002 the relationship of scod with srf was analyzed through linear regression using graphpad prism 7 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ef on sludge dewatering and disintegration performance ef was examined for its effect on sludge dewatering and disintegration performance with ao and at treatment as control after 60 min treatment srf reached 6 19 0 22 1011 m kg 18 77 reduction 5 28 0 01 1011 m kg 30 17 reduction and 2 70 0 38 1011 m kg 64 57 reduction in at ao and ef respectively fig 1 a the variation of sv30 showed that at ao and ef could improve sludge sedimentation capacity by 2 77 20 88 and 35 97 respectively fig 1b furthermore vss of sludge reduced by 6 77 18 42 and 36 89 in at ao and ef respectively indicating the disintegration and reduction of sludge solid in all treatments especially in ef treatment fig 1c in consistent with the reduction of vss scod increased to 934 62 97 44 mg l 539 19 increase in ef after 60 min treatment followed by ao 535 43 3 41 mg l 474 31 increase and at 342 62 2 67 mg l 170 44 increase which demonstrated that as solids were solubilized during these treatments fig 1d the significantly negative relationship between srf and scod claimed that disintegration of as contributed to the improvement of dewaterability fig s1 previous studies also found that disruption of cells and eps affected sludge dewatering li et al 2018 zhen et al 2013 which was in consistent with our results in at strong acid could denature eps proteins and hydrolyze glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides in eps neyens et al 2004 resulting in the moderate increase of scod fig 1d in ao the surface hydroxyl radical oh produced from the oxidation of water on ruo2 ti anode eq 3 özcan et al 2009 made ao an efficient electrochemical aops for the degradation of organic compounds oturan et al 2015 the free radical of oh could react with the organics of microbial cells resulting in eps degradation disruption of cell membrane and release of intracellular organics into the filtrate obviously aop effect of ao on vss reduction and scod release was significantly higher than the acid lysis effect in at fig 1 however the shortcoming of ao is that the generated oh is bound on the surface of electrode özcan et al 2009 which limited the reaction of oh with bulk sludge because of the mass transport limitations overall the performance of srf sv30 vss and scod in ef was significantly better than those in at and ao in ef except for acid lysis effect and surface oh produced on ruo2 ti anode fenton s reaction eq 4 mousset et al 2016 sirés et al 2014 produces oh continuously and homogenously moreira et al 2017 the contribution of homogeneous oh in the oxidation of as was much higher than that of produced in heterogeneous way such as in ao treatment özcan et al 2016 the results showed that scod increased to 1268 83 102 12 mg l at 40 min in ef and then decreased to 934 62 97 44 mg l indicating that scod was furtherly mineralized in ef 3 m h2o m oh h e 4 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 3 2 effect of ef on physicochemical and morphology properties of sludge flocs 3 2 1 floc size the variation of particle size was shown in fig 2 a the d50 of sludge flocs in ef treatment 37 07 μm was significantly smaller than ao 44 27 μm at 48 43 μm and raw sludge 58 03 μm p 0 05 the d90 of sludge flocs in ef treatment was 75 97 μm which was also significantly smaller than 88 20 μm in ao 96 43 μm in at and 280 30 μm in raw sludge it was obviously that ef provoked the disintegration of large flocs into smaller ones normally in the coagulation and flocculation processes of sludge conditioning improvement of as dewaterability was accompanied by the formation of larger floc size zhen et al 2012 and the flocs in the range of 1 100 μm were reported to have negative effect on sludge dewaterability higgins and novak 1997 however previous study showed that fine particles of sludge flocs were formed after radical oxidation by oh wu et al 2018 which is inconsistent with our results 3 2 2 zeta potential zeta potential is a critical factor in influencing sludge dewaterability zhen et al 2012 all of the three treatments significantly increased zeta potential of sludge flocs and the zeta potential in ef approached zero along with the extension of processing time fig 2b previous studies also reported that the zeta potential of the sludge particle was closer to zero when the dewatering performance was better cao et al 2016 liu et al 2012 zhen et al 2012 the functional groups on the surface of the eps such as amino group or carboxyl group give negative charges to as particles raynaud et al 2012 which often prevent sludge particles aggregation and result in loose and high water content zoogloea zhang et al 2017 after treatment groups with negative charge on the sludge surface were reduced by oh oxidiation and or charge neutralization by acid which resulted in decreased electrostatic repulsion and lowered interaction energy among sludge flocs then the flocs could aggregate to improve dewatering properties mikkelsen and keiding 2002 normally the release of electro negative biopolymers and cellular content caused by cell disruption could furtherly reduce the zeta potential of sludge flocs laurent et al 2009 zhen et al 2012 however zeta potential after ef treatment was close to 0 mv although ef caused the reduction of sludge floc size and disintegration of microbial cells fig 2b the simultaneous effect of ef on improving dewaterability reducing floc size and elevating zeta potential could be contributed to the strong oxidation capability of oh produced in ef process free radical of oh was known for its high reaction activity in breaking chemical bonds and mineralization of organic matters olvera vargas et al 2018 the removal of functional groups with charges such as nh4 and cooh in the cell wall or membrane might cause disintegration of sludge flocs by weakening the interactions among microbial cell which explained the increasingly small floc size elevated zeta potential as well as improvement of dewaterability after ef treatment wu et al 2017 3 2 3 morphology of sludge flocs to verify the changes of morphology of as under different treatment conditions the sem images of sludge floc were shown in fig 3 compared with raw as the sludge floc became coarser and denser after the treatment of at which might be explained by the denaturalization of surface protein and polysaccharide under extreme acid condition after ao treatment the structure of sludge floc became smaller indicating that anodic oxidation could substantially change the structure of the sludge floc after ef treatment the sludge flocs became finer and irregular and coarser surface and bigger pores were observed the results demonstrated that ef process caused substantial changes in the surface morphology and floc structure the roughness and porosity structures could weaken the storage capacity for water molecules kept in the fine pores of sludge finally improving the dewaterability stabnikova et al 2005 wu et al 2017 3 3 effect of ef treatment on eps distribution tb eps is eps that tightly bounds and surrounds microbial cells chen et al 2015 which contributes to the water retention ability lb eps and seps which loosely bound microbial cells contribute to sludge dewaterability chen et al 2015 the content of tb eps in at ao and ef decreased significantly in all treatments whilst the contents of seps and lb eps increased fig 4 a c indicating that tb eps was converted into lb eps and seps after treatment in at the amount of tb eps reduction was almost equivalent to the sum of lb eps and seps increase and the increase of lb eps and seps in ao was about 2 4 times of tb eps reduction seps in ef increased sharply from 175 05 19 79 mg cod l to 1068 79 13 30 mg cod l which was 6 11 times of tb eps reduction these results indicated that acid treatment could redistribute tb eps to lb eps and seps whilst aops could accelerate the transformation of tb eps to more loosely bound and soluble matters as discussed above the homogenous oh could react with extra cellular polymers and produce soluble matters of lower molecular weight making eps easier to be extracted after ef treatment chen et al 2015 the dramatic increase of seps in ef might also be attributed to the fact that microbial cells trapped in sludge were broken down by homogeneous oh generated through electro fenton reaction and intracellular substance was released into seps fraction yuan et al 2011a contrary to the continuously increase of seps in at and ao seps in ef peaked at 40 min and then decreased slowly which once again indicated that mineralization of organic matters occurred in ef kinetics evolution of the obtained data in fig 4d showed pseudo first order eps components variation kinetics in all treatment which was in agreement with previous reports chen et al 2015 yang et al 2010 the obtained rate constants of tb eps decrease were 5 72 10 3 6 47 10 3 and 16 97 10 3 min 1 for at ao and ef respectively table s2 the decrease rate of tb eps in ef was almost 2 97 and 2 62 times of that in at and ao respectively mirroring the faster redistribution of eps in ef treatment it is well known that pn and ps are key organic compounds of as chen et al 2017 many previous studies have demonstrated that the variation of pn and ps of eps influenced sludge dewatering and settling capability chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 a the pn contents were 4 88 4 58 and 43 05 mg l in seps lb eps and tb eps fractions of raw as respectively after ef treatment the pn contents approximately increased by 1076 43 and 619 65 in seps and lb eps whilst decreased by 69 20 in tb eps the ps contents in seps and lb eps also increased by 948 39 and 486 05 after ef treatment fig 5b the increase of pn and ps in seps and lb eps after ef treatment indicated that ef could modify the composition of eps fractions it was noteworthy that in accordance with increasing scod ef caused more pn and ps redistributed to seps many studies have demonstrated that the high content of pn in seps was detrimental to sludge filterability probably because of the high viscosity caused by high concentration of pn zhang et al 2014 2017 however in the case of ef high contents of pn and ps in seps did not have negative effect on dewaterability of as as discussed above strong oxidation capacity of ef could cause the damage of the membrane and release of intracellular substances which might attribute to the dramatic increase of pn and ps in seps for the method of extracting seps cannot separate soluble eps from total soluble fraction of sludge mixed liquid furthermore the high reactive activity of oh could change the chemical structure of organic matters e g protein likes and prevented extracellular proteins from forming stable colloidal aggregation and accordingly eliminated the water affinity of extracellular proteins wu et al 2017 3 4 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps to furtherly analyze the detailed changes in chemical composition of eps 3d eem is used for characterization of organic matters with the advantages of high sensitivity and selectivity henderson et al 2009 five dominant peaks representing different dissolved organic material components were detected in eps fractions table 2 fig s2 in the fraction of tb eps organic matters in raw as at and ao treatments were all characterized by peak a and peak c whilst those in ef treatment were characterized by peak a and d this difference was also observed in the fraction of lb eps and seps consolidating that ef had different modification mechanism on sludge flocs it was obviously that most of the organic matters at least the ones with fluorescence redistributed from tb eps to seps especially for the microbial byproduct like substances represented by peak c table 2 furthermore the intensity of peak a and e increased sharply in the seps fraction in ef treatment indicating the amount of humic acid like organics in seps increased after ef treatment in ef treatment disruption of polymer of pn ps etc and conversion of organic matters into humic acid like organics occurred more rapidly through condensation route polyphenol theory veeken et al 2000 as free radicals are linked forming polymer products giannakopoulos et al 2017 the humification of as organics accelerated maturation of as through polymerization of organic matter into humic acid like organics which could decrease the amount of groups with negative charges on the surface of the sludge and promote the dewaterability of as 3 5 optimization of ef on activated sludge modification several parameters such as current intensity olvera vargas et al 2014 ph loaiza ambuludi et al 2013 and catalyst concentration ammar et al 2015 impact the effectiveness of ef due to their influence on oh generation our results showed that the generation of h2o2 in ef cells increased significantly with the increasing of current intensity from 10 ma cm2 to 40 ma cm2 p 0 01 and the generation of h2o2 increased insignificantly after that p 0 05 fig s3a meanwhile srf significantly lowered from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 whilst no significant difference was observed between 30 ma cm2 and 40 ma cm2 fig s3a indicating higher electric intensity above 40 ma cm2 could not furtherly improve the performance of srf for the generation of h2o2 is the key process in electro fenton reaction the electric energy utilization efficiency was calculated in term of h2o2 generation and the result showed that the electric energy utilization efficiency decreased continuously along with the increase of current density table s3 although there was no significant difference between ph 2 4 h2o2 generation reached the highest level at ph 3 in ef system fig s3b and dropped significantly at ph 5 and 6 meanwhile the srf reduced to the lowest at ph 3 and decreased along with the increasing of current intensity fig 6 in summary electric intensity of 40 ma cm2 and ph 3 was considered as the favored parameter in ef treatment for the sake of efficiency and economy the result of scod also supported the proper current intensity and ph on sludge disintegration fig 6 3 6 reusability of the dewatering filters in fenton process the requirement for the extremely acidic condition i e ph 2 0 3 0 to keep ferrous ion content steadily is the drawback zhang et al 2015 reuse of the acid dewatering filtrate might help to reduce the consumption of ph regulator and electrolytes as well as to reduce risk of second pollution cyclic tests were conducted to evaluate the dewaterability and disintegration performance of as when dewatering filtrate were reused after five cyclic use about 60 of srf reduction was achieved and the reduction ratio of ss and vss was 33 and 25 respectively fig 7 indicating that over 90 of the initial activity remained these results suggested that the acid dewatering filtrate could be reused and remained high catalytic activity which would cut off cost and second pollution the release of scod nitrogen and phosphorus showed that reuse of dewatering filtrate could also efficiently remain the cell disintegration effect of ef fig s4 the disintegration product of as could be used to improve denitrification efficiency zubrowska sudol 2018 zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 and pre treatment of as could help to produce methane in as anaerobic digestion zahedi et al 2017 furthermore most of the nitrogen and phosphorus in filtrate were in the form of nh4 n and po4 3 p fig s5 respectively which could be recovered through chemical participation or electro treatment park and kim 2015 therefore the pre treatment of ef and cyclic usage of filtrate could improve the dewaterability of as as well as the possibility of resource reutilization of as 3 7 mechanisms of ef in activated sludge pretreatment sludge dewaterability is difficult because sludge flocs trap a certain part of bounded water which behave differently from the free water furthermore bounded water is classified as interstitial water vicinal water and water of hydration wu et al 2018 in recent study eps was proven to influence different fractions of bounded water fixed in sludge floc wu et al 2018 in the ef treatment acid firstly played a role in sludge dewatering and sedimentation performance fig 1 chen et al 2001 just as that observed in at the positive charge neutralizes the negative charge on the surface of the sludge fig 2b raynaud et al 2012 and induced compaction of sludge flocs resulting in the release of interstitial water trapped in net like sludge flocs although the effect of acid treatment was relatively weak in sludge dewatering ph determined the production rate of oh and the concentration of soluble fe2 tokumura et al 2007 which in turn affected the efficiency of ef process fig s3 the disintegration of sludge flocs and increase of soluble organic matters were also observed in ao figs 1d 2a and 4d the higher zeta potential in ao reflected that some of the hydrophilic groups in sludge flocs were destroyed by the adsorbed hydroxyl radical mox oh and solid state active oxygen mox 1 with the reduction of hydrophilic groups more vicinal water attached on organic matters could be released to bulk water in ef except for the effect of acid and ao homogenous generation of oh contributed high oxidation activity to ef the strong oxidizing oh radicals reacted with extracellular macromolecules such as eps and microbial cells trapped in sludge directly and promoted the hydrolysis of sludge flocs and the disintegration of microbial cells vaxelaire and cézac 2004 once the eps structure of the sludge was destroyed figs 3 and 4 the hard to remove interstitial and vicinal water bounded in eps were converted into free water wu et al 2018 the high react activity of oh also helped to the humification of sludge organics the humification could reduce the negative charge content and viscosity of sludge mixed liquid which offset the disadvantages caused by high content of pn and ps released into seps through cell disintegration meanwhile the disintegration of bacterial cells in the zoogloea of sludge promoted to formation of macropores in sludge flocs fig 3 which also could help the rapid release of free water from sludge flocs and help to achieve a good performance of dewatering 4 conclusion in this study the effect of activated sludge pretreatment using eletro fenton on dewatering and disintegration performance was evaluated and the changes of sludge floc properties were investigated to unravel the mechanisms involved in ef treatment ef exhibited better performance in sludge dewaterability and disintegration than acid treatment and anodic oxidation by producing high reactive homogenous hydroxyl radicals sludge flocs after ef treatment were smaller coarser with bigger holes but zeta potential approached to near zero ef could compress eps more rapidly than acid and anodic oxidation treatments and ef could accelerate process of tb eps redistribution to seps and humification treatment with 40 ma cm2 and lower ph 3 was determined to be suitable condition based on the dewatering and disintegration of sludge the extreme acid dewatering filtrate could be reused for 5 times and the conditioning performance could remain up to 90 of the initial activity declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the national water pollution control and treatment science and technology major

19039,the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args in drinking water and their potential horizontal transfer to pathogenic microbes may cause failure of antibiotics however antimicrobial resistome monitoring in drinking water is not currently routine the bacterial hosts of args especially small sized microbes in drinking water may not be effectively removed by membrane filtration disinfection and thus pose threats to human health in the present study using metagenomic based approach we investigated antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes 0 2 0 45 μm in 20 household drinking water samples from 12 cities in mainland china hong kong and singapore a total of 265 arg subtypes belonging to 17 arg types were detected at abundances ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell multidrug bacitracin and aminoglycoside resistance genes are dominant and 43 arg subtypes were specifically carried by small size microbes metagenomic assembly strategy revealed fragments of three opportunistic pathogen i e pseudomonas alcaligenes pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium gordonae carried mexw aph 3 i and aac 2 i respectively drinking water samples were classified into three groups based on the presence of arg pathogen and arg carrying pathogen these new insights into the antibiotic resistome of small microbes in drinking water over a broad scale indicate the need for more comprehensive args monitoring and surveillance of drinking water supplies these findings together with the perspectives and strategies proposed in this study could support initiatives to improve drinking water safety graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water public health antibiotic resistome pathogenic host metagenomic sequencing 1 introduction increases in the selective pressure to develop resistance to antibiotics used in human medicine and livestock breeding have led to the wide distribution and exacerbation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args throughout both natural and man made environments nesme et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 antimicrobial resistance has thus become a global issue and is considered an emerging environmental pollutant unep 2017 that may pose risks to public health who 2018 nevertheless most relevant research efforts have focused on the sources of args such as hospital environments and sewage ashbolt et al 2013 le page et al 2017 or management options e g nutrient management runoff control and infrastructure upgrades with the aim of reducing the emission of args into the environment pruden et al 2013 to date however inadequate strategies have been proposed to monitor and manage args in household drinking water which potentially pose direct threats to human health su et al 2018 remarkably although the presence of args is a health threat a more critical issue related to args is the potential horizontal transfer of args to pathogenic microbes as the statement implies ashbolt 2015 accordingly these implied potential risks make it imperative to better integrate monitoring efforts and risk management strategies into public health decision making to enhance drinking water safety previous studies of args in drinking water have mainly used conventional methods such as bacterial isolation vaz moreira et al 2017 pcr figueira et al 2011 and qpcr su et al 2018 in the past decade advances in genomic technologies have yielded novel approaches and new visions for environmental health monitoring and arg risk assessment cote et al 2016 the sequencing of whole microbial communities has revealed genomic information from the vast majority of unculturable bacteria port et al 2014 given the potential health risks associated with drinking water researchers have recently attempted to clarify the antibiotic resistomes collection of all the args of drinking water microbes using metagenomic sequencing technique chao et al 2013 shi et al 2013 however current studies on this resistome have only focused on microbes larger than 0 45 μm chao et al 2013 ma et al 2017 and no report has addressed the resistome of small microbes 0 45 μm in drinking water the latter type of investigation is difficult because of the low available biomass for dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing luef et al 2015 however those small sized microbes can opportunistically pass through disinfecting membranes e g micro filtration membranes pore size 0 1 10 μm after traditional drinking water treatment processes these permeating small sized microbes may carry args that could potentially be transferred to human pathogen in the worst case scenario these small microbes may themselves be human pathogen for example the human pathogen legionella pneumophila which is usually spread via drinking water measures 0 3 0 9 μm in size and thus can escape membrane disinfection and surveillance lin et al 2011a moreover the proliferation of args in drinking water and their potential horizontal transfer to pathogenic microbes may lead to antibiotic failures and threats to public health thus the monitoring of the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes and tracking of pathogen is urgently needed for the purposes of both arg surveillance in drinking water and public health decision making in the present study small sized microbes from 20 samples of household drinking water from 12 cities in mainland china hong kong and singapore were collected through a two step membrane filtration process and analyzed using the drinking water antibiotic resistome profiling pipeline established in our previous study ma et al 2017 the objectives of this study were 1 to profile the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes 0 2 0 45 μm in drinking water 2 to identify specific args carried by small sized microbes through comparing with large sized microbes using newly generated and published large sized microbial metagenomic data sets 3 to identify the small sized bacterial hosts of args and 4 to propose solutions and strategies for antimicrobial resistance control and management in drinking water this study is the first to reveal the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes that may pose great risks to human health and to provide a reference and guidance for antibiotic resistance management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 tap water sampling and pretreatment twenty samples of household drinking water were collected from 12 cities and regions including nanning n 2 guangxi province jinzhong n 1 shanxi province qingdao n 2 shandong province wugang n 2 hunan province shanghai n 4 linyi n 2 shandong province botou n 1 hebei province xigaze n 1 tibet fujin n 2 heilongjiang province and yinchuan n 1 gansu province in mainland china as well as hong kong n 1 and singapore n 1 additional information e g sample id sampling location sampling date is listed in the supplementary materials table s1 microorganisms in each sample were collected by filtering the drinking water through high performance cartridge type water purifiers torayvino toray industries inc japan pore size 0 1 μm three water purifiers not exposed to tap water served as blank samples the filtered water volume 2000 l flow rate 40 l h and sampling time 48 h settings and pretreatment were conducted according to a previously proposed protocol ma et al 2017 in brief microbial cells were detached from the hollow fiber filters within the purifiers into ultrapure water via ultrasonication branson ultrasonics corp usa the detached cells were subsequently collected by filtration using a 0 45 μm cellulose ester membrane millipore corp usa subsequently this filtrate was further filtered through a 0 2 μm cellulose ester membrane to intercept microorganisms in the 0 2 0 45 μm size range the effectiveness of capturing microorganisms using this approach was previously evaluated by chao et al 2013 the membranes were stored at 20 c before dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing genomic dna was extracted from each sample using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france according to the standard protocol the dna concentration was measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen life technologies usa which confirmed that the three blank samples were below the detection limit a 5 μg aliquot of genomic dna from each sample was used to construct a 350 bp library nextera dna library preparation kit illumina inc usa paired end metagenomic sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform at the beijing genomics institute bgi to guarantee the quality of the downstream analysis the data were subjected to quality filtering which involved the removal of raw reads containing 3 or more ambiguous nucleotides reads with an average quality score of 20 and artificially identical reads yang et al 2013 after quality control 4 gbp metagenomic sequences of each tap water sample were generated to yield a total of 80 gbp the metagenomics data were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information short reads archive database ncbi sra accession number srp139701 2 3 identification of args in drinking water samples all metagenomic sequencing data were searched for args against the structured arg database sarg which integrates ardb and card using ublast strategies with an e value 10 7 yin et al 2018 a sequence was identified as an arg like fragment if its best blastx alignment to the arg sequence in the referenced database showed a similarity of 80 and alignment length of 75 customized scripts were used to automatically classify the identified arg like sequences into 23 arg types e g sulfonamide resistance gene and 1227 arg subtypes e g sul1 sul2 etc this annotation pipeline has been validated with a high accuracy of 97 99 5 in previous studies yang et al 2013 2016 yin et al 2018 to further validate the annotation results obtained in the present study 200 arg like sequences were randomly extracted from drinking water metagenomes and then aligned against ncbi database based on best hits for validation finally 198 sequences had matched results from ncbi and sarg database suggesting that 99 of the sequences were annotated correctly using sarg database and annotation pipeline for these drinking water samples to further compare the arg profiles of different microbial communities in drinking water the abundances of args were normalized and expressed as the number of copies of args per cell copy cell yang et al 2016 using the equation described in supplementary materials s1 a heatmap plot was conducted using the r program r project for statistical computing austria a procrustes analysis based on the abundance matrix of arg subtypes was performed using qiime forsberg et al 2014 to further reveal specific arg patterns among the small sized microbes in drinking water we compared the arg profile with that of large sized microbes 0 45 μm in the same samples using newly generated and published large sized microbial metagenomic data sets ma et al 2017 specifically 50 of the large sized microbial metagenomic data sets had been previously subjected to arg profile analysis supplementary materials table s1 and dna homogeneity among triplicated samples collected from the same tap had also been evaluated 2 4 identification of pathogenic hosts of args using metagenomic assembly to further identify the bacterial hosts of args arg carrying contigs accs were subjected to identification and taxonomic annotation according to the pipeline established in our previous study ma et al 2016 in brief metagenomic sequences were assembled using the idba algorithm version 1 1 1 with default parameters peng et al 2012 the open reading frames orfs prediction was then conducted for assembled contigs using prodigal version 2 hyatt et al 2010 next the predicted orf sequences were searched against the sarg database to identify arg like orfs using blastx under an e value 10 10 hu et al 2013 an orf sequence was identified as an arg like orf if its best blastx hit alignment to the arg sequences met the cutoffs of 80 similarity and 70 query coverage hu et al 2013 the identified arg like orfs were then classified according to the structured sarg database and contigs that carried arg like orfs were extracted to perform a taxonomic annotation of the identified accs the orfs of each acc were compared against the local ncbi nr database downloaded on october 27th 2017 using blastp with an e value 10 5 mao et al 2014 and then parsed using metagenome analyzer megan version 6 huson et al 2011 the taxonomies of accs were based on the following rule if 50 of the orfs on a contig were annotated as the same taxon this contig was then assigned to that taxon ishii et al 2013 the average coverage indicating abundance gb of each arg carrying contig was quantified by mapping metagenomic sequencing reads to the gene cassette using clc genomics workbench with a minimum similarity of 95 and over 95 of the read length the species level taxonomic list of accs was then further compared with the summarized pathogen list proposed in a previous study to identify arg carrying pathogen li et al 2015a furthermore virulence factors carried by arg carrying pathogen was screened by using vfdb virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria based online annotation pipeline vfanalyzer chen et al 2016 2 5 pathogen tracking from small sized microbes to identify pathogen from small sized microbes in drinking water metaphlan2 metagenomic phylogenetic analysis truong et al 2015 was used to conduct taxonomic profiling of metagenomic sequences the species taxa and corresponding abundances were subsequently extracted from the obtained taxonomic profiles the species level taxonomic list was then further compared with a previously summarized pathogen list li et al 2015a to identify small sized pathogen in the drinking water samples 2 6 qpcr abundance of important args with prevalence in all samples were further quantified by using quantitative real time pcr qpcr assay the unit of args were transformed into relative abundance by normalizing to 16s rrna gene as copy of arg per 16s rrna gene primers of args and 16s rrna gene were listed in supplementary materials table s9 each 20 μl qpcr reaction consisted of 10 μl 2 sybr green master mixes bio rad hercules california 0 5 μm each primer 5 ng dna as template and 7 μl nuclease free pcr grade water the thermal cycle consisted of a 3 min initial enzyme activation at 95 c followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 60 c for 30 s and extension 72 c for 60 s reactions were performed on a bio rad cfx96 connect real time pcr detection system and quantified with bio rad cfx manager software bio rad hercules california all qpcrs were performed in technical triplicates with negative controls specific amplification of qpcr was confirmed by checking the melting curve of the target gene in each sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water first a metagenomic technique based on the structured sarg database was used to profile the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water and present a comprehensive spectrum of the args carried by these microbes that had opportunistically passed through membrane disinfection and thus represent a direct risk to human health via drinking water a total of 265 arg subtypes classified into 17 arg types were detected in small sized microbes from the 20 drinking water samples collected in 12 cities fig 1 table 1 with total abundances ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell until now very limited studies had been employed to show the abundance of args in household drinking water tap water because of its low biomass and limitation of sample collection among the limited previous studies xu et al 2016 used high throughput qpcr to quantify diverse args in tap water and the relative abundance of args normalizing to cell number ranged from 5 75 10 1 to 8 25 10 1 copies cell this is in the range of our detection with 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell genes encoding multidrug 1 6 10 2 to 5 0 10 1 copies cell bacitracin 1 4 10 2 to 2 6 10 1 copy cell and beta lactam resistance 2 6 10 4 to 1 2 10 1 copies cell were detected at the highest levels of abundance in these microbes furthermore these top 3 arg types together with genes conferring resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls aminoglycoside sulfonamide and fosmidomycin were detected as general arg types in small sized microbes from all samples among the 265 arg subtypes baca bacitracin and mexf multidrug were dominant with respective abundances of 1 4 10 2 to 2 4 10 1 and 1 5 10 3 to 6 5 10 2 copies cell in the drinking water samples fig 2 presents the profiles of 56 arg subtypes carried by small sized microbes in drinking water samples with average abundances of 1 0 10 3 copies cell notably 27 arg subtypes were prevalent in the drinking water samples from all cities these encoded resistance to bacitracin baca and bcra fosmidomycin rosa and rosb mls macb and maca multidrug acrb acrf adeb amrb bpef ceob emrb mdtb mdtc mdtf mexb mexf mext mexw multidrug abc transporter multidrug transporter ompr oprc polymyxin arna sulfonamide sul1 and vancomycin vanr among them 17 arg subtypes were defined as generalist arg subtypes present in all samples fig 2 moreover primers of 4 generalist args baca acrb mexf and sul1 were available in previous studies by literature search and seven samples were randomly selected to further verify their prevalence by using qpcr method all the examined generalist args were detected in these samples supplementary materials table s10 mexf and sul1 had similar abundances comparing with using metagenomic based approach while baca and acrb were averagely 100 times less the metagenomic based arg detection mainly relies on arg database and therefore the most complete arg database sarg v2 0 containing 23 arg types 1227 arg subtypes and 12307 reference sequences was used in the present study in sarg v2 0 database there are totally 241 non redundant baca sequences and 117 acrb sequences thus it covers more sequence diversity not only to annotate amplify for specific sequence or region of target genes the generalist arg types namely bacitracin multidrug sulfonamide beta lactam and aminoglycoside have previously been reported to be relatively highly abundant in drinking water metagenomes li et al 2015b xu et al 2016 bacterial strains isolated from drinking water were also frequently reported to be resistant to these antibiotics figueira et al 2011 xi et al 2009 at the arg subtype level baca macb acrb and sul1 have previously been detected in drinking water samples ma et al 2017 whereas some of the detected arg subtypes such as blalcr 1 blalra 17 and blaoxa 142 were identified in drinking water for the first time as this is the first large scale study to determine the dominant and prevalent antibiotic resistome among small sized microbes in drinking water samples we aimed to further clarify whether some of the detected args were specifically carried by specific small sized microbes in drinking water and how these might pose risks to human health 3 2 specific args in small sized microbes in drinking water to reveal specific arg patterns in small sized microbes collected from drinking water we compared the arg profile with that of large sized microbes 0 45 μm in the same samples notably the abundance of args carried by small sized microbes 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell was on average 7 4 less than that carried by large sized microbes 4 9 10 2 to 1 2 100 copies cell p 0 01 four arg types multidrug beta lactam polymyxin and trimethoprim resistance genes were identified at significantly higher percentages in small sized microbes 1 4 30 5 23 9 and 57 4 respectively fig 3 a bar chart significantly small and large sized microbes in drinking water shared 81 1 of arg diversity though 43 of the 265 detected arg subtypes 16 2 in a total abundance of 0 33 average 1 3 10 3 copies cell were not observed in large sized microbes fig 3a pie chart and were specifically carried by small sized microbes these 43 specific arg subtypes belonged to four arg types aminoglycoside diversity 2 mls diversity 2 beta lactam diversity 36 and tetracycline diversity 3 among them 36 specific beta lactam resistance genes were present at a total abundance of 1 1 10 3 copies cell accounting for 6 1 of the total abundance of the beta lactam type one such gene blatem 127 a broad spectrum beta lactamase previously identified in escherichia coli jia et al 2017 olesen et al 2004 was detected at a significant level in sample dw1 heilongjiang province mainland china with at least 1 blatem 127 copy per 500 small sized microbes 2 1 10 3 copies cell to further clarify the different arg patterns carried by different bacterial communities in the drinking water samples a procrustes analysis fig 3b based on the arg profiles of small and large sized microbes was performed the results suggested that the drinking water samples could be distributed separately and that samples collected from shandong shanghai gansu and tibet in mainland china were much more similar to each other than to the other samples subsequently a follow up question was proposed which difference is more significant the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes among different samples or the antibiotic resistomes of both small and large sized microbes in the same sample then a correlation based differential test was used to compare and clarify these differences as shown in fig 4 the geometric mean of the pearson s r between samples was 0 851 while the r value between small and large sized microbes was 0 931 therefore the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in a drinking water sample is much more similar to that of the large sized microbes in the same sample than to the resistome of small sized microbes in the other drinking water samples further indicating that the antibiotic resistomes in diverse drinking water samples were not much bacterial size driven even though 43 arg subtypes were found specifically carried by small size microbes 3 3 small sized pathogenic hosts of args in drinking water thirty five arg carrying contigs 1000 bp were identified from the assembled drinking water metagenomes of small sized microbes these contigs contained args encoding resistance to aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam multidrug rifamycin and sulfonamide the accs were annotated as fragments of proteobacteria 80 actinobacteria 3 and unclassified 17 fig 5 significantly multidrug resistance genes mexf mext mexw and bacitracin resistance genes baca were frequently identified on proteobacteria accs 57 and 20 respectively using a previously summarized pathogen list li et al 2015a 3 accs were identified as fragments of opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas alcaligenes pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium gordonae while no virulence factor was found carried on these arg carrying pathogen fragments detailed information of the 3 arg carrying pathogen fragements including abundance and best annotation in ncbi database was present in the supplementary materials table s6 these arg carrying pathogen fragments carried mexw and aph 3 i and aac 2 i which encode resistance to multidrug and aminoglycoside respectively among the detected arg carrying pathogen p aeruginosa is considered a notoriously difficult to treat pathogen that can cause severe diseases and infections its efflux mechanism for antibiotic resistance may pose a great challenge to antibiotic development winkler et al 2015 additionally m gordonae an opportunistic pathogen was previously detected throughout drinking water treatment systems liu et al 2012 lu et al 2016 vaerewijck et al 2005 and its increased frequency in potable drinking water in the usa was revealed in a recent case study using a culture based method donohue et al 2015 the wide prevalence of m gordonae in drinking water as well as its correlation with args identified in this study identifies this organism as a necessary concern regarding drinking water safety therefore antibiotic resistome in drinking water especially that of pathogenic bacteria which may cause failure of antibiotics and threats to human beings deserving more future studies generally coliforms and escherichia coli are considered the standard pathogenic microbial indicators of drinking water safety edberg et al 2000 and a standard of 0 mpn cfu 100 ml has been set for assessment however the majority of pathogen opportunistic pathogen and even antibiotic resistant pathogen are difficult to detect given the low biomass in drinking water and limitations of traditional culture methods su et al 2018 in the present study the taxonomic annotation of accs greatly enhanced the identification of possible arg hosts especially pathogenic hosts in drinking water accordingly the metagenomic technique is a promising tool for drinking water safety monitoring and surveillance given its ability to conduct comprehensive and high throughput scans of args and arg carrying pathogen this technique could further yield reference material and support for decision making processes regarding the management of arb and args and safety control of human drinking water 3 4 profiles of small sized pathogen in drinking water to further elucidate the overall profile of small sized pathogen in drinking water taxonomic profiling was conducted using metaphlan2 truong et al 2015 five opportunistic pathogen acinetobacter johnsonii acinetobacter junii escherichia coli legionella pneumophila and pseudomonas alcaligenes were detected via comparison against a previously published pathogen list li et al 2015a using the profiles of the detected 78 bacterial species and the corresponding abundances of these samples supplementary materials table s7 diverse pathogenic species were detected in samples dw1 a johnsonii and e coli dw3 e coli and p alcaligenes and dw16 a junii and e coli notably e coli was the most dominant pathogenic bacteria among the small sized microorganisms in drinking water with an average abundance of 1 52 and occurrence rate of 40 in all of the samples in addition e coli was observed in 89 of the pathogen containing samples in this study based on its wide prevalence in drinking water and its status as a representative of diverse pathogen e coli can be considered the most likely indicator of pathogen among small sized microbes in drinking water l pneumophila which was detected in dw11 is another primary human pathogenic bacterium this bacterium is the causative agent of legionnaires disease a severe and often lethal form of pneumonia drinking water is considered as important source of l pneumophila infection albert weissenberger et al 2007 lin et al 2011a b each year 56 000 113 000 people are infected with legionella bacteria in the usa however l pneumophila has not previously been included in the routine monitoring of drinking water safety given the limitations of traditional culture methods and its low frequency in drinking water the development of high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses have led to the proposal herein of an effective approach to the monitoring of pathogen in drinking water especially pathogen that pose high risks to public health 3 5 classification of drinking water samples polluted by args to facilitate future antimicrobial resistance monitoring and management of drinking water we classified these drinking water samples into three groups considering the potential public health risks posed by args and pathogen according to the detection of arg pathogen and arg carrying pathogen fig 6 a with arg carrying pathogen detected b with args and pathogen detected but no arg carrying pathogen and c with only args detected group a and b were further classified into two subgroups 1 and 2 based on the detection of obligate opportunistic pathogen group c was further classified into subgroups based on whether the detected args are mobile or not mobile args are carried by mobile genetic elements and can undergo horizontal gene transfer among microbes and thus represent risks to human health forsberg et al 2012 accordingly drinking water that meets the criteria for group c 2 and thus lacks mobile args i e the possibility of transfer to pathogen could be considered relatively safe in terms of antimicrobial resistance despite the presence of args the drinking water samples analyzed in the present study were grouped using the above criteria for classification here the classification was based on the occurrence of args and pathogen in both small and large sized microorganisms table 2 two drinking water samples containing arg carrying opportunistic pathogen dw7 and dw8 shanghai china were classified as group a 2 while 75 samples belonged to group b 2 because they contained args and opportunistic pathogen but no arg carrying pathogen the small sized microbes in samples dw14 dw15 dw18 and dw20 were classified into group c however they were reclassified into group b 2 because of the detection of args and opportunistic pathogen in large sized microorganisms from these samples this finding suggests that filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane efficiently removed pathogen from these four drinking water samples furthermore only 15 of samples in this study were classified into group c no pathogen detected low frequency 15 of group c 2 in this study suggests that drinking water should be subjected to additional monitoring and surveillance of args and pathogen this classification system based on the occurrence of args pathogen and arg carrying pathogen which reflects the potential risks of antimicrobial resistance to public health could provide a reference and guidance for future arg studies and drinking water management frequent previous reports on the risks of mobile args with regard to human health have attracted considerable attention von wintersdorff et al 2016 however a database or list of mobile args is lacking this subject warrants additional efforts to facilitate risk assessments of drinking water and would benefit other human related environments such as swimming pools aerosols and food safety furthermore more efforts need to be paid for dose and duration dependent health risk assessment considering args pathogen and arg carrying pathogen in drinking water to further quantify and concretize the classification system for enhancing drinking water safety 3 6 relevance to drinking water safety management this study is the first to reveal the potential public health risks caused by the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water these small sized microbes opportunistically passed through the traditional drinking water treatment process and a further disinfection process involving filtration membranes especially micro filtration membranes and remained in the tap water thus exacerbating the risks of ingestion and horizontal gene transfer to human pathogen to meet the challenge posed by the small sized microbe resistome and enhance drinking water safety the following solutions and strategies are proposed 3 6 1 membrane filtration treatment should be applied before water is consumed in households membrane filtration treatment especially through an ultra filtration membrane pore size 0 1 μm should be promoted as an in situ in home post treatment after traditional drinking water treatment processes with the aim of removing the remaining arb and args from drinking water countries and regions with relatively poor or rough drinking water treatment processes and those considering tap water as a source of potable drinking water e g usa singapore should promote and popularize membrane based drinking water filtration treatment additionally tap water is boiled before drinking in some countries and regions blake et al 2016 although boiling certainly prevents the risk of infection caused by microbes in drinking water francis et al 2015 the remaining undestroyed arg dnas could still be transferred horizontally to pathogen and thus pose risks to human health 3 6 2 arb and arg indices and standards should be involved in assessments of drinking water quality and safety drinking water safety poses a challenge to public health cotruvo 2017 an arb and arg index should be implemented in drinking water quality control with the intention of controlling and preventing antibiotic failure and the horizontal transfer of args to human pathogen the norms and standards in such an index could be implemented in the near future based on the following 3 aspects characters researcher public government 1 more studies and evaluations of args hosts and horizontal transfer among bacteria especially from non pathogen to pathogen in drinking water 2 improved civic awareness and precautions regarding the risks of args to public health and 3 support and promotion via governmental laws and regulations the solutions and strategies proposed to control the abundance of args and arb in drinking water are presented in detail in fig 7 to provide a reference and support for further control and management of these elements future studies on args and pathogen in drinking water systems are warranted such as dose and duration dependent health risk assessment and disinfection technology improvement etc more efforts from all involved parties including researchers governments and the public should be concentrated to ensure the sustainable management and promotion of drinking water safety 4 conclusion the present study used a large scale metagenomic data analysis to provide new insights into the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water a total of 265 arg subtypes belonging to 17 arg types were detected at abundances ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell notably args encoding resistance to multidrug bacitracin and aminoglycoside were dominant among small sized microbes which specifically carried 16 2 of all arg subtypes moreover the prevalence of dominant args carried by small sized microbes in drinking water was also verified by using qpcr methods for future arg study in diverse environmental samples it is appealed that the metagenomic based method with the strength of high sequence diversity and traditional methods e g qpcr with strength of low detection limit could be combined to excavate and solve antimicrobial resistance issue notably continuous updating arg database is necessary that will not only facilitate comprehensive profiling of antibiotic resistome metagenomic analysis but also contribute to primers design for broader args detection pcr qpcr epic pcr etc a further correlation analysis revealed that the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in a drinking water sample were much more similar to those of large sized microbes in the same samples than to those of small sized microbes from drinking water samples collected elsewhere the assembled contigs annotated as p alcaligenes p aeruginosa and m gordonae were found to carry mexw aph 3 i and aac 2 i respectively based on these findings and concerns about drinking water safety samples were further classified into three groups based on the presence of arg pathogen and arg carrying pathogen additionally solutions and strategies are proposed to provide a further reference and guidance for antibiotic resistance control and management in drinking water namely 1 membrane filtration treatment and 2 the establishment of a standard for args and arb in drinking water monitoring that involves researchers the public and governments the findings and strategies proposed herein are expected to facilitate and promote the global surveillance and risk assessment of antimicrobial resistance in drinking water within the agendas of water supply

19039,the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args in drinking water and their potential horizontal transfer to pathogenic microbes may cause failure of antibiotics however antimicrobial resistome monitoring in drinking water is not currently routine the bacterial hosts of args especially small sized microbes in drinking water may not be effectively removed by membrane filtration disinfection and thus pose threats to human health in the present study using metagenomic based approach we investigated antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes 0 2 0 45 μm in 20 household drinking water samples from 12 cities in mainland china hong kong and singapore a total of 265 arg subtypes belonging to 17 arg types were detected at abundances ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell multidrug bacitracin and aminoglycoside resistance genes are dominant and 43 arg subtypes were specifically carried by small size microbes metagenomic assembly strategy revealed fragments of three opportunistic pathogen i e pseudomonas alcaligenes pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium gordonae carried mexw aph 3 i and aac 2 i respectively drinking water samples were classified into three groups based on the presence of arg pathogen and arg carrying pathogen these new insights into the antibiotic resistome of small microbes in drinking water over a broad scale indicate the need for more comprehensive args monitoring and surveillance of drinking water supplies these findings together with the perspectives and strategies proposed in this study could support initiatives to improve drinking water safety graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water public health antibiotic resistome pathogenic host metagenomic sequencing 1 introduction increases in the selective pressure to develop resistance to antibiotics used in human medicine and livestock breeding have led to the wide distribution and exacerbation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args throughout both natural and man made environments nesme et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 antimicrobial resistance has thus become a global issue and is considered an emerging environmental pollutant unep 2017 that may pose risks to public health who 2018 nevertheless most relevant research efforts have focused on the sources of args such as hospital environments and sewage ashbolt et al 2013 le page et al 2017 or management options e g nutrient management runoff control and infrastructure upgrades with the aim of reducing the emission of args into the environment pruden et al 2013 to date however inadequate strategies have been proposed to monitor and manage args in household drinking water which potentially pose direct threats to human health su et al 2018 remarkably although the presence of args is a health threat a more critical issue related to args is the potential horizontal transfer of args to pathogenic microbes as the statement implies ashbolt 2015 accordingly these implied potential risks make it imperative to better integrate monitoring efforts and risk management strategies into public health decision making to enhance drinking water safety previous studies of args in drinking water have mainly used conventional methods such as bacterial isolation vaz moreira et al 2017 pcr figueira et al 2011 and qpcr su et al 2018 in the past decade advances in genomic technologies have yielded novel approaches and new visions for environmental health monitoring and arg risk assessment cote et al 2016 the sequencing of whole microbial communities has revealed genomic information from the vast majority of unculturable bacteria port et al 2014 given the potential health risks associated with drinking water researchers have recently attempted to clarify the antibiotic resistomes collection of all the args of drinking water microbes using metagenomic sequencing technique chao et al 2013 shi et al 2013 however current studies on this resistome have only focused on microbes larger than 0 45 μm chao et al 2013 ma et al 2017 and no report has addressed the resistome of small microbes 0 45 μm in drinking water the latter type of investigation is difficult because of the low available biomass for dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing luef et al 2015 however those small sized microbes can opportunistically pass through disinfecting membranes e g micro filtration membranes pore size 0 1 10 μm after traditional drinking water treatment processes these permeating small sized microbes may carry args that could potentially be transferred to human pathogen in the worst case scenario these small microbes may themselves be human pathogen for example the human pathogen legionella pneumophila which is usually spread via drinking water measures 0 3 0 9 μm in size and thus can escape membrane disinfection and surveillance lin et al 2011a moreover the proliferation of args in drinking water and their potential horizontal transfer to pathogenic microbes may lead to antibiotic failures and threats to public health thus the monitoring of the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes and tracking of pathogen is urgently needed for the purposes of both arg surveillance in drinking water and public health decision making in the present study small sized microbes from 20 samples of household drinking water from 12 cities in mainland china hong kong and singapore were collected through a two step membrane filtration process and analyzed using the drinking water antibiotic resistome profiling pipeline established in our previous study ma et al 2017 the objectives of this study were 1 to profile the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes 0 2 0 45 μm in drinking water 2 to identify specific args carried by small sized microbes through comparing with large sized microbes using newly generated and published large sized microbial metagenomic data sets 3 to identify the small sized bacterial hosts of args and 4 to propose solutions and strategies for antimicrobial resistance control and management in drinking water this study is the first to reveal the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes that may pose great risks to human health and to provide a reference and guidance for antibiotic resistance management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 tap water sampling and pretreatment twenty samples of household drinking water were collected from 12 cities and regions including nanning n 2 guangxi province jinzhong n 1 shanxi province qingdao n 2 shandong province wugang n 2 hunan province shanghai n 4 linyi n 2 shandong province botou n 1 hebei province xigaze n 1 tibet fujin n 2 heilongjiang province and yinchuan n 1 gansu province in mainland china as well as hong kong n 1 and singapore n 1 additional information e g sample id sampling location sampling date is listed in the supplementary materials table s1 microorganisms in each sample were collected by filtering the drinking water through high performance cartridge type water purifiers torayvino toray industries inc japan pore size 0 1 μm three water purifiers not exposed to tap water served as blank samples the filtered water volume 2000 l flow rate 40 l h and sampling time 48 h settings and pretreatment were conducted according to a previously proposed protocol ma et al 2017 in brief microbial cells were detached from the hollow fiber filters within the purifiers into ultrapure water via ultrasonication branson ultrasonics corp usa the detached cells were subsequently collected by filtration using a 0 45 μm cellulose ester membrane millipore corp usa subsequently this filtrate was further filtered through a 0 2 μm cellulose ester membrane to intercept microorganisms in the 0 2 0 45 μm size range the effectiveness of capturing microorganisms using this approach was previously evaluated by chao et al 2013 the membranes were stored at 20 c before dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing genomic dna was extracted from each sample using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france according to the standard protocol the dna concentration was measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen life technologies usa which confirmed that the three blank samples were below the detection limit a 5 μg aliquot of genomic dna from each sample was used to construct a 350 bp library nextera dna library preparation kit illumina inc usa paired end metagenomic sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform at the beijing genomics institute bgi to guarantee the quality of the downstream analysis the data were subjected to quality filtering which involved the removal of raw reads containing 3 or more ambiguous nucleotides reads with an average quality score of 20 and artificially identical reads yang et al 2013 after quality control 4 gbp metagenomic sequences of each tap water sample were generated to yield a total of 80 gbp the metagenomics data were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information short reads archive database ncbi sra accession number srp139701 2 3 identification of args in drinking water samples all metagenomic sequencing data were searched for args against the structured arg database sarg which integrates ardb and card using ublast strategies with an e value 10 7 yin et al 2018 a sequence was identified as an arg like fragment if its best blastx alignment to the arg sequence in the referenced database showed a similarity of 80 and alignment length of 75 customized scripts were used to automatically classify the identified arg like sequences into 23 arg types e g sulfonamide resistance gene and 1227 arg subtypes e g sul1 sul2 etc this annotation pipeline has been validated with a high accuracy of 97 99 5 in previous studies yang et al 2013 2016 yin et al 2018 to further validate the annotation results obtained in the present study 200 arg like sequences were randomly extracted from drinking water metagenomes and then aligned against ncbi database based on best hits for validation finally 198 sequences had matched results from ncbi and sarg database suggesting that 99 of the sequences were annotated correctly using sarg database and annotation pipeline for these drinking water samples to further compare the arg profiles of different microbial communities in drinking water the abundances of args were normalized and expressed as the number of copies of args per cell copy cell yang et al 2016 using the equation described in supplementary materials s1 a heatmap plot was conducted using the r program r project for statistical computing austria a procrustes analysis based on the abundance matrix of arg subtypes was performed using qiime forsberg et al 2014 to further reveal specific arg patterns among the small sized microbes in drinking water we compared the arg profile with that of large sized microbes 0 45 μm in the same samples using newly generated and published large sized microbial metagenomic data sets ma et al 2017 specifically 50 of the large sized microbial metagenomic data sets had been previously subjected to arg profile analysis supplementary materials table s1 and dna homogeneity among triplicated samples collected from the same tap had also been evaluated 2 4 identification of pathogenic hosts of args using metagenomic assembly to further identify the bacterial hosts of args arg carrying contigs accs were subjected to identification and taxonomic annotation according to the pipeline established in our previous study ma et al 2016 in brief metagenomic sequences were assembled using the idba algorithm version 1 1 1 with default parameters peng et al 2012 the open reading frames orfs prediction was then conducted for assembled contigs using prodigal version 2 hyatt et al 2010 next the predicted orf sequences were searched against the sarg database to identify arg like orfs using blastx under an e value 10 10 hu et al 2013 an orf sequence was identified as an arg like orf if its best blastx hit alignment to the arg sequences met the cutoffs of 80 similarity and 70 query coverage hu et al 2013 the identified arg like orfs were then classified according to the structured sarg database and contigs that carried arg like orfs were extracted to perform a taxonomic annotation of the identified accs the orfs of each acc were compared against the local ncbi nr database downloaded on october 27th 2017 using blastp with an e value 10 5 mao et al 2014 and then parsed using metagenome analyzer megan version 6 huson et al 2011 the taxonomies of accs were based on the following rule if 50 of the orfs on a contig were annotated as the same taxon this contig was then assigned to that taxon ishii et al 2013 the average coverage indicating abundance gb of each arg carrying contig was quantified by mapping metagenomic sequencing reads to the gene cassette using clc genomics workbench with a minimum similarity of 95 and over 95 of the read length the species level taxonomic list of accs was then further compared with the summarized pathogen list proposed in a previous study to identify arg carrying pathogen li et al 2015a furthermore virulence factors carried by arg carrying pathogen was screened by using vfdb virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria based online annotation pipeline vfanalyzer chen et al 2016 2 5 pathogen tracking from small sized microbes to identify pathogen from small sized microbes in drinking water metaphlan2 metagenomic phylogenetic analysis truong et al 2015 was used to conduct taxonomic profiling of metagenomic sequences the species taxa and corresponding abundances were subsequently extracted from the obtained taxonomic profiles the species level taxonomic list was then further compared with a previously summarized pathogen list li et al 2015a to identify small sized pathogen in the drinking water samples 2 6 qpcr abundance of important args with prevalence in all samples were further quantified by using quantitative real time pcr qpcr assay the unit of args were transformed into relative abundance by normalizing to 16s rrna gene as copy of arg per 16s rrna gene primers of args and 16s rrna gene were listed in supplementary materials table s9 each 20 μl qpcr reaction consisted of 10 μl 2 sybr green master mixes bio rad hercules california 0 5 μm each primer 5 ng dna as template and 7 μl nuclease free pcr grade water the thermal cycle consisted of a 3 min initial enzyme activation at 95 c followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 60 c for 30 s and extension 72 c for 60 s reactions were performed on a bio rad cfx96 connect real time pcr detection system and quantified with bio rad cfx manager software bio rad hercules california all qpcrs were performed in technical triplicates with negative controls specific amplification of qpcr was confirmed by checking the melting curve of the target gene in each sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water first a metagenomic technique based on the structured sarg database was used to profile the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water and present a comprehensive spectrum of the args carried by these microbes that had opportunistically passed through membrane disinfection and thus represent a direct risk to human health via drinking water a total of 265 arg subtypes classified into 17 arg types were detected in small sized microbes from the 20 drinking water samples collected in 12 cities fig 1 table 1 with total abundances ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell until now very limited studies had been employed to show the abundance of args in household drinking water tap water because of its low biomass and limitation of sample collection among the limited previous studies xu et al 2016 used high throughput qpcr to quantify diverse args in tap water and the relative abundance of args normalizing to cell number ranged from 5 75 10 1 to 8 25 10 1 copies cell this is in the range of our detection with 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell genes encoding multidrug 1 6 10 2 to 5 0 10 1 copies cell bacitracin 1 4 10 2 to 2 6 10 1 copy cell and beta lactam resistance 2 6 10 4 to 1 2 10 1 copies cell were detected at the highest levels of abundance in these microbes furthermore these top 3 arg types together with genes conferring resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls aminoglycoside sulfonamide and fosmidomycin were detected as general arg types in small sized microbes from all samples among the 265 arg subtypes baca bacitracin and mexf multidrug were dominant with respective abundances of 1 4 10 2 to 2 4 10 1 and 1 5 10 3 to 6 5 10 2 copies cell in the drinking water samples fig 2 presents the profiles of 56 arg subtypes carried by small sized microbes in drinking water samples with average abundances of 1 0 10 3 copies cell notably 27 arg subtypes were prevalent in the drinking water samples from all cities these encoded resistance to bacitracin baca and bcra fosmidomycin rosa and rosb mls macb and maca multidrug acrb acrf adeb amrb bpef ceob emrb mdtb mdtc mdtf mexb mexf mext mexw multidrug abc transporter multidrug transporter ompr oprc polymyxin arna sulfonamide sul1 and vancomycin vanr among them 17 arg subtypes were defined as generalist arg subtypes present in all samples fig 2 moreover primers of 4 generalist args baca acrb mexf and sul1 were available in previous studies by literature search and seven samples were randomly selected to further verify their prevalence by using qpcr method all the examined generalist args were detected in these samples supplementary materials table s10 mexf and sul1 had similar abundances comparing with using metagenomic based approach while baca and acrb were averagely 100 times less the metagenomic based arg detection mainly relies on arg database and therefore the most complete arg database sarg v2 0 containing 23 arg types 1227 arg subtypes and 12307 reference sequences was used in the present study in sarg v2 0 database there are totally 241 non redundant baca sequences and 117 acrb sequences thus it covers more sequence diversity not only to annotate amplify for specific sequence or region of target genes the generalist arg types namely bacitracin multidrug sulfonamide beta lactam and aminoglycoside have previously been reported to be relatively highly abundant in drinking water metagenomes li et al 2015b xu et al 2016 bacterial strains isolated from drinking water were also frequently reported to be resistant to these antibiotics figueira et al 2011 xi et al 2009 at the arg subtype level baca macb acrb and sul1 have previously been detected in drinking water samples ma et al 2017 whereas some of the detected arg subtypes such as blalcr 1 blalra 17 and blaoxa 142 were identified in drinking water for the first time as this is the first large scale study to determine the dominant and prevalent antibiotic resistome among small sized microbes in drinking water samples we aimed to further clarify whether some of the detected args were specifically carried by specific small sized microbes in drinking water and how these might pose risks to human health 3 2 specific args in small sized microbes in drinking water to reveal specific arg patterns in small sized microbes collected from drinking water we compared the arg profile with that of large sized microbes 0 45 μm in the same samples notably the abundance of args carried by small sized microbes 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell was on average 7 4 less than that carried by large sized microbes 4 9 10 2 to 1 2 100 copies cell p 0 01 four arg types multidrug beta lactam polymyxin and trimethoprim resistance genes were identified at significantly higher percentages in small sized microbes 1 4 30 5 23 9 and 57 4 respectively fig 3 a bar chart significantly small and large sized microbes in drinking water shared 81 1 of arg diversity though 43 of the 265 detected arg subtypes 16 2 in a total abundance of 0 33 average 1 3 10 3 copies cell were not observed in large sized microbes fig 3a pie chart and were specifically carried by small sized microbes these 43 specific arg subtypes belonged to four arg types aminoglycoside diversity 2 mls diversity 2 beta lactam diversity 36 and tetracycline diversity 3 among them 36 specific beta lactam resistance genes were present at a total abundance of 1 1 10 3 copies cell accounting for 6 1 of the total abundance of the beta lactam type one such gene blatem 127 a broad spectrum beta lactamase previously identified in escherichia coli jia et al 2017 olesen et al 2004 was detected at a significant level in sample dw1 heilongjiang province mainland china with at least 1 blatem 127 copy per 500 small sized microbes 2 1 10 3 copies cell to further clarify the different arg patterns carried by different bacterial communities in the drinking water samples a procrustes analysis fig 3b based on the arg profiles of small and large sized microbes was performed the results suggested that the drinking water samples could be distributed separately and that samples collected from shandong shanghai gansu and tibet in mainland china were much more similar to each other than to the other samples subsequently a follow up question was proposed which difference is more significant the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes among different samples or the antibiotic resistomes of both small and large sized microbes in the same sample then a correlation based differential test was used to compare and clarify these differences as shown in fig 4 the geometric mean of the pearson s r between samples was 0 851 while the r value between small and large sized microbes was 0 931 therefore the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in a drinking water sample is much more similar to that of the large sized microbes in the same sample than to the resistome of small sized microbes in the other drinking water samples further indicating that the antibiotic resistomes in diverse drinking water samples were not much bacterial size driven even though 43 arg subtypes were found specifically carried by small size microbes 3 3 small sized pathogenic hosts of args in drinking water thirty five arg carrying contigs 1000 bp were identified from the assembled drinking water metagenomes of small sized microbes these contigs contained args encoding resistance to aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam multidrug rifamycin and sulfonamide the accs were annotated as fragments of proteobacteria 80 actinobacteria 3 and unclassified 17 fig 5 significantly multidrug resistance genes mexf mext mexw and bacitracin resistance genes baca were frequently identified on proteobacteria accs 57 and 20 respectively using a previously summarized pathogen list li et al 2015a 3 accs were identified as fragments of opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas alcaligenes pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium gordonae while no virulence factor was found carried on these arg carrying pathogen fragments detailed information of the 3 arg carrying pathogen fragements including abundance and best annotation in ncbi database was present in the supplementary materials table s6 these arg carrying pathogen fragments carried mexw and aph 3 i and aac 2 i which encode resistance to multidrug and aminoglycoside respectively among the detected arg carrying pathogen p aeruginosa is considered a notoriously difficult to treat pathogen that can cause severe diseases and infections its efflux mechanism for antibiotic resistance may pose a great challenge to antibiotic development winkler et al 2015 additionally m gordonae an opportunistic pathogen was previously detected throughout drinking water treatment systems liu et al 2012 lu et al 2016 vaerewijck et al 2005 and its increased frequency in potable drinking water in the usa was revealed in a recent case study using a culture based method donohue et al 2015 the wide prevalence of m gordonae in drinking water as well as its correlation with args identified in this study identifies this organism as a necessary concern regarding drinking water safety therefore antibiotic resistome in drinking water especially that of pathogenic bacteria which may cause failure of antibiotics and threats to human beings deserving more future studies generally coliforms and escherichia coli are considered the standard pathogenic microbial indicators of drinking water safety edberg et al 2000 and a standard of 0 mpn cfu 100 ml has been set for assessment however the majority of pathogen opportunistic pathogen and even antibiotic resistant pathogen are difficult to detect given the low biomass in drinking water and limitations of traditional culture methods su et al 2018 in the present study the taxonomic annotation of accs greatly enhanced the identification of possible arg hosts especially pathogenic hosts in drinking water accordingly the metagenomic technique is a promising tool for drinking water safety monitoring and surveillance given its ability to conduct comprehensive and high throughput scans of args and arg carrying pathogen this technique could further yield reference material and support for decision making processes regarding the management of arb and args and safety control of human drinking water 3 4 profiles of small sized pathogen in drinking water to further elucidate the overall profile of small sized pathogen in drinking water taxonomic profiling was conducted using metaphlan2 truong et al 2015 five opportunistic pathogen acinetobacter johnsonii acinetobacter junii escherichia coli legionella pneumophila and pseudomonas alcaligenes were detected via comparison against a previously published pathogen list li et al 2015a using the profiles of the detected 78 bacterial species and the corresponding abundances of these samples supplementary materials table s7 diverse pathogenic species were detected in samples dw1 a johnsonii and e coli dw3 e coli and p alcaligenes and dw16 a junii and e coli notably e coli was the most dominant pathogenic bacteria among the small sized microorganisms in drinking water with an average abundance of 1 52 and occurrence rate of 40 in all of the samples in addition e coli was observed in 89 of the pathogen containing samples in this study based on its wide prevalence in drinking water and its status as a representative of diverse pathogen e coli can be considered the most likely indicator of pathogen among small sized microbes in drinking water l pneumophila which was detected in dw11 is another primary human pathogenic bacterium this bacterium is the causative agent of legionnaires disease a severe and often lethal form of pneumonia drinking water is considered as important source of l pneumophila infection albert weissenberger et al 2007 lin et al 2011a b each year 56 000 113 000 people are infected with legionella bacteria in the usa however l pneumophila has not previously been included in the routine monitoring of drinking water safety given the limitations of traditional culture methods and its low frequency in drinking water the development of high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses have led to the proposal herein of an effective approach to the monitoring of pathogen in drinking water especially pathogen that pose high risks to public health 3 5 classification of drinking water samples polluted by args to facilitate future antimicrobial resistance monitoring and management of drinking water we classified these drinking water samples into three groups considering the potential public health risks posed by args and pathogen according to the detection of arg pathogen and arg carrying pathogen fig 6 a with arg carrying pathogen detected b with args and pathogen detected but no arg carrying pathogen and c with only args detected group a and b were further classified into two subgroups 1 and 2 based on the detection of obligate opportunistic pathogen group c was further classified into subgroups based on whether the detected args are mobile or not mobile args are carried by mobile genetic elements and can undergo horizontal gene transfer among microbes and thus represent risks to human health forsberg et al 2012 accordingly drinking water that meets the criteria for group c 2 and thus lacks mobile args i e the possibility of transfer to pathogen could be considered relatively safe in terms of antimicrobial resistance despite the presence of args the drinking water samples analyzed in the present study were grouped using the above criteria for classification here the classification was based on the occurrence of args and pathogen in both small and large sized microorganisms table 2 two drinking water samples containing arg carrying opportunistic pathogen dw7 and dw8 shanghai china were classified as group a 2 while 75 samples belonged to group b 2 because they contained args and opportunistic pathogen but no arg carrying pathogen the small sized microbes in samples dw14 dw15 dw18 and dw20 were classified into group c however they were reclassified into group b 2 because of the detection of args and opportunistic pathogen in large sized microorganisms from these samples this finding suggests that filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane efficiently removed pathogen from these four drinking water samples furthermore only 15 of samples in this study were classified into group c no pathogen detected low frequency 15 of group c 2 in this study suggests that drinking water should be subjected to additional monitoring and surveillance of args and pathogen this classification system based on the occurrence of args pathogen and arg carrying pathogen which reflects the potential risks of antimicrobial resistance to public health could provide a reference and guidance for future arg studies and drinking water management frequent previous reports on the risks of mobile args with regard to human health have attracted considerable attention von wintersdorff et al 2016 however a database or list of mobile args is lacking this subject warrants additional efforts to facilitate risk assessments of drinking water and would benefit other human related environments such as swimming pools aerosols and food safety furthermore more efforts need to be paid for dose and duration dependent health risk assessment considering args pathogen and arg carrying pathogen in drinking water to further quantify and concretize the classification system for enhancing drinking water safety 3 6 relevance to drinking water safety management this study is the first to reveal the potential public health risks caused by the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water these small sized microbes opportunistically passed through the traditional drinking water treatment process and a further disinfection process involving filtration membranes especially micro filtration membranes and remained in the tap water thus exacerbating the risks of ingestion and horizontal gene transfer to human pathogen to meet the challenge posed by the small sized microbe resistome and enhance drinking water safety the following solutions and strategies are proposed 3 6 1 membrane filtration treatment should be applied before water is consumed in households membrane filtration treatment especially through an ultra filtration membrane pore size 0 1 μm should be promoted as an in situ in home post treatment after traditional drinking water treatment processes with the aim of removing the remaining arb and args from drinking water countries and regions with relatively poor or rough drinking water treatment processes and those considering tap water as a source of potable drinking water e g usa singapore should promote and popularize membrane based drinking water filtration treatment additionally tap water is boiled before drinking in some countries and regions blake et al 2016 although boiling certainly prevents the risk of infection caused by microbes in drinking water francis et al 2015 the remaining undestroyed arg dnas could still be transferred horizontally to pathogen and thus pose risks to human health 3 6 2 arb and arg indices and standards should be involved in assessments of drinking water quality and safety drinking water safety poses a challenge to public health cotruvo 2017 an arb and arg index should be implemented in drinking water quality control with the intention of controlling and preventing antibiotic failure and the horizontal transfer of args to human pathogen the norms and standards in such an index could be implemented in the near future based on the following 3 aspects characters researcher public government 1 more studies and evaluations of args hosts and horizontal transfer among bacteria especially from non pathogen to pathogen in drinking water 2 improved civic awareness and precautions regarding the risks of args to public health and 3 support and promotion via governmental laws and regulations the solutions and strategies proposed to control the abundance of args and arb in drinking water are presented in detail in fig 7 to provide a reference and support for further control and management of these elements future studies on args and pathogen in drinking water systems are warranted such as dose and duration dependent health risk assessment and disinfection technology improvement etc more efforts from all involved parties including researchers governments and the public should be concentrated to ensure the sustainable management and promotion of drinking water safety 4 conclusion the present study used a large scale metagenomic data analysis to provide new insights into the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in drinking water a total of 265 arg subtypes belonging to 17 arg types were detected at abundances ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell notably args encoding resistance to multidrug bacitracin and aminoglycoside were dominant among small sized microbes which specifically carried 16 2 of all arg subtypes moreover the prevalence of dominant args carried by small sized microbes in drinking water was also verified by using qpcr methods for future arg study in diverse environmental samples it is appealed that the metagenomic based method with the strength of high sequence diversity and traditional methods e g qpcr with strength of low detection limit could be combined to excavate and solve antimicrobial resistance issue notably continuous updating arg database is necessary that will not only facilitate comprehensive profiling of antibiotic resistome metagenomic analysis but also contribute to primers design for broader args detection pcr qpcr epic pcr etc a further correlation analysis revealed that the antibiotic resistome of small sized microbes in a drinking water sample were much more similar to those of large sized microbes in the same samples than to those of small sized microbes from drinking water samples collected elsewhere the assembled contigs annotated as p alcaligenes p aeruginosa and m gordonae were found to carry mexw aph 3 i and aac 2 i respectively based on these findings and concerns about drinking water safety samples were further classified into three groups based on the presence of arg pathogen and arg carrying pathogen additionally solutions and strategies are proposed to provide a further reference and guidance for antibiotic resistance control and management in drinking water namely 1 membrane filtration treatment and 2 the establishment of a standard for args and arb in drinking water monitoring that involves researchers the public and governments the findings and strategies proposed herein are expected to facilitate and promote the global surveillance and risk assessment of antimicrobial resistance in drinking water within the agendas of water supply authorities and government these initiatives would mitigate the public health threats of potential antibiotic resistant pathogen infection transmitted by drinking water and subsequent antibiotic
