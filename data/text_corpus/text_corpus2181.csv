10905,in a future climate warmer and drier conditions are expected and the associated negative impacts in agricultural productions are a major issue assessing the risk of drought hazard on agricultural systems is therefore of main importance in decision making with the aim of mitigating drought related crop losses in this study the agricultural drought risk is defined as the conditional probability of occurring crop losses under drought conditions we use the copula theory to estimate joint probability distributions describing the amount of dependence between drought conditions and crop yield anomalies of two major rainfed cereals in the iberian peninsula wheat and barley in the period 1986 2016 further conditional probability distributions of the crop yield anomalies under different drought levels are obtained using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the satellite derived indices vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci the results suggest that in general the joint behaviour of yield anomalies and drought conditions exhibits a dependence between the extreme values whereas barley exhibits greater probabilities of joint extreme low values of yield and drought indicators moreover while tci is mainly used in copula models indicating greater probabilities of joint extreme high values of wheat and drought indicators gumbel models vci and spei are mainly associated to copula models indicating greater probabilities of joint extreme low values clayton models the estimated conditional probabilities of occurrence of crop loss are illustrated at the province level and suggest that agricultural drought risk increases with drought severity in most of the provinces keywords drought rainfed cereals joint probability probability of crop loss probabilistic decision making 1 introduction extreme weather events such as droughts are major sources of risk to agricultural systems mainly in rainfed conditions ben ari et al 2016 hernandez barrera et al 2017 páscoa et al 2017 zampieri et al 2017 ribeiro et al 2018 the agricultural drought risk characterized by the probability of crop failure under the impact of dry conditions often entails substantial economic losses skakun et al 2016 xie et al 2018 hence the combined assessment of the drought hazard and the associated impacts on crop production based on a probabilistic approach is suitable to capture the multivariate character of drought risk in agriculture madadgar et al 2017 to overcome drought identification and characterization problems several approaches have been developed in the last decades among multivariate analysis approaches copula functions are becoming quite popular e g mirabbasi et al 2012 lee et al 2013 li et al 2015 copulas are based on sklar s theorem linking one dimensional marginal distributions to form a joint distribution the joint distribution can be described by the respective marginal distributions and the copula which describes the dependence structure copulas have been applied to hydrological extremes i e droughts and floods focusing on the characteristics of the events such as intensity duration and frequency namely mirabbasi et al 2012 estimated the bivariate joint behaviour of drought duration and severity and a trivariate approach was adopted by madadgar and moradkhani 2013 for the joint behaviour of drought intensity duration and frequency under climate change scenarios apart from being able to model two different characteristics of the same event e g severity and duration of droughts copula based models can also be used to estimate the joint distributions of two or more different variables e g madadgar et al 2017 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 for instance the recent and challenging understanding of the concurrent occurrence of different climate extremes referred to as a compound event have been addressed based on copula methods manning et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 have addressed the structure of the dependence between warm season temperature and precipitation using copulas and they found that the co occurrence of extremely hot and dry conditions is expected to increase under a strong greenhouse gas forcing scenario the application of copula theory to agrometeorological studies is also relatively recent the use of copula based models to model the joint distribution of rainfed agricultural crops and drought conditions has been recently performed by e g madadgar et al 2017 for australia and bokusheva et al 2016 in kazakhstan the previous mentioned authors have focused on establishing conditional probability distributions of yield in terms of copulas characterizing droughts based on hydro meteorological madadgar et al 2017 and remote sensing data bokusheva et al 2016 respectively the appeal of using copulas in multivariate modelling is that the individual variables do not necessarily have the same probability distribution nelsen 2013 in addition the statistical inference of copulas is not restricted to methods implying the parametrical estimation of the margins maity 2018 in this work we use the unique abilities of copulas to link crop yield anomalies with drought information to achieve two main objectives 1 estimate joint distributions two dimensional space describing the amount of dependence between yield anomalies and drought conditions and 2 use the estimated joint distributions to generate random crop yield anomalies preserving the structure of the dependence with droughts the agricultural drought risk is evaluated in terms of the conditional probability of non exceedance of the crop loss thresholds ranging between 0 low agricultural drought risk and 1 high agricultural drought risk to use a clearly and interpretable measure for decision support in case of agricultural drought here drought condition is characterized using the remotely sensed vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci and the hydro meteorological multi scalar standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in addition drought impacts are assessed in terms of two major world crop productions wheat and barley particularly significant in the mediterranean regions leff et al 2004 where dryness is expected to increase in coming decades giorgi and lionello 2008 2 data and methods data on crop yields were obtained from the portuguese national statistics institute ine and the spanish agriculture food and environment ministry at the sub national scale we have considered two winter cereals for analysis wheat and barley as they are major crop productions growing in rainfed conditions in the iberian peninsula ip and therefore susceptible to suffer from drought conditions austin et al 1998 páscoa et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2006 fig 1 illustrates the locations and names of the 54 considered provinces of portugal 7 regions referred as provinces hereafter instead of regions for sake of consistency with spain nomenclature and spain 47 provinces three spanish provinces vizcaya guipúzcoa and asturias were excluded due to the lack of production of one or both cereals on a consistent manner during the study period namely the province of vizcaya spain has not produced barley during the analysed period and it only produced wheat during 12 non consecutive years with relatively small harvested area between 1 and 5 ha in a similar way we also excluded the province of guipúzcoa spain which has not produced wheat and barley during this period and asturias spain which has not produced barley the annual values of wheat and barley yields th 1 were calculated as the ratio between crop production t and harvested area ha during the period of 1986 2016 for each province the yield anomalies were computed by removing the linear trend to exclude non climatic factors gouveia and trigo 2008 páscoa et al 2017 in this study we define crop loss as events when yield anomalies are below minus one standard deviation 1std of the time series of annual crop yield anomalies in this way the target of our analysis is focused on estimating the expected chance that the negative yield anomalies will not exceed i e is not higher than 1std of each province and cereal mean yield considering the average yield anomalies and the outliers and not only the average which would be the case of using zero as threshold and crop loss events would correspond to yield anomalies only below zero and not below 1std fig 2 summarizes the yield standard deviation of the yield anomalies on each province and cereal notice that portuguese provinces particularly entre douro e minho beira interior and algarve show relatively low values of standard deviation suggesting that crop loss thresholds correspond to values slightly below normal in comparison to spanish provinces hence in general portuguese annual yields are close to mean values and the difference between maximum and minimum yield values is small on the other hand valladolid avila cordoba sevilla orense cuenca and lerida show the highest values of crop loss threshold fig 2 in this study drought hazard was evaluated using remotely sensed and hydro meteorological multiscalar drought indices in terms of remote sensing we employed the satellite based vegetation condition index vci kogan et al 2015 and the temperature condition index tci kogan 1995 vci and tci monitor vegetation condition based respectively on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and brightness temperature bt being indicators of moisture and thermal stress on vegetation respectively weekly global maps of vci and tci were retrieved at 4 km spatial resolution from noaa s ftp server ftp ftp star nesdis noaa gov pub corp scsb wguo data blended vh 4km geo tiff during 1985 2016 and spatial averages of these indices were computed for each province in terms of hydro meteorological drought indices we used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 at different time scales 1 to 12 months during 1986 2016 the spei computation considers the role played by the evaporative demand on the occurrence of dry events consisting in a monthly climatic water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 in this study the monthly drought index spei gridded values with spatial resolution of 0 5 were computed based on precipitation and reference evapotranspiration values from the climate research unit cru ts4 01 using a log logistic distribution for statistical fitting vicente serrano et al 2010 and a gaussian kernel function to accumulate the previous months further spatial averages were computed for each province similar to earlier work performed by the authors ribeiro et al 2018 the indices vci and tci were examined between the weeks 35 and 25 comprising the major crop life cycle moments and the indices spei at 12 time scales were examined from january to june due to the time scale memory however in the present work we extended the data to the period 1986 2016 and to the province level while ribeiro et al 2018 considered the shorter period 1986 2012 and only 2 clusters of 5 and 4 provinces of the ip this high spatial scale is likely to better reflect the high spatial variability of climate conditions in the ip beguería and vicente serrano 2006 esteban parra et al 1998 trigo et al 2013 trıgo and dacamara 2000 the geographic distribution of mean rainfall amounts over the ip is illustrated in fig 3 for the vegetative cycle of the winter crops from sowing approximately in september of the year n 1 to the harvest approximately in june of the year n based on the precipitation dataset considered to compute the spei the precipitation regime exhibits strong spatial gradients with higher values in the northwestern sector and lower values in the southeastern sector as reported by several authors andrade and belo pereira 2015 belo pereira et al 2011 the northwestern southeastern contrasts in the precipitation regime are responsible for the spatial distribution of the vegetation behaviour in the ip and for these reason gouveia et al 2017 have also found a similar gradient of vegetation clusters the dominant drought indicator in explaining each cereal time series variability was selected for each province table 1 the baseline pool of drought indicators includes 43 week intervals of vci 43 week intervals of tci and 6 month by 12 time scales intervals of spei totalling 158 possible drought indicators for each cereal and province a stepwise linear regression was applied to perform a prior selection of the best subset of drought indicators for each cereal followed by the selection of the one with largest absolute value of the standardized regression coefficients table 1 indicates the selected drought indicator for each provinces and respective selected week in the case of vci and tci or month and time scale in the case of spei according to table 1 all the selected drought indicators are statistically significant at the 5 significance level the null hypothesis tests if the corresponding regression coefficient is equal to zero under the influence of the remaining drought indicators selected by stepwise regression in order to assess how each selected drought indicator influences crop s variability we use partial correlation the squared partial correlation coefficient indicates how much of the variance which is not estimated by the remain drought indicators chosen by stepwise regression is estimated by the selected drought indicator in the results section we will discuss in more detail the selected drought indicators fig 3 after the selection of one drought indicator for each cereal and province bivariate models based on copula functions are estimated copulas were firstly mentioned in the literature more than half a century ago by sklar 1959 however their application to the environmental and earth sciences is more recent maity 2018 mathematically given two correlated variables x and y with marginal distributions f x x and f y y uniform on the interval 0 1 a copula function c links these distributions to their joint probability distribution f x y x y as follows f x y x y c f x x f y y here x denote the yield anomalies y a drought indicator spei vci or tci and x y are pairs of observations a more detailed description of the use of copulas is provided by nelsen 2013 a total of five commonly used copulas were considered to estimate the bivariate joint dependence structures gaussian student s t copula clayton gumbel and frank table 2 these well documented copula functions belong to two distinct classes of copulas elliptical gaussian and student s t copula and archimedean clayton gumbel and frank among all types of copulas described in the literature most of the recent studies using copulas for agrometeorological purposes have employed the classes referred above given their properties bokusheva et al 2016 madadgar et al 2017 zscheischler et al 2017 the archimedean copulas have an explicit formula with only one parameter table 2 and are quite popular given their ability in capturing a wider variety of joint dependence structures and in some cases joint tail dependence i e joint extreme events the clayton and gumbel copulas describe an asymmetrical tail behaviour exhibiting greater dependence in the lower and upper tail respectively while the students t copula is only able to model joint symmetric tail dependence however the frank copula in a similar way to the gaussian copula is only capable to capture joint symmetric dependence without tail dependence despite the popularity of the elliptical copulas because they derive from well known distributions associated to the widely used pearson s correlation the elliptical dependence is only able to capture radial symmetry and the mathematical expressions do not have a closed form table 2 the mentioned copulas were tested and selected based on the smallest value of akaike s information criteria aic li et al 2015 for each cereal and province in order to transform the individual variables to uniformly distributed values between 0 and 1 as required by copula definition we used the kernel density estimator of the cumulative distribution function cdf this procedure is named canonical maximum likelihood cml method genest et al 1995 which allows for semi parametric estimation of the copula models using this procedure the estimation of the margins is performed non parametrically and the later fitting of the copula functions is performed by means of maximum likelihood to determine the copula parameters genest et al 1995 the main aim of adopting a semi parametric methodology is to avoid heavy assumptions about the marginal distributions when the sample size is rather small which can compromise the robustness of the models the data sample dimension n 31 used in this study results from the annual nature of the harvest values and from the use of remote sensing information that began in the eighties of the last century nevertheless the use of a semi parametric methodology is a good alternative without sacrificing the use of an important source of information complementary to climate variables such as the remote sensing of vegetation the copula parameters were estimated and afterwards uniformly distributed data was simulated originating f x s i m x and f y s i m y which stand for simulated distributions of yield anomalies and drought indicator respectively the data generation simulated 1000 pairs of data in the range 0 1 which were transformed back to the original scale using the kernel estimations of the inverse cdf this way we obtained simulations of yield anomalies x s i m and respective drought indicator y s i m and selected the data points of x s i m which correspond to particular drought conditions y of y s i m severe or extreme droughts mild or moderate drought and no drought see table 3 such that x s i m x y x s i m x y y as follows the conditional probability distributions of yield anomalies for different drought levels f x s i m preserve the structure of the dependence between the original marginal distributions of yield anomalies f x x and the drought indicator f y y by using their joint distribution for each drought condition the risk of crop loss was evaluated in terms of the conditional probability of non exceedance cpne of the crop loss thresholds of each cereal and province fig 2 given by f x s i m x s t d p r x s i m x s t d where x s t d is the crop loss threshold 1std for each province and cereal in this way in this study we define the agricultural drought risk as the conditional probability of occurring crop losses given that certain drought conditions are met 3 results drought conditions were characterized based on one drought indicator for each cereal wheat and barley at the province level fig 4 and table 1 according to the absolute value of the standardized regression coefficient fig 4 shows the selected drought indicator vci tci or spei and the variance of the crop yield explained by this indicator although not shown the corresponding partial correlations are all statistically significant according to fig 4 a the spei is selected to characterize drought conditions in almost half of the provinces in the ip 20 provinces in the case of wheat and 23 in the case of barley followed by the vci 14 provinces in the case of wheat and 18 in the case of barley and tci 12 provinces in the case of wheat and 5 in the case of barley while spei is mostly selected in the eastern provinces of the peninsula vci is mostly selected in western regions in the case of both rainfed cereals the tci is the drought indicator less selected presenting its influence on the northern provinces of spain in both cereals and also in central south provinces of the ip in the case of wheat in general the provincial barley yield shows a larger number of provinces with greater explained variance in comparison to wheat fig 4 b moreover both cereals show most of lower values of explained variance in northwestern provinces while higher values of explained variance are mainly present in eastern provinces according to fig 4 b more than 70 of the yield variability in zamora is explained in both cereals as obtained by the standardized regression coefficients and the correspondent drought conditions are characterized by the tci week 21 middle of may in the case of wheat and by the vci week 20 beginning of may in the case of barley see also table 1 besides zamora the provinces burgos albacete and granada also show a percentage of explained variance higher than 70 in the case of barley fig 3 while drought conditions influencing barley yield in burgos northern province are characterized by tci week 23 end of may the drought conditions in albacete and granada southeastern provinces are characterized by the spei march with 5 month time scale and june with 11 month time scale respectively see table 1 ribeiro et al 2018 also showed that there are stronger relationships between remote sensing indices and cereal yield in the western regions of the ip while the yield variability in the eastern region is better predicted based on spei in portugal alentejo is the province with the highest explained variance of cereal yield variability and the drought conditions are characterized by the vci in the week 14 end of march in both cereals fig 4 b as a matter of fact alentejo is the province producing most of the rainfed cereals in portugal gouveia and trigo 2008 and it is particularly affected by drought episodes moreira et al 2013 the fitting of the copula functions from table 2 gaussian t copula clayton frank and gumbel was carried out for each pair of cereal yield and drought indicator fig 5 a maps the type of selected copula according to the lowest value of aic appendix a indicates the respective dependence parameter estimates and fig 5 b illustrates the number of provinces adopting each type of copula and for each type of copula the number of provinces using each type of drought indicator in both cereals the clayton copula is the most selected copula type fig 5 14 provinces in case of wheat and 21 in the case of barley which indicates greater probabilities of joint extreme low values i e lower values of yield anomalies given lower values of drought indicators the opposite situation i e greater number of provinces showing larger probabilities of joint extreme high values of yield anomalies and drought hazard i e higher values of yield anomalies and higher values of the drought indicator is also verified corresponding to gumbel models however while there are more clayton copulas in the case of barley in comparison to wheat there are more gumbel models in the case of wheat rather than in barley 12 provinces gumbel copula in the case of wheat and 8 in the case of barley moreover in the case of wheat all the clayton models have drought conditions characterized by vci and spei and half of the wheat gumbel models uses tci in a similar way in the case of barley only one of the 21 clayton models uses tci hence 20 of the 21 clayton models uses vci or spei but most of the gumbel models uses spei the majority of clayton models uses vci and the number of provinces using tci is much lower see fig 4 a as expected the t copula is the less selected type 3 provinces in the case of wheat and 1 province in the case of barley given that aic penalizes the number of estimated parameters and t copulas require the estimation of two parameters table 2 regarding the copula functions without asymptotical tail dependence gaussian and frank there are more frank copula models in the case of wheat 10 provinces in the case of wheat and 7 in the case of barley and more gaussian copula models in the case of barley 7 provinces in the case of wheat and 9 in the case of barley after estimating the joint probability distributions using copula functions the subsequent generated simulations allowed to assess the conditional probability distributions of crop yield anomalies under different drought levels no drought mild or moderate drought and severe or extreme drought see table 3 in fig 6 the conditional probability of crop loss given different drought severity classes is shown based on the crop loss thresholds mapped in fig 2 complementarily fig 7 indicates the number of provinces showing each decile of conditional probability of crop loss and the respective type of copula in general the agricultural drought risk increases with drought severity in most of the provinces with particular emphasis on the provinces of salamanca and malaga in the case of the two cereals in comparison to the other provinces salamanca exhibits the greatest drought risk of wheat and barley during mild or moderate droughts fig 6 b and a slight increase during severe or extreme droughts fig 6 a in general in comparison to wheat during mild or moderate drought fig 6 b barley shows a larger number of provinces with more than 40 chance of non exceedance of the respective crop loss thresholds during severe or extreme droughts fig 6 a the agricultural drought risk increases in most of the provinces in comparison to mild or moderate droughts fig 6 b and barley endures a larger number of provinces with more than 70 chance of non exceedance of the respective crop loss thresholds in comparison to wheat during non drought conditions fig 6 c the agricultural drought risk is considerably lower in most of the provinces ranging from 0 to 30 chance of non exceedance of the wheat loss thresholds and ranging from 0 to 20 chance of non exceedance of the barley loss thresholds despite the general increase of the agricultural drought risk with drought severity minor exceptions are detailed next the provinces ribatejo oeste frank copula ourense frank copula alava gaussian copula and navarra gaussian copula show a decrease of wheat drought risk with drought severity decreasing progressively from no drought to mild or moderate drought and to severe or extreme drought figs 5 and 6 the provinces segovia t copula soria gaussian copula and alicante t copula also decrease wheat drought risk from the situation of non drought to mild or moderate drought while burgos t copula decreases wheat drought risk from the situation of mild or moderate drought to severe or extreme drought figs 5 and 6 regarding barley only lugo frank copula and ourense frank copula provinces decrease agricultural drought risk from non drought conditions to mild or moderate drought all the provinces modelled with gumbel or clayton copulas show an increase of the agricultural drought risk with drought severity while these exceptions are modelled by gaussian frank or t copulas fig 7 as expected fig 7 indicates that the number of provinces in lower deciles of agricultural drought risk is higher during non drought conditions followed by a higher number of provinces in intermediate deciles during mild or moderate droughts and the higher number of provinces in higher deciles is observed during severe or extreme droughts in addition the majority of the provinces with more than 70 chance of non exceedance of the respective crop loss thresholds during severe or extreme droughts is modelled by clayton copulas in both cereals fig 7 a yellow bars in a similar way the clayton provinces are also distributed in the greater deciles of agricultural drought risk during mild or moderate droughts of both cereals fig 7 b yellow bars during severe or extreme droughts and mild or moderate droughts the gumbel provinces are mainly associated to intermediate deciles of agricultural drought risk fig 7 a and b red bars the lower deciles of severe or extreme droughts and mild or moderate droughts are mainly associated to gaussian frank or t copulas fig 7 grey purple and blue bars 4 discussion and conclusions this work aimed to apply the copula approach for estimating the amount of dependence between crop yield anomalies wheat and barley and drought conditions in terms of the joint cumulative distribution function based on the estimated dependence structures the agricultural drought risk in the ip was defined as the conditional probability of non exceedance of crop loss thresholds under different drought levels no drought mild or moderate drought and severe or extreme drought the drought hazard was characterized in terms of the spei vci and tci combining the advantages of both hydrometeorological and remote sensing data for the assessment of drought conditions the results were illustrated at the province level of the ip and for each cereal and intended to address the following key questions 1 which are the critical drought indicators influencing crop yield variability 2 which are the most adequate copula functions to represent the dependence between crop yield anomalies and drought indicators 3 is there some type of copula most closely associated to the type of drought indicator 4 what is the conditional probability of joint extreme low values i e the likelihood of crop loss under different levels of drought severity 5 is there some type of copula most closely associated to higher values of agricultural drought risk 6 which are the provinces and cereals with higher agricultural drought risk according to the applied methodology the following paragraphs address the fundamental findings of the present study and answer the previously established questions in general the spei was found to be the drought indicator most adequate to the highest number of provinces in both cereals fig 4 a however in comparison to wheat barley presents a larger number of provinces characterized by spei and with larger explained variance fig 4 on the other hand the provinces with higher explained variance do not necessarily coincide with the selection of spei after the spei the vci is the second most selected type of drought indicator particularly regarding barley yield anomalies followed by tci fig 4 a as a matter of fact in the case of barley we can observe a west east gradient of suitability of vci in the western provinces towards spei in the eastern provinces fig 4 a this west east gradient is also slightly present in the case of wheat thus concluding that the rainfed cereal yield variability in western part of the ip is largely explained by vci while the rainfed cereals variability in eastern part of the ip is mostly explained by spei in a similar way the spatial patterns of humid semiarid climate regimes precipitation patterns and type of vegetation exhibit a northwestern southeastern gradient in the ip belo pereira et al 2011 gouveia et al 2017 soriano and pablo 2001 in other words the results suggest that the greenness of vegetation is a better proxy of yield anomalies in western rainfed cereals humid areas whereas water balance is a better proxy of yield anomalies in the eastern rainfed cereals semiarid areas in previous works using ndvi instead of vci which is ndvi derived the authors have also found a strong relationship between the wheat yield and vegetation activity in a western iberian region alentejo gouveia and trigo 2008 the influence of tci in the northern wheat and barley yields higher latitudes and elevations and in central parts of the ip in the case of wheat is also observed suggesting the importance of solar radiation for vegetation growth in these regions bento et al 2018 the most selected type of copula in both cereals was found to be clayton functions fig 5 suggesting stronger dependence between the extreme left values of drought conditions and yield anomalies in most of the provinces in addition most of the clayton models in the present work have drought conditions characterized by vci and spei indicating that the drought conditions characterized by these indicators greatly influence the occurrence of crop loss on the other hand the gumbel models greater probability of joint extreme high values in the case of wheat have most of drought conditions characterized by tci suggesting the influence of the increased solar radiation in the positive wheat anomalies in these provinces hence the results suggest that high values of tci promote positive yield anomalies of wheat over 6 of the gumbel provinces while low values of vci and spei promote negative yield anomalies of wheat over 14 clayton provinces and barley over 20 clayton provinces in general during severe or extreme drought and mild or moderate drought most of the provinces with greater deciles of probability of crop loss are associated to clayton copulas while the lower deciles are more linked to copula functions without asymptotical tail dependence gaussian and frank or without asymmetrical tail dependence t copulas moreover the provinces which do not increase agricultural drought risk with drought severity ribatejo oeste wheat ourense wheat and barley alava wheat navarra wheat segovia wheat burgos wheat and lugo barley are all modelled by copulas without tail dependence or t copulas thus suggesting that other factors rather than drought could be the reason of crop failure in these regions in a similar way páscoa et al 2017 have also found negative correlations between wheat yield and spei in provinces where there is an agreement between dry events and low yield anomalies in the present work most of the provinces which do not increase probability of crop loss with drought severity with the exception of burgos and lugo have drought conditions characterized by tci or spei suggesting that increased solar radiation and temperature could be favourable for cereal yield in these cases as expected most of the higher probabilities of agricultural drought risk during mild or moderate droughts and severe or extreme droughts are observed in provinces modelled by clayton copulas fig 7 which are closely associated to vci and spei suggesting that these indices are potential good indicators of drought related crop failure moreover to a greater severity of drought corresponds a higher agricultural drought risk in both cereals in most of the provinces however while barley exhibits 10 provinces with conditional probabilities of crop loss under severe or extreme drought higher than 90 wheat only exhibits 3 during mild or moderate droughts barley also exceeds wheat in the number of provinces with 40 50 chance of crop loss hence the results support that barley exhibits greater agricultural drought risk rather than wheat in agreement with the fact that barley is the cereal with more provinces with joint behaviour of yield anomalies and droughts described by clayton copulas similarly to the patterns found in the spatial distribution of precipitation fig 3 and type of drought indicator fig 4 one would expect a similar behaviour between neighbouring provinces in terms of selected copula models and subsequent conditional probabilities of drought related crop loss as a matter of fact in some cases even diametrically opposed dependence structures clayton and gumbel copulas are selected by neighbouring provinces this shortcoming may be associated to the distinct moments of the vegetative cycle selected to characterize droughts as shown in table 1 and to the province and crop specific threshold adopted in the present study to define crop loss events fig 2 moreover despite the spatial pattern in the mean rainfall in fig 3 a the variation coefficient in fig 3 b also do not present an evident spatial pattern with neighbouring provinces characterized by distinct precipitation variability the selection of different types of indicators and different moments of the vegetative cycle to characterize drought conditions the complex precipitation regime and the variable thresholds of crop loss between provinces and cereal specie reflects how distinct the crop specific crop loss attributable to drought conditions can be at the sub national scale previous studies performed by the authors assessing correlation patterns between spei and wheat yield anomalies at the province level of the ip páscoa et al 2017 have also found some inconsistencies associated to neighbouring provinces with opposite patterns nevertheless in the present study the galician provinces in the northwestern edge of the ip coruna lugo and orense stand out as provinces with low agricultural drought risk values in the case of both cereals in both severe or extreme and mild or moderate drought the present analysis might suggest that crop production in the ip could be focused on wheat given the lower levels of agricultural drought risk using the applied methodology however the present study does not consider an economic analysis regarding the cereal s prices the use of water resources irrigation during drought periods to avoid crop losses the use of machineries and fertilizers among other factors which influence the producers choice on crop quiroga et al 2011 have assessed crop yield risk to water pressures in spain and have found that irrigated crops do not show evidence of significant impact of drought on their yield although the irrigation area has an important effect in primarily rainfed crops such as wheat the impact decreases after a given amount of water quiroga et al 2011 therefore some losses are still expected under non drought conditions as shown in the present study fig 5 and 6 future research using the methodology applied in the present study could differentiate the yield of wheat and barley under rainfed or irrigated conditions to address if the risk of crop loss under drought conditions is reduced in the irrigated areas and if the costs involved in irrigation practices are compensatory the current study considers the total area and total production given that the amount of wheat and barley in rainfed area is much higher than in irrigated area in most of the provinces while some provinces do not use irrigation at all the application of this study using drought information under climate change scenarios and using seasonal drought forecasts are potential goals for future work moreover heatwaves have also been responsible for cereals wheat loss due to heat stress zampieri et al 2017 and it would be important to address its influence on the likelihood of crop loss using the presented methodology in summary our results point to the fact that wheat and barley are crops vulnerable to drought conditions whereas barley is suggested to exhibit greater probabilities of joint extreme low values between yield and drought indicators in most provinces in such cases drought hazard is manly characterized by vci and spei while tci is mainly used in copula models indicating greater probabilities of joint extreme high values of wheat and drought indicators in addition salamanca stands out as the province with the greatest agricultural drought risk level during mild or moderate and severe or extreme drought from an operational point of view the results aim to contribute to the decision making process in agricultural practices acknowledgements this work was partially

10905,in a future climate warmer and drier conditions are expected and the associated negative impacts in agricultural productions are a major issue assessing the risk of drought hazard on agricultural systems is therefore of main importance in decision making with the aim of mitigating drought related crop losses in this study the agricultural drought risk is defined as the conditional probability of occurring crop losses under drought conditions we use the copula theory to estimate joint probability distributions describing the amount of dependence between drought conditions and crop yield anomalies of two major rainfed cereals in the iberian peninsula wheat and barley in the period 1986 2016 further conditional probability distributions of the crop yield anomalies under different drought levels are obtained using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the satellite derived indices vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci the results suggest that in general the joint behaviour of yield anomalies and drought conditions exhibits a dependence between the extreme values whereas barley exhibits greater probabilities of joint extreme low values of yield and drought indicators moreover while tci is mainly used in copula models indicating greater probabilities of joint extreme high values of wheat and drought indicators gumbel models vci and spei are mainly associated to copula models indicating greater probabilities of joint extreme low values clayton models the estimated conditional probabilities of occurrence of crop loss are illustrated at the province level and suggest that agricultural drought risk increases with drought severity in most of the provinces keywords drought rainfed cereals joint probability probability of crop loss probabilistic decision making 1 introduction extreme weather events such as droughts are major sources of risk to agricultural systems mainly in rainfed conditions ben ari et al 2016 hernandez barrera et al 2017 páscoa et al 2017 zampieri et al 2017 ribeiro et al 2018 the agricultural drought risk characterized by the probability of crop failure under the impact of dry conditions often entails substantial economic losses skakun et al 2016 xie et al 2018 hence the combined assessment of the drought hazard and the associated impacts on crop production based on a probabilistic approach is suitable to capture the multivariate character of drought risk in agriculture madadgar et al 2017 to overcome drought identification and characterization problems several approaches have been developed in the last decades among multivariate analysis approaches copula functions are becoming quite popular e g mirabbasi et al 2012 lee et al 2013 li et al 2015 copulas are based on sklar s theorem linking one dimensional marginal distributions to form a joint distribution the joint distribution can be described by the respective marginal distributions and the copula which describes the dependence structure copulas have been applied to hydrological extremes i e droughts and floods focusing on the characteristics of the events such as intensity duration and frequency namely mirabbasi et al 2012 estimated the bivariate joint behaviour of drought duration and severity and a trivariate approach was adopted by madadgar and moradkhani 2013 for the joint behaviour of drought intensity duration and frequency under climate change scenarios apart from being able to model two different characteristics of the same event e g severity and duration of droughts copula based models can also be used to estimate the joint distributions of two or more different variables e g madadgar et al 2017 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 for instance the recent and challenging understanding of the concurrent occurrence of different climate extremes referred to as a compound event have been addressed based on copula methods manning et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 have addressed the structure of the dependence between warm season temperature and precipitation using copulas and they found that the co occurrence of extremely hot and dry conditions is expected to increase under a strong greenhouse gas forcing scenario the application of copula theory to agrometeorological studies is also relatively recent the use of copula based models to model the joint distribution of rainfed agricultural crops and drought conditions has been recently performed by e g madadgar et al 2017 for australia and bokusheva et al 2016 in kazakhstan the previous mentioned authors have focused on establishing conditional probability distributions of yield in terms of copulas characterizing droughts based on hydro meteorological madadgar et al 2017 and remote sensing data bokusheva et al 2016 respectively the appeal of using copulas in multivariate modelling is that the individual variables do not necessarily have the same probability distribution nelsen 2013 in addition the statistical inference of copulas is not restricted to methods implying the parametrical estimation of the margins maity 2018 in this work we use the unique abilities of copulas to link crop yield anomalies with drought information to achieve two main objectives 1 estimate joint distributions two dimensional space describing the amount of dependence between yield anomalies and drought conditions and 2 use the estimated joint distributions to generate random crop yield anomalies preserving the structure of the dependence with droughts the agricultural drought risk is evaluated in terms of the conditional probability of non exceedance of the crop loss thresholds ranging between 0 low agricultural drought risk and 1 high agricultural drought risk to use a clearly and interpretable measure for decision support in case of agricultural drought here drought condition is characterized using the remotely sensed vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci and the hydro meteorological multi scalar standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in addition drought impacts are assessed in terms of two major world crop productions wheat and barley particularly significant in the mediterranean regions leff et al 2004 where dryness is expected to increase in coming decades giorgi and lionello 2008 2 data and methods data on crop yields were obtained from the portuguese national statistics institute ine and the spanish agriculture food and environment ministry at the sub national scale we have considered two winter cereals for analysis wheat and barley as they are major crop productions growing in rainfed conditions in the iberian peninsula ip and therefore susceptible to suffer from drought conditions austin et al 1998 páscoa et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2006 fig 1 illustrates the locations and names of the 54 considered provinces of portugal 7 regions referred as provinces hereafter instead of regions for sake of consistency with spain nomenclature and spain 47 provinces three spanish provinces vizcaya guipúzcoa and asturias were excluded due to the lack of production of one or both cereals on a consistent manner during the study period namely the province of vizcaya spain has not produced barley during the analysed period and it only produced wheat during 12 non consecutive years with relatively small harvested area between 1 and 5 ha in a similar way we also excluded the province of guipúzcoa spain which has not produced wheat and barley during this period and asturias spain which has not produced barley the annual values of wheat and barley yields th 1 were calculated as the ratio between crop production t and harvested area ha during the period of 1986 2016 for each province the yield anomalies were computed by removing the linear trend to exclude non climatic factors gouveia and trigo 2008 páscoa et al 2017 in this study we define crop loss as events when yield anomalies are below minus one standard deviation 1std of the time series of annual crop yield anomalies in this way the target of our analysis is focused on estimating the expected chance that the negative yield anomalies will not exceed i e is not higher than 1std of each province and cereal mean yield considering the average yield anomalies and the outliers and not only the average which would be the case of using zero as threshold and crop loss events would correspond to yield anomalies only below zero and not below 1std fig 2 summarizes the yield standard deviation of the yield anomalies on each province and cereal notice that portuguese provinces particularly entre douro e minho beira interior and algarve show relatively low values of standard deviation suggesting that crop loss thresholds correspond to values slightly below normal in comparison to spanish provinces hence in general portuguese annual yields are close to mean values and the difference between maximum and minimum yield values is small on the other hand valladolid avila cordoba sevilla orense cuenca and lerida show the highest values of crop loss threshold fig 2 in this study drought hazard was evaluated using remotely sensed and hydro meteorological multiscalar drought indices in terms of remote sensing we employed the satellite based vegetation condition index vci kogan et al 2015 and the temperature condition index tci kogan 1995 vci and tci monitor vegetation condition based respectively on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and brightness temperature bt being indicators of moisture and thermal stress on vegetation respectively weekly global maps of vci and tci were retrieved at 4 km spatial resolution from noaa s ftp server ftp ftp star nesdis noaa gov pub corp scsb wguo data blended vh 4km geo tiff during 1985 2016 and spatial averages of these indices were computed for each province in terms of hydro meteorological drought indices we used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 at different time scales 1 to 12 months during 1986 2016 the spei computation considers the role played by the evaporative demand on the occurrence of dry events consisting in a monthly climatic water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 in this study the monthly drought index spei gridded values with spatial resolution of 0 5 were computed based on precipitation and reference evapotranspiration values from the climate research unit cru ts4 01 using a log logistic distribution for statistical fitting vicente serrano et al 2010 and a gaussian kernel function to accumulate the previous months further spatial averages were computed for each province similar to earlier work performed by the authors ribeiro et al 2018 the indices vci and tci were examined between the weeks 35 and 25 comprising the major crop life cycle moments and the indices spei at 12 time scales were examined from january to june due to the time scale memory however in the present work we extended the data to the period 1986 2016 and to the province level while ribeiro et al 2018 considered the shorter period 1986 2012 and only 2 clusters of 5 and 4 provinces of the ip this high spatial scale is likely to better reflect the high spatial variability of climate conditions in the ip beguería and vicente serrano 2006 esteban parra et al 1998 trigo et al 2013 trıgo and dacamara 2000 the geographic distribution of mean rainfall amounts over the ip is illustrated in fig 3 for the vegetative cycle of the winter crops from sowing approximately in september of the year n 1 to the harvest approximately in june of the year n based on the precipitation dataset considered to compute the spei the precipitation regime exhibits strong spatial gradients with higher values in the northwestern sector and lower values in the southeastern sector as reported by several authors andrade and belo pereira 2015 belo pereira et al 2011 the northwestern southeastern contrasts in the precipitation regime are responsible for the spatial distribution of the vegetation behaviour in the ip and for these reason gouveia et al 2017 have also found a similar gradient of vegetation clusters the dominant drought indicator in explaining each cereal time series variability was selected for each province table 1 the baseline pool of drought indicators includes 43 week intervals of vci 43 week intervals of tci and 6 month by 12 time scales intervals of spei totalling 158 possible drought indicators for each cereal and province a stepwise linear regression was applied to perform a prior selection of the best subset of drought indicators for each cereal followed by the selection of the one with largest absolute value of the standardized regression coefficients table 1 indicates the selected drought indicator for each provinces and respective selected week in the case of vci and tci or month and time scale in the case of spei according to table 1 all the selected drought indicators are statistically significant at the 5 significance level the null hypothesis tests if the corresponding regression coefficient is equal to zero under the influence of the remaining drought indicators selected by stepwise regression in order to assess how each selected drought indicator influences crop s variability we use partial correlation the squared partial correlation coefficient indicates how much of the variance which is not estimated by the remain drought indicators chosen by stepwise regression is estimated by the selected drought indicator in the results section we will discuss in more detail the selected drought indicators fig 3 after the selection of one drought indicator for each cereal and province bivariate models based on copula functions are estimated copulas were firstly mentioned in the literature more than half a century ago by sklar 1959 however their application to the environmental and earth sciences is more recent maity 2018 mathematically given two correlated variables x and y with marginal distributions f x x and f y y uniform on the interval 0 1 a copula function c links these distributions to their joint probability distribution f x y x y as follows f x y x y c f x x f y y here x denote the yield anomalies y a drought indicator spei vci or tci and x y are pairs of observations a more detailed description of the use of copulas is provided by nelsen 2013 a total of five commonly used copulas were considered to estimate the bivariate joint dependence structures gaussian student s t copula clayton gumbel and frank table 2 these well documented copula functions belong to two distinct classes of copulas elliptical gaussian and student s t copula and archimedean clayton gumbel and frank among all types of copulas described in the literature most of the recent studies using copulas for agrometeorological purposes have employed the classes referred above given their properties bokusheva et al 2016 madadgar et al 2017 zscheischler et al 2017 the archimedean copulas have an explicit formula with only one parameter table 2 and are quite popular given their ability in capturing a wider variety of joint dependence structures and in some cases joint tail dependence i e joint extreme events the clayton and gumbel copulas describe an asymmetrical tail behaviour exhibiting greater dependence in the lower and upper tail respectively while the students t copula is only able to model joint symmetric tail dependence however the frank copula in a similar way to the gaussian copula is only capable to capture joint symmetric dependence without tail dependence despite the popularity of the elliptical copulas because they derive from well known distributions associated to the widely used pearson s correlation the elliptical dependence is only able to capture radial symmetry and the mathematical expressions do not have a closed form table 2 the mentioned copulas were tested and selected based on the smallest value of akaike s information criteria aic li et al 2015 for each cereal and province in order to transform the individual variables to uniformly distributed values between 0 and 1 as required by copula definition we used the kernel density estimator of the cumulative distribution function cdf this procedure is named canonical maximum likelihood cml method genest et al 1995 which allows for semi parametric estimation of the copula models using this procedure the estimation of the margins is performed non parametrically and the later fitting of the copula functions is performed by means of maximum likelihood to determine the copula parameters genest et al 1995 the main aim of adopting a semi parametric methodology is to avoid heavy assumptions about the marginal distributions when the sample size is rather small which can compromise the robustness of the models the data sample dimension n 31 used in this study results from the annual nature of the harvest values and from the use of remote sensing information that began in the eighties of the last century nevertheless the use of a semi parametric methodology is a good alternative without sacrificing the use of an important source of information complementary to climate variables such as the remote sensing of vegetation the copula parameters were estimated and afterwards uniformly distributed data was simulated originating f x s i m x and f y s i m y which stand for simulated distributions of yield anomalies and drought indicator respectively the data generation simulated 1000 pairs of data in the range 0 1 which were transformed back to the original scale using the kernel estimations of the inverse cdf this way we obtained simulations of yield anomalies x s i m and respective drought indicator y s i m and selected the data points of x s i m which correspond to particular drought conditions y of y s i m severe or extreme droughts mild or moderate drought and no drought see table 3 such that x s i m x y x s i m x y y as follows the conditional probability distributions of yield anomalies for different drought levels f x s i m preserve the structure of the dependence between the original marginal distributions of yield anomalies f x x and the drought indicator f y y by using their joint distribution for each drought condition the risk of crop loss was evaluated in terms of the conditional probability of non exceedance cpne of the crop loss thresholds of each cereal and province fig 2 given by f x s i m x s t d p r x s i m x s t d where x s t d is the crop loss threshold 1std for each province and cereal in this way in this study we define the agricultural drought risk as the conditional probability of occurring crop losses given that certain drought conditions are met 3 results drought conditions were characterized based on one drought indicator for each cereal wheat and barley at the province level fig 4 and table 1 according to the absolute value of the standardized regression coefficient fig 4 shows the selected drought indicator vci tci or spei and the variance of the crop yield explained by this indicator although not shown the corresponding partial correlations are all statistically significant according to fig 4 a the spei is selected to characterize drought conditions in almost half of the provinces in the ip 20 provinces in the case of wheat and 23 in the case of barley followed by the vci 14 provinces in the case of wheat and 18 in the case of barley and tci 12 provinces in the case of wheat and 5 in the case of barley while spei is mostly selected in the eastern provinces of the peninsula vci is mostly selected in western regions in the case of both rainfed cereals the tci is the drought indicator less selected presenting its influence on the northern provinces of spain in both cereals and also in central south provinces of the ip in the case of wheat in general the provincial barley yield shows a larger number of provinces with greater explained variance in comparison to wheat fig 4 b moreover both cereals show most of lower values of explained variance in northwestern provinces while higher values of explained variance are mainly present in eastern provinces according to fig 4 b more than 70 of the yield variability in zamora is explained in both cereals as obtained by the standardized regression coefficients and the correspondent drought conditions are characterized by the tci week 21 middle of may in the case of wheat and by the vci week 20 beginning of may in the case of barley see also table 1 besides zamora the provinces burgos albacete and granada also show a percentage of explained variance higher than 70 in the case of barley fig 3 while drought conditions influencing barley yield in burgos northern province are characterized by tci week 23 end of may the drought conditions in albacete and granada southeastern provinces are characterized by the spei march with 5 month time scale and june with 11 month time scale respectively see table 1 ribeiro et al 2018 also showed that there are stronger relationships between remote sensing indices and cereal yield in the western regions of the ip while the yield variability in the eastern region is better predicted based on spei in portugal alentejo is the province with the highest explained variance of cereal yield variability and the drought conditions are characterized by the vci in the week 14 end of march in both cereals fig 4 b as a matter of fact alentejo is the province producing most of the rainfed cereals in portugal gouveia and trigo 2008 and it is particularly affected by drought episodes moreira et al 2013 the fitting of the copula functions from table 2 gaussian t copula clayton frank and gumbel was carried out for each pair of cereal yield and drought indicator fig 5 a maps the type of selected copula according to the lowest value of aic appendix a indicates the respective dependence parameter estimates and fig 5 b illustrates the number of provinces adopting each type of copula and for each type of copula the number of provinces using each type of drought indicator in both cereals the clayton copula is the most selected copula type fig 5 14 provinces in case of wheat and 21 in the case of barley which indicates greater probabilities of joint extreme low values i e lower values of yield anomalies given lower values of drought indicators the opposite situation i e greater number of provinces showing larger probabilities of joint extreme high values of yield anomalies and drought hazard i e higher values of yield anomalies and higher values of the drought indicator is also verified corresponding to gumbel models however while there are more clayton copulas in the case of barley in comparison to wheat there are more gumbel models in the case of wheat rather than in barley 12 provinces gumbel copula in the case of wheat and 8 in the case of barley moreover in the case of wheat all the clayton models have drought conditions characterized by vci and spei and half of the wheat gumbel models uses tci in a similar way in the case of barley only one of the 21 clayton models uses tci hence 20 of the 21 clayton models uses vci or spei but most of the gumbel models uses spei the majority of clayton models uses vci and the number of provinces using tci is much lower see fig 4 a as expected the t copula is the less selected type 3 provinces in the case of wheat and 1 province in the case of barley given that aic penalizes the number of estimated parameters and t copulas require the estimation of two parameters table 2 regarding the copula functions without asymptotical tail dependence gaussian and frank there are more frank copula models in the case of wheat 10 provinces in the case of wheat and 7 in the case of barley and more gaussian copula models in the case of barley 7 provinces in the case of wheat and 9 in the case of barley after estimating the joint probability distributions using copula functions the subsequent generated simulations allowed to assess the conditional probability distributions of crop yield anomalies under different drought levels no drought mild or moderate drought and severe or extreme drought see table 3 in fig 6 the conditional probability of crop loss given different drought severity classes is shown based on the crop loss thresholds mapped in fig 2 complementarily fig 7 indicates the number of provinces showing each decile of conditional probability of crop loss and the respective type of copula in general the agricultural drought risk increases with drought severity in most of the provinces with particular emphasis on the provinces of salamanca and malaga in the case of the two cereals in comparison to the other provinces salamanca exhibits the greatest drought risk of wheat and barley during mild or moderate droughts fig 6 b and a slight increase during severe or extreme droughts fig 6 a in general in comparison to wheat during mild or moderate drought fig 6 b barley shows a larger number of provinces with more than 40 chance of non exceedance of the respective crop loss thresholds during severe or extreme droughts fig 6 a the agricultural drought risk increases in most of the provinces in comparison to mild or moderate droughts fig 6 b and barley endures a larger number of provinces with more than 70 chance of non exceedance of the respective crop loss thresholds in comparison to wheat during non drought conditions fig 6 c the agricultural drought risk is considerably lower in most of the provinces ranging from 0 to 30 chance of non exceedance of the wheat loss thresholds and ranging from 0 to 20 chance of non exceedance of the barley loss thresholds despite the general increase of the agricultural drought risk with drought severity minor exceptions are detailed next the provinces ribatejo oeste frank copula ourense frank copula alava gaussian copula and navarra gaussian copula show a decrease of wheat drought risk with drought severity decreasing progressively from no drought to mild or moderate drought and to severe or extreme drought figs 5 and 6 the provinces segovia t copula soria gaussian copula and alicante t copula also decrease wheat drought risk from the situation of non drought to mild or moderate drought while burgos t copula decreases wheat drought risk from the situation of mild or moderate drought to severe or extreme drought figs 5 and 6 regarding barley only lugo frank copula and ourense frank copula provinces decrease agricultural drought risk from non drought conditions to mild or moderate drought all the provinces modelled with gumbel or clayton copulas show an increase of the agricultural drought risk with drought severity while these exceptions are modelled by gaussian frank or t copulas fig 7 as expected fig 7 indicates that the number of provinces in lower deciles of agricultural drought risk is higher during non drought conditions followed by a higher number of provinces in intermediate deciles during mild or moderate droughts and the higher number of provinces in higher deciles is observed during severe or extreme droughts in addition the majority of the provinces with more than 70 chance of non exceedance of the respective crop loss thresholds during severe or extreme droughts is modelled by clayton copulas in both cereals fig 7 a yellow bars in a similar way the clayton provinces are also distributed in the greater deciles of agricultural drought risk during mild or moderate droughts of both cereals fig 7 b yellow bars during severe or extreme droughts and mild or moderate droughts the gumbel provinces are mainly associated to intermediate deciles of agricultural drought risk fig 7 a and b red bars the lower deciles of severe or extreme droughts and mild or moderate droughts are mainly associated to gaussian frank or t copulas fig 7 grey purple and blue bars 4 discussion and conclusions this work aimed to apply the copula approach for estimating the amount of dependence between crop yield anomalies wheat and barley and drought conditions in terms of the joint cumulative distribution function based on the estimated dependence structures the agricultural drought risk in the ip was defined as the conditional probability of non exceedance of crop loss thresholds under different drought levels no drought mild or moderate drought and severe or extreme drought the drought hazard was characterized in terms of the spei vci and tci combining the advantages of both hydrometeorological and remote sensing data for the assessment of drought conditions the results were illustrated at the province level of the ip and for each cereal and intended to address the following key questions 1 which are the critical drought indicators influencing crop yield variability 2 which are the most adequate copula functions to represent the dependence between crop yield anomalies and drought indicators 3 is there some type of copula most closely associated to the type of drought indicator 4 what is the conditional probability of joint extreme low values i e the likelihood of crop loss under different levels of drought severity 5 is there some type of copula most closely associated to higher values of agricultural drought risk 6 which are the provinces and cereals with higher agricultural drought risk according to the applied methodology the following paragraphs address the fundamental findings of the present study and answer the previously established questions in general the spei was found to be the drought indicator most adequate to the highest number of provinces in both cereals fig 4 a however in comparison to wheat barley presents a larger number of provinces characterized by spei and with larger explained variance fig 4 on the other hand the provinces with higher explained variance do not necessarily coincide with the selection of spei after the spei the vci is the second most selected type of drought indicator particularly regarding barley yield anomalies followed by tci fig 4 a as a matter of fact in the case of barley we can observe a west east gradient of suitability of vci in the western provinces towards spei in the eastern provinces fig 4 a this west east gradient is also slightly present in the case of wheat thus concluding that the rainfed cereal yield variability in western part of the ip is largely explained by vci while the rainfed cereals variability in eastern part of the ip is mostly explained by spei in a similar way the spatial patterns of humid semiarid climate regimes precipitation patterns and type of vegetation exhibit a northwestern southeastern gradient in the ip belo pereira et al 2011 gouveia et al 2017 soriano and pablo 2001 in other words the results suggest that the greenness of vegetation is a better proxy of yield anomalies in western rainfed cereals humid areas whereas water balance is a better proxy of yield anomalies in the eastern rainfed cereals semiarid areas in previous works using ndvi instead of vci which is ndvi derived the authors have also found a strong relationship between the wheat yield and vegetation activity in a western iberian region alentejo gouveia and trigo 2008 the influence of tci in the northern wheat and barley yields higher latitudes and elevations and in central parts of the ip in the case of wheat is also observed suggesting the importance of solar radiation for vegetation growth in these regions bento et al 2018 the most selected type of copula in both cereals was found to be clayton functions fig 5 suggesting stronger dependence between the extreme left values of drought conditions and yield anomalies in most of the provinces in addition most of the clayton models in the present work have drought conditions characterized by vci and spei indicating that the drought conditions characterized by these indicators greatly influence the occurrence of crop loss on the other hand the gumbel models greater probability of joint extreme high values in the case of wheat have most of drought conditions characterized by tci suggesting the influence of the increased solar radiation in the positive wheat anomalies in these provinces hence the results suggest that high values of tci promote positive yield anomalies of wheat over 6 of the gumbel provinces while low values of vci and spei promote negative yield anomalies of wheat over 14 clayton provinces and barley over 20 clayton provinces in general during severe or extreme drought and mild or moderate drought most of the provinces with greater deciles of probability of crop loss are associated to clayton copulas while the lower deciles are more linked to copula functions without asymptotical tail dependence gaussian and frank or without asymmetrical tail dependence t copulas moreover the provinces which do not increase agricultural drought risk with drought severity ribatejo oeste wheat ourense wheat and barley alava wheat navarra wheat segovia wheat burgos wheat and lugo barley are all modelled by copulas without tail dependence or t copulas thus suggesting that other factors rather than drought could be the reason of crop failure in these regions in a similar way páscoa et al 2017 have also found negative correlations between wheat yield and spei in provinces where there is an agreement between dry events and low yield anomalies in the present work most of the provinces which do not increase probability of crop loss with drought severity with the exception of burgos and lugo have drought conditions characterized by tci or spei suggesting that increased solar radiation and temperature could be favourable for cereal yield in these cases as expected most of the higher probabilities of agricultural drought risk during mild or moderate droughts and severe or extreme droughts are observed in provinces modelled by clayton copulas fig 7 which are closely associated to vci and spei suggesting that these indices are potential good indicators of drought related crop failure moreover to a greater severity of drought corresponds a higher agricultural drought risk in both cereals in most of the provinces however while barley exhibits 10 provinces with conditional probabilities of crop loss under severe or extreme drought higher than 90 wheat only exhibits 3 during mild or moderate droughts barley also exceeds wheat in the number of provinces with 40 50 chance of crop loss hence the results support that barley exhibits greater agricultural drought risk rather than wheat in agreement with the fact that barley is the cereal with more provinces with joint behaviour of yield anomalies and droughts described by clayton copulas similarly to the patterns found in the spatial distribution of precipitation fig 3 and type of drought indicator fig 4 one would expect a similar behaviour between neighbouring provinces in terms of selected copula models and subsequent conditional probabilities of drought related crop loss as a matter of fact in some cases even diametrically opposed dependence structures clayton and gumbel copulas are selected by neighbouring provinces this shortcoming may be associated to the distinct moments of the vegetative cycle selected to characterize droughts as shown in table 1 and to the province and crop specific threshold adopted in the present study to define crop loss events fig 2 moreover despite the spatial pattern in the mean rainfall in fig 3 a the variation coefficient in fig 3 b also do not present an evident spatial pattern with neighbouring provinces characterized by distinct precipitation variability the selection of different types of indicators and different moments of the vegetative cycle to characterize drought conditions the complex precipitation regime and the variable thresholds of crop loss between provinces and cereal specie reflects how distinct the crop specific crop loss attributable to drought conditions can be at the sub national scale previous studies performed by the authors assessing correlation patterns between spei and wheat yield anomalies at the province level of the ip páscoa et al 2017 have also found some inconsistencies associated to neighbouring provinces with opposite patterns nevertheless in the present study the galician provinces in the northwestern edge of the ip coruna lugo and orense stand out as provinces with low agricultural drought risk values in the case of both cereals in both severe or extreme and mild or moderate drought the present analysis might suggest that crop production in the ip could be focused on wheat given the lower levels of agricultural drought risk using the applied methodology however the present study does not consider an economic analysis regarding the cereal s prices the use of water resources irrigation during drought periods to avoid crop losses the use of machineries and fertilizers among other factors which influence the producers choice on crop quiroga et al 2011 have assessed crop yield risk to water pressures in spain and have found that irrigated crops do not show evidence of significant impact of drought on their yield although the irrigation area has an important effect in primarily rainfed crops such as wheat the impact decreases after a given amount of water quiroga et al 2011 therefore some losses are still expected under non drought conditions as shown in the present study fig 5 and 6 future research using the methodology applied in the present study could differentiate the yield of wheat and barley under rainfed or irrigated conditions to address if the risk of crop loss under drought conditions is reduced in the irrigated areas and if the costs involved in irrigation practices are compensatory the current study considers the total area and total production given that the amount of wheat and barley in rainfed area is much higher than in irrigated area in most of the provinces while some provinces do not use irrigation at all the application of this study using drought information under climate change scenarios and using seasonal drought forecasts are potential goals for future work moreover heatwaves have also been responsible for cereals wheat loss due to heat stress zampieri et al 2017 and it would be important to address its influence on the likelihood of crop loss using the presented methodology in summary our results point to the fact that wheat and barley are crops vulnerable to drought conditions whereas barley is suggested to exhibit greater probabilities of joint extreme low values between yield and drought indicators in most provinces in such cases drought hazard is manly characterized by vci and spei while tci is mainly used in copula models indicating greater probabilities of joint extreme high values of wheat and drought indicators in addition salamanca stands out as the province with the greatest agricultural drought risk level during mild or moderate and severe or extreme drought from an operational point of view the results aim to contribute to the decision making process in agricultural practices acknowledgements this work was partially

university diyarbakır in the southeast anatolia region of turkey fig 1 the climate is continental and the precipitation in the study area is 480 mm year it has a growing season of approximately 180 days for cotton production however the rainfall during the cotton growing period is very low the rainfall during cotton growing cycle was 44 8 and 19 4 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively the annual average maximum and minimum temperatures for the study area are 15 8 42 3 and 9 1 respectively some climatic data such as rainfall maximum and average temperatures are given during growing season for cotton in fig 2 climatological data used for estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc using the fao 56 penman monteith pm method were collected by an automatic climatological station near the experimental site çetin et al 2018 the soil type is clay clay content is 65 in texture with a ph of 7 7 1 7 organic matter and electrical conductivity ec 0 48 ds m 1 the soil contains high potassium

approaches table 2 and fig 3 the amount of irrigation water applied was determined according to etc based on fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 thus reference evapotranspiration et0 was computed daily according to the pm equation from the required meteorological data then the amount of irrigation water applied was calculated using the kc approach for cotton the irrigation interval was 5 days the

stage for cotton respectively the canopy cover pc of 35 keller and bliesner 1990 was used until the value exceeded 35 emergency and the actual measured values were considered for each treatment and all irrigation cycles when the pc exceeded 35 çetin and bilgel 2002 plant canopy cover was calculated by measuring with a scaled wooden frame 70 100 cm before each irrigation cycle 5 days pc was thus computed by measuring the average plant width in a row and dividing that value by the plant row space hartz 1993 çetin et al 2018 pc was lower than 35 during the initial stage 0 30 days after sowing das of kc and it ranged from 20 to 80 at development stage das 31 80 days pc quickly reached to 100 in about 2 weeks after development stage however pc pertaining to each treatment was different and it was less in the treatments where a lower amount of irrigation water applied the plot area was 33 60 m2 4 20 m x 8 00 m the lateral pipe spacing was 1 40 m thus one lateral had two irrigated cotton rows plant row spacing and plant spacing were 0 70 and 0 20 m respectively fig 3 the sowing date was on may 11 and 9 2016 and 2017 respectively and the harvest date was at the beginning of october for all experimental years 2 3 calculation of water productivity wp and economic water productivity ewp wp is defined as the ratio between crop yield obtained ya and water use expressed kg m 3 wp could be computed according to the consumptive water use or actual crop evapotranspiration eta or just to the irrigation water use iwu pereira et al 2012 thus wpirrig was computed as the ratio of total seed cotton yield to amount of irrigation water eq 3 and consumptive water use eq 4 it was used here as eta on a seasonal basis wep was defined as the value derived per unit of water used thus eqs 3 6 given below were used to calculate irrigation wpirrig wp ewp and lep sinclair et al 1984 kijne et al 2003 sharma et al 2015 pereira et al 2012 the yields and amount of irrigation water applied and consumptive water use were used to compute and analyze wpirrig and wp or in other words water productivity ewp and lep pereria et al 2012 net returns per volumetric water ewp and net return per land area lep were based on current prices and cost of production all current prices and costs were collected from free market conditions all subsidies received for crops were not included in the net return çetin and üzen 2016 all the equations used for calculation of wpirrig wp ewp and lep are given as following pereria et al 2012 3 w p i r r i g y a i w 4 w p y a e t a 5 e w p n r i w 6 l e p n

capillary rise mm r runoff mm d deep percolation δs change in root zone soil moisture mm runoff was omitted because it did not occur and the borders of the plots were under the control by means of small soil bank capillary rise was considered as negligible because the ground water table is very deep and there was no perched water table up to 3 m deep percolation under the root zone 90 cm was checked by means of both tensiometers and frequency domain reflectometry fdr moreover soil moisture content was checked by gravimetric method time to time according to the measurements any deep percolation was not determined in 2016 however there was mainly over irrigation in some irrigation cycles for the treatment of 1 25 etc using fao 56 pm in 2017 thus some amounts of deep percolation were determined considering the treatments in 2017 deep percolation were i1k1 129 mm i1k2 43 mm i1k3 0 i2k1 116 mm i2k2 46 mm i2k3 15 mm i3k1 138 mm i3k2 48 mm and i3k3 7 6 mm for the experimental year of 2017 the main reason of no occurred percolation in 2016 could be attributed that the amount of irrigation water applied in 2016 was about 12 less than those in 2017 for the irrigation season in this context the amount of irrigation water applied for some irrigation cycles in 2017 were considerably higher compared to those in 2016 the reason of different amount of irrigation water applied might be also clarified with different climatic condition in the experimental years in this study the calculations of ewp were performed according to the irrigation water use because the amount of irrigation water used by farmer is taken into consideration for water considering ewp evaluation net revenue was calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue different establishment costs occurred for the sdi and ssdi irrigation systems and only the water amounts differed by the treatments because there were differences on total water and system design cost for that reason net revenue differences among the treatments were calculated through partial budgeting technique olson 2011 partial budgeting is based on the principle that small differences in net revenue calculation will cause increases and or decreases in revenues and costs in partial budgeting only variable factors are taken into account and fixed unchanged factors are not considered in our case revenue and cost increases and or decreases were due to crop revenue and costs irrigation water and irrigation system assets depreciation costs increases and or decreases respectively the net effects of the variations in net revenues for the treatments were obtained through subtracting the negative financial change equivalents from positive financial change in calculation of the depreciation the most commonly used method for financial reporting purposes the straight line depreciation method was used which allocates an equal portion of depreciation expense to each period of the asset s useful life williams et al 2010 considering all of the production costs and inputs for cotton production were same except cost of water the water labor and system design the total water cost was calculated differently in each treatment because there were different amounts of irrigation water applied and thus water labor cost was different depending on the experimental treatment furthermore irrigation system investment cost was also different for sdi and ssdi at depths of 30 and 40 cm the system design was planned for 10 ha because the average cotton farm field was about 10 ha in the study area and all drip irrigation investment costs were calculated for this unit area all production costs and inputs were determined based on free market conditions and some official registered reports according to the free market conditions irrigation labor cost and irrigation water charge except the cost of deep wells range from us 0 013 m 3 to us 0 071 m 3 respectively irrigation total labor cost irrigation total water charge and drip irrigation system cost were different for each treatment cotton production cost was us 1706 ha 1 including costs of plowing of land seeds fertilizers pesticides hoeing harvesting and so on for cotton growth in the study area the cost of the drip irrigation system for sdi ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 30 cm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm and one lateral design for each two rows was us 3083 ha 1 with a life period of 8 years us 3193 ha 1 and us 3547 ha 1 with a life period of 15 years respectively enciso et al 2005 lamm and rogers 2017 thus the cost of drip irrigation systems per 10 ha was calculated to be relatively higher than those widely used in the study area due to use of compensating emitters these cost figures are for high quality systems and include mainlines filters manifolds emitters and pumps çetin and uygan 2008 in addition drip irrigation system costs can vary greatly depending on crop plant and therefore emitter and hose spacing and type of hose employed solomon 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 water productivity wp in this study water productivity based on irrigation water use and total water use wp and wpirrig given and defined above were evaluated the values of wpirrig and wp obtained according to the experimental years are given in table 3 considering the data in the experimental years the effects of the treatments on wpirrig were more or less similar the main reason is that could be climatic conditions response of cotton yield was highly dependent on amount of irrigation water applied because of low rainfall during the growing season fig 2 however the values of wp in 2017 were considerably higher than those in 2016 the main reasons could be attributed to higher seed cotton yield lower crop consumptive water use and more deep percolation in 2017 there were statistically significant p 0 01 effects of different amount of irrigation levels in cotton yield in 2016 different drip irrigation systems p 0 05 and different amount of irrigation water p 0 01 resulted in significant differences in cotton yield in 2017 there was no significant effect on the interaction between drip irrigation systems and the amount of irrigation water applied as it occurred in 2016 table 4 for economic evaluation average results of 2 years were considered thus the wp obtained from the experimental treatments ranged from 0 72 to 0 95 kg m 3 table 5 the maximum wp of 0 95 kg m 3 was obtained from the treatment of crop water requirement etc of 0 75 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi the values of wpirrig were also calculated from 0 68 to 1 01 kg m 3 depending on the treatments table 5 the maximum wp and wpirrig of 0 95 and 1 01 kg m 3 respectively were obtained from the treatment in which the irrigation application involved etc of 0 75 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi it means that lower amounts of irrigation water applied for all drip irrigation systems provided higher wp and wpirrig wp and wpirrig evenly changed depending on the irrigation treatments because the amount of rainfall during the growing season were very low fig 2 considering the effects of different drip irrigation systems and amount of irrigation water applied separately on wp and wpirrig the maximum values of water productivity occurred in the subsurface irrigation system at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm fig 4 furthermore wp and wpirrig in general decreased as long as the amount of water applied increased table 5 fig 5 pereira et al 2012 and howell 2006 stated that wp or wue generally tends to increase with a decline in irrigation thus the results obtained from this experiment are comprehensible in any case wp and wpirrig were lower under the sdi and these were maximum under ssdi 40 cm fig 5 in some studies increased water productivity ranged from 0 43 kg m 3 to 0 61 kg m 3 however surface irrigation provides higher farm returns compared to drip irrigation thus it has been reported that drip irrigation is selected only when high priority is assigned to reducing water use on farms darouich et al 2014 contrary to these results use of sdi or ssdi on cotton in our study area resulted in much higher wp and wpirrig compared to surface furrow irrigation çetin and bilgel 2002 yazar et al 2002 the most important reason for this could be attributed to the study area receiving insignificant and or almost no rainfall and or temperatures being very high up to 45 c with very low relative humidity 10 15 during the growing season for cotton fig 2 rainfall was only 44 8 and 19 4 mm during the whole irrigation season in 2016 and 2017 respectively this means that yield response to irrigation water is very high due to climatic conditions wang et al 2019 thus the higher yield results in higher wpirrig and wp both wp and wpirrig might increase by means of increasing irrigation water in arid regions because the response to water in these regions is much greater compared to humid regions however use of irrigation water for irrigated agriculture might be minimized reduced by improving crop water use according to the results of this study irrigation scheduling can improve wp along with efficient irrigation scheduling management howell et al 2002 on the other hand wp is an indicator of the productivity of total yield of water used by the crops pereira et al 2012 wp is thus a considerably important issue when taking into account irrigation systems and irrigation water management and probably will become more important as access to water becomes more limited shdeed 2001 water productivity can be enhanced by increasing yield per unit of land area the main purpose in the irrigated agriculture should be more production per amount of irrigation water used çetin and uygan 2008 yields in some cases wp is not a logical approach and or consideration for farmers if there is enough irrigation water on the contrary farmers try to maximize the income returns per unit of land for which crop yield enhancement is the best route kumar et al 2008 in the study area cotton production is almost dependent on irrigation thus most farmers apply water considering economic productivity that is net income per unit area even if wp decreases as long as the necessary amount of irrigation water is applied fig 6 fig 6 shows the relationships between amount of irrigation water applied and both yield and wpirrig thus it is possible to estimate the level of non beneficial applied water kumar et al 2008 fig 6 shows also that ssdi resulted in reducing water use and more water productivity however relationship between wpirrig and crop yield in some cases could not clarify for threshold of non beneficial of applied water thus the further analysis such as ewp and led should be performed and considered 3 2 economic water productivity ewp and land economic productivity lep according to the evaluation of economic analysis the maximum lep obtained was us 1272 0 ha 1 for the treatment in which the irrigation application 640 1 mm had etc of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a soil depth of 30 cm table 5 the second rank of lep us 1226 4 ha 1 that was closest to this treatment was obtained from the treatment in which the irrigation application 673 7 mm had etc of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm the lep us 1109 9 ha 1 in the third rank was in the treatment in which the irrigation application 551 3 mm had etc of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm table 5 although the ssdi at the lateral pipe depth of 30 cm resulted in the maximum lep some agricultural practices such as plowing were difficult because some damages occurred to pipes in the soil during the plowing this problem is very important under the farming conditions similar problems occurred in another study carried out by şen et al 2013 because they used a lateral pipe depth of 30 cm for ssdi for cotton irrigation so they recommended a lateral depth of 40 cm for ssdi shruti and aladakatti 2017 reported that planting of a bt cotton hybrid in paired rows using drip irrigation at 0 8 etc was optimal for realizing higher seed cotton yield and net returns with increased water productivity on the other hand o brien et al 1998 stated that use of center pivot irrigation is more advantageous compared to ssdi because the investment cost of ssdi is more than that of center pivot irrigation kuşcu et al 2017 compared both water productivity and economic water productivity use efficiency for drip irrigated melons the results showed that full irrigation 100 evapotranspiration is recommended under non water limiting environments for higher yield and net income however the highest land economic productivity to water ratio and wp resulted from 75 full irrigation even though the lep is more important in terms of the farmers wp and ewp are also important in terms of irrigation schemes the maximum ewp based on volumetric unit of water us 0 20 m 3 occurred under the treatment in which both the irrigation applications had cwr of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a soil depth 30 cm and the treatment involving cwr of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and sdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm table 5 on the other hand fig 7 shows the variation of ewp and lep according to the amount of irrigation water applied for each drip irrigation system sdi resulted in lower ewp and lep in all irrigation levels compared to those of ssdi thus fig 7 explains also that ssdi 40 cm resulted in maximum values of ewp and lep considering the effects of only different drip irrigation system on ewp and lep in this study the maximum ewp us 0 19 m 3 and lep us 1005 ha 1 were provided from the ssdi 40 cm while the lowest ewp us 0 05 m 3 and lep us 386 ha 1 occurred under the sdi fig 8 ssdi 30 resulted in moderate values for ewp and lep these results also explain why the treatment of ssdi 40 cm is more appropriate and recommendable for farmers on the other hand it is important to consider the full cost of supplying energy to the farms while evaluating the economics of irrigation using a pressurized system such as drip irrigation thus the economic value of water should be considered then any water saved as a result of drip irrigation use could be treated as an economic gain kumar 2016 as a result ssdi at a soil depth of 40 cm using amount of irrigation water applied based on 1 00xetc was found to be recommendable in terms of both wp ewp and lep whereas ssdi at a soil depth of 30 cm created some problems during the soil plowing although different irrigation methods systems could be used for a crop irrigation reducing water use and maximization of water benefits might be different thus both wp ewp and lep using amount of irrigation water applied and the yield obtained by different irrigation scheduling should be considered çetin and uygan 2008 thus the cost of ssdi depends on crop number of drippers lateral spacing devices at the control unit pumps filtration systems and fertigation equipment water resource and quality and so on breazeale et al 2000 4 conclusion according to this study results the maximum wpirrig 0 84 kg m 3 and wp 0 84 kg m 3 occurred in the ssdi system at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm furthermore wp and wpirrig in general decreased as long as the amount of water applied increased however these results could be different because crop used some soil water under day treatments could change soil water content the lep us 1109 9 ha 1 in which the irrigation application 551 3 mm had etc of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm was found to be the most suitable in terms of farmer practices the maximum ewp in terms of volumetric unit of water us 0 20 m 3 occurred under the treatment in which both the irrigation applications had etc of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth 30 cm and the treatment with etc of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm as a result ssdi 40 cm resulted in saving water and greater water productivity using amount of irrigation water based on 1 0xetc although the maximum wp and wpirrig have been obtained under lower amounts of irrigation water applied in many cases these conditions did not provide higher ewp and lep in other words economical net return in this study moreover farmers may lose money even if the wp and wpirrig are maximum for this reason wpirrig ewp and lep must be evaluated together and considered for farmers and irrigation schemes ssdi is not conducive to cotton germination and use of ssdi is limited by this factor if there is no sufficient moisture during sowing time in the soil profile for this reason another irrigation system such as sprinkler should be used to provide cotton germination however this factor is in general not common in the study area because of climatic conditions in addition salts could be accumulated in the soil because ssdi results in no leaching above the depth of the drip line however total precipitation in the study area was about 480 mm for the whole year and this amount is adequate for leaching otherwise a supplemental leaching using different irrigation systems such as sprinklers or flood irrigation is required the better reliability and adequacy of irrigation can improve the yield and water productivity of irrigated crops through better agronomic practices and better water management all farmers irrigators and water user associations should take into account wp ewp and led according to the different irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling to decide for deficit irrigation or increasing production by means of irrigation acknowledgements

cotton in fig 2 climatological data used for estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc using the fao 56 penman monteith pm method were collected by an automatic climatological station near the experimental site çetin et al 2018 the soil type is clay clay content is 65 in texture with a ph of 7 7 1 7 organic matter and electrical conductivity ec 0 48 ds m 1 the soil contains high potassium and lime however the soil has lower amounts of organic matter and phosphorus than the sufficient levels there are no salinity alkalinity and water table problems 3 0 m table 1 the experiments were performed for two growing seasons of cotton in 2016 and 2017 2 2 experimental treatments and design in this study split plots in randomized blocks with three replications were designed and applied to the experiment yurtsever 2011 the main plots involved different drip irrigation systems sdi and ssdi systems and the subplots involved different amounts of water based on the fao 56 pm and kc approaches table 2 and fig 3 the amount of irrigation water applied was determined according to etc based on fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 thus reference evapotranspiration et0 was computed daily according to the pm equation from the required meteorological data then the amount of irrigation water applied was calculated using the kc approach for cotton the irrigation interval was 5 days the irrigation continued up to 10 of boll opening bilgel 1994 eqs 1 and 2 given below were used to calculate the amount of irrigation water applied allen et al 1998 1 e t c k c e t 0 2 i a e t c k p c where etc is crop evapotranspiration estimated by fao 56 pm for 5 days mm kc is crop coefficient dimensionless and et0 is reference crop evapotranspiration according to penman monteith for 5 days mm d 1 i is the amount of irrigation water applied to the experimental plot m3 a is the plot area m2 k refers to different rates of etc and pc is canopy cover kc was derived using the equations given in fao 56 and climatic and crop data pertaining to the study area allen et al 1998 thus kc were 0 33 0 33 1 27 1 27 and 1 27 0 68 for the initial stage development stage boll development and maturity stage for cotton respectively the canopy cover pc of 35 keller and bliesner 1990 was used until the value exceeded 35 emergency and the actual measured values were considered for each treatment and all irrigation cycles when the pc exceeded 35 çetin and bilgel 2002 plant canopy cover was calculated by measuring with a scaled wooden frame 70 100 cm before each irrigation cycle 5 days pc was thus computed by measuring the average plant width in a row and dividing that value by the plant row space hartz 1993 çetin et al 2018 pc was lower than 35 during the initial stage 0 30 days after sowing das of kc and it ranged from 20 to 80 at development stage das 31 80 days pc quickly reached to 100 in about 2 weeks after development stage however pc pertaining to each treatment was different and it was less in the treatments where a lower amount of irrigation water applied the plot area was 33 60 m2 4 20 m x 8 00 m the lateral pipe spacing was 1 40 m thus one lateral had two irrigated cotton rows plant row spacing and plant spacing were 0 70 and 0 20 m respectively fig 3 the sowing date was on may 11 and 9 2016 and 2017 respectively and the harvest date was at the beginning of october for all experimental years 2 3 calculation of water productivity wp and economic water productivity ewp wp is defined as the ratio between crop yield obtained ya and water use expressed kg m 3 wp could be computed according to the consumptive water use or actual crop evapotranspiration eta or just to the irrigation water use iwu pereira et al 2012 thus wpirrig was computed as the ratio of total seed cotton yield to amount of irrigation water eq 3 and consumptive water use eq 4 it was used here as eta on a seasonal basis wep was defined as the value derived per unit of water used thus eqs 3 6 given below were used to calculate irrigation wpirrig wp ewp and lep sinclair et al 1984 kijne et al 2003 sharma et al 2015 pereira et al 2012 the yields and amount of irrigation water applied and consumptive water use were used to compute and analyze wpirrig and wp or in other words water productivity ewp and lep pereria et al 2012 net returns per volumetric water ewp and net return per land area lep were based on current prices and cost of production all current prices and costs were collected from free market conditions all subsidies received for crops were not included in the net return çetin and üzen 2016 all the equations used for calculation of wpirrig wp ewp and lep are given as following pereria et al 2012 3 w p i r r i g y a i w 4 w p y a e t a 5 e w p n r i w 6 l e p n

capillary rise mm r runoff mm d deep percolation δs change in root zone soil moisture mm runoff was omitted because it did not occur and the borders of the plots were under the control by means of small soil bank capillary rise was considered as negligible because the ground water table is very deep and there was no perched water table up to 3 m deep percolation under the root zone 90 cm was checked by means of both tensiometers and frequency domain reflectometry fdr moreover soil moisture content was checked by gravimetric method time to time according to the measurements any deep percolation was not determined in 2016 however there was mainly over irrigation in some irrigation cycles for the treatment of 1 25 etc using fao 56 pm in 2017 thus some amounts of deep percolation were determined considering the treatments in 2017 deep percolation were i1k1 129 mm i1k2 43 mm i1k3 0 i2k1 116 mm i2k2 46 mm i2k3 15 mm i3k1 138 mm i3k2 48 mm and i3k3 7 6 mm for the experimental year of 2017 the main reason of no occurred percolation in 2016 could be attributed that the amount of irrigation water applied in 2016 was about 12 less than those in 2017 for the irrigation season in this context the amount of irrigation water applied for some irrigation cycles in 2017 were considerably higher compared to those in 2016 the reason of different amount of irrigation water applied might be also clarified with different climatic condition in the experimental years in this study the calculations of ewp were performed according to the irrigation water use because the amount of irrigation water used by farmer is taken into consideration for water considering ewp evaluation net revenue was calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue different establishment costs occurred for the sdi and ssdi irrigation systems and only the water amounts differed by the treatments because there were differences on total water and system design cost for that reason net revenue differences among the treatments were calculated through partial budgeting technique olson 2011 partial budgeting is based on the principle that small differences in net revenue calculation will cause increases and or decreases in revenues and costs in partial budgeting only variable factors are taken into account and fixed unchanged factors are not considered in our case revenue and cost increases and or decreases were due to crop revenue and costs irrigation water and irrigation system assets depreciation costs increases and or decreases respectively the net effects of the variations in net revenues for the treatments were obtained through subtracting the negative financial change equivalents from positive financial change in calculation of the depreciation the most commonly used method for financial reporting purposes the straight line depreciation method was used which allocates an equal portion of depreciation expense to each period of the asset s useful life williams et al 2010 considering all of the production costs and inputs for cotton production were same except cost of water the water labor and system design the total water cost was calculated differently in each treatment because there were different amounts of irrigation water applied and thus water labor cost was different depending on the experimental treatment furthermore irrigation system investment cost was also different for sdi and ssdi at depths of 30 and 40 cm the system design was planned for 10 ha because the average cotton farm field was about 10 ha in the study area and all drip irrigation investment costs were calculated for this unit area all production costs and inputs were determined based on free market conditions and some official registered reports according to the free market conditions irrigation labor cost and irrigation water charge except the cost of deep wells range from us 0 013 m 3 to us 0 071 m 3 respectively irrigation total labor cost irrigation total water charge and drip irrigation system cost were different for each treatment cotton production cost was us 1706 ha 1 including costs of plowing of land seeds fertilizers pesticides hoeing harvesting and so on for cotton growth in the study area the cost of the drip irrigation system for sdi ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 30 cm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm and one lateral design for each two rows was us 3083 ha 1 with a life period of 8 years us 3193 ha 1 and us 3547 ha 1 with a life period of 15 years respectively enciso et al 2005 lamm and rogers 2017 thus the cost of drip irrigation systems per 10 ha was calculated to be relatively higher than those widely used in the study area due to use of compensating emitters these cost figures are for high quality systems and include mainlines filters manifolds emitters and pumps çetin and uygan 2008 in addition drip irrigation system costs can vary greatly depending on crop plant and therefore emitter and hose spacing and type of hose employed solomon 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 water productivity wp in this study water productivity based on irrigation water use and total water use wp and wpirrig given and defined above were evaluated the values of wpirrig and wp obtained according to the experimental years are given in table 3 considering the data in the experimental years the effects of the treatments on wpirrig were more or less similar the main reason is that could be climatic conditions response of cotton yield was highly dependent on amount of irrigation water applied because of low rainfall during the growing season fig 2 however the values of wp in 2017 were considerably higher than those in 2016 the main reasons could be attributed to higher seed cotton yield lower crop consumptive water use and more deep percolation in 2017 there were statistically significant p 0 01 effects of different amount of irrigation levels in cotton yield in 2016 different drip irrigation systems p 0 05 and different amount of irrigation water p 0 01 resulted in significant differences in cotton yield in 2017 there was no significant effect on the interaction between drip irrigation systems and the amount of irrigation water applied as it occurred in 2016 table 4 for economic evaluation average results of 2 years were considered thus the wp obtained from the experimental treatments ranged from 0 72 to 0 95 kg m 3 table 5 the maximum wp of 0 95 kg m 3 was obtained from the treatment of crop water requirement etc of 0 75 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi the values of wpirrig were also calculated from 0 68 to 1 01 kg m 3 depending on the treatments table 5 the maximum wp and wpirrig of 0 95 and 1 01 kg m 3 respectively were obtained from the treatment in which the irrigation application involved etc of 0 75 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi it means that lower amounts of irrigation water applied for all drip irrigation systems provided higher wp and wpirrig wp and wpirrig evenly changed depending on the irrigation treatments because the amount of rainfall during the growing season were very low fig 2 considering the effects of different drip irrigation systems and amount of irrigation water applied separately on wp and wpirrig the maximum values of water productivity occurred in the subsurface irrigation system at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm fig 4 furthermore wp and wpirrig in general decreased as long as the amount of water applied increased table 5 fig 5 pereira et al 2012 and howell 2006 stated that wp or wue generally tends to increase with a decline in irrigation thus the results obtained from this experiment are comprehensible in any case wp and wpirrig were lower under the sdi and these were maximum under ssdi 40 cm fig 5 in some studies increased water productivity ranged from 0 43 kg m 3 to 0 61 kg m 3 however surface irrigation provides higher farm returns compared to drip irrigation thus it has been reported that drip irrigation is selected only when high priority is assigned to reducing water use on farms darouich et al 2014 contrary to these results use of sdi or ssdi on cotton in our study area resulted in much higher wp and wpirrig compared to surface furrow irrigation çetin and bilgel 2002 yazar et al 2002 the most important reason for this could be attributed to the study area receiving insignificant and or almost no rainfall and or temperatures being very high up to 45 c with very low relative humidity 10 15 during the growing season for cotton fig 2 rainfall was only 44 8 and 19 4 mm during the whole irrigation season in 2016 and 2017 respectively this means that yield response to irrigation water is very high due to climatic conditions wang et al 2019 thus the higher yield results in higher wpirrig and wp both wp and wpirrig might increase by means of increasing irrigation water in arid regions because the response to water in these regions is much greater compared to humid regions however use of irrigation water for irrigated agriculture might be minimized reduced by improving crop water use according to the results of this study irrigation scheduling can improve wp along with efficient irrigation scheduling management howell et al 2002 on the other hand wp is an indicator of the productivity of total yield of water used by the crops pereira et al 2012 wp is thus a considerably important issue when taking into account irrigation systems and irrigation water management and probably will become more important as access to water becomes more limited shdeed 2001 water productivity can be enhanced by increasing yield per unit of land area the main purpose in the irrigated agriculture should be more production per amount of irrigation water used çetin and uygan 2008 yields in some cases wp is not a logical approach and or consideration for farmers if there is enough irrigation water on the contrary farmers try to maximize the income returns per unit of land for which crop yield enhancement is the best route kumar et al 2008 in the study area cotton production is almost dependent on irrigation thus most farmers apply water considering economic productivity that is net income per unit area even if wp decreases as long as the necessary amount of irrigation water is applied fig 6 fig 6 shows the relationships between amount of irrigation water applied and both yield and wpirrig thus it is possible to estimate the level of non beneficial applied water kumar et al 2008 fig 6 shows also that ssdi resulted in reducing water use and more water productivity however relationship between wpirrig and crop yield in some cases could not clarify for threshold of non beneficial of applied water thus the further analysis such as ewp and led should be performed and considered 3 2 economic water productivity ewp and land economic productivity lep according to the evaluation of economic analysis the maximum lep obtained was us 1272 0 ha 1 for the treatment in which the irrigation application 640 1 mm had etc of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a soil depth of 30 cm table 5 the second rank of lep us 1226 4 ha 1 that was closest to this treatment was obtained from the treatment in which the irrigation application 673 7 mm had etc of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm the lep us 1109 9 ha 1 in the third rank was in the treatment in which the irrigation application 551 3 mm had etc of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm table 5 although the ssdi at the lateral pipe depth of 30 cm resulted in the maximum lep some agricultural practices such as plowing were difficult because some damages occurred to pipes in the soil during the plowing this problem is very important under the farming conditions similar problems occurred in another study carried out by şen et al 2013 because they used a lateral pipe depth of 30 cm for ssdi for cotton irrigation so they recommended a lateral depth of 40 cm for ssdi shruti and aladakatti 2017 reported that planting of a bt cotton hybrid in paired rows using drip irrigation at 0 8 etc was optimal for realizing higher seed cotton yield and net returns with increased water productivity on the other hand o brien et al 1998 stated that use of center pivot irrigation is more advantageous compared to ssdi because the investment cost of ssdi is more than that of center pivot irrigation kuşcu et al 2017 compared both water productivity and economic water productivity use efficiency for drip irrigated melons the results showed that full irrigation 100 evapotranspiration is recommended under non water limiting environments for higher yield and net income however the highest land economic productivity to water ratio and wp resulted from 75 full irrigation even though the lep is more important in terms of the farmers wp and ewp are also important in terms of irrigation schemes the maximum ewp based on volumetric unit of water us 0 20 m 3 occurred under the treatment in which both the irrigation applications had cwr of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a soil depth 30 cm and the treatment involving cwr of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and sdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm table 5 on the other hand fig 7 shows the variation of ewp and lep according to the amount of irrigation water applied for each drip irrigation system sdi resulted in lower ewp and lep in all irrigation levels compared to those of ssdi thus fig 7 explains also that ssdi 40 cm resulted in maximum values of ewp and lep considering the effects of only different drip irrigation system on ewp and lep in this study the maximum ewp us 0 19 m 3 and lep us 1005 ha 1 were provided from the ssdi 40 cm while the lowest ewp us 0 05 m 3 and lep us 386 ha 1 occurred under the sdi fig 8 ssdi 30 resulted in moderate values for ewp and lep these results also explain why the treatment of ssdi 40 cm is more appropriate and recommendable for farmers on the other hand it is important to consider the full cost of supplying energy to the farms while evaluating the economics of irrigation using a pressurized system such as drip irrigation thus the economic value of water should be considered then any water saved as a result of drip irrigation use could be treated as an economic gain kumar 2016 as a result ssdi at a soil depth of 40 cm using amount of irrigation water applied based on 1 00xetc was found to be recommendable in terms of both wp ewp and lep whereas ssdi at a soil depth of 30 cm created some problems during the soil plowing although different irrigation methods systems could be used for a crop irrigation reducing water use and maximization of water benefits might be different thus both wp ewp and lep using amount of irrigation water applied and the yield obtained by different irrigation scheduling should be considered çetin and uygan 2008 thus the cost of ssdi depends on crop number of drippers lateral spacing devices at the control unit pumps filtration systems and fertigation equipment water resource and quality and so on breazeale et al 2000 4 conclusion according to this study results the maximum wpirrig 0 84 kg m 3 and wp 0 84 kg m 3 occurred in the ssdi system at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm furthermore wp and wpirrig in general decreased as long as the amount of water applied increased however these results could be different because crop used some soil water under day treatments could change soil water content the lep us 1109 9 ha 1 in which the irrigation application 551 3 mm had etc of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm was found to be the most suitable in terms of farmer practices the maximum ewp in terms of volumetric unit of water us 0 20 m 3 occurred under the treatment in which both the irrigation applications had etc of 1 25 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth 30 cm and the treatment with etc of 1 00 times using fao 56 pm and ssdi at a lateral pipe depth of 40 cm as a result ssdi 40 cm resulted in saving water and greater water productivity using amount of irrigation water based on 1 0xetc although the maximum wp and wpirrig have been obtained under lower amounts of irrigation water applied in many cases these conditions did not provide higher ewp and lep in other words economical net return in this study moreover farmers may lose money even if the wp and wpirrig are maximum for this reason wpirrig ewp and lep must be evaluated together and considered for farmers and irrigation schemes ssdi is not conducive to cotton germination and use of ssdi is limited by this factor if there is no sufficient moisture during sowing time in the soil profile for this reason another irrigation system such as sprinkler should be used to provide cotton germination however this factor is in general not common in the study area because of climatic conditions in addition salts could be accumulated in the soil because ssdi results in no leaching above the depth of the drip line however total precipitation in the study area was about 480 mm for the whole year and this amount is adequate for leaching otherwise a supplemental leaching using different irrigation systems such as sprinklers or flood irrigation is required the better reliability and adequacy of irrigation can improve the yield and water productivity of irrigated crops through better agronomic practices and better water management all farmers irrigators and water user associations should take into account wp ewp and led according to the different irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling to decide for deficit irrigation or increasing production by means of irrigation acknowledgements

10907,produced water pw is the largest by product of the oil and gas industry its management is both economically and environmentally costly pw reuse for irrigation offers an alternative to current disposal practices while providing water to irrigators in drylands the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the environmental effects of irrigation with pw the saltirsoil m model was used to simulate the irrigation of sugar beet with 15 pws of a wide range of qualities in four climates of different aridity and on four contrasting soil types the impacts on soil salinity sodicity and ph as well as on crop yield and drainage water salinity were estimated well drained soils with low water content at field capacity arenosol are less sensitive to salinisation while a relatively high gypsum content gypsisol makes the soil less vulnerable to both sodification and salinisation on the contrary clayey soils with higher water content at field capacity and lower gypsum content must be avoided as the soil structural stability as well as a tolerable soil electrical conductivity for the crop cannot be maintained on the long term soil ph was not found to be sensitive to pw quality drainage water quality was found to be closely linked to pw quality although it is also influenced by the soil type the impact of drainage water on the aquifer must be considered and reuse or disposal implemented accordingly for achieving sustainable irrigation finally increasing aridity intensifies soil and drainage water salinity and sodicity this investigation highlights the importance of adapting the existing irrigation water quality guidelines through the use of models to include relevant parameters related to soil type and aridity indeed it will support the petroleum industry and irrigators to estimate the risks due to watering crops with pw and will encourage its sustainable reuse in water scarce areas keywords arid climate irrigation water quality modelling salinity saltirsoil sodicity 1 introduction oil and gas o g extraction generates considerable volumes of produced water pw which is the main by product of the o g industry veil 2011 pw mostly originates from water which is naturally present with the hydrocarbons in the reservoir but can also include water that is artificially added to the reservoir and flows back to the surface during enhanced oil recovery and hydraulic fracturing engle et al 2014 about half of the global pw volume is injected into disposal wells or discharged on the surface after treatment without being beneficially reused echchelh et al 2018 these disposal practices have limits deep injection is energy intensive and thus is expensive and is responsible for high co2 emissions arthur et al 2011 furthermore it is environmentally hazardous as it can pollute the groundwater hagström et al 2016 and induce seismic activity walsh and zoback 2015 surface discharge can also contaminate soils konkel 2016 and receiving

entirely e g zero liquid discharge igunnu and chen 2014 the increasingly stringent regulation increases pw management cost for o g firms stanic 2014 as global pw volume is expected to rise drastically dal ferro and smith 2007 there is a need for sustainable alternatives to current pw management practices pw reuse for irrigation could potentially provide a considerable amount of water to farmlands situated in o g basins echchelh et al 2018 this option is of the utmost interest in drylands which host a significant part of the world s hydrocarbon production and reserves eia 2018 and where water scarcity is likely to be exacerbated as a result of climate change feng and fu 2013 and population growth safriel et al 2006 therefore to respond to both water scarcity and the environmental economic limits of traditional pw disposal practices the reclamation of pw for irrigation in dry areas must be considered despite the large volume available pw salinity sodicity and metalloids contents often exceed the maximum levels recommended in the fao irrigation water quality guidelines alley et al 2011 thus preventing its application to the soil without adequate treatment in oman for instance following irrigation with partially treated pw the electrical conductivity ece and the soil sodium adsorption ratio sare of the soil saturation extract dramatically increased from 1 6 to 7 1 ds m for the ece and from 2 3 to 68 1 for the sare after 102 days of irrigation as a result the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased from 1 42 10 3 to 1 6 10 6 m s hirayama et al 2002 similarly in semi arid usa when untreated pw was used to irrigate camelina the soil ece increased from 1 4 to 1 9 ds m while the soil sare rose from 0 2 to 2 0 sintim et al 2017 comparable observations have been reported in other semi arid regions of the usa burkhardt et al 2015 johnston et al 2008 north east brazil sousa et al 2017 south africa beletse et al 2008 as well as in dry sub humid australia biggs et al 2013 although these changes to soil properties may not immediately affect crop productivity the long term implications of irrigation using pw without soil salinity and sodicity management are uncertain most research addressing the impacts of irrigation with pw is composed of short term field experiments 1 3 years whereas o g fields longevity varies from 5 to more than 50 years encana 2011 total 2015 moreover field trials are carried out under specific climates and on particular soils so their results cannot be easily extrapolated to other types of drylands also the qualities of the pws used in these trials do not necessarily represent the diversity of pw qualities therefore there is a need for extending the study of the impacts on soil fertility in the long term of irrigation with pw of different qualities on soil fertility in the long term and under different climates and soil types to this end simulation with soil water models such as saltirsoil m visconti et al 2014 is an adequate methodology for studying the long term impacts of irrigation with a range of representative pws on multiple soils and climates typical of drylands modelling is an appropriate tool firstly because it reduces the time needed for obtaining results compared to field experiments also models can be run with what if scenarios describing different situations without the need for a large number of field trials lastly models allow the simulation of extreme scenarios without any adverse consequences on the environment graves et al 2002 although mallants et al 2017 and jakubowski et al 2014 modelled the impacts of irrigation with pw on soil salinity on the medium term 1 10 years they did not consider the long term sustainability of this practice in addition these studies were limited to dry sub humid queensland australia this investigation aims to estimate the environmental sustainability of irrigation with pw in dry conditions and to determine how it is affected by environmental

types according to fao s reference soil groups rsg classification iuss working group wrb 2015 the selected soil types gypsisol arenosol planosol and vertisol represent 22 12 5 and 5 respectively of soils in drylands koohafkan and stewart 2008 all soil samples belonging to the same soil type were grouped and their parameters values averaged to create an indicative soil for each soil type the soil volumetric water contents at saturation and field capacity were estimated from the soil texture and organic matter content saxton and rawls 2006 the soil organic matter content som was estimated from the total organic carbon content using a van bemmelen factor of 1 72 soil survey staff 1996 the pco2 was estimated from soil ph thomas 1996 table 2 tropical sugar beet was selected as an exemplar crop for the following reasons firstly it is salt tolerant tanji and kielen 2002 sodium and chloride tolerant wakeel et al 2010 and it can be grown in a wide range of soils sesvanderhave 2016 and under dry climates chatin et al 2004 nilsson 2005 secondly sugar beet usually adapts well to drip irrigation which is the most suitable system in water scarce drylands rhoades et al 1992 finally this crop has multiple uses such as foodstuff sugar animal feed pellets and molasses and biofuel the planting date was set on november 1st a typical planting date in the northern hemisphere regions with mediterranean arid climates fao 2018a crop coefficients growth stages lengths and root depths were obtained from fao 2018a fao 2018b the shaded area values were sourced from webb et al 1997 cropwat 8 0 fao 2018b was used to estimate the crop water requirements and to set the irrigation schedule for each climate table 1 no deliberate leaching nor amendments were included 2 3 produced water quality data on pw origin and quality for 33 pws were sourced from the usgs national produced waters geochemical database blondes et al 2017 an exploratory data analysis of the ten physicochemical water properties ec25 ph na k mg2 ca2 cl no3 so4 2 and alkalinity alk was carried out in the 33 pws the distributions of these properties fulfilled the requirements for log normally distributed variables with the exception of ph being this last one normally distributed however inspection of the histograms revealed some data clustering that could diminish the precision of the sustainability assessment since having more regularly distributed data would be optimal a stochastic pw generator spwg was developed on the basis of the 33 pw according to the methodology outlined in the ensuing paragraph first of all the original water properties were log transformed with the exception of ph and their means and standard deviations assessed second a principal components analysis pca was performed on the log transformed data table of 33 pws and as a consequence its matrix of eigenvectors was obtained third independent random values were obtained from a marginal normal distribution with zero mean and one standard deviation for each of the 10 principal components pcs of a set of 1000 synthetic waters four the logarithmic values of the 10 physicochemical water properties in all these synthetic waters were calculated using the previously obtained matrix of eigenvectors in addition to the corresponding means and standard deviations which we know from the first step five these logarithmic values for the ten properties in the set of 1000 synthetic waters were back transformed to become normal six the charge balance errors cbe were calculated in every synthetic water and the waters exceeding 2 were deleted from the dataset finally just 15 waters regularly covering a wide range from 0 3 to 130 3 ds m were kept and used in the simulations table 3 2 4 model scenarios the 240 simulated scenarios represent the irrigation with each pw 15 on each soil type 4 and under each climate 4 the soil depth chosen for the simulation was 60 cm because this is the depth where sugar beet root density is the highest draycott 2006 all results of soil composition were expressed for a saturated extract at chemical equilibrium 2 5 sustainability assessment soil fertility was appraised using the calculated indicators sare and ece which were compared to threshold values threshold sare values for soil structural stability were based on the australian and new zealand environment conservation council guidelines anzecc 2000 which have been used as a reference to study the risks and feasibility of irrigating with pw under dry climates in australia and in sub saharan africa horner et al 2011 mallants et al 2017 the thresholds for sare were set at 20 for arenosol sandy soil with clay content 15 20 for gypsisol loamy soil with 15 clay content 24 13 for planosol clay loam soil with 25 clay content 34 and 5 for vertisol clayey soil with 55 clay content 64 due to the critical importance of sare for soil stability no scenario could be considered sustainable if the simulated soil sare exceeded the anzecc guidelines thresholds soil ece was evaluated through the expected effects on sugar beet yield considering the fao salt tolerance parameters given by shaw et al 2011 that is an ece of 7 ds m for a maximum yield and a productivity decrease of 5 9 per ds m increase of ece therefore taking a minimum yield of 50 of its potential the resulting maximum ece is 15 5 ds m the quality of dw can affect the sub soil and the aquifer in fact dw can carry dissolved salts into the aquifer and depending on its depth it may result in groundwater salinisation shannon et al 1997 dws qualities are ranked according to their ecd rhoades et al 1992 to consider their impacts on groundwater and the implications in addition soil phe was used as a complementary indicator for assessing the risk of nutrient deficiencies which have an impact on crop yield and quality mcenroe and coulter 1964 the phe threshold values are the suitable range of values for sugar beet cultivation sesvanderhave 2016 2 6 statistical analyses three way analyses of variance anova were used to check for significant differences among soils climates and pws in the determination of the soil chemistry i e ece sare and phe and dw quality i e ecd and sard characteristics besides two way anovas were also performed to check for significant first order interactions second order effects between soils climates and pws in the determination of the same characteristics linear regressions were used to study the strength of the linear dependence r2 and strength of the effect line slope of the pw characteristics on their soil counterparts i e ecw on ece sarw on sare and especially alkw on phe under the influence of the different soil types fig 3 and climates considered in this work fig 4 3 results the impact of irrigation with pw on the long term soil salinity and sodicity of the 240 scenarios are presented in fig 1 the dws resulting from irrigation are classified by their level of salinity in fig 2 the salinity and sodicity balances between the different salt reservoirs irrigation water soil and dw are described by the slope of the curves in figs 3 and 4 according to the three way anova pw but also soil and climate significantly influence the soil chemistry and dw quality the ranking of the mean square values in descending order indicate that the ece and sare were mainly determined by pw then soil and finally climate climate was not determinant for the phe as the latter was mainly determined by soil and pw lastly the ecd was shown to be mostly influenced by pw and to a lesser extent by climate whereas the sard was influenced by pw climate and finally soil table 4 according to the two way anovas the interaction between pw and soil was significant on the determination of ece sare and phe but not the others i e soil x climate and climate x pw however the interaction between climate and pw has a significant effect on dw quality ecd and sard soil salinity and sodicity showed a remarkable linear dependence on pw salinity and sodicity according to the high r2 in figs 3 and 4 the curves ece f ecw in fig 3 indicate how prone the different soils are to salinisation because of salt transfer from the irrigation water to the soil the slope of the curve ece f ecw was the steepest for vertisol 1 01 planosol 0 87 gypsisol 0 65 and finally arenosol 0 23 on the other hand the curves ecd f ecw illustrate how dependent on pw is dw salinity in each soil type in this case the slope of this curve was the highest for arenosol 2 10 vertisol 1 85 planosol 1 84 and finally gypsisol 1 82 likewise the curves sare f sarw indicates the soil sensitivity to sodification due to the transfer of sodium from the irrigation water to the soil the slope of this curve was the steepest for vertisol 0 94 planosol 0 88 arenosol 0 54 and gypsisol 0 42 next the curves sard f sarw indicate the ability of the soil to buffer the calcium and magnesium concentrations of the water that percolates through it in this case the slope of this curve was the highest for planosol 1 32 vertisol 1 32 arenosol 1 05 and gypsisol 0 90 the impact of irrigation with pw on soil salinity and sodicity is also influenced by climate and specifically it can be amplified by the increasing aridity fig 4 indeed all soils combined the slopes of the curves ece f ecw and sare f sarw from highest to lowest were as follow hyper arid 0 89 and 0 96 arid 0 89 and 0 75 semi arid 0 68 and 0 66 and dry sub humid 0 40 and 0 45 respectively whereas the slopes of the curves ecd f ecw and sard f sarw from highest to lowest were as follow arid 2 56 and 1 35 hyper arid 2 25 and 1 33 semi arid 1 70 and 1 01 and dry sub humid 1 08 and 0 81 respectively according to r2 soil phe was not dependent on pw quality in gypsisol and vertisol whereas it was somewhat more dependent in the case of arenosol and vertisol fig 6 there was no risk of crop yield loss due to unsuitable phe as tropical sugar beet can be grown in soil with ph ranging from 4 to 9 instead crop yield responded negatively to increasing ece 4 discussion 4 1 soil salinity and sodicity the three way anova revealed that in the long term pw quality soil type and climate influence in this order from the most to the least influential soil salinity and sodicity table 4 besides the two way anova revealed that the only significant interaction was between pw and soil that is to say the effect of pw on soil salinity sodicity and ph was significantly modulated by the soil type table 4 in all scenarios increasing ecw and sarw led to a higher degree of soil salinisation and or sodification fig 1 this is illustrated by the values of the coefficients of determination r2 of ece against ecw on the one hand and sare against sarw on the other hand therefore independently of soil type fig 3 and aridity fig 4 irrigation using pws with higher ecw led to higher soil ece similarly irrigation using pws with higher sarw led to higher soil sare however r2 was lower for soil and water sar than for soil and water ec thus soil sodicity sare was less dependent on water sodicity sarw than soil salinity ece was on water salinity ecw as other parameters related to the soil interfere and must be taken into account to predict sare the simulations have shown that the soil types differed regarding their levels of vulnerability to sodification table 4 and fig 1 the clay content on which the anzecc sare threshold values are based shaw et al 2011 has a key role in determining the sensitivity of a soil to sodification indeed high sare causes high exchangeable sodium percentage esp which destabilise soil particles due to clay swelling and dispersion as a result soil pores clog and its hydraulic conductivity and thus the ability to supply water to crops decreases eventually the sensitivity of lands to erosion and desertification are both amplified dregne 1983 qadir and schubert 2002 the soil characteristics that mostly influence long term sare are gypsum content and drainage ability firstly soil gypsum content buffers soil sodicity by dissolving into the soil solution secondly the drainage properties of the soil moderate soil sodification because as the percentage of sand increases water content at field capacity decreases and leaching increases and thus the sodium concentration in the soil solution decreases however calcium concentration is more constant because this ion also dissolves into the soil solution from calcium minerals calcite and mostly gypsum if present as a result the soils with the highest gypsum content highest sand content and thus lowest field capacity were the less prone to sodification this was shown by the simulations in which vertisol and planosol resulted to be the most sensitive to sodification whereas gypsisol and arenosol were the least vulnerable to sodification fig 3 field experiments have confirmed that the sensitivity of soil to sodification can be anticipated knowing the soil clay content and the water retention properties levy et al 2005 the buffer effect of soil gypsum on sare has also been highlighted in an experimental modelling study with pw in semi arid wyoming usa engle et al 2011 the long term ece and therefore the risk of soil salinisation also depends on soil type table 4 and fig 1 indeed soils with a low water content at field capacity in general drain more easily as they usually have large pores thus they retain less water and leach more salt compared to soils with a higher field capacity as a consequence vertisol and planosol were the most sensitive to salinisation whereas gypsisol and arenosol were the least vulnerable to salinisation fig 3 an irrigation trial with pw conducted in semi arid ne brazil on a sandy soil showed that the high porosity of arenosols decreased ece through facilitated drainage sousa et al 2017 although less than soil climate also affects the relationships between water and soil salinity as well as between water and soil sodicity indeed this was anticipated by the three way anova table 4 and then quantified by the slopes of the curves ece f ecw and sare f sarw which increased following aridity from dry sub humid to hyper arid fig 4 making irrigation with pw less sustainable fig 1 this is explained by the double effect of rain which both dilutes the soil solution and transport salts out of the root zone reducing ece equally important higher evaporation increases the salt concentration of the soil water lower aridity or higher humidity decreases the concentration of soil sodium while the concentrations of magnesium and over all calcium are buffered by the minerals calcite and gypsum generally present in dryland soils koohafkan and stewart 2008 the ability of aridity to influence ece and sare were observed in a field trial carried out with pw under humid sub tropical climate in alabama usa mullins and hajek 1998 thus the aridity index should be considered when assessing the sustainability of irrigation with pw the crop has an indirect effect in determining ece and sare sugar beet was considered in this study however other crops would have required different irrigation amounts and schedules as the irrigation volume and its distribution play a key role for ece and sare a crop with lower water needs compared to sugar beet implies less irrigation water and thus less salt input to the soil also if the crop requires water in the period of the year when rainfall is the highest and evaporation the lowest it could highly reduce soil ece and sare due to less irrigation more salt leaching and less water evaporation in brief well drained soils with low clay content and significant gypsum content in the relatively most humid regions must be chosen in priority for preventing soil salinisation and sodification in addition a drought resistant crop growing when the ai is the highest during the year must be privileged for improving the sustainability of irrigation with pw most of the studies referring to the suitability of using pw for irrigation use the fao guidelines ayers and westcot 1985 for assessing potential risks to the soil and crop beletse et al 2008 guerra et al 2011 martel valles et al 2014 2017 2016 myers 2014 the results obtained in this investigation could help to refine these standards when assessing the sustainability of irrigation with pw indeed the limitations of the fao guidelines are that they are not specific therefore they may be too conservative for environments with low vulnerability to salinisation and sodification e g well drained soils in dry sub humid climates although the anzecc guidelines are more specific by discriminating among soil types according to their clay content they do not consider the degree of aridity in the determination of threshold ecw and sarw values to prevent soil salinisation and sodification 4 2 soil ph according to the three way anova soil phe was mainly determined by the soil type especially by the soil caco3 content and to a lesser extent by pw quality table 4 only for arenosol and planosol which have low carbonate content the soil phe was positively influenced although in a limited proportion by irrigation water alkalinity alkw with 0 79 r2 0 86 whereas the r2 were very low 0 01 for gypsisol and vertisol which both have the highest carbonate content fig 5 the limited influence of irrigation water on phe has also been highlighted in an irrigation trial with pw on a vertisol in dry sub humid australia bennett et al 2016 decreasing aridity slightly reduced phe on arenosol and planosol fig 5 that is a common observation in arid environments jiao et al 2016 soil amendments and fertilisers which are not considered in this study may have a significant effect on phe which must be anticipated if they are used along with irrigation 4 3 crop yield crop yield can be maximised by reducing the soil ece below 7 ds m which is the crop threshold value for an optimal yield fig 6 the irrigation volume can be increased to leach more salt or pw can be blended with another water of lower salinity to reduce ece eventually crop with a higher tolerance to salinity can be cultivated if it is adapted to climates and soils in drylands although crop production is of primary relevance for farmers the o g industry does not necessarily have the same target if managing pw in an irrigation project remains less expensive compared to conventional disposal options yield as low as 50 of crop optimum could be satisfactory 4 4 drainage water according to the three way anova the dw quality was significantly related to pw quality and then climate while significant differences among soils were only observed on the dw sodicity table 4 increasing ecw and sarw led to higher ecd and sard fig 2 due to positive correlations between ecw and ecd on the one hand and between sarw and sard on the other hand although bare differences were observed among soil types table 4 soils were however determinant in defining dw quality according to the slopes of the curves ecd f sarw and sard f sarw well drained soils such as arenosol generated the most saline dw whereas planosol and vertisol generated the most sodic dw climate interferes as decreasing aridity lowered ecd and sard by diluting the salinity of dw because of lower evaporation and or higher precipitation the crop indirectly determines ecd and sard through the irrigation volume and irrigation schedule also if the crop requires water in the period of the year when rainfall is the highest and evaporation the lowest rain could either increase ecd and sard due to more salt leaching or reduce ecd and sard due to increasing dilution of dw notwithstanding if the crop requires more water when it rains more then less pw will be used accordingly and therefore less salt will be introduced into the soil if irrigation can be sustainable from a soil plant point of view dw leaving the root zone must be properly managed to avoid transferring the salinity and sodicity hazards from the soil to the groundwater indeed in the simulations dw was always more saline and more sodic than the associated irrigation water dw would continue to percolate deeper into the soil eventually reaching the aquifer this risk must be anticipated if ecd is higher than the ec of the aquifer although it might not be a problem in some dry areas where groundwater is deep and or already brackish vengosh 2014 alternatively dw can be captured by means of drainage systems and reused treated or disposed of disposal options such as pond evaporation discharge to the sea or deep well injection could be considered jiménez et al 2018 notwithstanding irrigation would at least reduce the volume of saline water that had to be disposed of compared to the original volume of pw therefore it would be cheaper to manage 4 5 limitations the carried out simulations are exploratory and limitations related to the model the method and the guidelines used in this study are acknowledged the saltirsoil m model does not simulate crop salt uptake therefore where this is significant it could overestimate the soil salinity although salt uptake is usually negligible compared to the salt load brought by irrigation water sugar beet salt uptake can reach more than 1 2 t ha of sodium and potassium annually cumo 2013 given that irrigation of sugar beet under dry sub humid climate requires 590 mm of water table 1 irrigation would bring between 0 15 to 118 t ha year of sodium and potassium respectively if pw1 and pw15 are used that is between 13 and 10 000 of the salt load that would be exported by the crop thus the salt load extracted from the soil solution would not significantly change the salt concentration of the worst case scenarios e g irrigation in a hyper arid climate with pw15 but would positively contribute to the sustainability of the simulated scenarios where the salt load brought by irrigation water was relatively low tolerance to salinity and optimum soil phe vary widely among crops consequently different crop threshold levels will also impact soil salinity and sodicity as well as crop yield the soil salinity and sodicity and crop yield patterns described in figs 1 and 6 would be different if another crop would have been chosen instead of sugar beet from an agricultural point of view the sustainability of irrigation with pw is mainly but not exclusively a salinity issue other constituents of concern such as metalloids exist in pw and their presence and concentrations depend on pw origin alley et al 2011 and treatment processes fakhru l razi et al 2009 on the one hand the high soil phe and the low som content of most soils in dryland limit the bioavailability of heavy metals but on the other hand high soil ece increases this risk singh et al 2009 although the risks linked to other components of pw are not as concerning as those related to salts they still deserve to be specifically assessed and included in potential guidelines or frameworks aiming to support pw reuse for irrigation although the saltirsoil m model has been calibrated and validated against field results in a dry region with slightly to moderately saline irrigation water visconti et al 2014 this has not yet been done for the environments simulated in this investigation therefore the model results should be used in the context of refining conceptual and mathematical models for future research based on a comparison of simulated and field results under specific environments this would also help to define the sensitivity of sustainability indicators e g ece sare ions contents phe and alkalinity of the soil solution to parameters and processes that are considered or not considered in the model and which in this case would require further characterisation and study 5 conclusions pw is generated continuously independent of climatic conditions and could be a useful water resource for irrigators in drylands for petroleum firms its reuse for irrigation is an alternative to conventional disposal practices which are environmentally risky increasingly regulated and costly depending on the soil and climate the low quality of pw particularly its high salinity and sodicity can degrade soil fertility and aquifers to varying degrees irrigation water quality and climatic aridity drive the balance of salt inputs and outputs of the system while the irrigation practice and soil type control the salt removal processes and leaching through drainage the main threat to the soil from irrigation with pw is sodification the risk of which largely depends on the clay content of the soil pw sodicity sarw and aridity if pw quality cannot be improved e g by blending with freshwater or desalination pw irrigation can only be used in the long term in environments that are less vulnerable to soil salinisation and sodification well drained soils with low water content at field capacity e g arenosol are less vulnerable to salinisation whilst a relatively high gypsum content gypsisol provides resistance against sodification on the contrary clayey soils with a high field capacity water content and a low gypsum content must be avoided as the soil structural stability as well as a tolerable soil electrical conductivity ece for the crop cannot be maintained on the long term simulations with a sugar beet crop in drylands demonstrated that crop yield could be adequate 50 of optimum and even improved by using pw with lower ec in well drained soils soil phe which also impacts crop yield through nutrient availability was not significantly affected by irrigation water quality since it largely depends on the natural soil caco3 co2 content finally drainage water quality is closely linked to the quality of pw but is also influenced by the soil type and aridity the impact of drainage water on the aquifer must be considered and measures such as drainage water reuse or disposal implemented accordingly for achieving sustainable irrigation with pw the modelling has demonstrated the importance of the clay and gypsum content of the soil and of climate aridity index to assess the suitability of produced waters for irrigation based on the simulation results irrigation with pw is likely to be sustainable on sandy soils if pw has an ec 28 ds m and a sar 36 loamy and gypsiferous soils can cope with pw with an ec 14 ds m and a sar 29 unless the climate is dry sub humid 0 50 ai 0 65 in this case pw with an ec as high as 28 ds m and a sar 83 can be used for long term irrigation of salt tolerant crops salinisation and sodification can be avoided in sandy clay loam soils if the pw has an ec 12 ds m and a sar 6 lastly clayey soils should not be irrigated with pw with an ec 2 ds m and a sar 10 except if the climate is dry sub humid or wetter where pw sar can be as high as 13 these thresholds values need to be confirmed through further field study and would only be adopted to manage pw through irrigation without targeting optimum crop yield on a sample of 474 pws collected worldwide about 6 8 of pws fall within the threshold values for the least vulnerable environments i e sandy soil and loamy gypsiferous soil in dry sub humid climate whereas only 2 of the pws corresponded to the required quality for irrigation on clayey soil echchelh et al 2018 future work should be carried out to explore how management practices such as over irrigation pw blending with freshwater pw desalination and gypsum amendments could help to improve irrigation sustainability with the pws that are too saline and or too sodic to be used in long term irrigation a complete sustainability assessment would also require an analysis of the impacts of other constituents of concern such as heavy metals and radioelements on soil crop and groundwater these studies could be synthesised in a sustainability assessment framework specifically designed for the oil and gas sector to encourage cooperation between the oil and gas industry and irrigators for sustainable reuse of pw in drylands acknowledgement

10907,produced water pw is the largest by product of the oil and gas industry its management is both economically and environmentally costly pw reuse for irrigation offers an alternative to current disposal practices while providing water to irrigators in drylands the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the environmental effects of irrigation with pw the saltirsoil m model was used to simulate the irrigation of sugar beet with 15 pws of a wide range of qualities in four climates of different aridity and on four contrasting soil types the impacts on soil salinity sodicity and ph as well as on crop yield and drainage water salinity were estimated well drained soils with low water content at field capacity arenosol are less sensitive to salinisation while a relatively high gypsum content gypsisol makes the soil less vulnerable to both sodification and salinisation on the contrary clayey soils with higher water content at field capacity and lower gypsum content must be avoided as the soil structural stability as well as a tolerable soil electrical conductivity for the crop cannot be maintained on the long term soil ph was not found to be sensitive to pw quality drainage water quality was found to be closely linked to pw quality although it is also influenced by the soil type the impact of drainage water on the aquifer must be considered and reuse or disposal implemented accordingly for achieving sustainable irrigation finally increasing aridity intensifies soil and drainage water salinity and sodicity this investigation highlights the importance of adapting the existing irrigation water quality guidelines through the use of models to include relevant parameters related to soil type and aridity indeed it will support the petroleum industry and irrigators to estimate the risks due to watering crops with pw and will encourage its sustainable reuse in water scarce areas keywords arid climate irrigation water quality modelling salinity saltirsoil sodicity 1 introduction oil and gas o g extraction generates considerable volumes of produced water pw which is the main by product of the o g industry veil 2011 pw mostly originates from water which is naturally present with the hydrocarbons in the reservoir but can also include water that is artificially added to the reservoir and flows back to the surface during enhanced oil recovery and hydraulic fracturing engle et al 2014 about half of the global pw volume is injected into disposal wells or discharged on the surface after treatment without being beneficially reused echchelh et al 2018 these disposal practices have limits deep injection is energy intensive and thus is expensive and is responsible for high co2 emissions arthur et al 2011 furthermore it is environmentally hazardous as it can pollute the groundwater hagström et al 2016 and induce seismic activity walsh and zoback 2015 surface discharge can also contaminate soils konkel 2016 and receiving water bodies christie 2012 as a consequence stricter environmental regulations are being developed requiring extensive pw treatment before discharging fakhru l razi et al 2009 or prohibiting discharge entirely e g zero liquid discharge igunnu and chen 2014 the increasingly stringent regulation increases pw management cost for o g firms stanic 2014 as global pw volume is expected to rise drastically dal ferro and smith 2007 there is a need for sustainable alternatives to current pw management practices pw reuse for irrigation could potentially provide a considerable amount of water to farmlands situated in o g basins echchelh et al 2018 this option is of the utmost interest in drylands which host a significant part of the world s hydrocarbon production and reserves eia 2018 and where water scarcity is likely to be exacerbated as a result of climate change feng and fu 2013 and population growth safriel et al 2006 therefore to respond to both water scarcity and the environmental economic limits of traditional pw disposal practices the reclamation of pw for irrigation in dry areas must be considered despite the large volume available pw salinity sodicity and metalloids contents often exceed the maximum levels recommended in the fao irrigation water quality guidelines alley et al 2011 thus preventing its application to the soil without adequate treatment in oman for instance following irrigation with partially treated pw the electrical conductivity ece and the soil sodium adsorption ratio sare of the soil saturation extract dramatically increased from 1 6 to 7 1 ds m for the ece and from 2 3 to 68 1 for the sare after 102 days of irrigation as a result the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased from 1 42 10 3 to 1 6 10 6 m s hirayama et al 2002 similarly in semi arid usa when untreated pw was used to irrigate camelina the soil ece increased from 1 4 to 1 9 ds m while the soil sare rose from 0 2 to 2 0 sintim et al 2017 comparable observations have been reported in other semi arid regions of the usa burkhardt et al 2015 johnston et al 2008 north east brazil sousa et al 2017 south africa beletse et al 2008 as well as in dry sub humid australia biggs et al 2013 although these changes to soil properties may not immediately affect crop productivity the long term implications of irrigation using pw without soil salinity and sodicity management are uncertain most research addressing the impacts of irrigation with pw is composed of short term field experiments 1 3 years whereas o g fields longevity varies from 5 to more than 50 years encana 2011 total 2015 moreover field trials are carried out under specific climates and on particular soils so their results cannot be easily extrapolated to other types of drylands also the qualities of the pws used in these trials do not necessarily represent the diversity of pw qualities therefore there is a need for extending the study of the impacts on soil fertility in the long term of irrigation with pw of different qualities on soil fertility in the long term and under different climates and soil types to this end simulation with soil water models such as saltirsoil m visconti et al 2014 is an adequate methodology for studying the long term impacts of irrigation with a range of representative pws on multiple soils and climates typical of drylands modelling is an appropriate tool firstly because it reduces the time needed for obtaining results compared to field experiments also models can be run with what if scenarios describing different situations without the need for a large number of field trials lastly models allow the simulation of extreme scenarios without any adverse consequences on the environment graves et al 2002 although mallants et al 2017 and jakubowski et al 2014 modelled the impacts of irrigation with pw on soil salinity on the medium term 1 10 years they did not consider the long term sustainability of this practice in addition these studies were limited to dry sub humid queensland australia this investigation aims to estimate the environmental sustainability of irrigation with pw in dry conditions and to determine how it is affected by environmental parameters pw quality climate and soil type here sustainable irrigation refers to maintaining soil fertility in the long term i e indefinitely which means to preserve soil structural stability and maintain a crop yield of at least 50 of optimum potential for that salinity ece sodicity sare and ph phe of the soil saturation extract must be preserved from the effects of the irrigation water salinity ecw sodicity sarw and ph phw sustainable irrigation also includes appropriate management of drainage water dw depending on its salinity ecd and sodicity sard the impacts of irrigation with pw on soil fertility dw quality and crop yield are discussed from an environmental perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil water model saltirsoil m is a one dimensional deterministic transient state

irrigated semi arid lands in spain visconti et al 2014 in this research the model is used to calculate the equilibrium ece sare and phe of the soil saturation extract and of the dw 2 2 model parameterisation locations from the western usa preferably near o g fields were chosen to represent the different types of dry climates table 1 dry climates are classified using the unep aridity index ai which is defined as the ratio of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration cherlet et al 2018 a climate is hyper arid if ai 0 05 arid if 0 05 ai 0 20 semi arid if 0 20 ai 0 50 and dry sub humid if 0 5 ai 0 65 monthly climatic averages were calculated from daily time series for the period 1990 2016 temperature relative humidity precipitation reference evapotranspiration eto wind speed and downward solar radiation were sourced from the university of idaho s metdata abatzoglou 2013 and the average number of days with precipitation from weatherbase canty et al 2018 the number of sunshine hours was estimated using the adapted equation of ångström prescott viswanadham and ramanadham 1969 the harmonised world soil database fao 2009 was used to select four representative soil types according to fao s reference soil groups rsg classification iuss working group wrb 2015 the selected soil types gypsisol arenosol planosol and vertisol represent 22 12 5 and 5 respectively of soils in drylands koohafkan and stewart 2008 all soil samples belonging to the same soil type were grouped and their parameters values averaged to create an indicative soil for each soil type the soil volumetric water contents at saturation and field capacity were estimated from the soil texture and organic matter content saxton and rawls 2006 the soil organic matter content som was estimated from the total organic carbon content using a van bemmelen factor of 1 72 soil survey staff 1996 the pco2 was estimated from soil ph thomas 1996 table 2 tropical sugar beet was selected as an exemplar crop for the following reasons firstly it is salt tolerant tanji and kielen 2002 sodium and chloride tolerant wakeel et al 2010 and it can be grown in a wide range of soils sesvanderhave 2016 and under dry climates chatin et al 2004 nilsson 2005 secondly sugar beet usually adapts well to drip irrigation which is the most suitable system in water scarce drylands rhoades et al 1992 finally this crop has multiple uses such as foodstuff sugar animal feed pellets and molasses and biofuel the planting date was set on november 1st a typical planting date in the northern hemisphere regions with mediterranean arid climates fao 2018a crop coefficients growth stages lengths and root depths were obtained from fao 2018a fao 2018b the shaded area values were sourced from webb et al 1997 cropwat 8 0 fao 2018b was used to estimate the crop water requirements and to set the irrigation schedule for each climate table 1 no deliberate leaching nor amendments were included 2 3 produced water quality data on pw origin and quality for 33 pws were sourced from the usgs national produced waters geochemical database blondes et al 2017 an exploratory data analysis of the ten physicochemical water properties ec25 ph na k mg2 ca2 cl no3 so4 2 and alkalinity alk was carried out in the 33 pws the distributions of these properties fulfilled the requirements for log normally distributed variables with the exception of ph being this last one normally distributed however inspection of the histograms revealed some data clustering that could diminish the precision of the sustainability assessment since having more regularly distributed data would be optimal a stochastic pw generator spwg was developed on the basis of the 33 pw according to the methodology outlined in the ensuing paragraph first of all the original water properties were log transformed with the exception of ph and their means and standard deviations assessed second a principal components analysis pca was performed on the log transformed data table of 33 pws and as a consequence its matrix of eigenvectors was obtained third independent random values were obtained from a marginal normal distribution with zero mean and one standard deviation for each of the 10 principal components pcs of a set of 1000 synthetic waters four the logarithmic values of the 10 physicochemical water properties in all these synthetic waters were calculated using the previously obtained matrix of eigenvectors in addition to the corresponding means and standard deviations which we know from the first step five these logarithmic values for the ten properties in the set of 1000 synthetic waters were back transformed to become normal six the charge balance errors cbe were calculated in every synthetic water and the waters exceeding 2 were deleted from the dataset finally just 15 waters regularly covering a wide range from 0 3 to 130 3 ds m were kept and used in the simulations table 3 2 4 model scenarios the 240 simulated scenarios represent the irrigation with each pw 15 on each soil type 4 and under each climate 4 the soil depth chosen for the simulation was 60 cm because this is the depth where sugar beet root density is the highest draycott 2006 all results of soil composition were expressed for a saturated extract at chemical equilibrium 2 5 sustainability assessment soil fertility was appraised using the calculated indicators sare and ece which were compared to threshold values threshold sare values for soil structural stability were based on the australian and new zealand environment conservation council guidelines anzecc 2000 which have been used as a reference to study the risks and feasibility of irrigating with pw under dry climates in australia and in sub saharan africa horner et al 2011 mallants et al 2017 the thresholds for sare were set at 20 for arenosol sandy soil with clay content 15 20 for gypsisol loamy soil with 15 clay content 24 13 for planosol clay loam soil with 25 clay content 34 and 5 for vertisol clayey soil with 55 clay content 64 due to the critical importance of sare for soil stability no scenario could be considered sustainable if the simulated soil sare exceeded the anzecc guidelines thresholds soil ece was evaluated through the expected effects on sugar beet yield considering the fao salt tolerance parameters given by shaw et al 2011 that is an ece of 7 ds m for a maximum yield and a productivity decrease of 5 9 per ds m increase of ece therefore taking a minimum yield of 50 of its potential the resulting maximum ece is 15 5 ds m the quality of dw can affect the sub soil and the aquifer in fact dw can carry dissolved salts into the aquifer and depending on its depth it may result in groundwater salinisation shannon et al 1997 dws qualities are ranked according to their ecd rhoades et al 1992 to consider their impacts on groundwater and the implications in addition soil phe was used as a complementary indicator for assessing the risk of nutrient deficiencies which have an impact on crop yield and quality mcenroe and coulter 1964 the phe threshold values are the suitable range of values for sugar beet cultivation sesvanderhave 2016 2 6 statistical analyses three way analyses of variance anova were used to check for significant differences among soils climates and pws in the determination of the soil chemistry i e ece sare and phe and dw quality i e ecd and sard characteristics besides two way anovas were also performed to check for significant first order interactions second order effects between soils climates and pws in the determination of the same characteristics linear regressions were used to study the strength of the linear dependence r2 and strength of the effect line slope of the pw characteristics on their soil counterparts i e ecw on ece sarw on sare and especially alkw on phe under the influence of the different soil types fig 3 and climates considered in this work fig 4 3 results the impact of irrigation with pw on the long term soil salinity and sodicity of the 240 scenarios are presented in fig 1 the dws resulting from irrigation are classified by their level of salinity in fig 2 the salinity and sodicity balances between the different salt reservoirs irrigation water soil and dw are described by the slope of the curves in figs 3 and 4 according to the three way anova pw but also soil and climate significantly influence the soil chemistry and dw quality the ranking of the mean square values in descending order indicate that the ece and sare were mainly determined by pw then soil and finally climate climate was not determinant for the phe as the latter was mainly determined by soil and pw lastly the ecd was shown to be mostly influenced by pw and to a lesser extent by climate whereas the sard was influenced by pw climate and finally soil table 4 according to the two way anovas the interaction between pw and soil was significant on the determination of ece sare and phe but not the others i e soil x climate and climate x pw however the interaction between climate and pw has a significant effect on dw quality ecd and sard soil salinity and sodicity showed a remarkable linear dependence on pw salinity and sodicity according to the high r2 in figs 3 and 4 the curves ece f ecw in fig 3 indicate how prone the different soils are to salinisation because of salt transfer from the irrigation water to the soil the slope of the curve ece f ecw was the steepest for vertisol 1 01 planosol 0 87 gypsisol 0 65 and finally arenosol 0 23 on the other hand the curves ecd f ecw illustrate how dependent on pw is dw salinity in each soil type in this case the slope of this curve was the highest for arenosol 2 10 vertisol 1 85 planosol 1 84 and finally gypsisol 1 82 likewise the curves sare f sarw indicates the soil sensitivity to sodification due to the transfer of sodium from the irrigation water to the soil the slope of this curve was the steepest for vertisol 0 94 planosol 0 88 arenosol 0 54 and gypsisol 0 42 next the curves sard f sarw indicate the ability of the soil to buffer the calcium and magnesium concentrations of the water that percolates through it in this case the slope of this curve was the highest for planosol 1 32 vertisol 1 32 arenosol 1 05 and gypsisol 0 90 the impact of irrigation with pw on soil salinity and sodicity is also influenced by climate and specifically it can be amplified by the increasing aridity fig 4 indeed all soils combined the slopes of the curves ece f ecw and sare f sarw from highest to lowest were as follow hyper arid 0 89 and 0 96 arid 0 89 and 0 75 semi arid 0 68 and 0 66 and dry sub humid 0 40 and 0 45 respectively whereas the slopes of the curves ecd f ecw and sard f sarw from highest to lowest were as follow arid 2 56 and 1 35 hyper arid 2 25 and 1 33 semi arid 1 70 and 1 01 and dry sub humid 1 08 and 0 81 respectively according to r2 soil phe was not dependent on pw quality in gypsisol and vertisol whereas it was somewhat more dependent in the case of arenosol and vertisol fig 6 there was no risk of crop yield loss due to unsuitable phe as tropical sugar beet can be grown in soil with ph ranging from 4 to 9 instead crop yield responded negatively to increasing ece 4 discussion 4 1 soil salinity and sodicity the three way anova revealed that in the long term pw quality soil type and climate influence in this order from the most to the least influential soil salinity and sodicity table 4 besides the two way anova revealed that the only significant interaction was between pw and soil that is to say the effect of pw on soil salinity sodicity and ph was significantly modulated by the soil type table 4 in all scenarios increasing ecw and sarw led to a higher degree of soil salinisation and or sodification fig 1 this is illustrated by the values of the coefficients of determination r2 of ece against ecw on the one hand and sare against sarw on the other hand therefore independently of soil type fig 3 and aridity fig 4 irrigation using pws with higher ecw led to higher soil ece similarly irrigation using pws with higher sarw led to higher soil sare however r2 was lower for soil and water sar than for soil and water ec thus soil sodicity sare was less dependent on water sodicity sarw than soil salinity ece was on water salinity ecw as other parameters related to the soil interfere and must be taken into account to predict sare the simulations have shown that the soil types differed regarding their levels of vulnerability to sodification table 4 and fig 1 the clay content on which the anzecc sare threshold values are based shaw et al 2011 has a key role in determining the sensitivity of a soil to sodification indeed high sare causes high exchangeable sodium percentage esp which destabilise soil particles due to clay swelling and dispersion as a result soil pores clog and its hydraulic conductivity and thus the ability to supply water to crops decreases eventually the sensitivity of lands to erosion and desertification are both amplified dregne 1983 qadir and schubert 2002 the soil characteristics that mostly influence long term sare are gypsum content and drainage ability firstly soil gypsum content buffers soil sodicity by dissolving into the soil solution secondly the drainage properties of the soil moderate soil sodification because as the percentage of sand increases water content at field capacity decreases and leaching increases and thus the sodium concentration in the soil solution decreases however calcium concentration is more constant because this ion also dissolves into the soil solution from calcium minerals calcite and mostly gypsum if present as a result the soils with the highest gypsum content highest sand content and thus lowest field capacity were the less prone to sodification this was shown by the simulations in which vertisol and planosol resulted to be the most sensitive to sodification whereas gypsisol and arenosol were the least vulnerable to sodification fig 3 field experiments have confirmed that the sensitivity of soil to sodification can be anticipated knowing the soil clay content and the water retention properties levy et al 2005 the buffer effect of soil gypsum on sare has also been highlighted in an experimental modelling study with pw in semi arid wyoming usa engle et al 2011 the long term ece and therefore the risk of soil salinisation also depends on soil type table 4 and fig 1 indeed soils with a low water content at field capacity in general drain more easily as they usually have large pores thus they retain less water and leach more salt compared to soils with a higher field capacity as a consequence vertisol and planosol were the most sensitive to salinisation whereas gypsisol and arenosol were the least vulnerable to salinisation fig 3 an irrigation trial with pw conducted in semi arid ne brazil on a sandy soil showed that the high porosity of arenosols decreased ece through facilitated drainage sousa et al 2017 although less than soil climate also affects the relationships between water and soil salinity as well as between water and soil sodicity indeed this was anticipated by the three way anova table 4 and then quantified by the slopes of the curves ece f ecw and sare f sarw which increased following aridity from dry sub humid to hyper arid fig 4 making irrigation with pw less sustainable fig 1 this is explained by the double effect of rain which both dilutes the soil solution and transport salts out of the root zone reducing ece equally important higher evaporation increases the salt concentration of the soil water lower aridity or higher humidity decreases the concentration of soil sodium while the concentrations of magnesium and over all calcium are buffered by the minerals calcite and gypsum generally present in dryland soils koohafkan and stewart 2008 the ability of aridity to influence ece and sare were observed in a field trial carried out with pw under humid sub tropical climate in alabama usa mullins and hajek 1998 thus the aridity index should be considered when assessing the sustainability of irrigation with pw the crop has an indirect effect in determining ece and sare sugar beet was considered in this study however other crops would have required different irrigation amounts and schedules as the irrigation volume and its distribution play a key role for ece and sare a crop with lower water needs compared to sugar beet implies less irrigation water and thus less salt input to the soil also if the crop requires water in the period of the year when rainfall is the highest and evaporation the lowest it could highly reduce soil ece and sare due to less irrigation more salt leaching and less water evaporation in brief well drained soils with low clay content and significant gypsum content in the relatively most humid regions must be chosen in priority for preventing soil salinisation and sodification in addition a drought resistant crop growing when the ai is the highest during the year must be privileged for improving the sustainability of irrigation with pw most of the studies referring to the suitability of using pw for irrigation use the fao guidelines ayers and westcot 1985 for assessing potential risks to the soil and crop beletse et al 2008 guerra et al 2011 martel valles et al 2014 2017 2016 myers 2014 the results obtained in this investigation could help to refine these standards when assessing the sustainability of irrigation with pw indeed the limitations of the fao guidelines are that they are not specific therefore they may be too conservative for environments with low vulnerability to salinisation and sodification e g well drained soils in dry sub humid climates although the anzecc guidelines are more specific by discriminating among soil types according to their clay content they do not consider the degree of aridity in the determination of threshold ecw and sarw values to prevent soil salinisation and sodification 4 2 soil ph according to the three way anova soil phe was mainly determined by the soil type especially by the soil caco3 content and to a lesser extent by pw quality table 4 only for arenosol and planosol which have low carbonate content the soil phe was positively influenced although in a limited proportion by irrigation water alkalinity alkw with 0 79 r2 0 86 whereas the r2 were very low 0 01 for gypsisol and vertisol which both have the highest carbonate content fig 5 the limited influence of irrigation water on phe has also been highlighted in an irrigation trial with pw on a vertisol in dry sub humid australia bennett et al 2016 decreasing aridity slightly reduced phe on arenosol and planosol fig 5 that is a common observation in arid environments jiao et al 2016 soil amendments and fertilisers which are not considered in this study may have a significant effect on phe which must be anticipated if they are used along with irrigation 4 3 crop yield crop yield can be maximised by reducing the soil ece below 7 ds m which is the crop threshold value for an optimal yield fig 6 the irrigation volume can be increased to leach more salt or pw can be blended with another water of lower salinity to reduce ece eventually crop with a higher tolerance to salinity can be cultivated if it is adapted to climates and soils in drylands although crop production is of primary relevance for farmers the o g industry does not necessarily have the same target if managing pw in an irrigation project remains less expensive compared to conventional disposal options yield as low as 50 of crop optimum could be satisfactory 4 4 drainage water according to the three way anova the dw quality was significantly related to pw quality and then climate while significant differences among soils were only observed on the dw sodicity table 4 increasing ecw and sarw led to higher ecd and sard fig 2 due to positive correlations between ecw and ecd on the one hand and between sarw and sard on the other hand although bare differences were observed among soil types table 4 soils were however determinant in defining dw quality according to the slopes of the curves ecd f sarw and sard f sarw well drained soils such as arenosol generated the most saline dw whereas planosol and vertisol generated the most sodic dw climate interferes as decreasing aridity lowered ecd and sard by diluting the salinity of dw because of lower evaporation and or higher precipitation the crop indirectly determines ecd and sard through the irrigation volume and irrigation schedule also if the crop requires water in the period of the year when rainfall is the highest and evaporation the lowest rain could either increase ecd and sard due to more salt leaching or reduce ecd and sard due to increasing dilution of dw notwithstanding if the crop requires more water when it rains more then less pw will be used accordingly and therefore less salt will be introduced into the soil if irrigation can be sustainable from a soil plant point of view dw leaving the root zone must be properly managed to avoid transferring the salinity and sodicity hazards from the soil to the groundwater indeed in the simulations dw was always more saline and more sodic than the associated irrigation water dw would continue to percolate deeper into the soil eventually reaching the aquifer this risk must be anticipated if ecd is higher than the ec of the aquifer although it might not be a problem in some dry areas where groundwater is deep and or already brackish vengosh 2014 alternatively dw can be captured by means of drainage systems and reused treated or disposed of disposal options such as pond evaporation discharge to the sea or deep well injection could be considered jiménez et al 2018 notwithstanding irrigation would at least reduce the volume of saline water that had to be disposed of compared to the original volume of pw therefore it would be cheaper to manage 4 5 limitations the carried out simulations are exploratory and limitations related to the model the method and the guidelines used in this study are acknowledged the saltirsoil m model does not simulate crop salt uptake therefore where this is significant it could overestimate the soil salinity although salt uptake is usually negligible compared to the salt load brought by irrigation water sugar beet salt uptake can reach more than 1 2 t ha of sodium and potassium annually cumo 2013 given that irrigation of sugar beet under dry sub humid climate requires 590 mm of water table 1 irrigation would bring between 0 15 to 118 t ha year of sodium and potassium respectively if pw1 and pw15 are used that is between 13 and 10 000 of the salt load that would be exported by the crop thus the salt load extracted from the soil solution would not significantly change the salt concentration of the worst case scenarios e g irrigation in a hyper arid climate with pw15 but would positively contribute to the sustainability of the simulated scenarios where the salt load brought by irrigation water was relatively low tolerance to salinity and optimum soil phe vary widely among crops consequently different crop threshold levels will also impact soil salinity and sodicity as well as crop yield the soil salinity and sodicity and crop yield patterns described in figs 1 and 6 would be different if another crop would have been chosen instead of sugar beet from an agricultural point of view the sustainability of irrigation with pw is mainly but not exclusively a salinity issue other constituents of concern such as metalloids exist in pw and their presence and concentrations depend on pw origin alley et al 2011 and treatment processes fakhru l razi et al 2009 on the one hand the high soil phe and the low som content of most soils in dryland limit the bioavailability of heavy metals but on the other hand high soil ece increases this risk singh et al 2009 although the risks linked to other components of pw are not as concerning as those related to salts they still deserve to be specifically assessed and included in potential guidelines or frameworks aiming to support pw reuse for irrigation although the saltirsoil m model has been calibrated and validated against field results in a dry region with slightly to moderately saline irrigation water visconti et al 2014 this has not yet been done for the environments simulated in this investigation therefore the model results should be used in the context of refining conceptual and mathematical models for future research based on a comparison of simulated and field results under specific environments this would also help to define the sensitivity of sustainability indicators e g ece sare ions contents phe and alkalinity of the soil solution to parameters and processes that are considered or not considered in the model and which in this case would require further characterisation and study 5 conclusions pw is generated continuously independent of climatic conditions and could be a useful water resource for irrigators in drylands for petroleum firms its reuse for irrigation is an alternative to conventional disposal practices which are environmentally risky increasingly regulated and costly depending on the soil and climate the low quality of pw particularly its high salinity and sodicity can degrade soil fertility and aquifers to varying degrees irrigation water quality and climatic aridity drive the balance of salt inputs and outputs of the system while the irrigation practice and soil type control the salt removal processes and leaching through drainage the main threat to the soil from irrigation with pw is sodification the risk of which largely depends on the clay content of the soil pw sodicity sarw and aridity if pw quality cannot be improved e g by blending with freshwater or desalination pw irrigation can only be used in the long term in environments that are less vulnerable to soil salinisation and sodification well drained soils with low water content at field capacity e g arenosol are less vulnerable to salinisation whilst a relatively high gypsum content gypsisol provides resistance against sodification on the contrary clayey soils with a high field capacity water content and a low gypsum content must be avoided as the soil structural stability as well as a tolerable soil electrical conductivity ece for the crop cannot be maintained on the long term simulations with a sugar beet crop in drylands demonstrated that crop yield could be adequate 50 of optimum and even improved by using pw with lower ec in well drained soils soil phe which also impacts crop yield through nutrient availability was not significantly affected by irrigation water quality since it largely depends on the natural soil caco3 co2 content finally drainage water quality is closely linked to the quality of pw but is also influenced by the soil type and aridity the impact of drainage water on the aquifer must be considered and measures such as drainage water reuse or disposal implemented accordingly for achieving sustainable irrigation with pw the modelling has demonstrated the importance of the clay and gypsum content of the soil and of climate aridity index to assess the suitability of produced waters for irrigation based on the simulation results irrigation with pw is likely to be sustainable on sandy soils if pw has an ec 28 ds m and a sar 36 loamy and gypsiferous soils can cope with pw with an ec 14 ds m and a sar 29 unless the climate is dry sub humid 0 50 ai 0 65 in this case pw with an ec as high as 28 ds m and a sar 83 can be used for long term irrigation of salt tolerant crops salinisation and sodification can be avoided in sandy clay loam soils if the pw has an ec 12 ds m and a sar 6 lastly clayey soils should not be irrigated with pw with an ec 2 ds m and a sar 10 except if the climate is dry sub humid or wetter where pw sar can be as high as 13 these thresholds values need to be confirmed through further field study and would only be adopted to manage pw through irrigation without targeting optimum crop yield on a sample of 474 pws collected worldwide about 6 8 of pws fall within the threshold values for the least vulnerable environments i e sandy soil and loamy gypsiferous soil in dry sub humid climate whereas only 2 of the pws corresponded to the required quality for irrigation on clayey soil echchelh et al 2018 future work should be carried out to explore how management practices such as over irrigation pw blending with freshwater pw desalination and gypsum amendments could help to improve irrigation sustainability with the pws that are too saline and or too sodic to be used in long term irrigation a complete sustainability assessment would also require an analysis of the impacts of other constituents of concern such as heavy metals and radioelements on soil crop and groundwater these studies could be synthesised in a sustainability assessment framework specifically designed for the oil and gas sector to encourage cooperation between the oil and gas industry and irrigators for sustainable reuse of pw in drylands acknowledgement

10908,this paper presents the development and application of a comprehensive methodology for the systematic water balance calculation in collective irrigation systems cis applicable to pressurized pipelines or open canals existing approaches focus solely on the assessment the water resources use efficiency of cis single components e g leakage in some canal reaches without a system wide approach a water balance approach allows accounting for the different system volume inputs i e water abstraction imported water water volume due to precipitation or surface runoff authorized and non authorized consumptions and water losses either in canal mixed or pressurized cis which has never been presented in literature the proposed methodology allows the assessment of different water loss components i e evaporation losses unauthorized uses metering errors leakage and discharges and the calculation of water loss performance indicators that allow the identification of the main problems in terms of water losses and provides guidance about measures to control water losses although based on the existing and consolidated water balance schemes specifically developed for urban water supply systems the proposed methodology includes novel components in terms of system input volume authorized consumption and water loss that are specific of cis the methodology is tested and applied to a mixed collective irrigation system results show that the water losses due to discharges in canal systems can be one of the most relevant component of the non revenue water representing approximately half of its total volume followed by leakage in canals and metering errors these results highlight the importance of improving daily operation of these systems and also rehabilitating ageing infrastructures keywords collective irrigation systems water balance water losses 1 introduction the agricultural sector is responsible for ca 70 of the freshwater consumed volume in the world molden 2007 as the world population grows food demand increases and a higher pressure is put on irrigated agriculture that despite representing only 20 of the total cultivated land contributes in 40 to the total food produced worldwide fao aquastat 2019 thus more water is required to meet food production requirements irrigation systems allow the compensation of the precipitation time and space irregularity being fundamental that these systems use water resources efficiently collective irrigation systems cis are infrastructures composed of a set of assets which assure the abstraction storage conveyance and distribution of water to the users water can be abstracted either from surface sources rivers and reservoirs or from groundwater wells the conveyance and distribution can be made either through canals or pressurized pipelines in terms of the delivery to irrigation users diversion structures also known as turnouts are typical of canal delivery and water meters of pressurized networks cis are usually managed by water users associations wuas who are responsible for system operation and for assuring an adequate level of service for the consumers as for the delivery methods the service can be classified as on demand scheduled or rotation depending on the system flexibility fao 2007 the latter is the most rigid method on which the system manager sets a delivery schedule obliging the users to use water in a specific time and during a limited period in systems operating under scheduled delivery users must specify the time and the volume of water they wish in advance us department of interior 1991 allowing the system manager to operate the system according to its needs a drawback of this concept is the low efficiency due to the higher water loss volumes caused by frequent canal flow control needs rijo 2010 on demand distribution is the most common method used in pressurized systems having only one constraint the flow that is physically imposed by the outlets characteristics rijo 2010 the canal systems are controlled by their delivery method and by the hydraulic structures used to control water levels fao 1975 canal check gate structures are flow control structures responsible for the regulation of the water level inside the canal being usually located near turnout structures to ensure the minimum hydraulic head irrigation canals usually operate at a flow rate that changes over time depending on water demand burt 1995 increasing the system operation complexity upstream water level control consists in controlling the water level upstream of each control structure while manually operated systems require numerous structures to be adjusted whenever the flow regime changes fao 2019 these systems tend to have higher water loss volumes not only due to canals leakage but also due to their manual operation which result in high discharge volumes burt 1995 intermediate reservoirs allow to store part of the excessive flows that otherwise would be lost in canal discharges and at the same time allow faster response times to water demand at downstream water losses in canals are highly dependent on the soil permeability canal lining depth of water and groundwater levels the soil plays a major role in canal leakage with recent studies demonstrating that soil compaction is also a critical aspect of seepage reduction alam and bhutta 2004 rates of canal seepage between 25 and 50 l m2 day have been generally accepted as reference values for canals that fulfil their undertakings montañés 2006 water consumption in canal systems can be measured by modules equipped with a stopwatch operation of these modules is done by the opening of certain slots according to the flow requests downstream these slots are designed to assure a certain flow as long as the water level upstream fits in a certain range as for the metering devices used in pressurized systems paddle wheel meters are usually installed due to their ability to allow suspended solids in the flow without damaging the equipment arregui et al 2006 in these meters an impeller on the upper part of the meter is responsible for measuring the flow integrating the velocity in the same upper part although differences between the average velocity inside the pipe and the one metered by the meter can be quite significant which diminishes the measuring performance of the paddle wheel meter when compared to meters with different operating principles arregui et al 2006 besides the factors mentioned above that can affect measurements upstream conditions also play a major role on the meter accuracy these meters are quite sensitive to perturbations of the velocity profile tests in laboratory show that the effects of a partially closed gate valve placed at a distance of three diameters at upstream can lead to very high under metering errors up to 30 arregui et al 2005 the performance of irrigation systems is dependent of on farm water use efficiency assets structural condition and manpower requirements for the system operation a different water balance approach from the one presented is commonly used by farmers to assess crop water demands and set up irrigation scheduling fao 2017 traditionally approaches to evaluating the performance of irrigation schemes are focused on gross production and efficient water use clemmens and molden 2007 in the past approaches were focused on ensuring an adequate supply to farms molden and gates 1990 these approaches assist irrigation managers to improve water delivery service to users but do not allow cross system comparisons bos 1997 recommends a set of performance indicators to be used in irrigation and drainage performance assessment these indicators aim to evaluate the level of service provided by covering not only a volumetric dimension but also evaluating sustainability and equity aspects bos and nugteren 1990 bos 1997 a more in depth analysis can be carried out to the conveyance system and the distribution network by evaluating respectively the supply efficiency i e the ratio between abstracted water volume and supplied volume to the distribution system and the distribution efficiency i e the ratio between water received by the distribution system and the water supplied to the users bos and nugteren 1990 in a broader scope molden et al 1998 define a set of indicators which relates outputs from irrigated agriculture to inputs water land and finance results allow an initial screening of systems performance in different environments molden et al 1998 although performance of irrigation schemes is site specific continual improvement through benchmarking allows comparison with future targets previous performances both internal or against similar organizations malano and burton 2001 in fact benchmarking is one of the most utilized tools to compare wuas at service delivery and resource uses levels malano and burton 2001 nevertheless a systematic and standardized approach to individually characterize every component of water used in conveyance and distribution systems in terms of consumption and water loss is lacking the water balance proposed by alegre et al 2006 for urban water supply systems has become a valuable tool to carry out the systematic assessment of water losses in water services alegre et al 2006 a reliable water balance allows utilities to carry out the diagnosis of their systems to establish tactical plans to reduce water losses to improve the infrastructure asset management and to continuously monitor the effectiveness of implemented measures actions the water balance developed for urban water supply systems cannot be directly applied to all collective irrigation systems since the latter can include not only pipes but large reservoirs and open canals that are subjected to different system input volumes and water losses e g evaporation canal discharges variation of reservoir storage although these different components are already evaluated by wuas an integrated approach on which systems are analyzed as a whole is still missing the current paper presents several innovative contributions to current knowledge the first is the development of a comprehensive water accounting methodology specific for collective irrigation systems grounded on the consolidated approach for urban water systems but including other assets such as canals and intermediate reservoirs the scope of application is the conveyance system and the distribution network up to the point of delivery to the consumers it does not involve reservoirs at the inlet of the system neither the farms irrigation systems the second novel contribution is the detailed description of methods for assessing different types of water losses e g evaporation losses metering errors leakage overflows and discharges and water input volumes e g canal inflows reservoirs volume variation that occur in these assets the third is the methodology demonstration using a real life case study with the assessment of the importance of each water loss component and guidance on measures to improve efficiency 2 methodology 2 1 novel water accounting method a comprehensive water accounting methodology specific for collective irrigation systems is proposed and described herein the first step is the definition of the irrigation system boundaries and the reference period the analyzed system should include all the conveyance and distribution infrastructures of water to farms and for which the water use efficiency aims to be improved the reference period for the water balance calculation in collective irrigation systems should correspond to the period in which the system is operated i e irrigation is performed therefore a reference period shorter than the irrigation seasons is not recommended due to gaps between readings of system input volumes and consumptions in farms the presented analysis is focused on fluxes of water that cross the defined boundaries during the period on which the system is operating it is substantially different from the typical water balance analysis performed fao 2017 since its boundaries and consequently its components are considerably different as it is shown in fig 1 the water balance boundaries do not include irrigation fields or catchments marked in grey rather only the conveyance and distribution network of irrigation systems up to the point of delivery to its users and to existing system discharges as a result the proposed water balance considers components that are different from the ones typically used since the system may include open canals and intermediate reservoirs new components should be considered when calculating the water balance the proposed water balance scheme specific for collective irrigation systems is presented in fig 2 the procedure for the water balance calculation is similar to the one carried out for urban water systems being composed of nine main steps as follows 1 estimate system input volume sub components i e abstracted water imported water precipitation runoff and intermediate reservoir contributions 2 calculate the revenue water summing the billed metered consumption and the billed unmetered consumption 3 calculate non revenue water by subtracting the revenue water 2 to the system input volume 1 4 estimate the unbilled authorized consumption and determine the authorized consumption 5 obtain the total water losses volume by subtracting the authorized consumption 4 to the system input volume 1 6 estimate evaporation losses in canal and intermediate reservoirs by the most appropriate method available 7 assess apparent losses components by the most appropriate methods available 8 estimate real losses by subtracting evaporation 6 and apparent losses 7 from total water losses 5 9 assess real loss components by best methods available and crosscheck with the real losses volume previously obtained in 8 the steps above might also be described as a top down approach on which the total value for the real losses components is estimated afterwards as described in step number 9 the water balance calculation follows a bottom up approach where real loss components should be assessed results obtained following these two approaches assist on closing the water balance with higher accuracy levels the system input volume sub components addressed are related with precipitation runoff and intermediate reservoirs storage with new authorized sub components i e minimum operational volume and canal related water loss components i e evaporation losses canal leakage and discharges also being covered it should be noted that a component related to the water inflow through canal linings is not considered herein since the hydraulic head is higher inside the canal this can be explained by the lower velocities registered in groundwater flows allowing the respective kinetic head to be neglected quintela 2010 if these inflows can be significant on the region where the water balance is to be applied further studies should be carried out in order to evaluate the associated flows some of these components that are assessed by wuas are mainly used for the daily operation of the system e g canal discharges however there is no assessment in a larger time scale i e irrigation season and with a system wide view of the different water components in the following sections new components of the proposed water balance for collective irrigation systems will be detailed and when necessary suggested methodologies to estimate each of them will be presented 2 2 system input volume due to precipitation in canals and intermediate reservoirs in open canals and intermediate reservoirs the precipitation that directly occurs on the surface area is included in the system s input volume precipitation data canal reaches and intermediate reservoir geometry as well as their geographic locations are required to estimate the input volume due to precipitation the calculation is carried out for each canal reach which is defined by the canal length between two consecutive water level control structures using data from the nearest weather station if the geographic information is not available the average value from existing weather stations should be used the total volume that entering the system due to direct precipitation is obtained by multiplying the precipitation head p m by the canal reservoir surface area a m2 although the canal width varies with the water level in canals with trapezoidal cross sections it is assumed that all the water that falls inside the canal slopes ends up reaching the flow being neglected water losses occurring in the canal slopes e g infiltration or evaporation therefore the canal surface area is the one that corresponds to the top width of the canal the same approach is applied for intermediate reservoirs considering the flooded area at the maximum storage level as the calculation area for the precipitated volume a typical canal cross section is presented in fig 3 2 3 system input volume due to surface runoff surface flows can also occur depending on the rainfall intensity and duration and on the soil characteristics if there are infrastructures that allow the inlet of these flows such as intermediate reservoirs or water streams their volumes should be calculated and included in the water balance when considering artificial canals it is admitted that the canal and the surface water drainage system which prevents runoff from getting into the canal are built side by side fig 3 the methodology used to estimate this component depends on available data in case these inflows are metered collected data should be used if very few information is available a lower bound for the runoff volume might be given for example by the revenue water during the time without any water collected from system sources on the other hand if in a particular part of the system the runoff is the only unknown variable a water balance can be calculated for the sub system to estimate this variable the runoff volume can also be estimated using a mathematical relationship between the volume of water precipitated in a specific basin and the volume of water stored inside the same basin this empirical relationship is often calculated to estimate inflows to the wua main reservoirs and can be used to estimate runoff volumes lastly another possible estimation for the runoff can be through a sequential water balance this method requires assessing a soil parameter which describes the soil water holding capacity therefore requiring a more in depth study of the basin 2 4 system input volume due to intermediate storage the water balance inside the reservoirs should be calculated to estimate intermediate reservoirs positive or negative contribution to the global balance of the irrigation system the reservoir volume variation is given by 1 δ v v i n v p v r u n o f f v o u t v e v a p v l e a k s v d where vin is the volume from the canal to the reservoir vp is the precipitated volume in the reservoir vrun off is the affluent runoff volume to the reservoir vout is the volume from the reservoir to the canal vevap is the evaporated volume in the reservoirs vleaks is the volume of leaks and vd is the volume of discharges from the reservoir a positive volume variation in the intermediate reservoir means that water has been accumulated in the reservoir therefore it contributes to system global input volume with a negative volume conversely a negative volume is associated with the reservoir water level decrease having this system input volume component a positive value 2 5 authorized consumption water consumption is divided into billed or unbilled and metered or unmetered components beyond water uses and consumptions that occur inside the system if the wua exports water to any other system the transferred volume should also be considered as authorized consumption the billed authorized consumption should be obtained from the wua s billing system taking into account metered and unmetered volumes delivered to irrigators or other customers e g industrial or urban this component is also known as revenue water it should be noted that customers supplied by the wua infrastructure should be considered authorized customers that have their intake infrastructure located outside the conveyance and distribution system e g customers that use water directly from catchments should not be considered for the water balance calculation at the beginning of the irrigation season before the system starts operating it is required to fill up the canal network to guarantee water to the users as in these canals the derivation from one canal to another or the delivery to the user is done by water intake structures it is required a certain water level at the water intake the water volume inside the canal required to reach the water intake is referred to as the minimum operational volume since this volume is usually discharged at the end of the irrigation season for the water balance purpose it is considered as authorized unbilled and unmetered consumption if stored for example in intermediate reservoirs the volume would be included in system input volume due to intermediate storage a schematic sketch of the minimum operation volume and the water levels involved in its determination is presented in fig 4 the calculation of this volume should be done for each canal reach with the required water level being given by the further downstream water intake level the downstream water depth for the minimum volume calculation hd min is given by 2 h d m i n h d h i n t a k e where hd is the water height downstream the reach m and hintake is the nominal hydraulic head of the water intake m upstream water depth for the minimum volume estimation hu min is calculated as follows 3 h u m i n h d o w n m i n l i where l is the canal reach length m and i is the canal reach slope m m knowing the total length of the canal reach and the cross section for each water depth aup min and adown min the minimum operation volume vmin is calculated as follows 4 v m i n a u m i n a d m i n 2 l where au min is the upstream cross section area m2 and ad min is the downstream cross section area m2 2 6 water loss components in the proposed water balance for cis the water loss components covered in the water balance for urban water supply systems are also considered i e apparent losses and real losses also new water losses components related to canal system and intermediate reservoirs should be taken into account the latter ones are divided into canal or intermediate reservoir leakage evaporation and discharges water losses components with special emphasis on components that should be estimated for canals and intermediate reservoirs are described in the current section when accounting for the water losses due to evaporation if open canals or intermediate reservoirs are part of the system estimations should be conducted similar to the precipitation estimations data from the weather stations i e precipitation records should be collected in order to estimate the evaporation volume if evaporation data is not available it is proposed to estimate evaporation using thornthwaite empirical formula 5 e t p 16 n m 10 t m i a a where nm is a correction factor according to the latitude and time of the year t m is the average monthly temperature c ia is the annual thermal index and a is a polynomial function of the index the reason why thornthwaite empirical formula is proposed in this methodology is due to its simplicity it only requires to know average monthly temperatures when compared to other empirical approaches that demand more data studies conducted in northeastern usa rosenberry et al 2007 and in southern portugal rodrigues 2009 concluded that when compared with the results obtained by the energy balance calculation thornthwaite formula provided valid evaporation estimates however when evaluating evaporation in other regions it is recommended to check the adequacy of this method evaporation volume is obtained by multiplying the estimated evaporation during the reference period by the water surface area in intermediate reservoirs flooded area records for each month of the reference period should be used to estimate evaporation volumes in case these are not available the area corresponding the full storage level should be considered however this can lead to an overestimation of the real area when estimating water surface areas for the canal network the most accurate estimation is obtained by calculating the water surface profile for each canal reach nevertheless this procedure is a demanding and time consuming thus more straightforward methods were analyzed in this study to estimate surface areas a sensitivity analysis between three considered hypotheses a b and c depicted in fig 5 was carried out in one reach of the conveyance system of the case study in order to assess which one returns an area estimation closer to the one of the water surface profile hypothesis a considers the water depth along the canal equal to the one at the downstream end hypothesis b considers the water depth along the canal equal to the one of the uniform equilibrium flow and hypothesis c considers the water depth varying linearly between the previous two depths results show a negative variation of the water surface area of 6 8 in comparison with the actual water level profile when assuming a constant water level equal to the water depth of the uniform equilibrium flow hu and a positive variation of 4 9 when a constant level equal to the water depth downstream hd is used in the proposed methodology the water depth at downstream hd is the one given by the water depth control structure and the one at upstream hu is the water depth of the uniform equilibrium flow also known as design water depth this hypothesis is the one that has the least deviation from the estimation of the water surface profile area the water surface profile was determined using the direct step method for the design discharge of the canal reach the comparison between the results of the water surface are estimations based on the three studied hypotheses is summarized in table 1 as for the apparent losses unauthorized uses and metering errors are two components also covered by the proposed water balance the water supply in open canal systems is usually performed by wua employees who are responsible for operating the flow control structures that deliver water to the users in this way there is direct control of the number of users reducing the chances of unauthorized uses either way when the user is collecting water directly from the canal or the distribution is carried out by a pressurized system unauthorized uses can still occur tampering or routing around the water meter are some examples of illegal uses that may happen the wua can perform periodic inspections in suspicious areas where illegal uses may be occurring but estimating the unauthorized uses components is a difficult task users whose consumption is fairly different from the water demand of a certain crop should be studied in order to understand such deviation to reduce the volumes associated with unauthorized uses consistent monitoring of the system should be carried out the other apparent loss component considered in the presented water balance is the metering errors this component accounts for the deviations between the metered volumes and the real volumes delivered to the user a variety of factors can be responsible for these deviations e g type of meter age installation conditions range of the metered flows vermersch et al 2016 when water consumption is metered in modules equipped with a stopwatch the metering results from the integration of the modules discharge coefficient during the registered opening time sediments lack of proper adjustment and erosion are some of the factors responsible for the change in the discharge coefficient of the modules jorabloo and sarkardeh 2010 therefore hydraulic performance of irrigation meters and modules should be assessed in order to evaluate the metering accuracy of these devices as for real losses similar to urban water supply systems leakage in mains and storage tanks as well as overflows should also be considered depending on the leakage control policy of the wua bursts can be identified allowing to estimate a volume of water lost in each event i e during the event and repair thornton et al 2008 due to the variety of conditions that one can encounter seepage tests should be carried out between the various methods used to estimate canal seepage ponding tests have been proved to be a method capable of producing results with a higher accuracy level alam and bhutta 2004 lastly a monitoring system should be installed in order to determine the canal discharges component in the water balance and subsequently data should be stored to be available for the water balance calculation measuring the canal discharges will not only allow to estimate the volumes discharged and increase the water balance reliability but also improve the system management if updated and timely data are provided to the system manager 3 application 3 1 case study description the proposed methodology is applied to a collective irrigation system in portugal a country where these infrastructures account for 35 of the total irrigated area dgadr 2014 and it is estimated that global water efficiency of these systems is below 65 apa 2012 this value that can in part be explained by their age and need of urgent rehabilitation interventions to reduce water loss dgadr 2014 the collective irrigation system aproveitamento hidroagrícola do vale do sorraia ahvs is located in tejo river basin and lies alongside sorraia river and two tributaries sôr and raia rivers the system conveyance is entirely in open canal the distribution is carried out by a mixed system composed of canals and pipes assuring the connection of the conveyance system with the users the total irrigated area is 16 351 ha in this irrigation system underflow gates amil are the canals water level control structures which guarantee the required level for the intake structures neyrpic modules the majority of users are farmers responsible for 98 of the billed authorized consumption with the remaining volume being consumed by two industries the distribution method implemented by the wua is a prior agreement method on which users must request water 24 h in advance so the utility manager operates the system to supply the flow rate at the requested time the primary water sources are maranhão montargil and magos reservoirs the water collected at maranhão reservoir is conveyed through raia stream until gameiro weir this weir was built to enable two pumping stations to raise water to two distributors located at higher terrain levels downstream gameiro weir is furadouro weir which was built to feed the artificial conveyance canal of the system at montargil reservoir the water collected is conveyed in an artificial canal that meets the main conveyance canal in santa justa junction right before the peso node where the main conveyance canal splits in two an intermediate reservoir was built this reservoir stores surpluses volumes reducing the discharged volume at downstream along the system water is collected from the water line and enters the system through pumping stations magos reservoir is a catchment decoupled from the main system that together with a pumping station supplies water to a smaller canal network a schematic representation of the system is presented in fig 6 the boundaries of the sub system later considered for runoff estimation using water balance calculation are also presented irrigation systems are highly dependent on precipitation not only from a water storage point of view but also because it is a key factor influencing water consumption of the users billed meter consumption and precipitation records from 2013 to 2017 are depicted in fig 7 since rice crop farmers are the largest water consumers in ahvs with an average consumption in the last five years of 11 220 m3 ha rice water consumption is separated from other crops consumption fig 7 shows the effect that precipitation changes have on the water demand by the users in years with higher precipitation billed metered consumption reaches lower values whereas when precipitation is scarce water demand increases this situation obliges wua to manage water storage and system operation more efficiently in order to prevent users from not having supplied water in quantity and in the time they need 3 2 water balance calculation the reference period for the water balance calculation was established based on the availability of the service to the users during the year 2017 the agricultural season started in march 2017 and lasted until october 2017 with the system operating during this period during this time the total water collected from the system sources reservoirs and pumping stations calculated being detailed according to the source in table 2 water volumes abstracted from reservoirs were metered unlike the abstracted volume from the river through pumping stations which result from estimations based on the nominal power and working time of each pump in order to calculate the total input volume due to precipitation data from the wua s weather stations was gathered and accumulated precipitation during the reference period was calculated for each weather station since there was no geographical information related to the canal reaches the average value of the accumulated precipitation in the six stations was adopted for the whole canal network for the weirs and the intermediate reservoirs accumulated precipitations from the nearest weather station to each structure were adopted since part of the conveyance system is a stream runoff volume estimations had to be conducted the basin that drains to the system is the one associated to raia stream located between maranhão reservoir and gameiro weir as a first approach the billed volume at the beginning of the irrigation season during a time without any reservoir input was obtained having enough data to estimate the runoff volume by the three other methods estimations were carried out and obtained results are presented in table 3 the estimated runoff volume obtained by calculating the sequential water balance returned a value 48 mm3 with a higher order of magnitude than the remaining methods this skewed estimation should be revised and a better assessment of the soil parameter should be done the estimations returned by the water balance 4 67 mm3 and the runoff precipitation relation 5 70 mm3 seem coherent converging to a value of the same order of magnitude both estimations are higher than the billed volume during the initial operation time 1 05 mm3 a value obtained when supply to crops downstream of furadouro section is ensured without any reservoir input that estimation can be seen as rough estimation given by the wua of the system input component to be estimated the method adopted for the runoff estimation in this system was the water balance given the fact that the required data were available and its calculation resulted from measured variables the sub system considered in the water balance for the runoff estimation is the one presented in fig 6 the subsystem input volumes were the abstracted volumes from maranhão reservoir and the runoff volume the revenue water and the water received by the canal constitute the authorized consumption causing the discharge in the weir to be the only water loss considered the supplied volumes by the wua to the users billed authorized consumption were obtained from the billing system of the wua since unbilled authorized consumption is not applicable in this system about 95 of this volume was metered and the rest obtained with estimations based on the irrigated area and type of crop subcomponents related with water exportation firefighting and wua uses were not considered during the reference period since the wua does not have any record the minimum operational volume was calculated for a conveyance canal reach and for a distribution canal reach that were considered as being representative of each system the estimated volume for the entire system is presented in table 4 the next step of the approach is the estimation of the water losses components as the collective irrigation system is mainly in open canal evaporation losses were estimated similar to the minimum operation volume calculation the evaporation estimation was carried out for the same two canals and then extrapolated for the whole network evaporation in the river part of the conveyance system was calculated considering an average surface width of 25 m and a total length of 32 6 km evaporation value considered was the average value recorded during the irrigation season between the wua s weather stations the estimation for the intermediate reservoir and the two weirs was done with the evaporation value registered in the nearest weather station of each structure results are presented in table 5 as the wua did not have information about any illegal consumption that may have occurred during the reference period estimation of this component was done taking into account the lower probabilities of these phenomena to happen when compared to urban water supply systems due to the presence of wua employees that guarantee a correct operation of the system employees are responsible to account for water requests ensure good metering performance and operate flow control structures leaving small room for unauthorized uses to happen as for the metering errors at this stage no meters were tested nevertheless the wua started to collect essential data that will help to select the meters to be submitted to metering error auditing tests this analysis was performed for meters installed in rice crops since it is the crop with the highest water consumption fig 7 the flow meter distribution according to their age for two metering diameter classes is presented in fig 8 age distribution allows identifying a set of ageing meters over than 12 years with high values of metered volumes this can cause changes in the performance characteristics of the meter highlighting to the need of assessing the accuracy of meters operating under these conditions and considering their substitution by new equipment considering that rice crops consumption can be characterized by a steady flow during the peak months of the irrigation season average flow rates in both diameter classes analyzed were obtained for each month results are presented in fig 9 as well as the metrological characteristics q1 and q2 of two models of water meters currently in use m1 and m2 as it is not possible to distinguish between dn80 and dn100 meters and since dn100 meters is the prevailing diameter the minimum flow q1 and the transitional flow q2 presented correspond to the ones from dn100 meters results show a distinct behavior between the two diameter classes during the peak consumption months june july and august it is noticeable a growing trend of the average flow in the lower diameter classes in contrast to the higher diameter class that shows a more stable behavior with a small decrease in the average volume towards the end of the irrigation season according to the wua this can be explained by an intermittent operation of the meters at the beginning of the rice irrigation process taking into account meter technical characteristics these average flow values fit between the minimum flow and the transitional in m2 model a range where metering errors by default tend to be higher further analysis should be carried out in order to assess the effect that these inaccuracies have on the apparent losses component network pipes leakage was estimated considering the reference value of real losses for urban distribution systems with poor service quality 5 m3 km day ersar and lnec 2013 the reason why a pessimistic value was considered is due to the age of the infrastructure concrete pipes have ca 60 years which is beyond their expectable technical operating life and several pipe bursts were reported by the wua covas et al 2018 given the age of the canal network some rehabilitation works have been carried out by the wua so that continuous system operation is guaranteed nowadays the canals condition suggests that the real losses may be over the values found in the bibliography in order to estimate a value for the leaks in these assets an inflow outflow study was carried out in a representative reach of canal the canal studied has an approximate length of 20 km and at the time all the canal gates were closed however amil gates are not entirely watertight allowing the flow of a small discharge at the canal head the registered inflow was 150 l s and since there were no flow meters at downstream the canal a value of 20 l s was adopted as the outflow based on in situ observations the estimated flow associated with water leakage through the canal is 130 l s which corresponds to 53 l m2 day water loss rate according to the canal geometrical characteristics later the wua carried out ponding tests in two canal reaches from the distribution network preliminary results alert to a key factor that affects canal water loss soil one of the canal reaches shows clear signs of deterioration reason why it was expected to have higher water loss rates than the other canal reach which is in better conditions however the more degraded canal is operating in clayey soils which may explain a lower water loss rate than the one expected further works are being planned in order to increase the canal leakage estimation the application of the proposed methodology for calculating the water balance in cis has shown to be a challenging task in which several methodologies are still being tested for estimating the new components the complete water balance for the 2017 irrigation season in ahvs is presented in fig 10 the non revenue water components are presented in detail in fig 11 real losses volume is responsible for the most significant share 70 results indicate that the wua actions should be focused on reducing the weight that real losses and apparent losses have on the system water balance ca 33 7 of total input volume when assessing real losses in a mixed system such as ahvs canal related components such as discharges and leakage should be considered canal discharges are estimated in 48 9 of the non revenue water which highlights the need to improve the estimation of this component and to reduce system operational losses leakage in canals cannot be neglected as this represents around 20 of the non revenue water in the analyzed irrigation system 4 conclusions a novel comprehensive methodology has been proposed and illustrated for the water balance calculation in irrigation systems this methodology can become an important performance evaluation tool for both canal and pressurized systems helping wua to achieve more efficient water management practices the water balance calculation allows to have a diagnosis of the system in terms of system input volume consumption billed and unbilled and water losses helping wuas to take improvement measures the water balance is also an essential tool to calculate a set of water loss indicators which will allow wuas to evaluate its performance over time and benchmarking different collective irrigation systems the systematic water balance calculation for every irrigation season allows to evaluate the impact of improvement measures that were taken inspired on the urban water balance principles the proposed water balance includes new components on the system input authorized consumption and water losses the methodology was tested for the first time in a wua highlighting the importance that real water losses have on the collective irrigation system hydrological modelling of the basin that contributes with runoff should be performed in order to validate the results obtained regarding metering errors in pressurized systems the water meters error should be assessed and in open canal systems the hydraulic performance of the modules responsible for the derivation of flow to the user should be evaluated as part of the forthcoming works the current work pointed out that some installed meters flow range does not match the range of water demand associated with rice crop demand this is caused by an inappropriate meter size selection results highlight to the need to rehabilitate the conveyance and distribution infrastructures as well as reducing canal discharges in the future more cis should be tested in order to consolidate the methodology and to improve canal leakage estimation the water energy balance scheme following the principles proposed by mamade et al 2017 for urban water supply systems is also being developed for

its total volume followed by leakage in canals and metering errors these results highlight the importance of improving daily operation of these systems and also rehabilitating ageing infrastructures keywords collective irrigation systems water balance water losses 1 introduction the agricultural sector is responsible for ca 70 of the freshwater consumed volume in the world molden 2007 as the world population grows food demand increases and a higher pressure is put on irrigated agriculture that despite representing only 20 of the total cultivated land contributes in 40 to the total food produced worldwide fao aquastat 2019 thus more water is required to meet food production requirements irrigation systems allow the compensation of the precipitation time and space irregularity being fundamental that these systems use water resources efficiently collective irrigation systems cis are infrastructures composed of a set of assets which assure the abstraction storage conveyance and distribution of water to the users water can be abstracted either from surface sources rivers and reservoirs or from groundwater wells the conveyance and distribution can be made either through canals or pressurized pipelines in terms of the delivery to irrigation users diversion structures also known as turnouts are typical of canal delivery and water meters of pressurized networks cis are usually managed by water users associations wuas who are responsible for system operation and for assuring an adequate level of service for the consumers as for the delivery methods the service can be classified as on demand scheduled or rotation depending on the system flexibility fao 2007 the latter is the most rigid method on which the system manager sets a delivery schedule obliging the users to use water in a specific time and during a limited period in systems operating under scheduled delivery users must specify the time and the volume of water they wish in advance us department of interior 1991 allowing the system manager to operate the system according to its needs a drawback of this concept is the low efficiency due to the higher water loss volumes caused by frequent canal flow control needs rijo 2010 on demand distribution is the most common method used in pressurized systems having only one constraint the flow that is physically imposed by the outlets characteristics rijo 2010 the canal systems are controlled by their delivery method and by the hydraulic structures used to control water levels fao 1975 canal check gate structures are flow control structures responsible for the regulation of the water level inside the canal being usually located near turnout structures to ensure the minimum hydraulic head irrigation canals usually operate at a flow rate that changes over time depending on water demand burt 1995 increasing the system operation complexity upstream water level control consists in controlling the water level upstream of each control structure while manually operated systems require numerous structures to be adjusted whenever the flow regime changes fao 2019 these systems tend to have higher water loss volumes not only due to canals leakage but also due to their manual operation which result in high discharge volumes burt 1995 intermediate reservoirs allow to store part of the excessive flows that otherwise would be lost in canal discharges and at the same time allow faster response times to water demand at downstream water losses in canals are highly dependent on the soil permeability canal lining depth of water and groundwater levels the soil plays a major role in canal leakage with recent studies demonstrating that soil compaction is also a critical aspect of seepage reduction alam and bhutta 2004 rates of canal seepage between 25 and 50 l m2 day have been generally accepted as reference values for canals that fulfil their undertakings montañés 2006 water consumption in canal systems can be measured by modules equipped with a stopwatch operation of these modules is done by the opening of certain slots according to the flow requests downstream these slots are designed to assure a certain flow as long as the water level upstream fits in a certain range as for the metering devices used in pressurized systems paddle wheel meters are usually installed due to their ability to allow suspended solids in the flow without damaging the equipment arregui et al 2006 in these meters an impeller on the upper part of the meter is responsible for measuring the flow integrating the velocity in the same upper part although differences between the average velocity inside the pipe and the one metered by the meter can be quite significant which diminishes the measuring performance of the paddle wheel meter when compared to meters with different operating principles arregui et al 2006 besides the factors mentioned above that can affect measurements upstream conditions also play a major role on the meter accuracy these meters are quite sensitive to perturbations of the velocity profile tests in laboratory show that the effects of a partially closed gate valve placed at a distance of three diameters at upstream can lead to very high under metering errors up to 30 arregui et al 2005 the performance of irrigation systems is dependent of on farm water use efficiency assets structural condition and manpower requirements for the system operation a different water balance approach from the one presented is commonly used by farmers to assess crop water demands and set up irrigation scheduling fao 2017 traditionally approaches to evaluating the performance of irrigation schemes are focused on gross production and efficient water use clemmens and molden 2007 in the past approaches were focused on ensuring an adequate supply to farms molden and gates 1990 these approaches assist irrigation managers to improve water delivery service to users but do not allow cross system comparisons bos 1997 recommends a set of performance indicators to be used in irrigation and drainage performance assessment these indicators aim to evaluate the level of service provided by covering not only a volumetric dimension but also evaluating sustainability and equity aspects bos and nugteren 1990 bos 1997 a more in depth analysis can be carried out to the conveyance system and the distribution network by evaluating respectively the supply efficiency i e the ratio between abstracted water volume and supplied volume to the distribution system and the distribution efficiency i e the ratio between water received by the distribution system and the water supplied to the users bos and nugteren 1990 in a broader scope molden et al 1998 define a set of indicators which relates outputs from irrigated agriculture to inputs water land and finance results allow an initial screening of systems performance in different environments molden et al 1998 although performance of irrigation schemes is site specific continual improvement through benchmarking allows comparison with future targets previous performances both internal or against similar organizations malano and burton 2001 in fact benchmarking is one of the most utilized tools to compare wuas at service delivery and resource uses levels malano and burton 2001 nevertheless a systematic and standardized approach to individually characterize every component of water used in conveyance and distribution systems in terms of consumption and water loss is lacking the water balance proposed by alegre et al 2006 for urban water supply systems has become a valuable tool to carry out the systematic assessment of water losses in water services alegre et al 2006 a reliable water balance allows utilities to carry out the diagnosis of their systems to establish tactical plans to reduce water losses to improve the infrastructure asset management and to continuously monitor the effectiveness of implemented measures actions the water balance developed for urban water supply systems cannot be directly applied to all collective irrigation systems since the latter can include not only pipes but large reservoirs and open canals that are subjected to different system input volumes and water losses e g evaporation canal discharges variation of reservoir storage although these different components are already evaluated by wuas an integrated approach on which systems are analyzed as a whole is still missing the current paper presents several innovative contributions to current knowledge the first is the development of a comprehensive water accounting methodology specific for collective irrigation systems grounded on the consolidated approach for urban water systems but including other assets such as canals and intermediate reservoirs the scope of application is the conveyance system and the distribution network up to the point of delivery to the consumers it does not involve reservoirs at the inlet of the system neither the farms irrigation systems the second novel contribution is the detailed description of methods for assessing different types of water losses e g evaporation losses metering errors leakage overflows and discharges and water input volumes e g canal inflows reservoirs volume variation that occur in these assets the third is the methodology demonstration using a real life case study with the assessment of the importance of each water loss component and guidance on measures to improve efficiency 2 methodology 2 1 novel water accounting method a comprehensive water accounting methodology specific for collective irrigation systems is proposed and described herein the first step is the definition of the irrigation system boundaries and the reference period the analyzed system should include all the conveyance and distribution infrastructures of water to farms and for which the water use efficiency aims to be improved the reference period for the water balance calculation in collective irrigation systems should correspond to the period in which the system is operated i e irrigation is performed therefore a reference period shorter than the irrigation seasons is not recommended due to gaps between readings of system input volumes and consumptions in farms the presented analysis is focused on fluxes of water that cross the defined boundaries during the period on which the system is operating it is substantially different from the typical water balance analysis performed fao 2017 since its boundaries and consequently its components are considerably different as it is shown in fig 1 the water balance boundaries do not include irrigation fields or catchments marked in grey rather only the conveyance and distribution network of irrigation systems up to the point of delivery to its users and to existing system discharges as a result the proposed water balance considers components that are different from the ones typically used since the system may include open canals and intermediate reservoirs new components should be considered when calculating the water balance the proposed water balance scheme specific for collective irrigation systems is presented in fig 2 the procedure for the water balance calculation is similar to the one carried out for urban water systems being composed of nine main steps as follows 1 estimate system input volume sub components i e abstracted water imported water precipitation runoff and intermediate reservoir contributions 2 calculate the revenue water summing the billed metered consumption and the billed unmetered consumption 3 calculate non revenue water by subtracting the revenue water 2 to the system input volume 1 4 estimate the unbilled authorized consumption and determine the authorized consumption 5 obtain the total water losses volume by subtracting the authorized consumption 4 to the system input volume 1 6 estimate evaporation losses in canal and intermediate reservoirs by the most appropriate method available 7 assess apparent losses components by the most appropriate methods available 8 estimate real losses by subtracting evaporation 6 and apparent losses 7 from total water losses 5 9 assess real loss components by best methods available and crosscheck with the real losses volume previously obtained in 8 the steps above might also be described as a top down approach on which the total value for the real losses components is estimated afterwards as described in step number 9 the water balance calculation follows a bottom up approach where real loss components should be assessed results obtained following these two approaches assist on closing the water balance with higher accuracy levels the system input volume sub components addressed are related with precipitation runoff and intermediate reservoirs storage with new authorized sub components i e minimum operational volume and canal related water loss components i e evaporation losses canal leakage and discharges also being covered it should be noted that a component related to the water inflow through canal linings is not considered herein since the hydraulic head is higher inside the canal this can be explained by the lower velocities registered in groundwater flows allowing the respective kinetic head to be neglected quintela 2010 if these inflows can be significant on the region where the water balance is to be applied further studies should be carried out in order to evaluate the associated flows some of these components that are assessed by wuas are mainly used for the daily operation of the system e g canal discharges however there is no assessment in a larger time scale i e irrigation season and with a system wide view of the different water components in the following sections new components of the proposed water balance for collective irrigation systems will be detailed and when necessary suggested methodologies to estimate each of them will be presented 2 2 system input volume due to precipitation in canals and intermediate reservoirs in open canals and intermediate reservoirs the precipitation that directly occurs on the surface area is included in the system s input volume precipitation data canal reaches and intermediate reservoir geometry as well as their geographic locations are required to estimate the input volume due to precipitation the calculation is carried out for each canal reach which is defined by the canal length between two consecutive water level control structures using data from the nearest weather station if the geographic information is not available the average value from existing weather stations should be used the total volume that entering the system due to direct precipitation is obtained by multiplying the precipitation head p m by the canal reservoir surface area a m2 although the canal width varies with the water level in canals with trapezoidal cross sections it is assumed that all the water that falls inside the canal slopes ends up reaching the flow being neglected water losses occurring in the canal slopes e g infiltration or evaporation therefore the canal surface area is the one that corresponds to the top width of the canal the same approach is applied for intermediate reservoirs considering the flooded area at the maximum storage level as the calculation area for the precipitated volume a typical canal cross section is presented in fig 3 2 3 system input volume due to surface runoff surface flows can also occur depending on the rainfall intensity and duration and on the soil characteristics if there are infrastructures that allow the inlet of these flows such as intermediate reservoirs or water streams their volumes should be calculated and included in the water balance when considering artificial canals it is admitted that the canal and the surface water drainage system which prevents runoff from getting into the canal are built side by side fig 3 the methodology used to estimate this component depends on available data in case these inflows are metered collected data should be used if very few information is available a lower bound for the runoff volume might be given for example by the revenue water during the time without any water collected from system sources on the other hand if in a particular part of the system the runoff is the only unknown variable a water balance can be calculated for the sub system to estimate this variable the runoff volume can also be estimated using a mathematical relationship between the volume of water precipitated in a specific basin and the volume of water stored inside the same basin this empirical relationship is often calculated to estimate inflows to the wua main reservoirs and can be used to estimate runoff volumes lastly another possible estimation for the runoff can be through a sequential water balance this method requires assessing a soil parameter which describes the soil water holding capacity therefore requiring a more in depth study of the basin 2 4 system input volume due to intermediate storage the water balance inside the reservoirs should be calculated to estimate intermediate reservoirs positive or negative contribution to the global balance of the irrigation system the reservoir volume variation is given by 1 δ v v i n v p v r u n o f f v o u t v e v a p v l e a k s v d where vin is the volume from the canal to the reservoir vp is the precipitated volume in the reservoir vrun off is the affluent runoff volume to the reservoir vout is the volume from the reservoir to the canal vevap is the evaporated volume in the reservoirs vleaks is the volume of leaks and vd is the volume of discharges from the reservoir a positive volume variation in the intermediate reservoir means that water has been accumulated in the reservoir therefore it contributes to system global input volume with a negative volume conversely a negative volume is associated with the reservoir water level decrease having this system input volume component a positive value 2 5 authorized consumption water consumption is divided into billed or unbilled and metered or unmetered components beyond water uses and consumptions that occur inside the system if the wua exports water to any other system the transferred volume should also be considered as authorized consumption the billed authorized consumption should be obtained from the wua s billing system taking into account metered and unmetered volumes delivered to irrigators or other customers e g industrial or urban this component is also known as revenue water it should be noted that customers supplied by the wua infrastructure should be considered authorized customers that have their intake infrastructure located outside the conveyance and distribution system e g customers that use water directly from catchments should not be considered for the water balance calculation at the beginning of the irrigation season before the system starts operating it is required to fill up the canal network to guarantee water to the users as in these canals the derivation from one canal to another or the delivery to the user is done by water intake structures it is required a certain water level at the water intake the water volume inside the canal required to reach the water intake is referred to as the minimum operational volume since this volume is usually discharged at the end of the irrigation season for the water balance purpose it is considered as authorized unbilled and unmetered consumption if stored for example in intermediate reservoirs the volume would be included in system input volume due to intermediate storage a schematic sketch of the minimum operation volume and the water levels involved in its determination is presented in fig 4 the calculation of this volume should be done for each canal reach with the required water level being given by the further downstream water intake level the downstream water depth for the minimum volume calculation hd min is given by 2 h d m i n h d h i n t a k e where hd is the water height downstream the reach m and hintake is the nominal hydraulic head of the water intake m upstream water depth for the minimum volume estimation hu min is calculated as follows 3 h u m i n h d o w n m i n l i where l is the canal reach length m and i is the canal reach slope m m knowing the total length of the canal reach and the cross section for each water depth aup min and adown min the minimum operation volume vmin is calculated as follows 4 v m i n a u m i n a d m i n 2 l where au min is the upstream cross section area m2 and ad min is the downstream cross section area m2 2 6 water loss components in the proposed water balance for cis the water loss components covered in the water balance for urban water supply systems are also considered i e apparent losses and real losses also new water losses components related to canal system and intermediate reservoirs should be taken into account the latter ones are divided into canal or intermediate reservoir leakage evaporation and discharges water losses components with special emphasis on components that should be estimated for canals and intermediate reservoirs are described in the current section when accounting for the water losses due to evaporation if open canals or intermediate reservoirs are part of the system estimations should be conducted similar to the precipitation estimations data from the weather stations i e precipitation records should be collected in order to estimate the evaporation volume if evaporation data is not available it is proposed to estimate evaporation using thornthwaite empirical formula 5 e t p 16 n m 10 t m i a a where nm is a correction factor according to the latitude and time of the year t m is the average monthly temperature c ia is the annual thermal index and a is a polynomial function of the index the reason why thornthwaite empirical formula is proposed in this methodology is due to its simplicity it only requires to know average monthly temperatures when compared to other empirical approaches that demand more data studies conducted in northeastern usa rosenberry et al 2007 and in southern portugal rodrigues 2009 concluded that when compared with the results obtained by the energy balance calculation thornthwaite formula provided valid evaporation estimates however when evaluating evaporation in other regions it is recommended to check the adequacy of this method evaporation volume is obtained by multiplying the estimated evaporation during the reference period by the water surface area in intermediate reservoirs flooded area records for each month of the reference period should be used to estimate evaporation volumes in case these are not available the area corresponding the full storage level should be considered however this can lead to an overestimation of the real area when estimating water surface areas for the canal network the most accurate estimation is obtained by calculating the water surface profile for each canal reach nevertheless this procedure is a demanding and time consuming thus more straightforward methods were analyzed in this study to estimate surface areas a sensitivity analysis between three considered hypotheses a b and c depicted in fig 5 was carried out in one reach of the conveyance system of the case study in order to assess which one returns an area estimation closer to the one of the water surface profile hypothesis a considers the water depth along the canal equal to the one at the downstream end hypothesis b considers the water depth along the canal equal to the one of the uniform equilibrium flow and hypothesis c considers the water depth varying linearly between the previous two depths results show a negative variation of the water surface area of 6 8 in comparison with the actual water level profile when assuming a constant water level equal to the water depth of the uniform equilibrium flow hu and a positive variation of 4 9 when a constant level equal to the water depth downstream hd is used in the proposed methodology the water depth at downstream hd is the one given by the water depth control structure and the one at upstream hu is the water depth of the uniform equilibrium flow also known as design water depth this hypothesis is the one that has the least deviation from the estimation of the water surface profile area the water surface profile was determined using the direct step method for the design discharge of the canal reach the comparison between the results of the water surface are estimations based on the three studied hypotheses is summarized in table 1 as for the apparent losses unauthorized uses and metering errors are two components also covered by the proposed water balance the water supply in open canal systems is usually performed by wua employees who are responsible for operating the flow control structures that deliver water to the users in this way there is direct control of the number of users reducing the chances of unauthorized uses either way when the user is collecting water directly from the canal or the distribution is carried out by a pressurized system unauthorized uses can still occur tampering or routing around the water meter are some examples of illegal uses that may happen the wua can perform periodic inspections in suspicious areas where illegal uses may be occurring but estimating the unauthorized uses components is a difficult task users whose consumption is fairly different from the water demand of a certain crop should be studied in order to understand such deviation to reduce the volumes associated with unauthorized uses consistent monitoring of the system should be carried out the other apparent loss component considered in the presented water balance is the metering errors this component accounts for the deviations between the metered volumes and the real volumes delivered to the user a variety of factors can be responsible for these deviations e g type of meter age installation conditions range of the metered flows vermersch et al 2016 when water consumption is metered in modules equipped with a stopwatch the metering results from the integration of the modules discharge coefficient during the registered opening time sediments lack of proper adjustment and erosion are some of the factors responsible for the change in the discharge coefficient of the modules jorabloo and sarkardeh 2010 therefore hydraulic performance of irrigation meters and modules should be assessed in order to evaluate the metering accuracy of these devices as for real losses similar to urban water supply systems leakage in mains and storage tanks as well as overflows should also be considered depending on the leakage control policy of the wua bursts can be identified allowing to estimate a volume of water lost in each event i e during the event and repair thornton et al 2008 due to the variety of conditions that one can encounter seepage tests should be carried out between the various methods used to estimate canal seepage ponding tests have been proved to be a method capable of producing results with a higher accuracy level alam and bhutta 2004 lastly a monitoring system should be installed in order to determine the canal discharges component in the water balance and subsequently data should be stored to be available for the water balance calculation measuring the canal discharges will not only allow to estimate the volumes discharged and increase the water balance reliability but also improve the system management if updated and timely data are provided to the system manager 3 application 3 1 case study description the proposed methodology is applied to a collective irrigation system in portugal a country where these infrastructures account for 35 of the total irrigated area dgadr 2014 and it is estimated that global water efficiency of these systems is below 65 apa 2012 this value that can in part be explained by their age and need of urgent rehabilitation interventions to reduce water loss dgadr 2014 the collective irrigation system aproveitamento hidroagrícola do vale do sorraia ahvs is located in tejo river basin and lies alongside sorraia river and two tributaries sôr and raia rivers the system conveyance is entirely in open canal the distribution is carried out by a mixed system composed of canals and pipes assuring the connection of the conveyance system with the users the total irrigated area is 16 351 ha in this irrigation system underflow gates amil are the canals water level control structures which guarantee the required level for the intake structures neyrpic modules the majority of users are farmers responsible for 98 of the billed authorized consumption with the remaining volume being consumed by two industries the distribution method implemented by the wua is a prior agreement method on which users must request water 24 h in advance so the utility manager operates the system to supply the flow rate at the requested time the primary water sources are maranhão montargil and magos reservoirs the water collected at maranhão reservoir is conveyed through raia stream until gameiro weir this weir was built to enable two pumping stations to raise water to two distributors located at higher terrain levels downstream gameiro weir is furadouro weir which was built to feed the artificial conveyance canal of the system at montargil reservoir the water collected is conveyed in an artificial canal that meets the main conveyance canal in santa justa junction right before the peso node where the main conveyance canal splits in two an intermediate reservoir was built this reservoir stores surpluses volumes reducing the discharged volume at downstream along the system water is collected from the water line and enters the system through pumping stations magos reservoir is a catchment decoupled from the main system that together with a pumping station supplies water to a smaller canal network a schematic representation of the system is presented in fig 6 the boundaries of the sub system later considered for runoff estimation using water balance calculation are also presented irrigation systems are highly dependent on precipitation not only from a water storage point of view but also because it is a key factor influencing water consumption of the users billed meter consumption and precipitation records from 2013 to 2017 are depicted in fig 7 since rice crop farmers are the largest water consumers in ahvs with an average consumption in the last five years of 11 220 m3 ha rice water consumption is separated from other crops consumption fig 7 shows the effect that precipitation changes have on the water demand by the users in years with higher precipitation billed metered consumption reaches lower values whereas when precipitation is scarce water demand increases this situation obliges wua to manage water storage and system operation more efficiently in order to prevent users from not having supplied water in quantity and in the time they need 3 2 water balance calculation the reference period for the water balance calculation was established based on the availability of the service to the users during the year 2017 the agricultural season started in march 2017 and lasted until october 2017 with the system operating during this period during this time the total water collected from the system sources reservoirs and pumping stations calculated being detailed according to the source in table 2 water volumes abstracted from reservoirs were metered unlike the abstracted volume from the river through pumping stations which result from estimations based on the nominal power and working time of each pump in order to calculate the total input volume due to precipitation data from the wua s weather stations was gathered and accumulated precipitation during the reference period was calculated for each weather station since there was no geographical information related to the canal reaches the average value of the accumulated precipitation in the six stations was adopted for the whole canal network for the weirs and the intermediate reservoirs accumulated precipitations from the nearest weather station to each structure were adopted since part of the conveyance system is a stream runoff volume estimations had to be conducted the basin that drains to the system is the one associated to raia stream located between maranhão reservoir and gameiro weir as a first approach the billed volume at the beginning of the irrigation season during a time without any reservoir input was obtained having enough data to estimate the runoff volume by the three other methods estimations were carried out and obtained results are presented in table 3 the estimated runoff volume obtained by calculating the sequential water balance returned a value 48 mm3 with a higher order of magnitude than the remaining methods this skewed estimation should be revised and a better assessment of the soil parameter should be done the estimations returned by the water balance 4 67 mm3 and the runoff precipitation relation 5 70 mm3 seem coherent converging to a value of the same order of magnitude both estimations are higher than the billed volume during the initial operation time 1 05 mm3 a value obtained when supply to crops downstream of furadouro section is ensured without any reservoir input that estimation can be seen as rough estimation given by the wua of the system input component to be estimated the method adopted for the runoff estimation in this system was the water balance given the fact that the required data were available and its calculation resulted from measured variables the sub system considered in the water balance for the runoff estimation is the one presented in fig 6 the subsystem input volumes were the abstracted volumes from maranhão reservoir and the runoff volume the revenue water and the water received by the canal constitute the authorized consumption causing the discharge in the weir to be the only water loss considered the supplied volumes by the wua to the users billed authorized consumption were obtained from the billing system of the wua since unbilled authorized consumption is not applicable in this system about 95 of this volume was metered and the rest obtained with estimations based on the irrigated area and type of crop subcomponents related with water exportation firefighting and wua uses were not considered during the reference period since the wua does not have any record the minimum operational volume was calculated for a conveyance canal reach and for a distribution canal reach that were considered as being representative of each system the estimated volume for the entire system is presented in table 4 the next step of the approach is the estimation of the water losses components as the collective irrigation system is mainly in open canal evaporation losses were estimated similar to the minimum operation volume calculation the evaporation estimation was carried out for the same two canals and then extrapolated for the whole network evaporation in the river part of the conveyance system was calculated considering an average surface width of 25 m and a total length of 32 6 km evaporation value considered was the average value recorded during the irrigation season between the wua s weather stations the estimation for the intermediate reservoir and the two weirs was done with the evaporation value registered in the nearest weather station of each structure results are presented in table 5 as the wua did not have information about any illegal consumption that may have occurred during the reference period estimation of this component was done taking into account the lower probabilities of these phenomena to happen when compared to urban water supply systems due to the presence of wua employees that guarantee a correct operation of the system employees are responsible to account for water requests ensure good metering performance and operate flow control structures leaving small room for unauthorized uses to happen as for the metering errors at this stage no meters were tested nevertheless the wua started to collect essential data that will help to select the meters to be submitted to metering error auditing tests this analysis was performed for meters installed in rice crops since it is the crop with the highest water consumption fig 7 the flow meter distribution according to their age for two metering diameter classes is presented in fig 8 age distribution allows identifying a set of ageing meters over than 12 years with high values of metered volumes this can cause changes in the performance characteristics of the meter highlighting to the need of assessing the accuracy of meters operating under these conditions and considering their substitution by new equipment considering that rice crops consumption can be characterized by a steady flow during the peak months of the irrigation season average flow rates in both diameter classes analyzed were obtained for each month results are presented in fig 9 as well as the metrological characteristics q1 and q2 of two models of water meters currently in use m1 and m2 as it is not possible to distinguish between dn80 and dn100 meters and since dn100 meters is the prevailing diameter the minimum flow q1 and the transitional flow q2 presented correspond to the ones from dn100 meters results show a distinct behavior between the two diameter classes during the peak consumption months june july and august it is noticeable a growing trend of the average flow in the lower diameter classes in contrast to the higher diameter class that shows a more stable behavior with a small decrease in the average volume towards the end of the irrigation season according to the wua this can be explained by an intermittent operation of the meters at the beginning of the rice irrigation process taking into account meter technical characteristics these average flow values fit between the minimum flow and the transitional in m2 model a range where metering errors by default tend to be higher further analysis should be carried out in order to assess the effect that these inaccuracies have on the apparent losses component network pipes leakage was estimated considering the reference value of real losses for urban distribution systems with poor service quality 5 m3 km day ersar and lnec 2013 the reason why a pessimistic value was considered is due to the age of the infrastructure concrete pipes have ca 60 years which is beyond their expectable technical operating life and several pipe bursts were reported by the wua covas et al 2018 given the age of the canal network some rehabilitation works have been carried out by the wua so that continuous system operation is guaranteed nowadays the canals condition suggests that the real losses may be over the values found in the bibliography in order to estimate a value for the leaks in these assets an inflow outflow study was carried out in a representative reach of canal the canal studied has an approximate length of 20 km and at the time all the canal gates were closed however amil gates are not entirely watertight allowing the flow of a small discharge at the canal head the registered inflow was 150 l s and since there were no flow meters at downstream the canal a value of 20 l s was adopted as the outflow based on in situ observations the estimated flow associated with water leakage through the canal is 130 l s which corresponds to 53 l m2 day water loss rate according to the canal geometrical characteristics later the wua carried out ponding tests in two canal reaches from the distribution network preliminary results alert to a key factor that affects canal water loss soil one of the canal reaches shows clear signs of deterioration reason why it was expected to have higher water loss rates than the other canal reach which is in better conditions however the more degraded canal is operating in clayey soils which may explain a lower water loss rate than the one expected further works are being planned in order to increase the canal leakage estimation the application of the proposed methodology for calculating the water balance in cis has shown to be a challenging task in which several methodologies are still being tested for estimating the new components the complete water balance for the 2017 irrigation season in ahvs is presented in fig 10 the non revenue water components are presented in detail in fig 11 real losses volume is responsible for the most significant share 70 results indicate that the wua actions should be focused on reducing the weight that real losses and apparent losses have on the system water balance ca 33 7 of total input volume when assessing real losses in a mixed system such as ahvs canal related components such as discharges and leakage should be considered canal discharges are estimated in 48 9 of the non revenue water which highlights the need to improve the estimation of this component and to reduce system operational losses leakage in canals cannot be neglected as this represents around 20 of the non revenue water in the analyzed irrigation system 4 conclusions a novel comprehensive methodology has been proposed and illustrated for the water balance calculation in irrigation systems this methodology can become an important performance evaluation tool for both canal and pressurized systems helping wua to achieve more efficient water management practices the water balance calculation allows to have a diagnosis of the system in terms of system input volume consumption billed and unbilled and water losses helping wuas to take improvement measures the water balance is also an essential tool to calculate a set of water loss indicators which will allow wuas to evaluate its performance over time and benchmarking different collective irrigation systems the systematic water balance calculation for every irrigation season allows to evaluate the impact of improvement measures that were taken inspired on the urban water balance principles the proposed water balance includes new components on the system input authorized consumption and water losses the methodology was tested for the first time in a wua highlighting the importance that real water losses have on the collective irrigation system hydrological modelling of the basin that contributes with runoff should be performed in order to validate the results obtained regarding metering errors in pressurized systems the water meters error should be assessed and in open canal systems the hydraulic performance of the modules responsible for the derivation of flow to the user should be evaluated as part of the forthcoming works the current work pointed out that some installed meters flow range does not match the range of water demand associated with rice crop demand this is caused by an inappropriate meter size selection results highlight to the need to rehabilitate the conveyance and distribution infrastructures as well as reducing canal discharges in the future more cis should be tested in order to consolidate the methodology and to improve canal leakage estimation the water energy balance scheme following the principles proposed by mamade et al 2017 for urban water supply systems is also being developed for

10909,the effectiveness of water saving irrigation strategies such as partial root zone drying prd should be explored to ensure food security as the availability of water for irrigation declines and population increases prd is easily performed by localized irrigation method however very small percentage of irrigated area is under this irrigation method and main irrigation method is furrow irrigation that should be adapted to prd in this respect present study was conducted to explore the effects of prd in furrow irrigation strategies on physiological and agronomic behavior of winter wheat the field experiment included two irrigation strategies variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi as prd and ordinary furrow irrigation ofi two different planting method in furrow planting and on ridge planting and three nitrogen rates 0 150 and 300 kg n ha 1 over 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 results showed that decreasing leaf water potential lwp during the stem elongation stage resulted in increasing the sensitivity of winter wheat to water stress and yield reduction the leaf photosynthesis rate an was not significantly lowered in vafi prd in comparison with that obtained in ofi the vafi strategy reduced the stomatal conductance gs about 12 and 7 in comparison with that obtained in ofi in the first and second year respectively that were statistically significant the lower slope of linear relationship between leaf transpiration efficiency an tr and vapor pressure deficit vpd in vafi strategy indicated that with increasing vpd leaf transpiration efficiency was higher than that obtained in ofi as a consequence vafi strategy as prd was effective in increasing an tr and can be an alternative irrigation management in winter wheat farms with limited water supplies although in furrow planting showed higher efficiency in increasing yield in comparison with that obtained in on ridge planting on ridge planting showed higher effects on leaf transpiration efficiency furthermore there was no significant difference between two application rates of nitrogen 150 kg n ha 1 and 300 kg n ha 1 for different parameters therefore application of 150 kg n ha 1 can be suggested as an effective rate to increase winter wheat yield consequently in areas with scarce water and furrow irrigation combination of vafi in furrow planting and 150 kg n ha 1 is recommended to achieve optimum yield with possibility of saving water during the winter wheat growing season keywords variable alternate furrow irrigation planting method leaf water potential leaf photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance leaf transpiration efficiency 1 introduction although water scarcity generally associated with arid and semiarid climates field and water resources management is essential to enhance the water productivity in all over the world in order to supply food for next generations deficit irrigation di is one of the strategies that scientists have been used to reduce water application with negligible effects on yield results showed that in comparison with di the variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi as an approach to partial root zone drying irrigation prd can decrease irrigation water without significant yield loss while it may improve the yield quality abdelraouf and ragab 2018 casa and rouphael 2014 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 ahmadi et al 2010 saeed et al 2008 kang et al 2000 the advantage of this strategy is that water uptake from the wet side of the root system maintain a favorable plant water status while part of the root system in drying soil can respond to the drying by sending a root sourced signal abscisic acid aba to the shoots where stomata opening may be inhibited by decreasing the stomata conductance gs so that water loss is reduced haworth et al 2018

different findings on the effects of aba concentration in root and shoot on stomata sensitivity some studies reported that xylem sap aba is a function of root aba as well as the flow rate of water from roots to shoots and aba can be a sensitive indicator in the shoot to show the effect of soil drying khalil and grace 1993 for sycamore whereas puértolas et al 2014 suggested that differences in root aba accumulation did not influence xylem aba concentration aba increases the stomatal sensitivity of c3 monocots as wheat in addition to lowering gs haworth et al 2018 prd works for crops with stomata that are sensitive to aba for example certain varieties of olive are insensitive to the aba signal derived from drying of one half of the root dbara et al 2016 however collins et al 2010 suggested that prd reduced vine water use by up to 50 at moderate vpd 3 kpa compared with control vines irrigated at the same level it also increased stomatal sensitivity to vpd and decreased sap flow although application of prd using drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation is more convenient and practical as studies conducted on maize by abdelraouf and ragab 2018 and tomato by hashem et al 2018 and casa and rouphael 2014 however globally around 86 of the irrigated area equipped with surface irrigation 11 is sprinkler irrigation and 3 is localized irrigation fao 2016 therefore it is essential to implement and explore the prd irrigation strategy in the surface irrigation method transpiration rate and leaf expansion are very sensitive to reduction in soil water deficit and water stress inhibits transpiration rate tr while photosynthesis rate an remains unchanged at mild stress sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 consequently water productivity can be improved without significant effect on photosynthesis and yield investigations on winter wheat jia et al 2014 li et al 2011 sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 potato ahmadi et al 2010 and safflower shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2016 showed that vafi improved water productivity additional effective way to improve more water saving along with prd is use of appropriate planting patterns in furrow planting has reported as an effective strategy in water saving and increasing yield due to higher soil water and winter soil temperature yarami and sepaskhah 2015b shabani et al 2013b in addition in furrow planting has recognized as an appropriate strategy by many investigations in order to increase leaf area index lai crop height yield dry matter photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance for different crops mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 yarami and sepaskhah 2015a jia et al 2014 wang et al 2014 in addition nitrogen is another important factor that affected on physiologic and agronomic parameters of crops shangguan et al 2000 suggested that under well watered conditions an and gs of winter wheat were increased in the high n rate 15 mm no 3 in irrigation water in comparison with that obtained in the low n rate 1 5 mm no 3 in irrigation water although its effect on an and gs was not identical under different water status an and gs both decreased in water stress conditions while the reaction to water stress was different between high and low nitrogen application rates alternatively tranavičiené et al 2008 mentioned that nitrogen was not the only affecting factor and changeable environmental condition in different years can suspend or accelerate the decline in photosynthesis and reduce the grain yield water and n supply often showed interaction with each other wu et al 2008a pandey et al 2001 frederick and camberato 1995 n supply under non water limiting conditions can result in full yield potential but under water limiting conditions n may increase the severity of drought stress frederick and camberato 1995 that results in reducing yield and economic return besides the interaction effects occurred between n application and soil water deficit on photosynthesis and transpiration wu et al 2008b otoo et al 1989 regarding to various responses of nitrogen and other restrictive factors on physiologic and agronomic parameters this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different irrigation strategies including ordinary furrow irrigation ofi and variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi as prd planting methods on ridge planting orp and in furrow planting ifp and n application rates on some agronomic physiologic and gas exchange parameters of winter wheat triticum aestivam that was grown in a semi arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a set of 36 water balance lysimiters was used in this study for two years 2015 2016 in a semi arid region these lysimeters were installed in the experimental research station of the agricultural college shiraz university shiraz iran location of the station is 29 56 n latitude 52 02 e longitude and 1810 m m s l the lysimeters dimension were 1 5 m 1 5 m 1 1 m there was a 0 9 m soil layer clay loam in the lysimeters with field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 and wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 the properties of soil and irrigation water are shown in table 1 physical properties of the soil were taken from the study of barzegari et al 2017 the variation in climatic data that were measured in a station near the site in two years are figured fig 1 annual rainfall of 282 mm and 378 mm occurred in late fall and winter in the first year and winter in the second year respectively wheat local pishtaz cultivar was seeded on october 29th and november 6th 2015 and 2016 respectively in lysimeters the well water with electrical conductivity ec of 0 72 ds m 1 was used for irrigation water the drainage water was conducted to the individual sump and collected in containers four ridges 0 5 m spacing and three furrows manually constructed in each lysimeter phosphorous fertilizer was applied as triple superphosphate at rate of 150 kg ha 1 46 p2o5 and mixed with the soil surface layer at the time of soil preparation nitrogen fertilizer was applied as urea 46 n at two times along with irrigation water at planting and beginning the stem elongation wheat seeding rate was 250 kg ha 1 in 6 rows in the furrows and on the ridges the distance between two rows in each furrow or on ridge was 0 15 m the spacing between two rows in consecutive furrow or ridge was 0 35 m the experiment was conducted in a split split plot design with randomized complete blocks with three replications interaction effects of three factors were investigated in this study these factors were irrigation strategies as main plot planting method and nitrogen fertilizer rates as sub plot and sub sub plots respectively two different irrigation treatments were full irrigation by ordinary furrow ofi and partial root drying irrigation prd as variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi on ridge planting orp and in furrow planting ifp were used as different planting methods nitrogen fertilizer treatments were n0 0 n1 150 and n2 300 kg n ha 1 2 2 irrigation requirement soil water content before irrigation event was used to determine the crop irrigation requirement an access tube of neutron meter was installed in the middle furrow soil water content was measured at three depths of 0 3 m 0 6 m and 0 9 m with neutron scattering method in the access tubes in addition soil water content at the depth of 0 0 1 m of surface soil was measured by the gravimetric method the irrigation water was considered by raising the soil water in the lysimeter to the field capacity and it was calculated by the following equation 1 d i 1 n θ f c i θ i δ z i where d is the irrigation water depth m i is the soil layer number n is the total number of soil layers θ f c i and θ i are the volumetric soil water content at field capacity and before the irrigation event m3 m 3 respectively and δ z i is the soil layer thickness m the irrigation application efficiency of 70 was used to convert the irrigation water to gross irrigation water for the first irrigation all lysimeters were irrigated with ofi method to provide uniform seed germination and plant stands the amount of applied water in the first irrigation was about 27 mm in the first year about 77 mm of rainfall occurred during the week after sowing and 111 mm in the second year crop water requirement was generally provided by precipitation till march in the first year afterward the irrigation treatments were started however in the second year due to lack of adequate rainfall after sowing second irrigation event 80 mm was applied in ofi the gross irrigation water was applied with 10 days irrigation interval in all irrigation furrows in ofi the amount of applied irrigation water in each irrigation event for vafi was 2 3 of that applied in ofi and it was applied in the furrows which were dry in the preceding irrigation cycle 2 3 crop parameters measurement since the leaf area varies among cultivation sowing density and nitrogen rate in winter wheat bavec et al 2007 it was measured during the growing season to investigate the effects of different treatments on wheat growth in different growth stages one plant was detached from the field and the leaf length l and width w were measured by ruler and the leaves area were measured by an area meter a relationship between the measured leaf area and multiplication of l w was determined as follows 2 a c k 1 n l i w i where a is the total area of crop leaves l i leaf length w i leaf width and c equation coefficient in order to obtain leaf area index lai one plant was specified in each lysimeter and its leaf length l and width w was measured during the growing season at first a linear relation was obtained between total leaf area of a plant and multiplication of l w by regression analysis eq 3 then plant leaf area was determined using this equation during the growing season 3 a 0 6915 l i w i r 2 0 999 n 130 s e 7 75 p 0 0001 the measured leaf length and width were used in eq 3 to determine the plant leaf area then the plant leaf area was divided by the devoted area of each plant to calculate the lai lai was measured monthly until the breaking dormancy and every two weeks to the end of growing season within each lysimeter one fully expanded leaf from the top of the plant was chosen for measuring the gas exchange parameters these parameters were net photosynthesis rate an stomatal conductance gs and leaf transpiration rate tr that were measured using lci analyzer adc bioscientific ltd on different days the measurements were made under periods of fair weather condition in order to measure leaf water potential lwp one fresh leaf from the top of the plant was selected in each lysimeter during different growth stages early stem elongation stem elongation booting heading in the first year and during the early stem elongation stem elongation early heading early flowering and end of flowering in the second year in the midday around 11 a m 1 pm and lwp was measured using pressure bomb pms instrument company model 1000 pressure chamber instrument furthermore growing degree days gdd was calculated by following equation mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 4 g d d 0 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b i f t a v e t b t a v e t b i f t a v e t u t t a v e t u t where t m a x and t m i n are the maximum and minimum air temperature in c respectively t b is the crop base temperature and it was considered as zero for winter wheat and t u t is the upper temperature threshold that was considered as 25 c for wheat mcmaster and smika 1988 2 4 statistical analysis the interaction effects between irrigation method planting method and nitrogen application rate were evaluated by using analysis of variance anova and means were compared by duncan s multiple range tests at 5 level of probability the statistical analyses were carried out by mstatc software 3 results and discussion 3 1 water application with regard to table 2 in furrow planting reduced the applied water in comparison with that obtained in on ridge planting about 10 15 in 300 kg n ha 1 application rate in the first and second year respectively therefore in furrow planting reduced the surface evaporation and preserved soil water in the root zone especially in higher n fertilizer rates consequently less water applied to in furrow planting compared with that applied in on ridge planting application of higher nitrogen rate also increased the applied water in different irrigation regimes in general application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased the applied water about 26 33 in on ridge planting and 18 20 in in furrow planting compared with that obtained in 0 n application these increases were about 52 66 in on ridge planting and 37 40 in in furrow planting in 300 kg n ha 1 compared with that obtained in 0 n application soil water content was measured in the middle furrow ofi and vafi and side furrow in vafi strategy during two growing seasons and results are presented in fig 2 soil water content was almost the same in two irrigation methods at the early season due to rainfall occurrence then it showed differences after irrigation treatment initiation and applying vafi strategy soil water content differed in two different furrows in vafi strategy due to applying irrigation in different furrows in every irrigation cycle generally soil water content in vafi strategy was lower than that obtained in ofi strategy due to applying lower amount of irrigation water 3 2 leaf area index the leaf area index was figured to days after planting and gdd for different treatments during the growing season in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 although it has been presented as a function of gdd fig 3 the lai reached its maximum 176 and 167 days after planting in the first and second year respectively the corresponding gdd was about 1261 c and 1441 c at maximum lai laimax for the first and second year respectively although the growing season in the first year was longer than that in the second year this reduction of gdd resulted from inappropriate weather condition and spring cold in the first year that also resulted in less lai and yield tables 2 and 3 besides a relationship between laimax and irrigation water depth was determined by following equation 5 l a i m a x 0 009 i r r 0 96 r 2 0 47 n 24 s e 1 85 p 0 0002 where l a i m a x and i r r are the maximum lai and irrigation water depth mm respectively eq 5 showed that by 107 mm of irrigation water depth threshold the laimax started to increase from zero and reached 10 at irrigation water application of 1004 mm the threshold indicated that some portion of the irrigation water lost by deep percolation and surface evaporation regarding table 2 the laimax reached its highest value as 9 93 and 10 13 and the lowest values as 1 74 and 2 8 in the first and second year respectively as for laimax bavec et al 2007 reported 1 0 7 5 for an especial variety among control and 120 kg n ha 1 treatments with 600 seeds m 2 same seed density in this study the maximum values of lai belonged to on ridge planting in ofi and 300 kg n ha 1 and minimum values were observed in in furrow planting with ofi and no n application rate n0 in both years decrease in irrigation water reduced lai azizian and sepaskhah 2014a zhang et al 2009 as it is observed in table 2 ofi enhanced laimax compared with that obtained in vafi strategy although this increase is not statistically significant with an exception in the first year n2p1 on the other hand laimax was lower in the in furrow planting with ofi in comparison with that obtained in on ridge planting for all nitrogen application rates in two consecutive years in contrast lai value in in furrow planting with vafi increased compared with that obtained in on ridge planting these results are in contradiction to those obtained by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower increasing in laimax value in on ridge planting with ofi can be related to higher tilering in this treatment compared with that obtained in in furrow planting however better conditions for plant growth may be provided by in furrow planting due to higher soil water and temperature shabani et al 2013b yarami and sepaskhah 2015b in vafi treatments and resulted in higher laimax table 2 moreover application of nitrogen increased laimax in comparison with that obtained in no n application table 2 compared with no n application rate application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased laimax as 55 and 100 in the first and second year respectively similarly application of 300 kg n ha 1 increased laimax about 200 and 143 in the first and second year respectively that was similar to the results reported by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower higher values of lai are rooted in larger leaf area and more tillering compared with that obtained in non fertilized plants there is no significant interaction between irrigation strategies and planting methods or nitrogen rates table 2 on laimax the only factor affecting on laimax was nitrogen rate p 0 05 results indicated that application of 300 kg n ha 1 caused a significant increase in laimax compared with that obtained in no n application and 150 kg n ha 1 however there is no significant difference in application of 150 kg n ha 1 on laimax compared with that obtained in 300 kg n ha 1 in general application of 150 kg n ha 1 had the optimum laimax with no significant difference in crop yield in comparison with that obtained in application of 300 kg n ha 1 3 3 leaf water potential fig 4 illustrates the leaf water potential lwp during the growing season for different treatments in two years it is shown that lwp in the 2015 2016 was lower than that in 2016 2017 the higher value of lwp in the second year was accounted due to about 183 mm rainfall during 17 days before the first measurement of lwp this difference in lwp between two years affected yield and showed the sensitivity of winter wheat to water stress during the stem elongation stage overall leaf water potential decreased during growing season due to increase in air temperature fig 1 the relationship between grain yield and lwp in different growth stages was figured fig 5 for two different planting methods since the relationship between grain yield and lwp in flowering stage was not significant it was not shown the relationship between yield and lwp showed that with decreasing in lwp yield reduced with a non linear relationship in both planting methods however reduction in grain yield in in furrow planting was more severe than that obtained in on ridge planting since prd may have no function in this case due to the fact that both sides of the crop root irrigated in each irrigation event but with longer irrigation interval therefore vafi with on ridge planting is considered as prd strategy that is effective in decreasing the reduction of grain yield by decreasing lwp besides a simple linear relationship was obtained between the net photosynthesis rate an and lwp fig 6 as follows 6 a n 5 09 l w r 23 58 r 2 0 35 n 72 s e 3 02 p 0 01 results indicated that with decreasing the leaf water potential photosynthetic rate decreased linearly therefore soil water condition and leaf water condition has a direct role on net photosynthetic rate during the growing season 3 4 net photosynthesis rate an according to fig 7 a net photosynthesis rate was measured for different growth stages in two years although an was not measured because of cloudy weather during the flowering stage and stem elongation in the first and second year respectively furthermore it should be noticed that about two weeks after the first measurement the second part of nitrogen 50 was applied to the field besides it should be mentioned that vafi strategy was not applied during the stem elongation because of enough rainfall occurrence at this time in the second year results indicated that none of the irrigation strategies planting methods and n application rates showed significant difference in net photosynthesis rate of winter wheat p 0 05 hashem et al 2018 reported that prd irrigation did not affect net photosynthesis rate of tomato compared with that obtained in full irrigation although prd decreased the stomatal conductance the an values varied between 5 48 23 1 μmol m 2 s 1 and 6 91 19 7 μmol m 2 s 1 for different treatments and growth stages in the first and second year respectively highest value of an was obtained during the stem elongation after applying the second part of nitrogen fertilizer in the first year that was in accordance with the results reported by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 and kazemeini et al 2015 for safflower and shabani et al 2013a for rapeseed however net photosynthesis rate started to decrease after stem elongation stage and gradually continued until end of growing season although during the booting an decreased sharply in the first year because of spring cold and it increased again as the weather condition improved it is observed fig 7a that an decreased much more in ofi compared with that obtained in vafi strategy and indicated that vafi strategy increased plant tolerance against the spring cold the photosynthesis rate was reduced gradually after heading during the winter wheat growing season due to increase in air temperature higher that for optimum photosynthesis rate as other studies suggested for safflower and rapeseed shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 kazemeini et al 2015 shabani et al 2013a the an had the highest values in stem elongation stage 3 5 stomatal conductance gs the stomatal conductance gs of winter wheat varied between 0 08 to 0 57 mol m 2 s 1 in the first year and 0 09 to 0 51 mol m 2 s 1 in the second year fig 7b the vafi strategy prd reduced gs values about 12 and 7 in comparison with that obtained in ofi in the first and second year respectively that were not significant showing that this strategy can be used effectively in saving water instead of ofi likewise shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 and azizian and sepaskhah 2014b reported a reduction of about 24 and 43 in gs for safflower with vafi strategy and maize with deficit irrigation di respectively that shows winter wheat is more tolerant to water stress than safflower and maize as previously stated stomatal conductance decreased sharply during booting stage because of spring cold in the first year and vafi strategy prd showed higher gs in this stage fig 7b in response to water stress stomata closure generally occurs due to atmospheric vapor pressure along with root generated chemical signals like producing stress hormone abscisic acid ashraf and harris 2013 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 as an illustration hashem et al 2018 reported that the values of the abscisic acid aba contents were higher under prd and regular deficit irrigation than that obtained in full irrigation since stomata closure have more inhibitory effect on transpiration than that on co2 diffusion into the leaf tissues ashraf and harris 2013 it was not seen any significant difference in an in this study consequently prd can be used as a proper strategy with mild stress in field irrigation management application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased stomatal conductance of winter wheat about 2 8 and 28 4 compared with that obtained in no n application rate in the first and second year respectively higher application rate of nitrogen 300 kg n ha 1 enhanced the gs values around 18 8 and 8 6 in comparison with that obtained in 150 kg n ha 1 in the first and second year respectively high n supply lead to a less carbon loss compared with that under a low n supply besides n deficiency can decrease the stomatal aperture by increasing their sensitivity to endogenous abscisic acid sun et al 2016 3 6 leaf transpiration rate tr the transpiration rate of winter wheat leaf varied between 2 84 to 10 05 mmol m 2 s 1 in the first year and 2 89 to 7 92 mmol m 2 s 1 in the second fig 8 a the vafi strategy prd reduced tr values in most of treatments about 6 and 14 in the first and second year respectively this reduction can be linked to decreasing the gs as stated before and its affection on transpiration rate shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 suggested that vafi decreased transpiration rate about 27 for safflower in comparison with that obtained in ofi although it was not significant as well application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased leaf transpiration rate of winter wheat about 5 and 14 compared with that obtained in no n application rate in the first and second year respectively application of 300 kg n ha 1 enhanced the tr values about 10 and 3 in comparison with that obtained in 150 kg n ha 1 in the first and second year respectively overall n application rates and planting methods did not show any specific influences on leaf transpiration rate in various growth stages leaf transpiration rate variation was similar to net photosynthesis rate during the growing season for different crop growth stages 3 7 leaf transpiration efficiency an tr fig 8b shows the variation of leaf transpiration efficiency in different irrigation strategies in both years the vafi strategy prd showed higher an tr in comparison with that obtained in ofi without any significant decrease in photosynthesis rate for different n application rates however there was a significant difference in an tr between no n application rate n0 with vafi strategy and other n application rates although the difference between ofi and vafi strategies was not significant for most of the treatments during growth stages the leaf transpiration efficiency showed efficient water use in vafi strategy similar findings are also reported for potato by ahmadi et al 2010 and liu et al 2005 3 8 relationship between an and gs since the relationship between an and gs was recognized as a drought adaptation index chaves 1991 linear relationship between the an and gs was determined for different growth stages in two years fig 9 like that was found for safflower by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 maize by azizian and sepaskhah 2014b and saffron by yarami and sepaskhah 2015a fig 7a and b showed the linear relationship between an and gs in different growth stages in the first and second year respectively with regard to fair weather requirement for measuring the photosynthesis rate it could not be measured in some growth stages for both years flowering in the first year and stem elongation and booting in the second year regarding with fig 9a the slope of fitted line in booting stage was high that showed spring cold made net photosynthesis rate very sensitive and with a slight decline in gs photosynthesis rate decreased remarkably however higher slope s 27 89 p 0 005 belonged to the relationship between an and gs during the end of flowering in the second year fig 9b and it showed that net photosynthesis rate was more sensitive to closing the stomatal in this growth stage fig 9c illustrated the relationship between net photosynthesis rate and gs for all growth stages together in two years a power relationship was fitted to the relationship between an and gs during the growing season fig 9c besides in order to find out the effects of irrigation strategies planting methods and nitrogen rate on the relationship between an and gs in winter wheat it was determined for each treatment separately table 4 the slope of fitted lines in vafi strategy prd is lower than that obtained in ofi and indicated when gs decreases under prd conditions the an values are reduced with lower rates therefore this strategy was efficient in water use reduction and winter wheat showed adaptation with this strategy against water stress this finding agrees with study of shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower in prd condition however the slopes of linear relationship in various planting methods were close to each other therefore drought adaptation was not varied by different planting methods that is consistent with the finding of shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower and yarami and sepaskhah 2015a for saffron the slopes of linear relationship for different n fertilization rates in the first year indicated that non fertilized plants were more sensitive to water deficits in contrast to that found in the second year finding of shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 showed that fertilized plant was more sensitive to water stress this difference can be due to occurrence of spring cold along with the water stress in the first year and it increased the sensitivity of the photosynthesis rate in plants with lower n rate to water shortage on the other hand application of 300 kg n ha 1 was more vulnerable to water shortage in the second year that maybe due to having larger canopy and higher water requirement in this treatment shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 3 9 relationship between air vapor pressure deficit vpd and gas exchange parameters in order to discover the effect of irrigation strategy on water stress adaptation the relationship between gas exchange parameters and vpd was illustrated figs 10 and 11 for two different planting methods and irrigation strategies the slope of the linear relationship between an and vpd in two irrigation strategies table 5 showed that vafi prd with on ridge planting slightly decreased an vs vpd indicating that vafi prd is an efficient strategy to water stress adaptation however vafi strategy with in furrow planting did not show any difference in comparison with ofi strategy regarding fig 10c f increasing vpd affected much more the gs and tr than an with increasing vpd during the growing season gs and tr increased although the slope of the line revealed that transpiration rate and gs had a slight rise in vafi prd with on ridge planting compared with that obtained in ofi and vafi with in furrow planting the slope of the line in fig 11a d revealed that the rate of intrinsic water use efficiency an gs and leaf transpiration efficiency an tr decreased with increase in vpd due to increasing the gs and tr during the growing season intrinsic water use efficiency and leaf transpiration efficiency in vafi prd was higher than that obtained in ofi and the slope of linear relationship was lower 14 9 and 0 5 in an gs and an tr respectively in vafi prd with on ridge planting and in furrow planting respectively in comparison with those obtained in ofi 27 06 and 0 85 in an gs and an tr respectively with on ridge planting and in furrow planting these results indicated the possibility of plant water stress adaptation in prd strategy without much effect on the leaf transpiration efficiency reduction ahmadi et al 2010 4 conclusions it was concluded that decreasing lwp during the stem elongation stage resulted in yield reduction due to extreme sensitivity of winter wheat to water stress during this growth stage the values of an and gs were not significantly reduced in vafi prd in comparison with that obtained in ofi although the reduction in gs was higher than an which saved 30 irrigation water with a slight reduction in grain yield the slope of fitted lines in vafi prd strategy in comparison with that obtained in ofi indicated that when gs decreases under water shortage conditions the an values are reduced with lower rates therefore vafi prd strategy is efficient and winter wheat can show adaptation with this strategy against water stress the lower slope of linear relationship between an tr and vpd in vafi prd strategy indicated that with increasing vpd leaf transpiration efficiency decreased in vafi prd with lower rate than that obtained in ofi as a consequence vafi prd strategy can be an alternative irrigation management in winter wheat farms with limited water supplies although in furrow planting showed higher efficiency in increasing yield in comparison with on ridge planting however on ridge planting showed higher leaf water use efficiency since it was not observed a significant difference between two application rates of nitrogen 150 kg n ha 1 and 300 kg n ha 1 on different parameters application of 150 kg n ha 1 in proper weather condition proper temperature during booting and flowering enough rainfall occurrence during the effective growth stages and preparing proper soil water content can be suggested as an effective rate to increase winter wheat yield therefore in areas with scarce water combination of vafi prd strategy and 150 kg n ha 1 application rate could be recommended to achieve optimum yield with possibility of saving water and adaptation to water stress

10909,the effectiveness of water saving irrigation strategies such as partial root zone drying prd should be explored to ensure food security as the availability of water for irrigation declines and population increases prd is easily performed by localized irrigation method however very small percentage of irrigated area is under this irrigation method and main irrigation method is furrow irrigation that should be adapted to prd in this respect present study was conducted to explore the effects of prd in furrow irrigation strategies on physiological and agronomic behavior of winter wheat the field experiment included two irrigation strategies variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi as prd and ordinary furrow irrigation ofi two different planting method in furrow planting and on ridge planting and three nitrogen rates 0 150 and 300 kg n ha 1 over 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 results showed that decreasing leaf water potential lwp during the stem elongation stage resulted in increasing the sensitivity of winter wheat to water stress and yield reduction the leaf photosynthesis rate an was not significantly lowered in vafi prd in comparison with that obtained in ofi the vafi strategy reduced the stomatal conductance gs about 12 and 7 in comparison with that obtained in ofi in the first and second year respectively that were statistically significant the lower slope of linear relationship between leaf transpiration efficiency an tr and vapor pressure deficit vpd in vafi strategy indicated that with increasing vpd leaf transpiration efficiency was higher than that obtained in ofi as a consequence vafi strategy as prd was effective in increasing an tr and can be an alternative irrigation management in winter wheat farms with limited water supplies although in furrow planting showed higher efficiency in increasing yield in comparison with that obtained in on ridge planting on ridge planting showed higher effects on leaf transpiration efficiency furthermore there was no significant difference between two application rates of nitrogen 150 kg n ha 1 and 300 kg n ha 1 for different parameters therefore application of 150 kg n ha 1 can be suggested as an effective rate to increase winter wheat yield consequently in areas with scarce water and furrow irrigation combination of vafi in furrow planting and 150 kg n ha 1 is recommended to achieve optimum yield with possibility of saving water during the winter wheat growing season keywords variable alternate furrow irrigation planting method leaf water potential leaf photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance leaf transpiration efficiency 1 introduction although water scarcity generally associated with arid and semiarid climates field and water resources management is essential to enhance the water productivity in all over the world in order to supply food for next generations deficit irrigation di is one of the strategies that scientists have been used to reduce water application with negligible effects on yield results showed that in comparison with di the variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi as an approach to partial root zone drying irrigation prd can decrease irrigation water without significant yield loss while it may improve the yield quality abdelraouf and ragab 2018 casa and rouphael 2014 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 ahmadi et al 2010 saeed et al 2008 kang et al 2000 the advantage of this strategy is that water uptake from the wet side of the root system maintain a favorable plant water status while part of the root system in drying soil can respond to the drying by sending a root sourced signal abscisic acid aba to the shoots where stomata opening may be inhibited by decreasing the stomata conductance gs so that water loss is reduced haworth et al 2018 hashem et al 2018 puértolas et al 2014 khalil and grace 1993 and increase water use efficiency shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 ahmadi et al 2010 kang and zhang 2004 davies et al 2002 there are different findings on the effects of aba concentration in root and shoot on stomata sensitivity some studies reported that xylem sap aba is a function of root aba as well as the flow rate of water from roots to shoots and aba can be a sensitive indicator in the shoot to show the effect of soil drying khalil and grace 1993 for sycamore whereas puértolas et al 2014 suggested that differences in root aba accumulation did not influence xylem aba concentration aba increases the stomatal sensitivity of c3 monocots as wheat in addition to lowering gs haworth et al 2018 prd works for crops with stomata that are sensitive to aba for example certain varieties of olive are insensitive to the aba signal derived from drying of one half of the root dbara et al 2016 however collins et al 2010 suggested that prd reduced vine water use by up to 50 at moderate vpd 3 kpa compared with control vines irrigated at the same level it also increased stomatal sensitivity to vpd and decreased sap flow although application of prd using drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation is more convenient and practical as studies conducted on maize by abdelraouf and ragab 2018 and tomato by hashem et al 2018 and casa and rouphael 2014 however globally around 86 of the irrigated area equipped with surface irrigation 11 is sprinkler irrigation and 3 is localized irrigation fao 2016 therefore it is essential to implement and explore the prd irrigation strategy in the surface irrigation method transpiration rate and leaf expansion are very sensitive to reduction in soil water deficit and water stress inhibits transpiration rate tr while photosynthesis rate an remains unchanged at mild stress sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 consequently water productivity can be improved without significant effect on photosynthesis and yield investigations on winter wheat jia et al 2014 li et al 2011 sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 potato ahmadi et al 2010 and safflower shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2016 showed that vafi improved water productivity additional effective way to improve more water saving along with prd is use of appropriate planting patterns in furrow planting has reported as an effective strategy in water saving and increasing yield due to higher soil water and winter soil temperature yarami and sepaskhah 2015b shabani et al 2013b in addition in furrow planting has recognized as an appropriate strategy by many investigations in order to increase leaf area index lai crop height yield dry matter photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance for different crops mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 yarami and sepaskhah 2015a jia et al 2014 wang et al 2014 in addition nitrogen is another important factor that affected on physiologic and agronomic parameters of crops shangguan et al 2000 suggested that under well watered conditions an and gs of winter wheat were increased in the high n rate 15 mm no 3 in irrigation water in comparison with that obtained in the low n rate 1 5 mm no 3 in irrigation water although its effect on an and gs was not identical under different water status an and gs both decreased in water stress conditions while the reaction to water stress was different between high and low nitrogen application rates alternatively tranavičiené et al 2008 mentioned that nitrogen was not the only affecting factor and changeable environmental condition in different years can suspend or accelerate the decline in photosynthesis and reduce the grain yield water and n supply often showed interaction with each other wu et al 2008a pandey et al 2001 frederick and camberato 1995 n supply under non water limiting conditions can result in full yield potential but under water limiting conditions n may increase the severity of drought stress frederick and camberato 1995 that results in reducing yield and economic return besides the interaction effects occurred between n application and soil water deficit on photosynthesis and transpiration wu et al 2008b otoo et al 1989 regarding to various responses of nitrogen and other restrictive factors on physiologic and agronomic parameters this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different irrigation strategies including ordinary furrow irrigation ofi and variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi as prd planting methods on ridge planting orp and in furrow planting ifp and n application rates on some agronomic physiologic and gas exchange parameters of winter wheat triticum aestivam that was grown in a semi arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a set of 36 water balance lysimiters was used in this study for two years 2015 2016 in a semi arid region these lysimeters were installed in the experimental research station of the agricultural college shiraz university shiraz iran location of the station is 29 56 n latitude 52 02 e longitude and 1810 m m s l the lysimeters dimension were 1 5 m 1 5 m 1 1 m there was a 0 9 m soil layer clay loam in the lysimeters with field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 and wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 the properties of soil and irrigation water are shown in table 1 physical properties of the soil were taken from the study of barzegari et al 2017 the variation in climatic data that were measured in a station near the site in two years are figured fig 1 annual rainfall of 282 mm and 378 mm occurred in late fall and winter in the first year and winter in the second year respectively wheat local pishtaz cultivar was seeded on october 29th and november 6th 2015 and 2016 respectively in lysimeters the well water with electrical conductivity ec of 0 72 ds m 1 was used for irrigation water the drainage water was conducted to the individual sump and collected in containers four ridges 0 5 m spacing and three furrows manually constructed in each lysimeter phosphorous fertilizer was applied as triple superphosphate at rate of 150 kg ha 1 46 p2o5 and mixed with the soil surface layer at the time of soil preparation nitrogen fertilizer was applied as urea 46 n at two times along with irrigation water at planting and beginning the stem elongation wheat seeding rate was 250 kg ha 1 in 6 rows in the furrows and on the ridges the distance between two rows in each furrow or on ridge was 0 15 m the spacing between two rows in consecutive furrow or ridge was 0 35 m the experiment was conducted in a split split plot design with randomized complete blocks with three replications interaction effects of three factors were investigated in this study these factors were irrigation strategies as main plot planting method and nitrogen fertilizer rates as sub plot and sub sub plots respectively two different irrigation treatments were full irrigation by ordinary furrow ofi and partial root drying irrigation prd as variable alternate furrow irrigation vafi on ridge planting orp and in furrow planting ifp were used as different planting methods nitrogen fertilizer treatments were n0 0 n1 150 and n2 300 kg n ha 1 2 2 irrigation requirement soil water content before irrigation event was used to determine the crop irrigation requirement an access tube of neutron meter was installed in the middle furrow soil water content was measured at three depths of 0 3 m 0 6 m and 0 9 m with neutron scattering method in the access tubes in addition soil water content at the depth of 0 0 1 m of surface soil was measured by the gravimetric method the irrigation water was considered by raising the soil water in the lysimeter to the field capacity and it was calculated by the following equation 1 d i 1 n θ f c i θ i δ z i where d is the irrigation water depth m i is the soil layer number n is the total number of soil layers θ f c i and θ i are the volumetric soil water content at field capacity and before the irrigation event m3 m 3 respectively and δ z i is the soil layer thickness m the irrigation application efficiency of 70 was used to convert the irrigation water to gross irrigation water for the first irrigation all lysimeters were irrigated with ofi method to provide uniform seed germination and plant stands the amount of applied water in the first irrigation was about 27 mm in the first year about 77 mm of rainfall occurred during the week after sowing and 111 mm in the second year crop water requirement was generally provided by precipitation till march in the first year afterward the irrigation treatments were started however in the second year due to lack of adequate rainfall after sowing second irrigation event 80 mm was applied in ofi the gross irrigation water was applied with 10 days irrigation interval in all irrigation furrows in ofi the amount of applied irrigation water in each irrigation event for vafi was 2 3 of that applied in ofi and it was applied in the furrows which were dry in the preceding irrigation cycle 2 3 crop parameters measurement since the leaf area varies among cultivation sowing density and nitrogen rate in winter wheat bavec et al 2007 it was measured during the growing season to investigate the effects of different treatments on wheat growth in different growth stages one plant was detached from the field and the leaf length l and width w were measured by ruler and the leaves area were measured by an area meter a relationship between the measured leaf area and multiplication of l w was determined as follows 2 a c k 1 n l i w i where a is the total area of crop leaves l i leaf length w i leaf width and c equation coefficient in order to obtain leaf area index lai one plant was specified in each lysimeter and its leaf length l and width w was measured during the growing season at first a linear relation was obtained between total leaf area of a plant and multiplication of l w by regression analysis eq 3 then plant leaf area was determined using this equation during the growing season 3 a 0 6915 l i w i r 2 0 999 n 130 s e 7 75 p 0 0001 the measured leaf length and width were used in eq 3 to determine the plant leaf area then the plant leaf area was divided by the devoted area of each plant to calculate the lai lai was measured monthly until the breaking dormancy and every two weeks to the end of growing season within each lysimeter one fully expanded leaf from the top of the plant was chosen for measuring the gas exchange parameters these parameters were net photosynthesis rate an stomatal conductance gs and leaf transpiration rate tr that were measured using lci analyzer adc bioscientific ltd on different days the measurements were made under periods of fair weather condition in order to measure leaf water potential lwp one fresh leaf from the top of the plant was selected in each lysimeter during different growth stages early stem elongation stem elongation booting heading in the first year and during the early stem elongation stem elongation early heading early flowering and end of flowering in the second year in the midday around 11 a m 1 pm and lwp was measured using pressure bomb pms instrument company model 1000 pressure chamber instrument furthermore growing degree days gdd was calculated by following equation mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 4 g d d 0 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b i f t a v e t b t a v e t b i f t a v e t u t t a v e t u t where t m a x and t m i n are the maximum and minimum air temperature in c respectively t b is the crop base temperature and it was considered as zero for winter wheat and t u t is the upper temperature threshold that was considered as 25 c for wheat mcmaster and smika 1988 2 4 statistical analysis the interaction effects between irrigation method planting method and nitrogen application rate were evaluated by using analysis of variance anova and means were compared by duncan s multiple range tests at 5 level of probability the statistical analyses were carried out by mstatc software 3 results and discussion 3 1 water application with regard to table 2 in furrow planting reduced the applied water in comparison with that obtained in on ridge planting about 10 15 in 300 kg n ha 1 application rate in the first and second year respectively therefore in furrow planting reduced the surface evaporation and preserved soil water in the root zone especially in higher n fertilizer rates consequently less water applied to in furrow planting compared with that applied in on ridge planting application of higher nitrogen rate also increased the applied water in different irrigation regimes in general application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased the applied water about 26 33 in on ridge planting and 18 20 in in furrow planting compared with that obtained in 0 n application these increases were about 52 66 in on ridge planting and 37 40 in in furrow planting in 300 kg n ha 1 compared with that obtained in 0 n application soil water content was measured in the middle furrow ofi and vafi and side furrow in vafi strategy during two growing seasons and results are presented in fig 2 soil water content was almost the same in two irrigation methods at the early season due to rainfall occurrence then it showed differences after irrigation treatment initiation and applying vafi strategy soil water content differed in two different furrows in vafi strategy due to applying irrigation in different furrows in every irrigation cycle generally soil water content in vafi strategy was lower than that obtained in ofi strategy due to applying lower amount of irrigation water 3 2 leaf area index the leaf area index was figured to days after planting and gdd for different treatments during the growing season in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 although it has been presented as a function of gdd fig 3 the lai reached its maximum 176 and 167 days after planting in the first and second year respectively the corresponding gdd was about 1261 c and 1441 c at maximum lai laimax for the first and second year respectively although the growing season in the first year was longer than that in the second year this reduction of gdd resulted from inappropriate weather condition and spring cold in the first year that also resulted in less lai and yield tables 2 and 3 besides a relationship between laimax and irrigation water depth was determined by following equation 5 l a i m a x 0 009 i r r 0 96 r 2 0 47 n 24 s e 1 85 p 0 0002 where l a i m a x and i r r are the maximum lai and irrigation water depth mm respectively eq 5 showed that by 107 mm of irrigation water depth threshold the laimax started to increase from zero and reached 10 at irrigation water application of 1004 mm the threshold indicated that some portion of the irrigation water lost by deep percolation and surface evaporation regarding table 2 the laimax reached its highest value as 9 93 and 10 13 and the lowest values as 1 74 and 2 8 in the first and second year respectively as for laimax bavec et al 2007 reported 1 0 7 5 for an especial variety among control and 120 kg n ha 1 treatments with 600 seeds m 2 same seed density in this study the maximum values of lai belonged to on ridge planting in ofi and 300 kg n ha 1 and minimum values were observed in in furrow planting with ofi and no n application rate n0 in both years decrease in irrigation water reduced lai azizian and sepaskhah 2014a zhang et al 2009 as it is observed in table 2 ofi enhanced laimax compared with that obtained in vafi strategy although this increase is not statistically significant with an exception in the first year n2p1 on the other hand laimax was lower in the in furrow planting with ofi in comparison with that obtained in on ridge planting for all nitrogen application rates in two consecutive years in contrast lai value in in furrow planting with vafi increased compared with that obtained in on ridge planting these results are in contradiction to those obtained by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower increasing in laimax value in on ridge planting with ofi can be related to higher tilering in this treatment compared with that obtained in in furrow planting however better conditions for plant growth may be provided by in furrow planting due to higher soil water and temperature shabani et al 2013b yarami and sepaskhah 2015b in vafi treatments and resulted in higher laimax table 2 moreover application of nitrogen increased laimax in comparison with that obtained in no n application table 2 compared with no n application rate application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased laimax as 55 and 100 in the first and second year respectively similarly application of 300 kg n ha 1 increased laimax about 200 and 143 in the first and second year respectively that was similar to the results reported by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower higher values of lai are rooted in larger leaf area and more tillering compared with that obtained in non fertilized plants there is no significant interaction between irrigation strategies and planting methods or nitrogen rates table 2 on laimax the only factor affecting on laimax was nitrogen rate p 0 05 results indicated that application of 300 kg n ha 1 caused a significant increase in laimax compared with that obtained in no n application and 150 kg n ha 1 however there is no significant difference in application of 150 kg n ha 1 on laimax compared with that obtained in 300 kg n ha 1 in general application of 150 kg n ha 1 had the optimum laimax with no significant difference in crop yield in comparison with that obtained in application of 300 kg n ha 1 3 3 leaf water potential fig 4 illustrates the leaf water potential lwp during the growing season for different treatments in two years it is shown that lwp in the 2015 2016 was lower than that in 2016 2017 the higher value of lwp in the second year was accounted due to about 183 mm rainfall during 17 days before the first measurement of lwp this difference in lwp between two years affected yield and showed the sensitivity of winter wheat to water stress during the stem elongation stage overall leaf water potential decreased during growing season due to increase in air temperature fig 1 the relationship between grain yield and lwp in different growth stages was figured fig 5 for two different planting methods since the relationship between grain yield and lwp in flowering stage was not significant it was not shown the relationship between yield and lwp showed that with decreasing in lwp yield reduced with a non linear relationship in both planting methods however reduction in grain yield in in furrow planting was more severe than that obtained in on ridge planting since prd may have no function in this case due to the fact that both sides of the crop root irrigated in each irrigation event but with longer irrigation interval therefore vafi with on ridge planting is considered as prd strategy that is effective in decreasing the reduction of grain yield by decreasing lwp besides a simple linear relationship was obtained between the net photosynthesis rate an and lwp fig 6 as follows 6 a n 5 09 l w r 23 58 r 2 0 35 n 72 s e 3 02 p 0 01 results indicated that with decreasing the leaf water potential photosynthetic rate decreased linearly therefore soil water condition and leaf water condition has a direct role on net photosynthetic rate during the growing season 3 4 net photosynthesis rate an according to fig 7 a net photosynthesis rate was measured for different growth stages in two years although an was not measured because of cloudy weather during the flowering stage and stem elongation in the first and second year respectively furthermore it should be noticed that about two weeks after the first measurement the second part of nitrogen 50 was applied to the field besides it should be mentioned that vafi strategy was not applied during the stem elongation because of enough rainfall occurrence at this time in the second year results indicated that none of the irrigation strategies planting methods and n application rates showed significant difference in net photosynthesis rate of winter wheat p 0 05 hashem et al 2018 reported that prd irrigation did not affect net photosynthesis rate of tomato compared with that obtained in full irrigation although prd decreased the stomatal conductance the an values varied between 5 48 23 1 μmol m 2 s 1 and 6 91 19 7 μmol m 2 s 1 for different treatments and growth stages in the first and second year respectively highest value of an was obtained during the stem elongation after applying the second part of nitrogen fertilizer in the first year that was in accordance with the results reported by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 and kazemeini et al 2015 for safflower and shabani et al 2013a for rapeseed however net photosynthesis rate started to decrease after stem elongation stage and gradually continued until end of growing season although during the booting an decreased sharply in the first year because of spring cold and it increased again as the weather condition improved it is observed fig 7a that an decreased much more in ofi compared with that obtained in vafi strategy and indicated that vafi strategy increased plant tolerance against the spring cold the photosynthesis rate was reduced gradually after heading during the winter wheat growing season due to increase in air temperature higher that for optimum photosynthesis rate as other studies suggested for safflower and rapeseed shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 kazemeini et al 2015 shabani et al 2013a the an had the highest values in stem elongation stage 3 5 stomatal conductance gs the stomatal conductance gs of winter wheat varied between 0 08 to 0 57 mol m 2 s 1 in the first year and 0 09 to 0 51 mol m 2 s 1 in the second year fig 7b the vafi strategy prd reduced gs values about 12 and 7 in comparison with that obtained in ofi in the first and second year respectively that were not significant showing that this strategy can be used effectively in saving water instead of ofi likewise shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 and azizian and sepaskhah 2014b reported a reduction of about 24 and 43 in gs for safflower with vafi strategy and maize with deficit irrigation di respectively that shows winter wheat is more tolerant to water stress than safflower and maize as previously stated stomatal conductance decreased sharply during booting stage because of spring cold in the first year and vafi strategy prd showed higher gs in this stage fig 7b in response to water stress stomata closure generally occurs due to atmospheric vapor pressure along with root generated chemical signals like producing stress hormone abscisic acid ashraf and harris 2013 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 as an illustration hashem et al 2018 reported that the values of the abscisic acid aba contents were higher under prd and regular deficit irrigation than that obtained in full irrigation since stomata closure have more inhibitory effect on transpiration than that on co2 diffusion into the leaf tissues ashraf and harris 2013 it was not seen any significant difference in an in this study consequently prd can be used as a proper strategy with mild stress in field irrigation management application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased stomatal conductance of winter wheat about 2 8 and 28 4 compared with that obtained in no n application rate in the first and second year respectively higher application rate of nitrogen 300 kg n ha 1 enhanced the gs values around 18 8 and 8 6 in comparison with that obtained in 150 kg n ha 1 in the first and second year respectively high n supply lead to a less carbon loss compared with that under a low n supply besides n deficiency can decrease the stomatal aperture by increasing their sensitivity to endogenous abscisic acid sun et al 2016 3 6 leaf transpiration rate tr the transpiration rate of winter wheat leaf varied between 2 84 to 10 05 mmol m 2 s 1 in the first year and 2 89 to 7 92 mmol m 2 s 1 in the second fig 8 a the vafi strategy prd reduced tr values in most of treatments about 6 and 14 in the first and second year respectively this reduction can be linked to decreasing the gs as stated before and its affection on transpiration rate shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 suggested that vafi decreased transpiration rate about 27 for safflower in comparison with that obtained in ofi although it was not significant as well application of 150 kg n ha 1 increased leaf transpiration rate of winter wheat about 5 and 14 compared with that obtained in no n application rate in the first and second year respectively application of 300 kg n ha 1 enhanced the tr values about 10 and 3 in comparison with that obtained in 150 kg n ha 1 in the first and second year respectively overall n application rates and planting methods did not show any specific influences on leaf transpiration rate in various growth stages leaf transpiration rate variation was similar to net photosynthesis rate during the growing season for different crop growth stages 3 7 leaf transpiration efficiency an tr fig 8b shows the variation of leaf transpiration efficiency in different irrigation strategies in both years the vafi strategy prd showed higher an tr in comparison with that obtained in ofi without any significant decrease in photosynthesis rate for different n application rates however there was a significant difference in an tr between no n application rate n0 with vafi strategy and other n application rates although the difference between ofi and vafi strategies was not significant for most of the treatments during growth stages the leaf transpiration efficiency showed efficient water use in vafi strategy similar findings are also reported for potato by ahmadi et al 2010 and liu et al 2005 3 8 relationship between an and gs since the relationship between an and gs was recognized as a drought adaptation index chaves 1991 linear relationship between the an and gs was determined for different growth stages in two years fig 9 like that was found for safflower by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 maize by azizian and sepaskhah 2014b and saffron by yarami and sepaskhah 2015a fig 7a and b showed the linear relationship between an and gs in different growth stages in the first and second year respectively with regard to fair weather requirement for measuring the photosynthesis rate it could not be measured in some growth stages for both years flowering in the first year and stem elongation and booting in the second year regarding with fig 9a the slope of fitted line in booting stage was high that showed spring cold made net photosynthesis rate very sensitive and with a slight decline in gs photosynthesis rate decreased remarkably however higher slope s 27 89 p 0 005 belonged to the relationship between an and gs during the end of flowering in the second year fig 9b and it showed that net photosynthesis rate was more sensitive to closing the stomatal in this growth stage fig 9c illustrated the relationship between net photosynthesis rate and gs for all growth stages together in two years a power relationship was fitted to the relationship between an and gs during the growing season fig 9c besides in order to find out the effects of irrigation strategies planting methods and nitrogen rate on the relationship between an and gs in winter wheat it was determined for each treatment separately table 4 the slope of fitted lines in vafi strategy prd is lower than that obtained in ofi and indicated when gs decreases under prd conditions the an values are reduced with lower rates therefore this strategy was efficient in water use reduction and winter wheat showed adaptation with this strategy against water stress this finding agrees with study of shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower in prd condition however the slopes of linear relationship in various planting methods were close to each other therefore drought adaptation was not varied by different planting methods that is consistent with the finding of shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 for safflower and yarami and sepaskhah 2015a for saffron the slopes of linear relationship for different n fertilization rates in the first year indicated that non fertilized plants were more sensitive to water deficits in contrast to that found in the second year finding of shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 showed that fertilized plant was more sensitive to water stress this difference can be due to occurrence of spring cold along with the water stress in the first year and it increased the sensitivity of the photosynthesis rate in plants with lower n rate to water shortage on the other hand application of 300 kg n ha 1 was more vulnerable to water shortage in the second year that maybe due to having larger canopy and higher water requirement in this treatment shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 3 9 relationship between air vapor pressure deficit vpd and gas exchange parameters in order to discover the effect of irrigation strategy on water stress adaptation the relationship between gas exchange parameters and vpd was illustrated figs 10 and 11 for two different planting methods and irrigation strategies the slope of the linear relationship between an and vpd in two irrigation strategies table 5 showed that vafi prd with on ridge planting slightly decreased an vs vpd indicating that vafi prd is an efficient strategy to water stress adaptation however vafi strategy with in furrow planting did not show any difference in comparison with ofi strategy regarding fig 10c f increasing vpd affected much more the gs and tr than an with increasing vpd during the growing season gs and tr increased although the slope of the line revealed that transpiration rate and gs had a slight rise in vafi prd with on ridge planting compared with that obtained in ofi and vafi with in furrow planting the slope of the line in fig 11a d revealed that the rate of intrinsic water use efficiency an gs and leaf transpiration efficiency an tr decreased with increase in vpd due to increasing the gs and tr during the growing season intrinsic water use efficiency and leaf transpiration efficiency in vafi prd was higher than that obtained in ofi and the slope of linear relationship was lower 14 9 and 0 5 in an gs and an tr respectively in vafi prd with on ridge planting and in furrow planting respectively in comparison with those obtained in ofi 27 06 and 0 85 in an gs and an tr respectively with on ridge planting and in furrow planting these results indicated the possibility of plant water stress adaptation in prd strategy without much effect on the leaf transpiration efficiency reduction ahmadi et al 2010 4 conclusions it was concluded that decreasing lwp during the stem elongation stage resulted in yield reduction due to extreme sensitivity of winter wheat to water stress during this growth stage the values of an and gs were not significantly reduced in vafi prd in comparison with that obtained in ofi although the reduction in gs was higher than an which saved 30 irrigation water with a slight reduction in grain yield the slope of fitted lines in vafi prd strategy in comparison with that obtained in ofi indicated that when gs decreases under water shortage conditions the an values are reduced with lower rates therefore vafi prd strategy is efficient and winter wheat can show adaptation with this strategy against water stress the lower slope of linear relationship between an tr and vpd in vafi prd strategy indicated that with increasing vpd leaf transpiration efficiency decreased in vafi prd with lower rate than that obtained in ofi as a consequence vafi prd strategy can be an alternative irrigation management in winter wheat farms with limited water supplies although in furrow planting showed higher efficiency in increasing yield in comparison with on ridge planting however on ridge planting showed higher leaf water use efficiency since it was not observed a significant difference between two application rates of nitrogen 150 kg n ha 1 and 300 kg n ha 1 on different parameters application of 150 kg n ha 1 in proper weather condition proper temperature during booting and flowering enough rainfall occurrence during the effective growth stages and preparing proper soil water content can be suggested as an effective rate to increase winter wheat yield therefore in areas with scarce water combination of vafi prd strategy and 150 kg n ha 1 application rate could be recommended to achieve optimum yield with possibility of saving water and adaptation to water stress
