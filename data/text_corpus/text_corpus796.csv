3980,cascade movable weirs have been increasingly widely used for river landscaping water storage and ecological wellbeing the weirs disturb the prior equilibrium in line with fluvial hydrology sediment transport and geomorphology and may lead to profound changes in the river of which however the understanding has so far remained poor here the first of its kind a computational modelling study is presented on the morphodynamic processes under the impact of cascade hydraulic lifting dams a type of movable weirs as to the middle fen river china a two dimensional shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic model is applied to resolve the fluvial processes which is physically coupled and computationally efficient based on finite volume method unstructured mesh local time stepping and parallel computing computational results show that the cascade dams alter the flow and sediment transport locally and on the reach scale in a distinct manner under different operation schemes which in turn incur disparate morphological changes collapse of all the dams all year round would lead to net degradation in the study reach with the floodplains aggrading and the main channel degrading operation of all the dams all year round may induce an overall aggradation both on the floodplains and in the main channel if all the dams collapse in flood seasons and operate in dry seasons cf degradation occurs in the main channel whereas the floodplains experience aggradation with a net degradation when only the dams in the main channel operate all year round om the floodplains degrade while the main channel aggrades resulting in a net aggradation in the study reach either aggradation or degradation may prevail locally on floodplains in main channel and individual subreaches the present findings lead us to propose a complex operation scheme of annually alternating cf and om to constrain significant morphological changes keywords morphodynamic process cascade movable weir

potential solution habets et al 2014 rubber dams have been built worldwide from 1950s due to its low cost of construction and high efficiency in irrigation which are capable of mitigating flood landscaping and storing water bao et al 2020 rane et al 2019 movable weirs developed in the 1980s are used to ensure the maintenance of water resources at normal times and sufficient flow passage during floods lee et al 2017 oh and park 2019 hydraulic lifting dams a type of movable weirs have been promoted in china wang 2014 yu et al 2019 generally a cascade of dams is built on a river instead of a single dam dos santos et al 2018 mao et al 2020 wen et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 cascade low head dams are small in size in comparison with high dams whereas they still have considerable hydrological morphological and ecological influences on rivers bao et al 2020 best 2019 casserly et al 2020 chandesris et al 2019 mao et al 2020 santucci et al 2005 szatten and habel 2020 zhang et al 2020b for example check dams play an important role in the soil and water conservation project in the loess plateau china by impeding eroded sediments upstream wang et al 2016 although there have been a number of investigations on the influences of cascade large dams on rivers kondolf et al 2014 timpe and kaplan 2017 wang et al 2017 wen et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 and general effects of dams may have something in common for rivers of distinct sizes santucci et al 2005 cascade small dams received little attention deitch et al 2013 among few studies regarding cascade low head dams their impacts on streamflow dos santos et al 2018 habets et al 2014 and ecology bao et al 2020 chandesris et al 2019 mao et al 2020 santucci et al 2005 have been examined to date however little is known about the morphological effects of cascade low head dams though there has been a large number of studies over the last several decades on bed evolution in response to high dams e g the three gorges dam on the yangtze river and the xiaolangdi dam on the yellow river china actually once riverine hydrological conditions amount and timing of flood and sediment loading are modified by damming concomitant short term or long term bed evolution will occur potentially posing a threat to dam operation or even rising flood risk kondolf et al 2014 kumar et al 2021 moreover instream sediments are essential for ecology such as being carriers of chemicals and habitats of aquatic animals suggesting the necessity of tracing sediment transport bao et al 2020 in general enhanced understanding of the morphodynamic processes under the impact of cascade movable weirs is urgently warranted as fluvial flow sediment and morphology may interact with each other strongly cao et al 2017 this is particularly significant for the middle fen river china where fifteen hydraulic lifting dams have recently been built which will certainly elicit disturbance to the fluvial processes concurrently the middle fen river features bends and compound cross sections comprising a main channel and wide floodplains the bed material is mainly composed of silt and fine sand that could be easily eroded characterizing a likelihood of rather complicated and active interactions between fluvial flow sediment transport and geomorphology eventually all these may lead to global or local bed deformation that can add to flood risk or affect the normal operation and function of the dams while physical river modelling has remained costly and analytical solutions are viable only for largely simplified idealized cases ni et al 2018 mathematical river modelling has become increasingly proactive for practical fluvial processes over the last half a century or so it is noted that three dimensional modelling may not be realistic for large scale and long period fluvial processes due to high computing cost and one dimensional 1d modelling is too crude to be applicable thus two dimensional 2d modelling is most attractive for the present work featuring a sensible balance between theoretical integrity and applicability in fact shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic shsm models have witnessed significant developments over the last two decades or so cao et al 2017 from traditional uncoupled to coupled models cao et al 2004 from depth averaged single layer to double layer averaged models cao et al 2015 li et al 2013 li et al 2019 li et al 2021a from quasi single phase to two phase models li et al 2021a pudasaini and fischer 2020 and have been widely applied to reveal the fundamental dynamics of riverbed evolution such as in the yangtze river cao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 and other fluvial processes like dam break floods over erodible beds cao et al 2004 reservoir turbidity currents cao et al 2015 hu and li 2020 debris flows bouchut et al 2015 li et al 2018 landslide generated waves li et al 2019 and barrier lake formation and outburst li et al 2021a the aim of this paper is to investigate the morphodynamic processes responding to the fifteen hydraulic lifting dams in cascade on the middle fen river china a series of operation schemes of the cascade dams are evaluated focusing on the flow sediment and morphological processes locally and at subreach and reach scales the implications of the finding are elucidated to facilitate a complex operation scheme to constrain geomorphological changes it is organized as follows the middle fen river and cascade hydraulic lifting dams are introduced in section 2 the shsm model is outlined in section 3 the study cases are briefed in section 4 in section 5 the computed results are evaluated discussions on field observations suggestions on dam operation schemes and uncertainties in modelling are provided in section 6 followed by conclusions in section 7 2 study reach and hydraulic lifting dams the fen river basin has an area of 39 471 km2 and serves as the political economic and cultural center of shanxi province the fen river is the largest river in shanxi province and the second largest tributary of the yellow river with a total length of 716 km fig 1 a the flood season is from june to september and the dry season is from october to next may from headwater to lancun lc is the upper reach and from hongdong hd to the confluence joining yellow river is the lower reach fig 1a taiyuan fig 1a the provincial capital of shanxi features high water demand for industrial irrigational and domestic uses zhang et al 2020a relying largely on the middle fen river the study reach is located in the middle fen river from erba eb station approximately 38 km downstream of taiyuan to the confluence of the ciyao and fen rivers 13 km upstream of yitang yt station with a total length of approximately 80 km fig 1 there are four tributaries joining the main fen river within the study reach i e the changyuan river huiji river longfeng river and ciyao river the confluence of the wenyu and fen rivers lies at approximately 8 km upstream of the yt station fig 1a the main channel is typically 20 80 m wide with the floodplains roughly 150 290 m wide in the study reach fifteen hydraulic lifting dams 1 15 in cascade were constructed in 2016 2017 fig 1b and 2 the hydraulic lifting dam consists of a series of 6 m wide sluice gates which are placed in parallel with a height of 3 5 5 m in the main channel and a uniform height of 2 m on the floodplains fig 2 each sluice gate can be lifted almost vertically to the bottom during operation or collapse horizontally separately within 5 min each dam comprises mainly the main channel protections apron sluice gates stilling basin and apron extension of which more details are illustrated in section 4 2 3 methodology a 2d shsm model is applied for the present work since suspended sediment prevails in the middle fen river a single phase flow model is utilized the model is detailed in ni 2021 essentially extended from ni et al 2020 for fluvial flows incorporating sediment transport and bed deformation it has been validated by a set of laboratory experiments such as dam break flow over fixed bed with obstacles soares frazão and zech 2008 and dam break flow on mobile bed in an abruptly widening channel palumbo et al 2008 the governing equations model closure and numerical algorithm and computing of the 2d shsm model are outlined below 3 1 governing equations the governing equations are derived from mass and momentum conservation laws in fluid dynamics hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 and comprise the continuity and momentum equations for water sediment mixture flow eqs 1 3 and the equations for sediment transport eq 4 and bed deformation eq 5 as follows 1 h t h u x h v y e d 1 p 2 h u t x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v y g h z b x 1 ρ τ bx ρ s ρ w g

is the friction coefficient and n is the manning roughness coefficient the sediment exchange between the bed and water sediment mixture flow is governed by entrainment and deposition physically controlled by turbulence and gravitation respectively however there are no universally applicable formulae for estimating sediment exchange flux to date in practice the estimation of sediment exchange flux is case specific in contrast to the non cohesive sands and gravels in the river reaches of the middle and lower yangtze river as studied in hu et al 2021 silt is dominant in the middle fen river the partheniades krone formula for cohesive sediment partheniades 1965 has been applied for modelling fluvial processes in the yellow river li et al 2017 van maren et al 2009 here it is introduced for the present work 7a e m ρ s τ b τ cr e 1 f o r τ b τ cr e 0 f o r τ b τ cr e 7b d ω c 1 τ b τ cr d f o r τ b τ cr d 0 f o r τ b τ cr d where m is the erosion rate τ cr e and τ cr d are the critical bed shear stresses for erosion and deposition respectively ω is the settling velocity of a single sediment particle and is calculated by zhang and xie s formula zhang and xie 1993 according to its applications in the yellow river li et al 2017 van maren et al 2009 the magnitude of m is 10 4 k g m 2 s and both critical bed shear stresses are usually set to 1 0 pa it is noted that given the sediment particle size 0 02 mm and concentration lower than 10 kg m3 as per the fen river flocculation hindered settling and turbulence damping are tentatively ignored 3 3 numerical algorithm and computing the governing equations are solved under the framework of cell centered finite volume method on unstructured meshes and are discretized explicitly with the operator splitting approach the harten lax and van leer approximate riemann solver with the influences of intermediate waves considered hllc toro 2001 is adopted to calculate the inter cell numerical fluxes a robust and well balanced approach is utilized to properly deal with the wet dry interfaces a splitting point implicit method is used to evaluate the bed shear stresses boundary conditions are implemented using the method of characteristics the local time stepping lts strategy is adopted the original code is written in fortran language with open multi processing openmp compiler directives that facilitate parallel computing the numerical algorithm and computing techniques are detailed in ni 2021 4 study case design 4 1 dam operation schemes to acquire physical insights into the morphodynamic processes under the impact of cascade hydraulic lifting dams in the middle fen river four cases are designed according to different dam operation schemes 1 all the dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains collapse all year round ca which is approximately equivalent to natural setting without the cascade dams 2 all the dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains operate all year round oa 3 all the dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains collapse in flood seasons and operate in dry seasons cf note that the discharge or the water level is not used here as the criterion for the dam operation and all the dams are adjusted simultaneously 4 only the dams in the main channel operate while the dams on the floodplains collapse all year round om in this scenario only the sluice gates in the main channel operate and those on the floodplains collapse the operation schemes of ca and oa are extreme cases and their computational results provide a range within which the solutions of cf and om cases lie in between while these four cases appear to be fairly idealized the present work is the first attempt on this topic leaving more complex operation schemes reserved for future studies 4 2 model set up the computational domain is defined as follows the upstream boundary is defined at the inlet cross section at the eb station the outlet boundary is set to be the cross section located 4 km upstream of the yt station the lateral boundary is aligned with the embankments the computational domain is divided by unstructured mesh which is refined based on the river center line and the layout plan of the 15 dams with the minimum mesh sizes being 13 m and 2 m for the main channel and dam structures respectively the total number of meshes is 166 167 with 86 731 nodes the bed topography is interpolated based on the 176 cross sections css measured from may to oct 2017 with an average spacing of 500 m the elevations of the dam structures are directly given in line with the layout plan note that the dam structures are made of manual materials such as concrete or gabion so that the bottom is non erodible fig 3 shows the comparison of the satellite image layout plan computational mesh and initial bed topography around dam 6 with the dam structures well captured the model is calibrated against observed data of the middle fen river for a two year period from jan 2016 to dec 2017 before the cascade hydraulic lifting dams were in place of which more details are provided in section s1 of the supplementary material the parameters are as follows the manning roughness coefficients for the main channel nm and floodplains nf are 0 020 and 0 050 respectively m 0 5 1 0 4 kg m2 s τ cr e 1 6 pa and τ cr e 1 6 pa according to field measurements the annual average medium size of suspended sediment was 0 017 mm during this time and the bed porosity is equal to 0 44 4 3 model drivers the fluvial processes during a three year period are resolved for understanding the morphodynamic processes over a reasonably long period of time and also a viable computing time there are two hydrological stations fig 1a i e eb and yt stations in the study reach yet there are only two hydrological stations on the five tributaries involved i e pantuo pt station on changyuan river and wenyu wy station on wenyu river fig 1a the observed daily average discharges q and suspended sediment concentrations ssc at the eb station in the sequence of hydrological years 2017 2015 and 2012 are used to specify the upstream boundary conditions and the corresponding observed daily average discharges at the pt and wy stations are adopted for the tributaries fig 4 a steady flow is first calculated with a certain discharge and then taken as the initial condition for the subsequent computation the calculations of boundary and initial conditions are detailed in section s1 of supplementary material due to lack of relevant data the present computational modelling needs to invite two assumptions i the sediment load from the tributaries is negligible and ii suspended sediment transport prevails whilst bedload is negligible these assumptions are acceptable because the tributaries possess low discharges as compared with the main fen river and the sediment on the riverbed of the middle fen river is mainly silt it is noted that based on the observed data at the eb and yt stations the whole reach featured weak bed degradation during the 2012 2017 period nevertheless the years of 2012 2015 and 2017 feature relatively large sediment yield and small runoff which is likely to cause bed aggradation so as to increase flood risk and affect the normal operation of the dams therefore the sequence of 2017 2015 and 2012 is selected herewith to specify the boundary conditions in fact more sequences of q and ssc combined based on the data of 2012 2015 and 2017 have been applied to specify the boundary conditions and the conclusions hold as described below cao et al 2020 5 results 5 1 flow and sediment processes on reach scale the first hydrological year features a high flood so the flow and sediment processes in its flood season are evaluated here fig 5 shows the discharge and stage hydrographs at css immediately upstream of dams 1 and 6 and the outlet cross section the x axis represents the number of days from 1st jun the stages shown in fig 5b d and f are the lowest water levels at the cross sections typically lower than the highest by less than 0 1 m the river floods propagate downstream in a relatively natural regime under the ca scheme while the extreme oa scheme leads to the initial static state of flow in june then the stage experiences a sharp increase to its maximum level behind the dams after which the floods propagate over the top of the sluice gates the hydrographs of cf and om cases are between those of ca and oa cases when entering dry season after 122 days 1st oct the cf case exhibits the same process of water storage behind the dams as in the oa case resulting in a rapid decrease of discharge and stage at the outlet cross section note that the flow discharges are higher and floods last longer at the outlet cross section due to the contributions of the four tributaries joining into the main fen river downstream of dam 7 fig 6 shows the time series of ssc at css immediately upstream of dams 1 6 10 and the outlet cross section in the om case as shown in fig 4b the peak ssc at the eb station during floods in jul and oct are 5 03 and 4 99 kg m3 respectively both of which experience attenuation along the river in the om case table 1 lists the evolutions of peak ssc at these four css in all cases which shows a similar pattern of attenuation but an appreciable difference in its rate the maximum attenuation is seen in the oa case due to the operation of dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains succinctly on the reach scale the flow discharge and stage hydrographs and suspended sediment transport processes are considerably altered by the cascade dams under different operation schemes implying different morphological responses in the reach as follows 5 2 reach scale bed deformation fig 7 shows the accumulated volumes of bed deformation δ v for all cases with positive and negative values representing bed aggradation and degradation respectively only bed aggradation could occur over the dam structures that are non erodible and δ v of the whole reach fig 7a is equal to the sum of δ v over dam structures the floodplains and main channel fig 7b d it is seen in fig 7a that 1 bed degrades in the ca case with a total amount of around 200 000 m3 2 bed aggrades in the oa case with a total amount of approximately 100 000 m3 3 bed degrades in the cf case with a volume of 50 000 m3 after three years 4 bed aggrades under the om scheme with the three year δ v value being about 75 000 m3 5 the ca and oa cases feature strongest bed degradation and aggradation respectively between which the geomorphological changes of cf and om cases lie in 6 the year 2015 features the smallest runoff and sediment yield so bed deformation is minor during this period fig 7b shows that sediments deposit over dam structures in all the cases the deposition amounts are diverse in different cases with the maximum value in the ca case and the minimum value in the oa case the main channel protections and apron are made of gabion whose surface is rough and could decrease the flow velocity the bottom of the stilling basin is 0 5 m lower than its surrounding areas so that water tends to impound there resulting in relatively smaller velocity these two factors favor sediment deposition furthermore it can be inferred from fig 7b that if the dams operate for a longer period sediments deposit less over the dam structures this is because when the dams operate in oa cf and om cases the sediments from the inlet cross section tend to deposit behind the dams especially the first dam instead of passing through the sluice gates and depositing over dam structures fig 7c and d show that the floodplains aggrade most and the main channel degrades most both in the ca case where the study reach is in a relatively natural regime i e aggradation on the floodplains and degradation in the main channel during flood seasons note that the streamflow and sediment yield of the fen river concentrate in flood seasons so bed evolution is pronounced during this period in the oa case the floodplains undergo merely a slight aggradation of about 10 000 m3 and the main channel aggrades by an amount of approximately 80 000 m3 this is because the operation of all the dams impounds water along the whole reach leading to an overall low velocity conducive to sediment deposition only in the om case the floodplains degrade since they play a leading role in flow passage where the flow is shallower and faster as compared with that in the impounded main channel among all the four schemes the main channel aggrades most under the om scheme as under the cf and ca schemes all the dams collapse in flood seasons when streamflow is large and sediment transport is active the patterns of bed evolution of these two cases possess similarities both qualitatively and quantitatively with the absolute δ v values in the cf case smaller than those in the ca case fig 8 illustrates the initial river thalweg and the changes after 1 2 and 3 years at the 15 css immediately upstream of each dam the ca case experiences the greatest fall of thalweg among all the cases while the thalweg in the cf case is slightly higher due to sediment deposition in dry seasons when the dams operate under the oa and om schemes the thalwegs exhibit minor alternation except for the rises in the upstream subreaches these patterns presented in fig 8 agree well with bed deformation shown in fig 7 briefly the oa case features the maximum net aggradation and the ca case is characterized by the maximum net degradation in the whole reach while bed deformation in the cf and om cases lies in between yet bed deformation over the dam structures in the main channel and over the floodplains features disparate patterns it is noted that the middle fen river is characterized by compound cross sections and the sluice gates in the main channel and on the floodplains operate distinctively under the om scheme in this regard evaluating the morphodynamic processes on the local scale is warranted section 5 4 5 3 subreach scale bed deformation to probe into the bed deformation in the longitudinal direction the study reach is divided into 16 subreaches according to the locations of the 15 dams except for the first subreach each subreach contains one dam in its upper part table 2 lists the name and length of each subreach with square brackets and parentheses representing the inclusion and exclusion of the dam respectively fig 9 shows the amounts of bed deformation of all the subreaches of which the intensities are presented in section s2 of supplementary material it is shown in fig 9 that the computed bed deformation in the 16 subreaches in both ca and cf cases does not have a definite pattern with bed degradation and aggradation alternating both spatially and temporally this is because when all the dams collapse ca the study reach is in a relatively natural regime under the cf scheme the dams collapse in flood seasons when streamflow and sediment yield concentrate eliminating the effects of dams however the construction of the dams itself has an impact on the morphological evolution such as sediment deposition over dam structures fig 9a and b illustrate that the subreach scale morphological changes are more severe in the ca case both in terms of bed degradation and aggradation than in the cf case fig 9c and d show the predicted bed deformation in the oa and om cases with a very prominent aggradation in the first subreach and much milder aggradation and then degradation downstream the first subreach features extremely large amount of nearly 100 000 m3 in the oa case which is still 30 000 m3 greater than that in the om case the last subreaches degrade in both oa and om cases since the majority of sediments transported from upper subreaches have deposited upstream of dam 15 inducing a sediment starved flow briefly there are more subreaches featuring bed degradation of higher intensities in the ca and cf cases than in the oa and om cases where most subreaches exhibit minor or even marginal bed deformation in addition it is noted that in both oa and om cases the first subreach experiences overwhelmingly strong aggradation 5 4 local hydraulics sediment transport and bed deformation under the om scheme the topography varies significantly around the joining points of the standing and falling sluice gates where the streamflow and sediment transport would adjust accordingly facilitating spatially complicated scenario of bed deformation therefore the om case is selected here to demonstrate local morphodynamic processes echoing section 5 1 the computed results are evaluated for the flood season in the first hydrological year dam 6 is chosen as an example figs 10 14 show the distributions of water depth velocity bed shear stress ssc and bed elevation change around dam 6 all of which exhibit considerable increases during the rising phase of the flood from t 30 d to t 92 d and decreases over the recession phase of the flood from t 92 d to t 122 d the sluice gates of dam 6 in the main channel have a height of 3 5 m so the maximum depth of the impounded water is about 2 3 m at 92 d the stilling basin is constructed to be 0 5 lower so that the water depth there is deeper by some 0 5 m it can be inferred from fig 10 that the cross sections behind the dam are asymmetric with the flow near the right bank 0 3 m deeper due to the impediment of dam 6 in the main channel the flow moves slowly in the main channel upstream of dam 6 fig 11 however the flow accelerates on the floodplains next to the standing sluice gates in the main channel due to the reduction of cross sectional area downstream of dam 6 water flows back into the main channel the distributions of bed shear stress follow the patterns of those of water depth and flow velocity fig 12 with regions featuring higher speed and shallower depth displaying greater bed shear stress accordingly this agrees with the equation of bed shear stress eq 6 in this regard a larger bed shear stress namely a greater capability of erosion characterizes the apron extensions on the floodplains downstream of dam 6 as well as the right side of the floodplains the bed shear stress is low in the main channel especially upstream of dam 6 favouring sediment deposition as shown in fig 13 ssc alters dramatically before during and after the floods one month after entering the flood season ssc is very low fig 13a which is consistent with the measured ssc shown in fig 4b where ssc keeps a zero value before and after big floods four days after the first peak discharge 108 m3 s from the inlet cross section ssc reaches a value of 0 01 kg m3 with a larger value of 0 04 kg m3 along the right side of floodplains fig 13b the regions around the sluice gates featuring the largest bed shear stress fig 12b do not possess high ssc fig 13b since the dam structures are non erodible three days after the second peak discharge 57 m3 s arriving at the inlet cross section a ssc value of 0 04 kg m3 is achieved fig 13c when the flood falls down at t 122 d ssc drops back to 0 01 kg m3 fig 13d fig 14 illustrates the bed elevation changes as compared to the initial bed elevation fig 3d with positive and negative values indicating local aggradation and degradation respectively the main channel experiences continuous aggradation with a global increase of bed elevation by the order of centimeters e g 0 02 m behind dam 6 at t 122 d two zones featuring approximately 0 1 m deep degradation can be observed on both sides of the floodplains downstream of dam 6 at 61 d where the flow mainly passes during floods fig 14b then these two zones degrade further in depth and area as flood propagates fig 14c and d with a final degradation of 0 3 m on the right side of the floodplains at 122 d these two zones are surrounded by the main channel protections and apron extensions where high bed shear stresses present fig 12 and while the dam structures are non erodible the flows over the rest of these regions on the floodplains are equipped with great ability to erode sediments from the bed in addition the asymmetry of the cross sections induces a larger flow on the right side of the floodplains therefore the local degradation is significant on the right side of the floodplains downstream of dam 6 the eroded sediments then move downstream with the streamflow which decelerates after passing through the dam due to the lateral widening of the channel resulting in aggradation downstream of the eroded path on the right side of the channel fig 14d in brief considerable morphological changes may occur locally where fluvial processes respond strongly to the dam structures which warrants close attention when deciding operation schemes and management of the cascade hydraulic lifting dams 6 discussions 6 1 field observation the fifteen hydraulic lifting dams on the middle fen river have been collapsing for more than three years after construction which actually corresponds to the ca scheme fig 15 a shows the photograph around dam 15 taken in mar 2021 as indicated by the red rectangular in fig 15a sediment deposited on the dam structures in the main channel while the surfaces of the dam structures on the floodplains saw marginal sediment deposition fig 15b and c show the contours of computed bed elevation change around dam 6 in the ca case with the greatest increase of bed elevation occurring in the main channel over the dam structures which is slightly lower than 0 6 m after three years fig 15c qualitatively these computed results fig 15b and c agree with the field observation fairly well fig 15a essentially the comparison constitutes a reasonable validation of the present shsm model unfortunately a quantitative comparison is hampered due to lack of observed data for flow sediment and morphology during the period from 2018 to 2020 6 2 suggestion on dam operation scheme given the computed results above a complex operation scheme of alternating cf and om annually is recommended the measured data and also the computational results show that the study reach features global bed degradation in a relatively natural regime without the hydraulic lifting dams or under the ca scheme however the ca scheme cannot make use of the dams at all the oa scheme is able to exploit the cascade dams to the maximum extent while global aggradation and severe local deposition in the upper subreaches would raise flood risk thus it is not desirable for a long term although strong deposition occurs under the om scheme and over dam structures under the cf scheme they are complementary to one another in terms of reach scale bed deformation as bed evolution on the floodplains and in the main channel evolves in opposite ways hence as far as these four operation schemes are concerned the cf and om schemes are sensible choices when necessary the ca scheme is suggested to erode the main channel which would otherwise aggrade under the om scheme it is noted that the first subreach aggrades heavily under the om scheme and the flow is highly complicated as the river features a main channel and wide floodplains and at the same time impacted by the cascade dam structures especially under the om scheme local aggradation may be inevitable in these circumstances local dredging may be necessary which can be readily implemented nowadays the present computational work focuses on four operation schemes of all the 15 hydraulic lifting dams in cascade yet each hydraulic lifting dam can be operated independently and accordingly there can be a huge number of combinations of operation schemes for the 15 hydraulic lifting dams at least presently it is challenging to work out the most optimal operation scheme for minimal geomorphological changes i e a near equilibrium state of sediment transport and weak bed deformation on a time period of several years further optimization of the operation schemes has to be reserved for future studies 6 3 uncertainty in modelling it is recognized that uncertainty is inevitable from the 2d shsm model used in the present work albeit it is physically coupled and computationally efficient characterizing the current state of the art of shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic modelling most critically uncertainty arises from the closures for boundary resistance and sediment exchange with the bed as the manning roughness parameter continues to be a catch all factor including the effect of turbulence suppression by fine sediments and the empirical estimation of sediment exchange flux with the bed is case specific likewise second order terms due to turbulent diffusion dispersion and secondary flows in river bends are tentatively neglected in the momentum conservation equations so are the second order terms in the continuity equation for sediment this is because numerical tests for the yangtze river show merely marginal discrepancy in morphodynamic processes if these terms are taken into account cao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 in fact similar treatment can also be found in other studies mahnaz et al 2011 valiani and caleffi 2005 at the same time the closure modules to these terms involve much uncertainty while no observed data is available to calibrate the parameters thereof concurrently uncertainty may stem from the limited quality and unavailability of observed data that have to be used to specify initial and boundary conditions and to measure model performance specific to the study reach sediment dredging certainly affects the morphodynamic processes however no data is available for the period 2016 2017 in model calibration section s1 in supplementary material though dredging can be readily incorporated in the model see for instance hu et al 2019 hence the parameters calibrated inevitably bear uncertainty which can hardly be estimated quantitatively similarly the indexes nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percentage bias pbias gupta et al 1999 adopted in model calibration section s1 in supplementary material to evaluate the model performance bear limitations inevitably it is recognized that bosboom 2020 proposed three diagnostic tools for the spatial validation of 2d morphological predictions unfortunately the measured data used in model calibration are scattered over 34 css in a reach over 80 km making refined spatial validation unviable further it is noted that 1d shsm models have recently been extended to resolve uncertainty arising from various sources e g li et al 2021b and once 2d version are in place the newly emerging models are expected to provide more refined and physically enhanced understanding of morphodynamic processes as impacted by cascade movable weirs finally all the issues above highlight that the proposed 2d shsm model warrants further developments in terms of theoretical integrity and model performance when more elaborate data becomes available concerning the flow sediment and morphology of the middle fen river more well planned and systematic observations are certainly warranted not only to underpin further development of the model but to enhance the understanding of the morphodynamic processes thereof 7 conclusions the morphodynamic processes under the impact of 15 hydraulic lifting dams in cascade in the middle fen river are investigated four operation schemes of the dams are considered i e collapse of all the dams all year around ca operation of all the dams all year around oa all the dams collapse in flood seasons and operate in dry seasons cf only the dams in the main channel operate all year round om the present 2d computational modelling is based on the available input data for the flow and sediment in 2012 2015 and 2017 the cascade dams have a great effect on the morphodynamic processes the flow and sediment transport are considerably modified by the cascade dams on the reach scale thereby incurring considerable bed deformation on the sub reach scale both aggradation and degradation may result on the reach scale the ca and cf schemes induce net bed degradation whereas the oa and om schemes incur net bed aggradation though the bed in the main channel and on the floodplains may evolve in different ways aggradation only over the dam structures on the local scale the geomorphological changes are highly varied both spatially and temporally in line with the flow and sediment patterns especially under the operation scheme om based on the present finding a complex operation scheme of alternating cf and om annually is proposed to confine significant geomorphological changes in the middle fen river thereby protecting the riverbed from monotone aggradation or degradation over a period of several years it is recognized that uncertainty is inevitable from the 2d shsm model here which needs to be scrutinized by uncertainty analysis in the future studies in addition further developments of the proposed shsm model here are expected in terms of theoretical integrity and model performance therefore more well planned observations of streamflow sediment and morphology are warranted to further calibrate model parameters and validate model performance this should underpin further optimization of the operation schemes of the cascade hydraulic lifting dams on the middle fen river thereby facilitating scientific bases for the planning design and management of other

3980,cascade movable weirs have been increasingly widely used for river landscaping water storage and ecological wellbeing the weirs disturb the prior equilibrium in line with fluvial hydrology sediment transport and geomorphology and may lead to profound changes in the river of which however the understanding has so far remained poor here the first of its kind a computational modelling study is presented on the morphodynamic processes under the impact of cascade hydraulic lifting dams a type of movable weirs as to the middle fen river china a two dimensional shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic model is applied to resolve the fluvial processes which is physically coupled and computationally efficient based on finite volume method unstructured mesh local time stepping and parallel computing computational results show that the cascade dams alter the flow and sediment transport locally and on the reach scale in a distinct manner under different operation schemes which in turn incur disparate morphological changes collapse of all the dams all year round would lead to net degradation in the study reach with the floodplains aggrading and the main channel degrading operation of all the dams all year round may induce an overall aggradation both on the floodplains and in the main channel if all the dams collapse in flood seasons and operate in dry seasons cf degradation occurs in the main channel whereas the floodplains experience aggradation with a net degradation when only the dams in the main channel operate all year round om the floodplains degrade while the main channel aggrades resulting in a net aggradation in the study reach either aggradation or degradation may prevail locally on floodplains in main channel and individual subreaches the present findings lead us to propose a complex operation scheme of annually alternating cf and om to constrain significant morphological changes keywords morphodynamic process cascade movable weir

of a single dam dos santos et al 2018 mao et al 2020 wen et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 cascade low head dams are small in size in comparison with high dams whereas they still have considerable hydrological morphological and ecological influences on rivers bao et al 2020 best 2019 casserly et al 2020 chandesris et al 2019 mao et al 2020 santucci et al 2005 szatten and habel 2020 zhang et al 2020b for example check dams play an important role in the soil and water conservation project in the loess plateau china by impeding eroded sediments upstream wang et al 2016 although there have been a number of investigations on the influences of cascade large dams on rivers kondolf et al 2014 timpe and kaplan 2017 wang et al 2017 wen et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 and general effects of dams may

on streamflow dos santos et al 2018 habets et al 2014 and ecology bao et al 2020 chandesris et al 2019 mao et al 2020 santucci et al 2005 have been examined to date however little is known about the morphological effects of cascade low head dams though there has been a large number of studies over the last several decades on bed evolution in response to high dams e g the three gorges dam on the yangtze river and the xiaolangdi dam on the yellow river china actually once riverine hydrological conditions amount and timing of flood and sediment loading are modified by damming concomitant short term or long term bed evolution will occur potentially posing a threat to dam operation or even rising flood risk kondolf et al 2014 kumar et al 2021 moreover instream sediments are essential for ecology such as being carriers of chemicals and habitats of aquatic animals suggesting the necessity of tracing sediment transport bao et al 2020 in general enhanced understanding of the morphodynamic processes under the impact of cascade movable weirs is urgently warranted as fluvial flow sediment and morphology may interact with each other strongly cao et al 2017 this is particularly significant for the middle fen river china where fifteen hydraulic lifting dams have recently been built which will certainly elicit disturbance to the fluvial processes concurrently the middle fen river features bends and compound cross sections comprising a main channel and wide floodplains the bed material is mainly composed of silt and fine sand that could be easily eroded characterizing a likelihood of rather complicated and active interactions between fluvial flow sediment transport and geomorphology eventually all these may lead to global or local bed deformation that can add to flood risk or affect the normal operation and function of the dams while physical river modelling has remained costly and analytical solutions are viable only for largely simplified idealized cases ni et al 2018 mathematical river modelling has become increasingly proactive for practical fluvial processes over the last half a century or so it is noted that three dimensional modelling may not be realistic for large scale and long period fluvial processes due to high computing cost and one dimensional 1d modelling is too crude to be applicable thus two dimensional 2d modelling is most attractive for the present work featuring a sensible balance between theoretical integrity and applicability in fact shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic shsm models have witnessed significant developments over the last two decades or so cao et al 2017 from traditional uncoupled to coupled models cao et al 2004 from depth averaged single layer to double layer averaged models cao et al 2015 li et al 2013 li

such as in the yangtze river cao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 and other fluvial processes like dam break floods over erodible beds cao et al 2004 reservoir turbidity currents cao et al 2015 hu and li 2020 debris flows bouchut et al 2015 li et al 2018 landslide generated waves li et al 2019 and barrier lake formation and outburst li et al 2021a the aim of this paper is to investigate the morphodynamic processes responding to the fifteen hydraulic lifting dams in cascade on the middle fen river china a series of operation schemes of the cascade dams are evaluated focusing on the flow sediment and morphological processes locally and at subreach and reach scales the implications of the finding are elucidated to facilitate a complex operation scheme to constrain geomorphological changes it is organized as follows the middle fen river and cascade hydraulic lifting dams are introduced in section 2 the shsm model is outlined in section 3 the study cases are briefed in section 4 in section 5 the computed results are evaluated discussions on field observations suggestions on dam operation schemes and uncertainties in modelling are provided in section 6 followed by conclusions in section 7 2 study reach and hydraulic lifting dams the fen river basin has an area of 39 471 km2 and serves as the political economic and cultural center of shanxi province the fen river is the largest river in shanxi province and the second largest tributary of the yellow river with a total length of 716 km fig 1 a the flood season is from june to september and the dry season is from october to next may from headwater to lancun lc is the upper reach and from hongdong hd to the confluence joining yellow river is the lower reach fig 1a taiyuan fig 1a the provincial capital of shanxi features high water demand for industrial irrigational and domestic uses zhang et al 2020a relying largely on the middle fen river the study reach is located in the middle fen river from erba eb station approximately 38 km downstream of taiyuan to the confluence of the ciyao and fen rivers 13 km upstream of yitang yt station with a total length of approximately 80 km fig 1 there are four tributaries joining the main fen river within the study reach i e the changyuan river huiji river longfeng river and ciyao river the confluence of the wenyu and fen rivers lies at approximately 8 km upstream of the yt station fig 1a the main channel is typically 20 80 m wide with the floodplains roughly 150 290 m wide in the study reach fifteen hydraulic lifting dams 1 15 in cascade were constructed in 2016 2017 fig 1b and 2 the hydraulic lifting dam consists of a series of 6 m wide sluice gates which are placed in parallel with a height of 3 5 5 m in the main channel and a uniform height of 2 m on the floodplains fig 2 each sluice gate can be lifted almost vertically to the bottom during operation or collapse horizontally separately within 5 min each dam comprises mainly the main channel protections apron sluice gates stilling basin and apron extension of which more details are illustrated in section 4 2 3 methodology a 2d shsm model is applied for the present work since suspended sediment prevails in the middle fen river a single phase flow model is utilized the model is detailed in ni 2021 essentially extended from ni et al 2020 for fluvial flows incorporating sediment transport and bed deformation it has been validated by a set of laboratory experiments such as dam break flow over fixed bed with obstacles soares frazão and zech 2008 and dam break flow on mobile bed in an abruptly widening channel palumbo et al 2008 the governing equations model closure and numerical algorithm and computing of the 2d shsm model are outlined below 3 1 governing equations the governing equations are derived from mass and momentum conservation laws in fluid dynamics hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 and comprise the continuity and momentum equations for water sediment mixture flow eqs 1 3 and the equations for sediment transport eq 4 and bed deformation eq 5 as follows 1 h t h u x h v y e d 1 p 2 h u t x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v y g h z b x 1 ρ τ bx ρ s ρ w g

density of saturated riverbed τ bx and τ by are the bed shear stress components in the x and y directions respectively 3 2 model closure empirical relationships are introduced to determine the bed

is the friction coefficient and n is the manning roughness coefficient the sediment exchange between the bed and water sediment mixture flow is governed by entrainment and deposition physically controlled by turbulence and gravitation respectively however there are no universally applicable formulae for estimating sediment exchange flux to date in practice the estimation of sediment exchange flux is case specific in contrast to the non cohesive sands and gravels in the river reaches of the middle and lower yangtze river as studied in hu et al 2021 silt is dominant in the middle fen river the partheniades krone formula for cohesive sediment partheniades 1965 has been applied for modelling fluvial processes in the yellow river li et al 2017 van maren et al 2009 here it is introduced for the present work 7a e m ρ s τ b τ cr e 1 f o r τ b τ cr e 0 f o r τ b τ cr e 7b d ω c 1 τ b τ cr d f o r τ b τ cr d 0 f o r τ b τ cr d where m is the erosion rate τ cr e and τ cr d are the critical bed shear stresses for erosion and deposition respectively ω is the settling velocity of a single sediment particle and is calculated by zhang and xie s formula zhang and xie 1993 according to its applications in the yellow river li et al 2017 van maren et al 2009 the magnitude of m is 10 4 k g m 2 s and both critical bed shear stresses are usually set to 1 0 pa it is noted that given the sediment particle size 0 02 mm and concentration lower than 10 kg m3 as per the fen river flocculation hindered settling and turbulence damping are tentatively ignored 3 3 numerical algorithm and computing the governing equations are solved under the framework of cell centered finite volume method on unstructured meshes and are discretized explicitly with the operator splitting approach the harten lax and van leer approximate riemann solver with the influences of intermediate waves considered hllc toro 2001 is adopted to calculate the inter cell numerical fluxes a robust and well balanced approach is utilized to properly deal with the wet dry interfaces a splitting point implicit method is used to evaluate the bed shear stresses boundary conditions are implemented using the method of characteristics the local time stepping lts strategy is adopted the original code is written in fortran language with open multi processing openmp compiler directives that facilitate parallel computing the numerical algorithm and computing techniques are detailed in ni 2021 4 study case design 4 1 dam operation schemes to acquire physical insights into the morphodynamic processes under the impact of cascade hydraulic lifting dams in the middle fen river four cases are designed according to different dam operation schemes 1 all the dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains collapse all year round ca which is approximately equivalent to natural setting without the cascade dams 2 all the dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains operate all year round oa 3 all the dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains collapse in flood seasons and operate in dry seasons cf note that the discharge or the water level is not used here as the criterion for the dam operation and all the dams are adjusted simultaneously 4 only the dams in the main channel operate while the dams on the floodplains collapse all year round om in this scenario only the sluice gates in the main channel operate and those on the floodplains collapse the operation schemes of ca and oa are extreme cases and their computational results provide a range within which the solutions of cf and om cases lie in between while these four cases appear to be fairly idealized the present work is the first attempt on this topic leaving more complex operation schemes reserved for future studies 4 2 model set up the computational domain is defined as follows the upstream boundary is defined at the inlet cross section at the eb station the outlet boundary is set to be the cross section located 4 km upstream of the yt station the lateral boundary is aligned with the embankments the computational domain is divided by unstructured mesh which is refined based on the river center line and the layout plan of the 15 dams with the minimum mesh sizes being 13 m and 2 m for the main channel and dam structures respectively the total number of meshes is 166 167 with 86 731 nodes the bed topography is interpolated based on the 176 cross sections css measured from may to oct 2017 with an average spacing of 500 m the elevations of the dam structures are directly given in line with the layout plan note that the dam structures are made of manual materials such as concrete or gabion so that the bottom is non erodible fig 3 shows the comparison of the satellite image layout plan computational mesh and initial bed topography around dam 6 with the dam structures well captured the model is calibrated against observed data of the middle fen river for a two year period from jan 2016 to dec 2017 before the cascade hydraulic lifting dams were in place of which more details are provided in section s1 of the supplementary material the parameters are as follows the manning roughness coefficients for the main channel nm and floodplains nf are 0 020 and 0 050 respectively m 0 5 1 0 4 kg m2 s τ cr e 1 6 pa and τ cr e 1 6 pa according to field measurements the annual average medium size of suspended sediment was 0 017 mm during this time and the bed porosity is equal to 0 44 4 3 model drivers the fluvial processes during a three year period are resolved for understanding the morphodynamic processes over a reasonably long period of time and also a viable computing time there are two hydrological stations fig 1a i e eb and yt stations in the study reach yet there are only two hydrological stations on the five tributaries involved i e pantuo pt station on changyuan river and wenyu wy station on wenyu river fig 1a the observed daily average discharges q and suspended sediment concentrations ssc at the eb station in the sequence of hydrological years 2017 2015 and 2012 are used to specify the upstream boundary conditions and the corresponding observed daily average discharges at the pt and wy stations are adopted for the tributaries fig 4 a steady flow is first calculated with a certain discharge and then taken as the initial condition for the subsequent computation the calculations of boundary and initial conditions are detailed in section s1 of supplementary material due to lack of relevant data the present computational modelling needs to invite two assumptions i the sediment load from the tributaries is negligible and ii suspended sediment transport prevails whilst bedload is negligible these assumptions are acceptable because the tributaries possess low discharges as compared with the main fen river and the sediment on the riverbed of the middle fen river is mainly silt it is noted that based on the observed data at the eb and yt stations the whole reach featured weak bed degradation during the 2012 2017 period nevertheless the years of 2012 2015 and 2017 feature relatively large sediment yield and small runoff which is likely to cause bed aggradation so as to increase flood risk and affect the normal operation of the dams therefore the sequence of 2017 2015 and 2012 is selected herewith to specify the boundary conditions in fact more sequences of q and ssc combined based on the data of 2012 2015 and 2017 have been applied to specify the boundary conditions and the conclusions hold as described below cao et al 2020 5 results 5 1 flow and sediment processes on reach scale the first hydrological year features a high flood so the flow and sediment processes in its flood season are evaluated here fig 5 shows the discharge and stage hydrographs at css immediately upstream of dams 1 and 6 and the outlet cross section the x axis represents the number of days from 1st jun the stages shown in fig 5b d and f are the lowest water levels at the cross sections typically lower than the highest by less than 0 1 m the river floods propagate downstream in a relatively natural regime under the ca scheme while the extreme oa scheme leads to the initial static state of flow in june then the stage experiences a sharp increase to its maximum level behind the dams after which the floods propagate over the top of the sluice gates the hydrographs of cf and om cases are between those of ca and oa cases when entering dry season after 122 days 1st oct the cf case exhibits the same process of water storage behind the dams as in the oa case resulting in a rapid decrease of discharge and stage at the outlet cross section note that the flow discharges are higher and floods last longer at the outlet cross section due to the contributions of the four tributaries joining into the main fen river downstream of dam 7 fig 6 shows the time series of ssc at css immediately upstream of dams 1 6 10 and the outlet cross section in the om case as shown in fig 4b the peak ssc at the eb station during floods in jul and oct are 5 03 and 4 99 kg m3 respectively both of which experience attenuation along the river in the om case table 1 lists the evolutions of peak ssc at these four css in all cases which shows a similar pattern of attenuation but an appreciable difference in its rate the maximum attenuation is seen in the oa case due to the operation of dams both in the main channel and on the floodplains succinctly on the reach scale the flow discharge and stage hydrographs and suspended sediment transport processes are considerably altered by the cascade dams under different operation schemes implying different morphological responses in the reach as follows 5 2 reach scale bed deformation fig 7 shows the accumulated volumes of bed deformation δ v for all cases with positive and negative values representing bed aggradation and degradation respectively only bed aggradation could occur over the dam structures that are non erodible and δ v of the whole reach fig 7a is equal to the sum of δ v over dam structures the floodplains and main channel fig 7b d it is seen in fig 7a that 1 bed degrades in the ca case with a total amount of around 200 000 m3 2 bed aggrades in the oa case with a total amount of approximately 100 000 m3 3 bed degrades in the cf case with a volume of 50 000 m3 after three years 4 bed aggrades under the om scheme with the three year δ v value being about 75 000 m3 5 the ca and oa cases feature strongest bed degradation and aggradation respectively between which the geomorphological changes of cf and om cases lie in 6 the year 2015 features the smallest runoff and sediment yield so bed deformation is minor during this period fig 7b shows that sediments deposit over dam structures in all the cases the deposition amounts are diverse in different cases with the maximum value in the ca case and the minimum value in the oa case the main channel protections and apron are made of gabion whose surface is rough and could decrease the flow velocity the bottom of the stilling basin is 0 5 m lower than its surrounding areas so that water tends to impound there resulting in relatively smaller velocity these two factors favor sediment deposition furthermore it can be inferred from fig 7b that if the dams operate for a longer period sediments deposit less over the dam structures this is because when the dams operate in oa cf and om cases the sediments from the inlet cross section tend to deposit behind the dams especially the first dam instead of passing through the sluice gates and depositing over dam structures fig 7c and d show that the floodplains aggrade most and the main channel degrades most both in the ca case where the study reach is in a relatively natural regime i e aggradation on the floodplains and degradation in the main channel during flood seasons note that the streamflow and sediment yield of the fen river concentrate in flood seasons so bed evolution is pronounced during this period in the oa case the floodplains undergo merely a slight aggradation of about 10 000 m3 and the main channel aggrades by an amount of approximately 80 000 m3 this is because the operation of all the dams impounds water along the whole reach leading to an overall low velocity conducive to sediment deposition only in the om case the floodplains degrade since they play a leading role in flow passage where the flow is shallower and faster as compared with that in the impounded main channel among all the four schemes the main channel aggrades most under the om scheme as under the cf and ca schemes all the dams collapse in flood seasons when streamflow is large and sediment transport is active the patterns of bed evolution of these two cases possess similarities both qualitatively and quantitatively with the absolute δ v values in the cf case smaller than those in the ca case fig 8 illustrates the initial river thalweg and the changes after 1 2 and 3 years at the 15 css immediately upstream of each dam the ca case experiences the greatest fall of thalweg among all the cases while the thalweg in the cf case is slightly higher due to sediment deposition in dry seasons when the dams operate under the oa and om schemes the thalwegs exhibit minor alternation except for the rises in the upstream subreaches these patterns presented in fig 8 agree well with bed deformation shown in fig 7 briefly the oa case features the maximum net aggradation and the ca case is characterized by the maximum net degradation in the whole reach while bed deformation in the cf and om cases lies in between yet bed deformation over the dam structures in the main channel and over the floodplains features disparate patterns it is noted that the middle fen river is characterized by compound cross sections and the sluice gates in the main channel and on the floodplains operate distinctively under the om scheme in this regard evaluating the morphodynamic processes on the local scale is warranted section 5 4 5 3 subreach scale bed deformation to probe into the bed deformation in the longitudinal direction the study reach is divided into 16 subreaches according to the locations of the 15 dams except for the first subreach each subreach contains one dam in its upper part table 2 lists the name and length of each subreach with square brackets and parentheses representing the inclusion and exclusion of the dam respectively fig 9 shows the amounts of bed deformation of all the subreaches of which the intensities are presented in section s2 of supplementary material it is shown in fig 9 that the computed bed deformation in the 16 subreaches in both ca and cf cases does not have a definite pattern with bed degradation and aggradation alternating both spatially and temporally this is because when all the dams collapse ca the study reach is in a relatively natural regime under the cf scheme the dams collapse in flood seasons when streamflow and sediment yield concentrate eliminating the effects of dams however the construction of the dams itself has an impact on the morphological evolution such as sediment deposition over dam structures fig 9a and b illustrate that the subreach scale morphological changes are more severe in the ca case both in terms of bed degradation and aggradation than in the cf case fig 9c and d show the predicted bed deformation in the oa and om cases with a very prominent aggradation in the first subreach and much milder aggradation and then degradation downstream the first subreach features extremely large amount of nearly 100 000 m3 in the oa case which is still 30 000 m3 greater than that in the om case the last subreaches degrade in both oa and om cases since the majority of sediments transported from upper subreaches have deposited upstream of dam 15 inducing a sediment starved flow briefly there are more subreaches featuring bed degradation of higher intensities in the ca and cf cases than in the oa and om cases where most subreaches exhibit minor or even marginal bed deformation in addition it is noted that in both oa and om cases the first subreach experiences overwhelmingly strong aggradation 5 4 local hydraulics sediment transport and bed deformation under the om scheme the topography varies significantly around the joining points of the standing and falling sluice gates where the streamflow and sediment transport would adjust accordingly facilitating spatially complicated scenario of bed deformation therefore the om case is selected here to demonstrate local morphodynamic processes echoing section 5 1 the computed results are evaluated for the flood season in the first hydrological year dam 6 is chosen as an example figs 10 14 show the distributions of water depth velocity bed shear stress ssc and bed elevation change around dam 6 all of which exhibit considerable increases during the rising phase of the flood from t 30 d to t 92 d and decreases over the recession phase of the flood from t 92 d to t 122 d the sluice gates of dam 6 in the main channel have a height of 3 5 m so the maximum depth of the impounded water is about 2 3 m at 92 d the stilling basin is constructed to be 0 5 lower so that the water depth there is deeper by some 0 5 m it can be inferred from fig 10 that the cross sections behind the dam are asymmetric with the flow near the right bank 0 3 m deeper due to the impediment of dam 6 in the main channel the flow moves slowly in the main channel upstream of dam 6 fig 11 however the flow accelerates on the floodplains next to the standing sluice gates in the main channel due to the reduction of cross sectional area downstream of dam 6 water flows back into the main channel the distributions of bed shear stress follow the patterns of those of water depth and flow velocity fig 12 with regions featuring higher speed and shallower depth displaying greater bed shear stress accordingly this agrees with the equation of bed shear stress eq 6 in this regard a larger bed shear stress namely a greater capability of erosion characterizes the apron extensions on the floodplains downstream of dam 6 as well as the right side of the floodplains the bed shear stress is low in the main channel especially upstream of dam 6 favouring sediment deposition as shown in fig 13 ssc alters dramatically before during and after the floods one month after entering the flood season ssc is very low fig 13a which is consistent with the measured ssc shown in fig 4b where ssc keeps a zero value before and after big floods four days after the first peak discharge 108 m3 s from the inlet cross section ssc reaches a value of 0 01 kg m3 with a larger value of 0 04 kg m3 along the right side of floodplains fig 13b the regions around the sluice gates featuring the largest bed shear stress fig 12b do not possess high ssc fig 13b since the dam structures are non erodible three days after the second peak discharge 57 m3 s arriving at the inlet cross section a ssc value of 0 04 kg m3 is achieved fig 13c when the flood falls down at t 122 d ssc drops back to 0 01 kg m3 fig 13d fig 14 illustrates the bed elevation changes as compared to the initial bed elevation fig 3d with positive and negative values indicating local aggradation and degradation respectively the main channel experiences continuous aggradation with a global increase of bed elevation by the order of centimeters e g 0 02 m behind dam 6 at t 122 d two zones featuring approximately 0 1 m deep degradation can be observed on both sides of the floodplains downstream of dam 6 at 61 d where the flow mainly passes during floods fig 14b then these two zones degrade further in depth and area as flood propagates fig 14c and d with a final degradation of 0 3 m on the right side of the floodplains at 122 d these two zones are surrounded by the main channel protections and apron extensions where high bed shear stresses present fig 12 and while the dam structures are non erodible the flows over the rest of these regions on the floodplains are equipped with great ability to erode sediments from the bed in addition the asymmetry of the cross sections induces a larger flow on the right side of the floodplains therefore the local degradation is significant on the right side of the floodplains downstream of dam 6 the eroded sediments then move downstream with the streamflow which decelerates after passing through the dam due to the lateral widening of the channel resulting in aggradation downstream of the eroded path on the right side of the channel fig 14d in brief considerable morphological changes may occur locally where fluvial processes respond strongly to the dam structures which warrants close attention when deciding operation schemes and management of the cascade hydraulic lifting dams 6 discussions 6 1 field observation the fifteen hydraulic lifting dams on the middle fen river have been collapsing for more than three years after construction which actually corresponds to the ca scheme fig 15 a shows the photograph around dam 15 taken in mar 2021 as indicated by the red rectangular in fig 15a sediment deposited on the dam structures in the main channel while the surfaces of the dam structures on the floodplains saw marginal sediment deposition fig 15b and c show the contours of computed bed elevation change around dam 6 in the ca case with the greatest increase of bed elevation occurring in the main channel over the dam structures which is slightly lower than 0 6 m after three years fig 15c qualitatively these computed results fig 15b and c agree with the field observation fairly well fig 15a essentially the comparison constitutes a reasonable validation of the present shsm model unfortunately a quantitative comparison is hampered due to lack of observed data for flow sediment and morphology during the period from 2018 to 2020 6 2 suggestion on dam operation scheme given the computed results above a complex operation scheme of alternating cf and om annually is recommended the measured data and also the computational results show that the study reach features global bed degradation in a relatively natural regime without the hydraulic lifting dams or under the ca scheme however the ca scheme cannot make use of the dams at all the oa scheme is able to exploit the cascade dams to the maximum extent while global aggradation and severe local deposition in the upper subreaches would raise flood risk thus it is not desirable for a long term although strong deposition occurs under the om scheme and over dam structures under the cf scheme they are complementary to one another in terms of reach scale bed deformation as bed evolution on the floodplains and in the main channel evolves in opposite ways hence as far as these four operation schemes are concerned the cf and om schemes are sensible choices when necessary the ca scheme is suggested to erode the main channel which would otherwise aggrade under the om scheme it is noted that the first subreach aggrades heavily under the om scheme and the flow is highly complicated as the river features a main channel and wide floodplains and at the same time impacted by the cascade dam structures especially under the om scheme local aggradation may be inevitable in these circumstances local dredging may be necessary which can be readily implemented nowadays the present computational work focuses on four operation schemes of all the 15 hydraulic lifting dams in cascade yet each hydraulic lifting dam can be operated independently and accordingly there can be a huge number of combinations of operation schemes for the 15 hydraulic lifting dams at least presently it is challenging to work out the most optimal operation scheme for minimal geomorphological changes i e a near equilibrium state of sediment transport and weak bed deformation on a time period of several years further optimization of the operation schemes has to be reserved for future studies 6 3 uncertainty in modelling it is recognized that uncertainty is inevitable from the 2d shsm model used in the present work albeit it is physically coupled and computationally efficient characterizing the current state of the art of shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic modelling most critically uncertainty arises from the closures for boundary resistance and sediment exchange with the bed as the manning roughness parameter continues to be a catch all factor including the effect of turbulence suppression by fine sediments and the empirical estimation of sediment exchange flux with the bed is case specific likewise second order terms due to turbulent diffusion dispersion and secondary flows in river bends are tentatively neglected in the momentum conservation equations so are the second order terms in the continuity equation for sediment this is because numerical tests for the yangtze river show merely marginal discrepancy in morphodynamic processes if these terms are taken into account cao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 in fact similar treatment can also be found in other studies mahnaz et al 2011 valiani and caleffi 2005 at the same time the closure modules to these terms involve much uncertainty while no observed data is available to calibrate the parameters thereof concurrently uncertainty may stem from the limited quality and unavailability of observed data that have to be used to specify initial and boundary conditions and to measure model performance specific to the study reach sediment dredging certainly affects the morphodynamic processes however no data is available for the period 2016 2017 in model calibration section s1 in supplementary material though dredging can be readily incorporated in the model see for instance hu et al 2019 hence the parameters calibrated inevitably bear uncertainty which can hardly be estimated quantitatively similarly the indexes nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percentage bias pbias gupta et al 1999 adopted in model calibration section s1 in supplementary material to evaluate the model performance bear limitations inevitably it is recognized that bosboom 2020 proposed three diagnostic tools for the spatial validation of 2d morphological predictions unfortunately the measured data used in model calibration are scattered over 34 css in a reach over 80 km making refined spatial validation unviable further it is noted that 1d shsm models have recently been extended to resolve uncertainty arising from various sources e g li et al 2021b and once 2d version are in place the newly emerging models are expected to provide more refined and physically enhanced understanding of morphodynamic processes as impacted by cascade movable weirs finally all the issues above highlight that the proposed 2d shsm model warrants further developments in terms of theoretical integrity and model performance when more elaborate data becomes available concerning the flow sediment and morphology of the middle fen river more well planned and systematic observations are certainly warranted not only to underpin further development of the model but to enhance the understanding of the morphodynamic processes thereof 7 conclusions the morphodynamic processes under the impact of 15 hydraulic lifting dams in cascade in the middle fen river are investigated four operation schemes of the dams are considered i e collapse of all the dams all year around ca operation of all the dams all year around oa all the dams collapse in flood seasons and operate in dry seasons cf only the dams in the main channel operate all year round om the present 2d computational modelling is based on the available input data for the flow and sediment in 2012 2015 and 2017 the cascade dams have a great effect on the morphodynamic processes the flow and sediment transport are considerably modified by the cascade dams on the reach scale thereby incurring considerable bed deformation on the sub reach scale both aggradation and degradation may result on the reach scale the ca and cf schemes induce net bed degradation whereas the oa and om schemes incur net bed aggradation though the bed in the main channel and on the floodplains may evolve in different ways aggradation only over the dam structures on the local scale the geomorphological changes are highly varied both spatially and temporally in line with the flow and sediment patterns especially under the operation scheme om based on the present finding a complex operation scheme of alternating cf and om annually is proposed to confine significant geomorphological changes in the middle fen river thereby protecting the riverbed from monotone aggradation or degradation over a period of several years it is recognized that uncertainty is inevitable from the 2d shsm model here which needs to be scrutinized by uncertainty analysis in the future studies in addition further developments of the proposed shsm model here are expected in terms of theoretical integrity and model performance therefore more well planned observations of streamflow sediment and morphology are warranted to further calibrate model parameters and validate model performance this should underpin further optimization of the operation schemes of the cascade hydraulic lifting dams on the middle fen river thereby facilitating scientific bases for the planning design and management of other

3981,the detachment rate of partially thawed frozen soil supplies data sets to compute the soil erodibility and critical shear strength in rill erosion model this research aims to investigate the effect of slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth on detachment rate under partially thawed condition the detachment rates of partially thawed soil rill were estimated under three thawed soil depths 1 2 5 cm four slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and three flow rates 1 2 4 l min they were then computed with the sediment concentrations measured along different slope lengths of 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 m results show that the detachment rates on a partially thawed soil slope as a function of rill length are piecewise functions which initially maintain a constant value before decreasing exponentially with rill length in the constant detachment rate section the constant detachment rate increased with thawed soil depth after the constant detachment rate section it increased with slope gradient and flow rate but decreased with the increase in thawed soil depth the detachment rate decreased fast with the increase in slope gradient and flow rate the computed detachment rates fitted by stepwise functions produced high coefficient of determination thereby indicating a good correlation of detachment rate with rill length the parameters critical rill length constant detachment rate potential detachment capacity and reduction coefficient of detachment rate in the piecewise function were regressed with stepwise regression method they determined the effects of those four parameters on detachment rate the influence of flow rate on critical rill length and thawed soil depth on reduction coefficient of detachment rate was limited the combined impacts of slope gradient and flow rate were positively related to those four parameters this study quantified the effect of slope flow rate and thawed soil depth on detachment rate and help to quantify the soil detachment rate in cold region keywords detachment rate partially thawed soil thawed soil depth slope gradient flow rate 1 introduction soil erosion involves the detachment deposition and transportation of soil particles by erosive agents such as water flow and wind ellison 1947 rill erosion on hillslopes can cause serious soil loss over cultivated slopes nearing et al 1997 zheng and tang 1997 gyssels et al 2002 detachment is an important process that is directly related with the delivery or transportation of sediments thereby leading to soil degradation owoputi and stolte 1995 the detachment rate needs to be considered in the modeling research of soil erosion sharma et al 1995 cochrane and flanagan 1996 franti et al 1999 giménez and govers 2002 flow induced detachment is an important parameter in soil erosion models such as water erosion predict project wepp foster et al 1977 other soil erosion models also use this factor to predict soil erosion foster et al 1989 morgan et al 1993 profitt et al 1993 the detachment rate and sediment concentration in flow water were interactively related by foster et al 1977 they suggested a coupling equation to model the function of detachment and sediment load scientists experimentally found that the detachment rate is remarkably affected by sediment load lei et al 2002 merten et al 2001 zhang et al 2005 in accordance with the wepp model the rill detachment rate is functionally related to soil erodibility parameter sediment transport capacity critical shear stress of the soil and sediment concentration in water flow nearing et al 1989 foster et al 1989 flanagan and nearing 1995 cochrane and flanagan 1996 the rill detachment rate is given as follows 1 d r k r τ τ c 1 qc t c where dr is the detachment rate under unit area per unit time kg s m2 kr is the soil erodibility parameter s m τ is the shear strength of water flow pa τ c is the critical soil shear strength pa q is the unit width flow rate m2 s c is the sediment concentration in water flow kg m3 tc is the sediment transport capacity of water flow kg m s the rill erosion and sediment transport are described in the wepp model they represent the interaction of detachment rate and sediment concentration in water flow nearing et al 1989 flanagan and nearing 1995 the detachment rate decreases with the increase in sediment load in water flow because the sediments consume the energy of water flow to reduce the ability of detachment when the sediment load reaches the sediment transport capacity the rill detachment rate decreases to zero the detachment rate also affects the increase in the sediment concentration in water flow the detachment rate represents the rate of water flow to detach soil particle and determines the increase rate of sediment concentration moore and burch 1986 merten et al 2001 in accordance with the detachment rate distribution along the rill over nonfrozen soil slope zhang et al 2014 suggested a function to quantify the relationship between the detachment rate and rill length as follows 2 d x a e b x where a is a regression coefficient defined as the detachment rate at x 0 b is a constant to quantify the decrease rate of detachment rate along the rill 1 m x is the rill length m d x is the detachment rate as a function of slope length kg m2 s the soil detachment on partially thawed soil slope is seldom studied in cold areas with freeze and thaw cycle partially thawed soil layer featured with shallow thawed soil depth causes serious soil erosion and loss sharratt et al 2000 2001 lentz et al 1993 auzet et al 1993 kurylyk et al 2014 øygarden 2003 the detachment rate has differences over frozen and partially thawed soil slope in cold regions compared with nonfrozen soil the thawed of frozen soil affects several factors and determines the detachment rate as shown in eq 1 the detachment rate is affected by the hydraulic condition of water flow the water flow velocity over frozen soil slope is higher than that over nonfrozen soil slope ban et al 2016 chen et al 2017 the higher flow velocity over partially thawed frozen soil slope indicates higher kinetic energy of water flow with higher water shear and detach forces compared with nonfrozen soil slope in addition to the hydraulics of water flow the detachment rate is strongly influenced by soil properties such as soil type texture cohesion and soil strength khanbilvardi and rogowski 1986 nearing et al 1988 owoputi 1994 the freeze thaw ft process breaks down the soil structure and particle cohesion to weaken the soil strength kok and mccool 1990 ferrick and gatto 2005 thereby affecting the soil detachment rate scientists recognized that the ft process determines high erodibility of soil bryan 2000 van klaveren and mccool 1998 the cohesion strength of thawed frozen silt loam is significantly reduced compared with its original value after one ft cycle formanek et al 1984 when the frozen soil is partially thawed the physical properties are greatly affected and the detachment rate gets higher than that of non frozen soil and total thawed soil the detachment rate is also influenced by the sediment supplied over soil slope over partially thawed soil slope insufficient supply of soil particles to detach water flow can reduce the sediment detachment rate the deficiency of sediment supply over partially thawed soil slope determines that the sediment concentration in water flow increases slowly with slope length thereby limiting the increase in detachment rate this study aims to 1 calculate the soil detachment rate along eroding rill length in accordance with the experimental data of sediment concentration under different hydraulic conditions 2 suggest the functional relationship between detachment rate and slope length 3 analyze the effect mechanism of thawed soil depth on the detachment rate of partially thawed soil 2 method 2 1 computational method for rill detachment rate the rill detachment rate is defined as the mass of soil particles being removed from a unit surface area during a unit time the sediment concentration increases with rill length because the water flow detaches soil particles along the slope continually before the sediment concentration reaches the maximum value when the water flow passes through the slope length of x m the sediment concentration reaches to c when the rill length increases to x δ x the sediment concentration increases to c δ c during time increment δ t the sediment concentration increment δ c is caused by the soil particles detached from the rill length of δ x the sediment load c q in the water flow increases to c δ c q the surface area of rill segment in which the soil particles are detached is estimated as δ x w the average detachment rate along the rill segment δ x is estimated as follows 3 d r c δ c c q δ x w q δ c δ x where x is the rill length m c is the sediment concentration kg m3 q is the flow rate m3 s q is the unit width flow rate m2 s w is the mean width of the rill segment m dr is the rill detachment rate kg m2 s 2 2 distribution of detachment rate with rill length flume experiments were conducted to study the distribution of sediment concentration with rill length under different hydrodynamic condition chen et al 2021 a soil flume system designed by ban et al 2016 was applied to realize the designed thaw depth of frozen soil in 1d from the top to the bottom soil flumes were made of steel of 2 or 3 m in length 10 cm in width and 12 cm in depth the soil materials were filled into the flumes to 10 cm to a bulk density of 1 1 g cm3 before being saturated the prepared flumes were kept in a freezer for 24 h under the temperature between 25 and 15 the flumes were removed from the freezer to be put on to the experimental platform after the soil materials in flumes were completely frozen the thawing system of frozen soil flumes was assembled with ice boxes in all directions except the top the frozen soil in the flumes was thawed to the designed depth experimental water flow was supplied by a water tank filled with mixture of water and ice cubes for controlling water temperature approximately to 0 steady water flow rate was supplied with a peristaltic pump for soil erosion experiments three main variables were taken into consideration to study the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length the sediment concentrations were measured at nine rill lengths 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 m under four slope gradients 5 10 15 and 20 three flow rates 1 2 and 4 l min and three thawed soil depths 1 2 and 5 cm with the datasets of sediment concentration and rill length reported by chen et al 2021 the distribution of rill detachment rate along rill length can be determined under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed depth the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length under partially thawed soil slope measured by chen et al 2021 is different from that under nonfrozen soil slope by zhang et al 2014 over partially thawed soil slope the function models of sediment concentration and rill length used by chen et al 2021 are piecewise functions this model exhibits that the sediment concentration initially increases linearly with rill length until the sediment concentration reaches to a certain value before it decreases exponentially with rill length the function of sediment concentration and rill length under the circumstance of partially thawed soil determines that the detachment rate needs to be regressed with a piecewise model to fit the series data of detachment rate 2 3 conceptual model for the detachment rate of partially thawed soil in accordance with the sediment rill functional format chen et al 2021 we have 4 c kx x x 0 a 1 e b x x x 0 where k is the increase rate of sediment concentration with rill length kg m4 a is the maximum sediment concentration under the condition of partially thawed soil slope kg m3 b is the reduction rate of sediment concentration increase with rill length 1 m x0 is the critical rill length at which the linear increase in sediment becomes an exponential increase m the detachment rates for frozen thawed slopes can be conceptually presented in fig 1 the detachment rates are conceptually divided into different situations the one in circular symbols in fig 1 conceptually represents the rill detachment rate of a nonfrozen soil slope this detachment rate follows a typical exponential function with rill length as suggested by zhang et al 2014 the one in square symbols presents the rill detachment rate of a partially thawed soil slope this curve consists of two distinguishable parts in the first part the line denoted by square dots that is horizontally distributed with rill length to indicate insufficient supply of soil particles to limit the increase of sediments in water flow so that the detachment rate remained constant thus the detachment rate is limited by sediment supply and remains constant when the rill length increase to a certain level sediment load in water flow increase to a level so that the detachment rate becomes being limited by sediment load in the water flow thus the detachment rate decreases exponentially in accordance with the functional relationship of sediment concentration and rill length a conceptual model for the detachment rate of partially thawed soil is proposed to fit the detachment rate data sets partially thawed soil slope may influence the soil erosion because limited thawed soil depth determines the sediment for water flow to detach as shown in fig 1 the detachment rate remains a constant value at the first section thereby illustrating the insufficient sediment supplied by partially thawed soil slope for the water flow to detach if the partially thawed soil slope can supply sufficient soil particles the detachment rate starts to decrease exponentially with rill length this factor is defined as the potential detachment rate distributed as the dashed line shown in fig 1 the intersection point of detachment curve with the y axis represents potential detachment rate when the rill length was zero the potential detachment rate is defined as the potential detachment capacity when the rill length exceeds the critical rill length x 0 the detachment rate decreases exponentially with the increase in rill length under this circumstance the detachment rate is determined by the detachment rate of sediment laden flow the higher the sediment concentration in water flow the lower the detachment rate in fig 1 the intersection points of a line parallel to the x axis and the exponential curve represents the critical rill length x0 the functional relationship between detachment rate and rill length under partially thawed soil slope can be regressed by equations as follows 5 d r k x x 0 a e b x x x 0 where dr is the detachment rate kg s m2 a b are the regressed parameters k is the constant detachment rate kg s m2 x0 is the critical rill length m the exponential function would be applied to regress the detachment rates from x0 to x along slope length as shown in fig 1 the detachment rate constant k was determined by the average detachment rate from x 0 to x x0 the critical rill length is the intersection of the horizontal line and the exponential curve which is obtained with the following function 6a a e b x 0 k 6 x 0 1 b ln k a 3 result and discussion 3 1 relationship between detachment rate and rill length the sediments in water flow derived from detachment and transport increase with rill length thereby consuming more energy of water flow to convey these sediments the energy used to detach soil particles decreases the detachment rate gradually decreases to zero zhang et al 2014 the computed detachment rates under different slope gradients and flow rates are presented in fig 2 at the beginning of the rill the detachment rate reaches the maximum value under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm as shown in fig 2 the detachment rate has a good correlation with rill length which decreases exponentially with the increase in rill length under thawed soil depth of 5 cm this finding agrees with the conclusion of zhang et al 2014 under the condition of nonfrozen soil the water flow does not cut the soil to the frozen layer under this circumstance the frozen soil layer has no effect on the erosion the thawed soil layer is capable to supply sufficient soil particles for water to detach under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm the trend of detachment rate decreases exponentially with rill length over nonfrozen soil slope figures a c d f h j and k m represent the detachment rate along rill length under slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 with thawed soil depth of 1 2 and 5 cm under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively for shallow thawed soil depths the detachment rates are piecewise functions with rill length when the frozen soil was partially thawed to a shallow depth the detachment rate is a constant value before the rill length reached the critical value and decreases exponentially with the further increase in rill length the water flow detaches the soil particles at a constant rate that is the increase rate of sediment remains a constant value under this condition insufficient sediment supply from partially thawed soil slope limits the increase in detachment rate thereby limiting the increase rate of sediment as shown in fig 2 distinct difference is found on the detachment rates under different thawed soil depths of frozen soil this condition presents that the shallower thawed frozen soil depth has larger detachment rates than that over deeper thawed soil depth ban et al 2016 concluded in their research that the water flow velocity over frozen soil slope is higher than that over nonfrozen soil slope the flow velocity represents the energy of water flow this factor determines that the higher the flow velocity the higher the capacity of water flow to detach soil particles thus the shallower the thawed soil depth of frozen soil results in the higher detachment rate of water flow apart from the thawed soil depth the flow rate has a significant influence on detachment rate in accordance with eq 2 the detachment rate is determined by the product of unit width flow rate and the variance ratio of sediment with rill length this condition can be the reason that the flow rate is a vital factor affecting the detachment rate under the low slope gradient of 5 the increase in detachment rate is high with the increase in flow rate as presented in fig 2 the detachment rates under the flow rate of 2 l min are approximately 4 times higher than that of 1 l min whereas the detachment rates under the flow rate of 4 l min are approximately 3 times as high as that of 2 l min with the increase in slope gradient the effect of flow rate on detachment rate decreases the slope gradient plays a significant role to affect the detachment rate under the same flow rate the detachment rate increases with the slope gradient at the decreased rate until the slope gradient of 15 with the increase in slope gradient to 20 the detachment rate does not increase and remains steady with the increase in flow rate the increase rate in detachment rate decreases after the slope gradient reaches to 15 the detachment rate remains steady and no longer varies 3 2 model to quantify the detachment rate along the slope as shown in fig 2 the detachment rates are piecewise functions of rill length under partially thawed soil the detachment rate is constant before the rill length reaches the critical value and then decreases exponentially with the further increase in rill length under the thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm hence the detachment rate is fitted with function eq 5 under the thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm the rill depth is shallower than 5 cm and does not reach the frozen soil layer thus the frozen soil layer has no effects on the soil erosion and detachment rate under this circumstance the detachment rate decreases exponentially with the increase in rill length therefore the detachment rate is fitted with function eq 3 under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm the yielded correlation coefficients range from 0 7 to 0 99 by fitting the experimental data with the two function models given in eq 5 the high correlation coefficients indicate that the models can fit the experimental data well 3 2 1 critical rill length of detachment rate x0 as shown in fig 2 the detachment rates are piecewise functions of slope length under shallow thawed frozen soil the first section of the function is a constant value and the second section is a curve that decreases exponentially with rill length the x coordinate of the intersection point of the two functions is termed as the critical rill length the critical rill length separates into two different distributions of detachment rate fig 3 displays the values of critical rill length under different thawed soil depths flow rates and slope gradients the critical rill lengths of the thawed soil depth of 1 cm are longer than those of 2 cm under all hydraulic conditions as shown in fig 3 the series data of critical rill length of thawed soil depth 1 and 2 cm under different flow rates and slope gradients are linearly regressed the ratio of the series data is 1 698 which means the x 0 of thawed soil depth 1 cm is about 69 8 longer than those of thawed soil depth 2 cm in general this effect is more significant under lower slope gradient compared with higher slope gradient fig 3 the slope gradient causes a great effect on critical rill length as observed in fig 3 the critical rill length is the maximum under the slope gradient of 5 and decreases with the increase in slope gradient the critical rill length decreases greatly with the increase in slope gradient from 5 to 10 it decreases slowly with the further increase in slope gradient when the slope gradient increase to 15 and 20 the critical rill lengths are approximately the same it also can be observed in fig 3 that the values of critical rill length of different flow rates are very close under the same slope gradient and thawed soil depth various impact factors significantly led to differences between critical rill length and slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth to quantify the influences of key factors and their interactions on critical rill length multivariable linear regression equation was applied to relate x 0 to different factors 7 x 0 a 1 a 2 s 2 a 3 q 2 a 4 d 2 a 5 s q a 6 s d a 7 q d a 8 s a 9 q a 10 d where x 0 is critical rill length m s is stands for slope gradient m m q is flow rate of unit rill width m2 s a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 a 9 and a 10 are regression coefficients stepwise regression method with eq 7 was applied to analysis the experiment data by spss statistics software the regression model of critical rill length is shown as follows 8 x 0 3 563 408 120 s d the regression model eq 8 fits well with the data set with coefficient of determination r2 equals 0 890 standard error is 0 885 linear function was applied to fit the dataset of critical rill length with experimental value and regressed value and given in fig 4 equation 8 indicates that critical rill length negative correlates with sd to mean that the combined influence of slope gradient along with thawed soil depth plays an important role in critical rill length flow rate has limited effect on critical rill length equation 8 suggests that critical rill length negatively correlates with the thawed soil depth the shallower the thawed soil depth supplies less sediments on the same rill length therefore longer rill length is needed to produce the same sediment concentration with the increase in flow rate and slope gradient the effect of thawed soil depth on critical rill length decreases equation 8 also indicates that critical rill length negatively correlates with slope gradient at low slope gradient the energy of water flow is low the water flow energy cannot produce rill and detaches few sediments thus longer slope is needed to achieve the critical value for supplying enough soil particle to meet the requirement of water flow to delivery sediments with the increase in slope gradient the water flow energy and gravity increase to erode wide and deep rill and detaches many sediments thus shorter rill length is needed to achieve the sediment concentration required to reach the critical rill length these results indicate that the critical length decreases with the increase in slope gradient 3 2 2 constant detachment rate of partially thawed soil k as shown in fig 2 the physical meaning of the constant detachment rate k calculated with eq 5 is the actual increase rate of sediment concentration in water flow before the rill length reaches the critical value over the partially thawed soil slope the constant detachment rates were determined by the average detachment rate before the critical point as shown in fig 2 the constant detachment rates under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depths are shown in fig 5 group of 1 4 and 5 8 represent constant detachment rate under different thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm within which the four data points are presented for the four constant detachment rates for the four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively as observed in fig 5 the constant values of detachment rate k under the thawed soil depth of 2 cm are higher than those of 1 cm under all hydraulic conditions under the slope gradient of 5 the k values at the thawed soil depth of 2 cm are approximately 10 higher than that under the thawed soil depth of 1 cm at different flow rates under the slope gradient ranging from 10 and 20 the k values under the thawed soil depth of 2 cm are approximately 20 30 higher than those of 1 cm under all circumstances the k values increase quickly with the flow rate at low slope gradient of 5 the k values of 2 l min are approximately 4 times higher than that of 1 l min the k values of 4 l min are approximately 3 times higher than that of 2 l min the results show that the increase rate of the k value decreases with the increase in slope gradient under the slope gradients of 10 15 and 20 the k values increase by approximately 150 100 and 100 exponentially with the flow rate the detachment rate k increases significantly with the slope gradient and the increase rate decreases quickly under the flow rate of 1 l min and thawed soil depth of 1 cm the k value increases by approximately 400 108 and 8 when the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 under the flow rate of 4 l min and thawed soil depth of 2 cm the k values increase by approximately 186 62 and 4 when the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 respectively at low slope gradient the k values increase quickly with the slope gradient the increase rate decreases when the slope gradient increased to 15 when the slope gradient further increased from 15 to 20 the k values remain mostly unchanged the constant detachment rate is influenced by several factors including slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth to quantify the influences of those factors and their interactions on the constant detachment rate multivariable regression was adopted to analysis the relationship of k and the impact factors the regression was performed with stepwise regression method by spss statistics software the output regression model of constant detachment rate is presented as follows 9 k 955 712 s q 3529 958 q d 0 016 the regression model fits the experiment dataset with linear function with coefficient of determination r2 equal 0 977 which is shown in fig 6 eq 9 indicates that the constant detachment rates positively correlate to sq and qd the combined influences of slope gradient and flow rate and flow rate and thawed soil depth play a significance role on constant detachment rate equation 9 indicates that constant detachment rates are influenced by the interaction of slope gradient and flow rate thawed soil depth and flow rate it suggests that constant detachment rates are influenced by thawed soil depth flow rate and slope gradient with partial differential calculation of eq 9 constant detachment rate positively correlates to thawed soil depth before reaching the critical rill length the key factor affecting the detachment rate is the insufficient soil particle supplied by the partially thawed soil slope the limited amount of soil particles determines that the sediment increase rate detachment rate is constant with rill length the sediments supplied by soil slope limit the detachment rate under the partially thawed soil the more sediments supplied from deeper thawed soil depth led to higher detachment rate combined with the critical rill length the deeper the thawed frozen soil the larger the k parameter and the shorter the critical rill length this condition explains that with the increase in thawed soil depth many soil particles over partially thawed soil slope can be detached thereby resulting in high detachment rate and short slope distance for the sediment concentration in water flow to achieve a certain value equation 9 also indicates that k positively correlates with slope gradient with the increase in slope gradient the water flow velocity increases and energy increases thereby resulting in high detachment rate the change in slope gradient greatly influences the k values at low slope gradient the increase in slope gradient has a low effect on the k values at low slope gradient and flow rate the low energy of water flow results in the low detachment capacity of water flow the change in hydraulic condition affects the detachment rate greatly at low slope gradient and flow rate the high velocity of water flow with high energy results in high detachment capacity thereby weakening the influence of the hydraulic condition change on detachment rate equation 9 also suggests that k positively correlates with flow rate the water flow rate greatly influences the k values the values of k increase with flow rate significantly this is due to the reason that the detachment rate is determined by the product of the unit width flow rate and the increase rate of sediment concentration with rill length flow rate is a hydraulic parameter closely correlated to flow velocity which represents water flow energy thus increase of flow rate results in a large increase in the k value 3 2 3 potential detachment capacity a in accordance with the function model eq 5 and fig 2 the detachment rate decreases exponentially when the rill length surpassed the critical length on partially thawed soil slopes the detachment rate under the thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm starts to decrease exponentially along the rill length with the same trend as the circumstance of thawed soil depth of 5 cm under this assumption the data points after the critical rill length are fitted with eq 3 to produce regression parameter a the values of a under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depths are presented in fig 7 when the rill length is zero the detachment rate is a in accordance with eq 3 therefore the physical meaning of parameter a represents the potential detachment capacity when clear water is introduced to the soil slope and the water flow contained no sediment the water flow possesses the maximum energy to detach the soil particles foster 1982 group of 1 4 5 8 and 9 12 represent critical rill length under different thawed soil depths of 1 2 and 5 cm within which the four points are presented for the four potential detachment rates for the four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively as shown in fig 7 parameter a decreases with the increase in the thawed soil depth under the low slope gradient of 5 and flow rate of 1 l min parameter a decreases by approximately 66 and 19 when the thawed soil depth increased from 1 cm to 2 cm and from 2 cm to 5 cm generally potential detachment capacity is higher at slope with shallower thawed soil depth under the same hydraulic condition of slope gradient and flow rate fig 7 indicates that parameter a increases quickly with the flow rate under the slope gradient of 5 and thawed soil depth of 1 cm the potential detachment capacity increases by approximately 209 and 145 when the flow rate increased from 1 l min to 2 l min and from 2 l min to 4 l min respectively its increase rate with flow rate is still high because the unit width flow rate is a parameter directly affecting the detachment rate as shown in fig 7 the potential detachment capacity increases with the slope gradient under the flow rate of 1 l min and thawed soil depth of 1 cm the potential detachment capacity increases by approximately 219 75 and 25 when the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 respectively under the flow rate of 4 l min and thawed soil depth of 5 cm the potential detachment capacity increases by 224 114 and 8 when the slope gradient increased gradually at low flow rate and thawed soil depth it increases quickly with the slope gradient and the increase rate decreases with the increase in slope gradient compared with low flow rate and thawed soil depth the increase rate of the potential detachment capacity is lower under the high flow rate and thawed soil depth according to the results of the experiment the potential detachment capacity is significantly influenced by slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth multivariable regression was applied to quantify the influences of those factors and their interactions on potential detachment capacity a as 10 a 0 069 5298 135 s q 16 910 q d 414 513 q the datasets calculated with regression model eq 10 are fitted with experiment values by linear function with coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 896 which is shown in fig 8 equation 10 indicates that potential detachment capacity relates to sq qd and q the interaction of slope gradient and flow rate and flow rate and thawed soil depth have significance effects on potential detachment capacity the relationship of potential detachment capacity with individual influence factor is obtained by partial derivative of eq 10 11 a d 16 910 q 12 a q 5298 135 s 16 910 d 414 513 13 a s 5298 135 q equation 11 indicates that potential detachment capacity negatively correlates to thawed soil depth which is verified by the experiment dataset as shown fig 7 the increase in the thawed soil depth changes the soil surface to supply much more sediments for water flow to detach thereby resulting in the decrease of the detachment capacity the potential detachment capacities over shallow thawed soil slope 1 and 2 cm are higher than those over thawed soil slope of 5 cm one of the reasons is the existence of the impermeable layer of frozen soil under the shallow thawed soil slope under the hydraulic condition in this study the water flow can cut the soil particles to the frozen soil layer over shallow partially thawed soil slope 1 and 2 cm whereas it cannot cut the impermeable layer over the thawed soil slope of 5 cm the water flow velocity over frozen soil slope is higher than that over nonfrozen soil slope chen et al 2018 this condition indicates that the flow velocities over shallowly thawed soil slope 1 and 2 cm are higher than those over the thawed soil slope of 5 cm under the same hydraulic condition another reason is the amount of soil particles supplied by different depths of partially thawed soil slope under the same circumstance the deeper the thawed soil depth is the more soil particles can be supplied by the soil slope for water flow to detach this condition indicates that the water flow can detach and carry many more soil particles the more water flow energy can be consumed by detaching and carrying more sediments thereby reducing the velocity of sediment laden flow in a word the shallower the thawed depth is the higher the potential energy of water flow thereby resulting in high potential detachment capacity equation 12 shows the result of partial derivative with respect to flow rate within the range of hydraulic condition designed in this study the result of eq 12 is positive which suggests potential detachment capacity positively relate to flow rate it has been proved significantly in fig 7 the flow velocities exert a significant effect on the potential detachment capacity as flow rate closely relating to flow velocity it significantly influences water flow energy water flow is capable to detachment more soil particle with higher water flow energy equation 13 indicates potential detachment capacity positive relates to slope gradient the values of a increase with slope gradient as shown in fig 7 at low slope gradient the water flow with low velocity and energy results in low ability to detach soil particles with the increase in slope gradient the water flow velocity and energy increase significantly with increase of gravitational potential energy thereby resulting in high value of parameter a at high slope gradient high water energy results in a high value of the potential detachment capacity 3 2 4 reduction coefficient of detachment rate model b as shown in fig 2 and function eq 5 the detachment rate decreases exponentially with the further increase in rill length to surpass the critical rill length parameter b is a regressed parameter used to represent the reduction speed of detachment rate with respect to rill length the larger the parameter is the faster the decrease in the detachment rate with rill length the reduction coefficients under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depth is shown in fig 8 group of 1 4 5 8 and 9 12 represent reduction coefficient under different thawed soil depths of 1 2 and 5 cm within which four points are presented for the four reduction coefficients for the four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively fig 9 shows similar reduction coefficients b between different thawed soil depth under slope gradient and flow rate the dataset presents that the rate of reduction coefficient changed with thawed soil depth mostly fluctuates between 10 it also can be observed in fig 9 that the values of b increase with flow rate under different slope gradients and thawed soil depths generally the reduction coefficients at high flow rate 4 l min are the highest between the designed flow rates in this study under different slope gradient and thawed soil depth it also can be observed in fig 9 the values of b at low flow rate 1 l min are the lowest under the flow rate of 1 l min and thawed soil depth of 5 cm the reduction coefficients increase by approximately 73 79 and 10 as the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 respectively under the flow rate of 2 l min the reduction coefficients under the thawed soil depths of 2 and 5 cm increased by approximately 9 and 3 respectively when the slope gradient increased from 15 to 20 the results show that the reduction coefficient increases steadily before the slope gradient reached 15 and the b values are similar under the slope gradients of 15 and 20 the reduction coefficient increases with the slope gradient this condition indicates that the sediment concentrations increase quickly to the maximum value and the detachment rate decreases fast with the increase in slope gradient under partially thawed soil slope multivariable regression was also adopted to quantitative analysis the influences of those factors slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth and their interactions on reduction coefficient b as 14 b 773 501 s q 1 771 s 0 124 the datasets determined by regression model eq 14 are fitted with experiment values by linear function with coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 988 which is shown in fig 10 equation 14 suggests that reduction coefficient correlates to sq and s the interaction of slope gradient along with flow rate plays an important role on reduction coefficient with stepwise regression method the parameter of thawed soil depth is excluded in eq 14 it indicates that there is no significant correlation between reduction coefficient and thawed soil depth equation 14 indicates that the reduction coefficient positively correlates to flow rate with the increase in flow rate the water flow velocity and energy increase thereby resulting in the fast increase in sediment concentration and fast decrease in detachment rate thus the reduction coefficient increases with the flow rate which means that shorter rill length is needed for water flow to achieve the fully loaded condition equation 14 suggests that reduction coefficient is positively correlated to slope gradient with the result of partial derivative with respect to slope gradient compared with the flow rate and thawed soil depth the slope gradient plays a more important role to affect the reduction coefficient the reduction coefficient increases with the slope gradient with elevation of slope gradient gravitational energy of water flow increases which enhance the energy of water flow the water flow with higher energy produces wider and deeper rill which accelerate the increase rate of sediment concentration in water flow with higher slope gradient shorter rill length is needed for detachment rate of water flow decreasing to zero caused larger reduction coefficient this condition indicates that the sediment concentrations increase quickly to the maximum value and the detachment rate decreases fast with the increase in slope gradient under partially thawed soil slope 3 3 comparison of detachment rate between loess soil and black soil lei et al 2002 experimentally proposed that the detachment rate decreased exponentially along a loess soil rill experimental dataset was regressed with exponential function potential detachment capacity and reduction coefficient are the regression parameters linear function is applied to fitted the potential detachment capacities of loess soil and black soil under thawed soil depth of 1 2 and 5 cm which is shown in fig 11 potential detachment capacities of non frozen loess soil were compared with black soil of thawed soil depth 1 2 and 5 cm as shown in fig 11 the values a of black soil under thawed soil depth of 1 2 and 5 cm were about 4 074 2 030 and 1 569 times higher than that of loess soil under the same slope gradient and flow rate in the process of experiment the water flow didn t cut soil to the frozen soil layer with the designed hydraulic conditions under thawed soil depth of 5 cm the potential detachment capacities of black soil under thawed soil depth of 5 cm were higher than that of nonfrozen loess soil may causes by 1 the higher organic matter and erodibility of black soil than loess soil 2 thawing process undermined the construction and aggregate of black soil 3 super saturation of the thawed soil layer the shallower of the thawed soil the higher rate of a values compared black soil with loess soil the reason is similar to the effect of thawed soil depth on potential detachment capacity linear function is also adopted to fitted the reduction coefficient of loess soil and black soil which is shown in fig 12 as the reduction coefficients are similar under different thawed soil depth the average values a of black soil under thawed soil depth 1 2 and 5 cm were compared with that of loess soil fig 12 indicates that the reduction coefficients of black soil were about 2 546 times of that of loess soil the reason that potential detachment capacities of black soil under thawed soil depth 5 cm higher than that of loess soil is also can explain reduction coefficient partially thawed black soil is prone to erosion which results in large reduction coefficient fast increase of sediment concentration in water flow and fast decrease of detachment rate 4 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the influence factor slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depths and their interaction on detachment rate the detachment rate along nine rill lengths under different hydraulic conditions was determined through soil erosion piecewise functions were used between the sediment concentration and rill length during soil erosion chen et al 2021 in accordance with the experimental data sets functions were proposed as the detachment rate model under the circumstance of partially thawed soil slope the computed detachment rates are different they are determined with the piecewise function of sediment rill length functions that consist of a constant part and an exponential curve under the partially thawed soil the regressed results show high correlation coefficient thereby representing that the model can fit the detachment rate data well the effect of the parameters critical rill length constant detachment rate potential detachment capacity and reduction coefficient of detachment rate are quantified by multivariable regression model the coefficients fitted with model and experimental dataset are higher than 0 89 showed the accuracy the regression models indicate those four parameters are significantly correlate to slope gradient the critical rill length is negatively related to sd constant detachment rate is positively correlated to sq and qd potential detachment capacity is positively related to sq and negatively related to sd and q reduction coefficient is positively related to sq and s the slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth exert a great effect and their interaction also plays an important role on the detachment rate this study proposed a model for detachment rate with rill length and ascertained the influence of slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth on detachment rate for partially

3981,the detachment rate of partially thawed frozen soil supplies data sets to compute the soil erodibility and critical shear strength in rill erosion model this research aims to investigate the effect of slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth on detachment rate under partially thawed condition the detachment rates of partially thawed soil rill were estimated under three thawed soil depths 1 2 5 cm four slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and three flow rates 1 2 4 l min they were then computed with the sediment concentrations measured along different slope lengths of 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 m results show that the detachment rates on a partially thawed soil slope as a function of rill length are piecewise functions which initially maintain a constant value before decreasing exponentially with rill length in the constant detachment rate section the constant detachment rate increased with thawed soil depth after the constant detachment rate section it increased with slope gradient and flow rate but decreased with the increase in thawed soil depth the detachment rate decreased fast with the increase in slope gradient and flow rate the computed detachment rates fitted by stepwise functions produced high coefficient of determination thereby indicating a good correlation of detachment rate with rill length the parameters critical rill length constant detachment rate potential detachment capacity and reduction coefficient of detachment rate in the piecewise function were regressed with stepwise regression method they determined the effects of those four parameters on detachment rate the influence of flow rate on critical rill length and thawed soil depth on reduction coefficient of detachment rate was limited the combined impacts of slope gradient and flow rate were positively related to those four parameters this study quantified the effect of slope flow rate and thawed soil depth on detachment rate and help to quantify the soil detachment rate in cold region keywords detachment rate partially thawed soil thawed soil depth slope gradient flow rate 1 introduction soil erosion involves the detachment deposition and transportation of soil particles by erosive agents such as water flow and wind ellison 1947 rill erosion on hillslopes can cause serious soil loss over cultivated slopes nearing et al 1997 zheng and tang 1997 gyssels et al 2002 detachment is an important process that is directly related with the delivery or transportation of sediments thereby leading to soil degradation owoputi and stolte 1995 the detachment rate needs to be considered in the modeling research of soil erosion sharma et al 1995 cochrane and flanagan 1996 franti et al 1999 giménez and govers 2002 flow induced detachment is an important parameter in soil erosion models such as water erosion predict project wepp foster et al 1977 other soil erosion models also use this factor to predict soil erosion foster et al 1989 morgan et al 1993 profitt et al 1993 the detachment rate and sediment concentration in flow water were interactively related by foster et al 1977 they suggested a coupling equation to model the function of detachment and sediment load scientists experimentally found that the detachment rate is remarkably affected by sediment load lei et al 2002 merten et al 2001 zhang et al 2005 in accordance with the wepp model the rill detachment rate is functionally related to soil erodibility parameter sediment transport capacity critical shear stress of the soil and sediment concentration in water flow nearing et al 1989 foster et al 1989 flanagan and nearing 1995 cochrane and flanagan 1996 the rill detachment rate is given as follows 1 d r k r τ τ c 1 qc t c where dr is the detachment rate under unit area per unit time kg s m2 kr is the soil erodibility parameter s m τ is the shear strength of water flow pa τ c is the critical soil shear strength pa q is the unit width flow rate m2 s c is the sediment concentration in water flow kg m3 tc is the sediment transport capacity of water flow kg m s the rill erosion and sediment transport are described in the wepp model they represent the interaction of detachment rate and sediment concentration in water flow nearing et al 1989 flanagan and nearing 1995 the detachment rate decreases with the increase in sediment load in water flow because the sediments consume the energy of water flow to reduce the ability of detachment when the sediment load reaches the sediment transport capacity the rill detachment rate decreases to zero the detachment rate also affects the increase in the sediment concentration in water flow the detachment rate represents the rate of water flow to detach soil particle and determines the increase rate of sediment concentration moore and burch 1986 merten et al 2001 in accordance with the detachment rate distribution along the rill over nonfrozen soil slope zhang et al 2014 suggested a function to quantify the relationship between the detachment rate and rill length as follows 2 d x a e b x where a is a regression coefficient defined as the detachment rate at x 0 b is a constant to quantify the decrease rate of detachment rate along the rill 1 m x is the rill length m d x is the detachment rate as a function of slope length kg m2 s the soil detachment on partially thawed soil slope is seldom studied in cold areas with freeze and thaw cycle partially thawed soil layer featured with shallow thawed soil depth causes serious soil erosion and loss sharratt et al 2000 2001 lentz et al 1993 auzet et al 1993 kurylyk et al 2014 øygarden 2003 the detachment rate has differences over frozen and partially thawed soil slope in cold regions compared with nonfrozen soil the thawed of frozen soil affects several factors and determines the detachment rate as shown in eq 1 the detachment rate is affected by the hydraulic condition of water flow the water flow velocity over frozen soil slope is higher than that over nonfrozen soil slope ban et al 2016 chen et al 2017 the higher flow velocity over partially thawed frozen soil slope indicates higher kinetic energy of water flow with higher water shear and detach forces compared with nonfrozen soil slope in addition to the hydraulics of water flow the detachment rate is strongly influenced by soil properties such as soil type texture cohesion and soil strength khanbilvardi and rogowski 1986 nearing et al 1988 owoputi 1994 the freeze thaw ft process breaks down the soil structure and particle cohesion to weaken the soil strength kok and mccool 1990 ferrick and gatto 2005 thereby affecting the soil detachment rate scientists recognized that the ft process determines high erodibility of soil bryan 2000 van klaveren and mccool 1998 the cohesion strength of thawed frozen silt loam is significantly reduced compared with its original value after one ft cycle formanek et al 1984 when the frozen soil is partially thawed the physical properties are greatly affected and the detachment rate gets higher than that of non frozen soil and total thawed soil the detachment rate is also influenced by the sediment supplied over soil slope over partially thawed soil slope insufficient supply of soil particles to detach water flow can reduce the sediment detachment rate the deficiency of sediment supply over partially thawed soil slope determines that the sediment concentration in water flow increases slowly with slope length thereby limiting the increase in detachment rate this study aims to 1 calculate the soil detachment rate along eroding rill length in accordance with the experimental data of sediment concentration under different hydraulic conditions 2 suggest the functional relationship between detachment rate and slope length 3 analyze the effect mechanism of thawed soil depth on the detachment rate of partially thawed soil 2 method 2 1 computational method for rill detachment rate the rill detachment rate is defined as the mass of soil particles being removed from a unit surface area during a unit time the sediment concentration increases with rill length because the water flow detaches soil particles along the slope continually before the sediment concentration reaches the maximum value when the water flow passes through the slope length of x m the sediment concentration reaches to c when the rill length increases to x δ x the sediment concentration increases to c δ c during time increment δ t the sediment concentration increment δ c is caused by the soil particles detached from the rill length of δ x the sediment load c q in the water flow increases to c δ c q the surface area of rill segment in which the soil particles are detached is estimated as δ x w the average detachment rate along the rill segment δ x is estimated as follows 3 d r c δ c c q δ x w q δ c δ x where x is the rill length m c is the sediment concentration kg m3 q is the flow rate m3 s q is the unit width flow rate m2 s w is the mean width of the rill segment m dr is the rill detachment rate kg m2 s 2 2 distribution of detachment rate with rill length flume experiments were conducted to study the distribution of sediment concentration with rill length under different hydrodynamic condition chen et al 2021 a soil flume system designed by ban et al 2016 was applied to realize the designed thaw depth of frozen soil in 1d from the top to the bottom soil flumes were made of steel of 2 or 3 m in length 10 cm in width and 12 cm in depth the soil materials were filled into the flumes to 10 cm to a bulk density of 1 1 g cm3 before being saturated the prepared flumes were kept in a freezer for 24 h under the temperature between 25 and 15 the flumes were removed from the freezer to be put on to the experimental platform after the soil materials in flumes were completely frozen the thawing system of frozen soil flumes was assembled with ice boxes in all directions except the top the frozen soil in the flumes was thawed to the designed depth experimental water flow was supplied by a water tank filled with mixture of water and ice cubes for controlling water temperature approximately to 0 steady water flow rate was supplied with a peristaltic pump for soil erosion experiments three main variables were taken into consideration to study the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length the sediment concentrations were measured at nine rill lengths 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 m under four slope gradients 5 10 15 and 20 three flow rates 1 2 and 4 l min and three thawed soil depths 1 2 and 5 cm with the datasets of sediment concentration and rill length reported by chen et al 2021 the distribution of rill detachment rate along rill length can be determined under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed depth the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length under partially thawed soil slope measured by chen et al 2021 is different from that under nonfrozen soil slope by zhang et al 2014 over partially thawed soil slope the function models of sediment concentration and rill length used by chen et al 2021 are piecewise functions this model exhibits that the sediment concentration initially increases linearly with rill length until the sediment concentration reaches to a certain value before it decreases exponentially with rill length the function of sediment concentration and rill length under the circumstance of partially thawed soil determines that the detachment rate needs to be regressed with a piecewise model to fit the series data of detachment rate 2 3 conceptual model for the detachment rate of partially thawed soil in accordance with the sediment rill functional format chen et al 2021 we have 4 c kx x x 0 a 1 e b x x x 0 where k is the increase rate of sediment concentration with rill length kg m4 a is the maximum sediment concentration under the condition of partially thawed soil slope kg m3 b is the reduction rate of sediment concentration increase with rill length 1 m x0 is the critical rill length at which the linear increase in sediment becomes an exponential increase m the detachment rates for frozen thawed slopes can be conceptually presented in fig 1 the detachment rates are conceptually divided into different situations the one in circular symbols in fig 1 conceptually represents the rill detachment rate of a nonfrozen soil slope this detachment rate follows a typical exponential function with rill length as suggested by zhang et al 2014 the one in square symbols presents the rill detachment rate of a partially thawed soil slope this curve consists of two distinguishable parts in the first part the line denoted by square dots that is horizontally distributed with rill length to indicate insufficient supply of soil particles to limit the increase of sediments in water flow so that the detachment rate remained constant thus the detachment rate is limited by sediment supply and remains constant when the rill length increase to a certain level sediment load in water flow increase to a level so that the detachment rate becomes being limited by sediment load in the water flow thus the detachment rate decreases exponentially in accordance with the functional relationship of sediment concentration and rill length a conceptual model for the detachment rate of partially thawed soil is proposed to fit the detachment rate data sets partially thawed soil slope may influence the soil erosion because limited thawed soil depth determines the sediment for water flow to detach as shown in fig 1 the detachment rate remains a constant value at the first section thereby illustrating the insufficient sediment supplied by partially thawed soil slope for the water flow to detach if the partially thawed soil slope can supply sufficient soil particles the detachment rate starts to decrease exponentially with rill length this factor is defined as the potential detachment rate distributed as the dashed line shown in fig 1 the intersection point of detachment curve with the y axis represents potential detachment rate when the rill length was zero the potential detachment rate is defined as the potential detachment capacity when the rill length exceeds the critical rill length x 0 the detachment rate decreases exponentially with the increase in rill length under this circumstance the detachment rate is determined by the detachment rate of sediment laden flow the higher the sediment concentration in water flow the lower the detachment rate in fig 1 the intersection points of a line parallel to the x axis and the exponential curve represents the critical rill length x0 the functional relationship between detachment rate and rill length under partially thawed soil slope can be regressed by equations as follows 5 d r k x x 0 a e b x x x 0 where dr is the detachment rate kg s m2 a b are the regressed parameters k is the constant detachment rate kg s m2 x0 is the critical rill length m the exponential function would be applied to regress the detachment rates from x0 to x along slope length as shown in fig 1 the detachment rate constant k was determined by the average detachment rate from x 0 to x x0 the critical rill length is the intersection of the horizontal line and the exponential curve which is obtained with the following function 6a a e b x 0 k 6 x 0 1 b ln k a 3 result and discussion 3 1 relationship between detachment rate and rill length the sediments in water flow derived from detachment and transport increase with rill length thereby consuming more energy of water flow to convey these sediments the energy used to detach soil particles decreases the detachment rate gradually decreases to zero zhang et al 2014 the computed detachment rates under different slope gradients and flow rates are presented in fig 2 at the beginning of the rill the detachment rate reaches the maximum value under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm as shown in fig 2 the detachment rate has a good correlation with rill length which decreases exponentially with the increase in rill length under thawed soil depth of 5 cm this finding agrees with the conclusion of zhang et al 2014 under the condition of nonfrozen soil the water flow does not cut the soil to the frozen layer under this circumstance the frozen soil layer has no effect on the erosion the thawed soil layer is capable to supply sufficient soil particles for water to detach under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm the trend of detachment rate decreases exponentially with rill length over nonfrozen soil slope figures a c d f h j and k m represent the detachment rate along rill length under slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 with thawed soil depth of 1 2 and 5 cm under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively for shallow thawed soil depths the detachment rates are piecewise functions with rill length when the frozen soil was partially thawed to a shallow depth the detachment rate is a constant value before the rill length reached the critical value and decreases exponentially with the further increase in rill length the water flow detaches the soil particles at a constant rate that is the increase rate of sediment remains a constant value under this condition insufficient sediment supply from partially thawed soil slope limits the increase in detachment rate thereby limiting the increase rate of sediment as shown in fig 2 distinct difference is found on the detachment rates under different thawed soil depths of frozen soil this condition presents that the shallower thawed frozen soil depth has larger detachment rates than that over deeper thawed soil depth ban et al 2016 concluded in their research that the water flow velocity over frozen soil slope is higher than that over nonfrozen soil slope the flow velocity represents the energy of water flow this factor determines that the higher the flow velocity the higher the capacity of water flow to detach soil particles thus the shallower the thawed soil depth of frozen soil results in the higher detachment rate of water flow apart from the thawed soil depth the flow rate has a significant influence on detachment rate in accordance with eq 2 the detachment rate is determined by the product of unit width flow rate and the variance ratio of sediment with rill length this condition can be the reason that the flow rate is a vital factor affecting the detachment rate under the low slope gradient of 5 the increase in detachment rate is high with the increase in flow rate as presented in fig 2 the detachment rates under the flow rate of 2 l min are approximately 4 times higher than that of 1 l min whereas the detachment rates under the flow rate of 4 l min are approximately 3 times as high as that of 2 l min with the increase in slope gradient the effect of flow rate on detachment rate decreases the slope gradient plays a significant role to affect the detachment rate under the same flow rate the detachment rate increases with the slope gradient at the decreased rate until the slope gradient of 15 with the increase in slope gradient to 20 the detachment rate does not increase and remains steady with the increase in flow rate the increase rate in detachment rate decreases after the slope gradient reaches to 15 the detachment rate remains steady and no longer varies 3 2 model to quantify the detachment rate along the slope as shown in fig 2 the detachment rates are piecewise functions of rill length under partially thawed soil the detachment rate is constant before the rill length reaches the critical value and then decreases exponentially with the further increase in rill length under the thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm hence the detachment rate is fitted with function eq 5 under the thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm the rill depth is shallower than 5 cm and does not reach the frozen soil layer thus the frozen soil layer has no effects on the soil erosion and detachment rate under this circumstance the detachment rate decreases exponentially with the increase in rill length therefore the detachment rate is fitted with function eq 3 under the thawed soil depth of 5 cm the yielded correlation coefficients range from 0 7 to 0 99 by fitting the experimental data with the two function models given in eq 5 the high correlation coefficients indicate that the models can fit the experimental data well 3 2 1 critical rill length of detachment rate x0 as shown in fig 2 the detachment rates are piecewise functions of slope length under shallow thawed frozen soil the first section of the function is a constant value and the second section is a curve that decreases exponentially with rill length the x coordinate of the intersection point of the two functions is termed as the critical rill length the critical rill length separates into two different distributions of detachment rate fig 3 displays the values of critical rill length under different thawed soil depths flow rates and slope gradients the critical rill lengths of the thawed soil depth of 1 cm are longer than those of 2 cm under all hydraulic conditions as shown in fig 3 the series data of critical rill length of thawed soil depth 1 and 2 cm under different flow rates and slope gradients are linearly regressed the ratio of the series data is 1 698 which means the x 0 of thawed soil depth 1 cm is about 69 8 longer than those of thawed soil depth 2 cm in general this effect is more significant under lower slope gradient compared with higher slope gradient fig 3 the slope gradient causes a great effect on critical rill length as observed in fig 3 the critical rill length is the maximum under the slope gradient of 5 and decreases with the increase in slope gradient the critical rill length decreases greatly with the increase in slope gradient from 5 to 10 it decreases slowly with the further increase in slope gradient when the slope gradient increase to 15 and 20 the critical rill lengths are approximately the same it also can be observed in fig 3 that the values of critical rill length of different flow rates are very close under the same slope gradient and thawed soil depth various impact factors significantly led to differences between critical rill length and slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth to quantify the influences of key factors and their interactions on critical rill length multivariable linear regression equation was applied to relate x 0 to different factors 7 x 0 a 1 a

7 a 8 a 9 and a 10 are regression coefficients stepwise regression method with eq 7 was applied to analysis the experiment data by spss statistics software the regression model of critical rill length is shown as follows 8 x 0 3 563 408 120 s d the regression model eq 8 fits well with the data set with coefficient of determination r2 equals 0 890 standard error is 0 885 linear function was applied to fit the dataset of critical rill length with experimental value and regressed value and given in fig 4 equation 8 indicates that critical rill length negative correlates with sd to mean that the combined influence of slope gradient along with thawed soil depth plays an important role in critical rill length flow rate has limited effect on critical rill length equation 8 suggests that critical rill length negatively correlates with the thawed soil depth the shallower the thawed soil depth supplies less sediments on the same rill length therefore longer rill length is needed to produce the same sediment concentration with the increase in flow rate and slope gradient the effect of thawed soil depth on critical rill length decreases equation 8 also indicates that critical rill length negatively correlates with slope gradient at low slope gradient the energy of water flow is low the water flow energy cannot produce rill and detaches few sediments thus longer slope is needed to achieve the critical value for supplying enough soil particle to meet the requirement of water flow to delivery sediments with the increase in slope gradient the water flow energy and gravity increase to erode wide and deep rill and detaches many sediments thus shorter rill length is needed to achieve the sediment concentration required to reach the critical rill length these results indicate that the critical length decreases with the increase in slope gradient 3 2 2 constant detachment rate of partially thawed soil k as shown in fig 2 the physical meaning of the constant detachment rate k calculated with eq 5 is the actual increase rate of sediment concentration in water flow before the rill length reaches the critical value over the partially thawed soil slope the constant detachment rates were determined by the average detachment rate before the critical point as shown in fig 2 the constant detachment rates under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depths are shown in fig 5 group of 1 4 and 5 8 represent constant detachment rate under different thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm within which the four data points are presented for the four constant detachment rates for the four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively as observed in fig 5 the constant values of detachment rate k under the thawed soil depth of 2 cm are higher than those of 1 cm under all hydraulic conditions under the slope gradient of 5 the k values at the thawed soil depth of 2 cm are approximately 10 higher than that under the thawed soil depth of 1 cm at different flow rates under the slope gradient ranging from 10 and 20 the k values under the thawed soil depth of 2 cm are approximately 20 30 higher than those of 1 cm under all circumstances the k values increase quickly with the flow rate at low slope gradient of 5 the k values of 2 l min are approximately 4 times higher than that of 1 l min the k values of 4 l min are approximately 3 times higher than that of 2 l min the results show that the increase rate of the k value decreases with the increase in slope gradient under the slope gradients of 10 15 and 20 the k values increase by approximately 150 100 and 100 exponentially with the flow rate the detachment rate k increases significantly with the slope gradient and the increase rate decreases quickly under the flow rate of 1 l min and thawed soil depth of 1 cm the k value increases by approximately 400 108 and 8 when the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 under the flow rate of 4 l min and thawed soil depth of 2 cm the k values increase by approximately 186 62 and 4 when the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 respectively at low slope gradient the k values increase quickly with the slope gradient the increase rate decreases when the slope gradient increased to 15 when the slope gradient further increased from 15 to 20 the k values remain mostly unchanged the constant detachment rate is influenced by several factors including slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth to quantify the influences of those factors and their interactions on the constant detachment rate multivariable regression was adopted to analysis the relationship of k and the impact factors the regression was performed with stepwise regression method by spss statistics software the output regression model of constant detachment rate is presented as follows 9 k 955 712 s q 3529 958 q d 0 016 the regression model fits the experiment dataset with linear function with coefficient of determination r2 equal 0 977 which is shown in fig 6 eq 9 indicates that the constant detachment rates positively correlate to sq and qd the combined influences of slope gradient and flow rate and flow rate and thawed soil depth play a significance role on constant detachment rate equation 9 indicates that constant detachment rates are influenced by the interaction of slope gradient and flow rate thawed soil depth and flow rate it suggests that constant detachment rates are influenced by thawed soil depth flow rate and slope gradient with partial differential calculation of eq 9 constant detachment rate positively correlates to thawed soil depth before reaching the critical rill length the key factor affecting the detachment rate is the insufficient soil particle supplied by the partially thawed soil slope the limited amount of soil particles determines that the sediment increase rate detachment rate is constant with rill length the sediments supplied by soil slope limit the detachment rate under the partially thawed soil the more sediments supplied from deeper thawed soil depth led to higher detachment rate combined with the critical rill length the deeper the thawed frozen soil the larger the k parameter and the shorter the critical rill length this condition explains that with the increase in thawed soil depth many soil particles over partially thawed soil slope can be detached thereby resulting in high detachment rate and short slope distance for the sediment concentration in water flow to achieve a certain value equation 9 also indicates that k positively correlates with slope gradient with the increase in slope gradient the water flow velocity increases and energy increases thereby resulting in high detachment rate the change in slope gradient greatly influences the k values at low slope gradient the increase in slope gradient has a low effect on the k values at low slope gradient and flow rate the low energy of water flow results in the low detachment capacity of water flow the change in hydraulic condition affects the detachment rate greatly at low slope gradient and flow rate the high velocity of water flow with high energy results in high detachment capacity thereby weakening the influence of the hydraulic condition change on detachment rate equation 9 also suggests that k positively correlates with flow rate the water flow rate greatly influences the k values the values of k increase with flow rate significantly this is due to the reason that the detachment rate is determined by the product of the unit width flow rate and the increase rate of sediment concentration with rill length flow rate is a hydraulic parameter closely correlated to flow velocity which represents water flow energy thus increase of flow rate results in a large increase in the k value 3 2 3 potential detachment capacity a in accordance with the function model eq 5 and fig 2 the detachment rate decreases exponentially when the rill length surpassed the critical length on partially thawed soil slopes the detachment rate under the thawed soil depths of 1 and 2 cm starts to decrease exponentially along the rill length with the same trend as the circumstance of thawed soil depth of 5 cm under this assumption the data points after the critical rill length are fitted with eq 3 to produce regression parameter a the values of a under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depths are presented in fig 7 when the rill length is zero the detachment rate is a in accordance with eq 3 therefore the physical meaning of parameter a represents the potential detachment capacity when clear water is introduced to the soil slope and the water flow contained no sediment the water flow possesses the maximum energy to detach the soil particles foster 1982 group of 1 4 5 8 and 9 12 represent critical rill length under different thawed soil depths of 1 2 and 5 cm within which the four points are presented for the four potential detachment rates for the four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively as shown in fig 7 parameter a decreases with the increase in the thawed soil depth under the low slope gradient of 5 and flow rate of 1 l min parameter a decreases by approximately 66 and 19 when the thawed soil depth increased from 1 cm to 2 cm and from 2 cm to 5 cm generally potential detachment capacity is higher at slope with shallower thawed soil depth under the same hydraulic condition of slope gradient and flow rate fig 7 indicates that parameter a increases quickly with the flow rate under the slope gradient of 5 and thawed soil depth of 1 cm the potential detachment capacity increases by approximately 209 and 145 when the flow rate increased from 1 l min to 2 l min and from 2 l min to 4 l min respectively its increase rate with flow rate is still high because the unit width flow rate is a parameter directly affecting the detachment rate as shown in fig 7 the potential detachment capacity increases with the slope gradient under the flow rate of 1 l min and thawed soil depth of 1 cm the potential detachment capacity increases by approximately 219 75 and 25 when the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 respectively under the flow rate of 4 l min and thawed soil depth of 5 cm the potential detachment capacity increases by 224 114 and 8 when the slope gradient increased gradually at low flow rate and thawed soil depth it increases quickly with the slope gradient and the increase rate decreases with the increase in slope gradient compared with low flow rate and thawed soil depth the increase rate of the potential detachment capacity is lower under the high flow rate and thawed soil depth according to the results of the experiment the potential detachment capacity is significantly influenced by slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth multivariable regression was applied to quantify the influences of those factors and their interactions on potential detachment capacity a as 10 a 0 069 5298 135 s q 16 910 q d 414 513 q the datasets calculated with regression model eq 10 are fitted with experiment values by linear function with coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 896 which is shown in fig 8 equation 10 indicates that potential detachment capacity relates to sq qd and q the interaction of slope gradient and flow rate and flow rate and thawed soil depth have significance effects on potential detachment capacity the relationship of potential detachment capacity with individual influence factor is obtained by partial derivative of eq 10 11 a d 16 910 q 12 a q 5298 135 s 16 910 d 414 513 13 a s 5298 135 q equation 11 indicates that potential detachment capacity negatively correlates to thawed soil depth which is verified by the experiment dataset as shown fig 7 the increase in the thawed soil depth changes the soil surface to supply much more sediments for water flow to detach thereby resulting in the decrease of the detachment capacity the potential detachment capacities over shallow thawed soil slope 1 and 2 cm are higher than those over thawed soil slope of 5 cm one of the reasons is the existence of the impermeable layer of frozen soil under the shallow thawed soil slope under the hydraulic condition in this study the water flow can cut the soil particles to the frozen soil layer over shallow partially thawed soil slope 1 and 2 cm whereas it cannot cut the impermeable layer over the thawed soil slope of 5 cm the water flow velocity over frozen soil slope is higher than that over nonfrozen soil slope chen et al 2018 this condition indicates that the flow velocities over shallowly thawed soil slope 1 and 2 cm are higher than those over the thawed soil slope of 5 cm under the same hydraulic condition another reason is the amount of soil particles supplied by different depths of partially thawed soil slope under the same circumstance the deeper the thawed soil depth is the more soil particles can be supplied by the soil slope for water flow to detach this condition indicates that the water flow can detach and carry many more soil particles the more water flow energy can be consumed by detaching and carrying more sediments thereby reducing the velocity of sediment laden flow in a word the shallower the thawed depth is the higher the potential energy of water flow thereby resulting in high potential detachment capacity equation 12 shows the result of partial derivative with respect to flow rate within the range of hydraulic condition designed in this study the result of eq 12 is positive which suggests potential detachment capacity positively relate to flow rate it has been proved significantly in fig 7 the flow velocities exert a significant effect on the potential detachment capacity as flow rate closely relating to flow velocity it significantly influences water flow energy water flow is capable to detachment more soil particle with higher water flow energy equation 13 indicates potential detachment capacity positive relates to slope gradient the values of a increase with slope gradient as shown in fig 7 at low slope gradient the water flow with low velocity and energy results in low ability to detach soil particles with the increase in slope gradient the water flow velocity and energy increase significantly with increase of gravitational potential energy thereby resulting in high value of parameter a at high slope gradient high water energy results in a high value of the potential detachment capacity 3 2 4 reduction coefficient of detachment rate model b as shown in fig 2 and function eq 5 the detachment rate decreases exponentially with the further increase in rill length to surpass the critical rill length parameter b is a regressed parameter used to represent the reduction speed of detachment rate with respect to rill length the larger the parameter is the faster the decrease in the detachment rate with rill length the reduction coefficients under different slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depth is shown in fig 8 group of 1 4 5 8 and 9 12 represent reduction coefficient under different thawed soil depths of 1 2 and 5 cm within which four points are presented for the four reduction coefficients for the four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 under different flow rates of 1 2 and 4 l min respectively fig 9 shows similar reduction coefficients b between different thawed soil depth under slope gradient and flow rate the dataset presents that the rate of reduction coefficient changed with thawed soil depth mostly fluctuates between 10 it also can be observed in fig 9 that the values of b increase with flow rate under different slope gradients and thawed soil depths generally the reduction coefficients at high flow rate 4 l min are the highest between the designed flow rates in this study under different slope gradient and thawed soil depth it also can be observed in fig 9 the values of b at low flow rate 1 l min are the lowest under the flow rate of 1 l min and thawed soil depth of 5 cm the reduction coefficients increase by approximately 73 79 and 10 as the slope gradient increased from 5 to 10 from 10 to 15 and from 15 to 20 respectively under the flow rate of 2 l min the reduction coefficients under the thawed soil depths of 2 and 5 cm increased by approximately 9 and 3 respectively when the slope gradient increased from 15 to 20 the results show that the reduction coefficient increases steadily before the slope gradient reached 15 and the b values are similar under the slope gradients of 15 and 20 the reduction coefficient increases with the slope gradient this condition indicates that the sediment concentrations increase quickly to the maximum value and the detachment rate decreases fast with the increase in slope gradient under partially thawed soil slope multivariable regression was also adopted to quantitative analysis the influences of those factors slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth and their interactions on reduction coefficient b as 14 b 773 501 s q 1 771 s 0 124 the datasets determined by regression model eq 14 are fitted with experiment values by linear function with coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 988 which is shown in fig 10 equation 14 suggests that reduction coefficient correlates to sq and s the interaction of slope gradient along with flow rate plays an important role on reduction coefficient with stepwise regression method the parameter of thawed soil depth is excluded in eq 14 it indicates that there is no significant correlation between reduction coefficient and thawed soil depth equation 14 indicates that the reduction coefficient positively correlates to flow rate with the increase in flow rate the water flow velocity and energy increase thereby resulting in the fast increase in sediment concentration and fast decrease in detachment rate thus the reduction coefficient increases with the flow rate which means that shorter rill length is needed for water flow to achieve the fully loaded condition equation 14 suggests that reduction coefficient is positively correlated to slope gradient with the result of partial derivative with respect to slope gradient compared with the flow rate and thawed soil depth the slope gradient plays a more important role to affect the reduction coefficient the reduction coefficient increases with the slope gradient with elevation of slope gradient gravitational energy of water flow increases which enhance the energy of water flow the water flow with higher energy produces wider and deeper rill which accelerate the increase rate of sediment concentration in water flow with higher slope gradient shorter rill length is needed for detachment rate of water flow decreasing to zero caused larger reduction coefficient this condition indicates that the sediment concentrations increase quickly to the maximum value and the detachment rate decreases fast with the increase in slope gradient under partially thawed soil slope 3 3 comparison of detachment rate between loess soil and black soil lei et al 2002 experimentally proposed that the detachment rate decreased exponentially along a loess soil rill experimental dataset was regressed with exponential function potential detachment capacity and reduction coefficient are the regression parameters linear function is applied to fitted the potential detachment capacities of loess soil and black soil under thawed soil depth of 1 2 and 5 cm which is shown in fig 11 potential detachment capacities of non frozen loess soil were compared with black soil of thawed soil depth 1 2 and 5 cm as shown in fig 11 the values a of black soil under thawed soil depth of 1 2 and 5 cm were about 4 074 2 030 and 1 569 times higher than that of loess soil under the same slope gradient and flow rate in the process of experiment the water flow didn t cut soil to the frozen soil layer with the designed hydraulic conditions under thawed soil depth of 5 cm the potential detachment capacities of black soil under thawed soil depth of 5 cm were higher than that of nonfrozen loess soil may causes by 1 the higher organic matter and erodibility of black soil than loess soil 2 thawing process undermined the construction and aggregate of black soil 3 super saturation of the thawed soil layer the shallower of the thawed soil the higher rate of a values compared black soil with loess soil the reason is similar to the effect of thawed soil depth on potential detachment capacity linear function is also adopted to fitted the reduction coefficient of loess soil and black soil which is shown in fig 12 as the reduction coefficients are similar under different thawed soil depth the average values a of black soil under thawed soil depth 1 2 and 5 cm were compared with that of loess soil fig 12 indicates that the reduction coefficients of black soil were about 2 546 times of that of loess soil the reason that potential detachment capacities of black soil under thawed soil depth 5 cm higher than that of loess soil is also can explain reduction coefficient partially thawed black soil is prone to erosion which results in large reduction coefficient fast increase of sediment concentration in water flow and fast decrease of detachment rate 4 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the influence factor slope gradients flow rates and thawed soil depths and their interaction on detachment rate the detachment rate along nine rill lengths under different hydraulic conditions was determined through soil erosion piecewise functions were used between the sediment concentration and rill length during soil erosion chen et al 2021 in accordance with the experimental data sets functions were proposed as the detachment rate model under the circumstance of partially thawed soil slope the computed detachment rates are different they are determined with the piecewise function of sediment rill length functions that consist of a constant part and an exponential curve under the partially thawed soil the regressed results show high correlation coefficient thereby representing that the model can fit the detachment rate data well the effect of the parameters critical rill length constant detachment rate potential detachment capacity and reduction coefficient of detachment rate are quantified by multivariable regression model the coefficients fitted with model and experimental dataset are higher than 0 89 showed the accuracy the regression models indicate those four parameters are significantly correlate to slope gradient the critical rill length is negatively related to sd constant detachment rate is positively correlated to sq and qd potential detachment capacity is positively related to sq and negatively related to sd and q reduction coefficient is positively related to sq and s the slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth exert a great effect and their interaction also plays an important role on the detachment rate this study proposed a model for detachment rate with rill length and ascertained the influence of slope gradient flow rate and thawed soil depth on detachment rate for partially

3982,regulation of streamflow by large reservoirs alters the characteristics of hydrological drought however few studies have focused on the impacts of regulation on the water required wr for hydrological drought recovery nor on the response relationship between wr and drought characteristics i e duration and severity therefore we proposed a comparative approach that integrates reconstructing unregulated streamflow and a drought identification method using variable threshold levels vtls to evaluate the impacts long term 40 years observational datasets for streamflow at a hydrometric station and inflow and outflow at multiple large reservoirs in the dongjiang river basin were used using vtls that accounted for seasonal differences in hydrological processes our method performed well in identifying historical hydrological droughts and their characteristics in the study area the wr mainly depended on drought severity rather than drought duration and there was a clear nonlinear response relationship i e power function between wr and drought severity the performance indices i e r 2 0 92 nse 0 97 pbias 13 57 indicated that the optimal nonlinear function model could accurately simulate the wr of hydrological drought events large reservoirs reduce the frequency of hydrological droughts shorten drought duration and reduce drought severity by storing water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season the presence of reservoirs shifted the relationship between wr and drought severity from linear to nonlinear these findings showed that the proposed methodology can help us to optimize the management of water resources for drought prevention and disaster reduction under changing environments keywords hydrological drought drought recovery water quired response relationship large reservoir dongjiang river basin 1 introduction drought is a recurring water deficit phenomenon in certain climate systems griggs et al 2013 hydrological drought is the continuation and development of meteorological drought precipitation deficit it is usually characterized by a shortage of river flow or surface runoff and is thought to be the most severe type of drought linsley et al 1982 wilhite glantz 1985 the occurrence of hydrological drought can seriously impact ecological systems water resources and human life aghakouchak et al 2021 ashraf et al 2017 bastos et al 2021 van loon 2015 as a multivariate random extreme hydrological process mishra singh 2010 hydrological drought events can be characterized according to their duration time from start to end of a drought severity streamflow or runoff deficit during the drought and intensity mean severity throughout the drought period all of which are interdependent liu et al 2019 lloyd hughes 2012 exploring the evolution of hydrological drought characteristics and their influencing mechanisms has attracted much attention which has produced fruitful results kolachian saghafian 2021 lópez moreno et al 2009 rangecroft et al 2019 vicente serrano et al 2011 van loon 2015 tallaksen van lanen 2004 wu et al 2018a 2021 yang et al 2021 beyond the drought itself the evaluation of drought recovery has been identified as an important component of drought management in recent years huang et al 2021 pan et al 2013 schwalm et al 2017 singh et al 2021 thomas et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 2019 this is because when a hydrological drought event occurs water managers must know how much water will be required before drought conditions are alleviated aghakouchak et al 2015 a few recent studies have evaluated global and local drought recovery patterns and their influencing factors and they have found significant differences in drought recovery patterns among different regions huang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 singh et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 most studies on hydrological drought recovery have looked at soil moisture replenishment or ecosystem function huang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 and measurements estimates of water required for recovery are largely absent a recent study by wu et al 2021 proposed a useful framework for determining the water required wr for hydrological drought recovery from a drought propagation perspective they defined the wr as the amount of water needed to achieve actual cumulative replenishment of river flow following hydrological drought however the relationships between wr and drought characteristics such as duration and severity were not considered in terms of water resources utilization the realization of quantitative estimations of the water required for hydrological drought recovery based on drought characteristics will be an important tool in guiding water resources management planning and drought control the evolution of a drought depends on its environment and can be complex and changeable aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2015 wu et al 2018a for hydrological drought its evolution is made more complicated and irregular by various human activities tallaksen van lanen 2004 van loon et al 2015 wu et al 2018a yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 indicated that human activities have contrasting influences on hydrological drought characteristics in the northern intensification and southern mitigation parts of china and they suggest it is necessary to consider the detailed roles of human activities on the evolution of hydrological drought when developing mitigation and adaptation strategies in china reservoirs are key components of water supply networks and hydropower generation facilities recently an increasing number of studies have investigated the role of reservoir management during drought periods but have reached different conclusions because of different reservoir management patterns chang et al 2020 lópez moreno et al 2009 wu et al 2019 for instance since the construction of the alcántara dam in the upstream portion of the tagus river in spain the downstream basin in portugal has experienced more severe droughts lópez moreno et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 found that the impacts of human activity three gorges dam china on hydrological process intensified during 2003 2012 in yangtze river basin leading to regional differences in hydrological drought characteristics chang et al 2020 indicated that optimizing reservoir scheduling can effectively alleviate water shortages during heavy drought and extreme drought events this can be done by maintaining sufficient water reserves in the reservoir in advance of potential drought conditions the operational activities of reservoirs can reduce the hydrological drought duration and severity but usually only focus on short term hydrological drought events wu et al 2018b 2019 furthermore how the relationships between wr and hydrological drought duration and severity are affected by the regulation by a large reservoir is still not fully understood here we define a large reservoir as a reservoir with a capacity of more than 1 billion cubic meters previous studies have only explored the impacts of large reservoirs on the evolution of hydrological drought in terms of operating or not i e by studying droughts before and after large reservoir construction lópez moreno et al 2009 or based on whether there is a large reservoir in a certain basin wu et al 2017 2018b and have ignored the mechanisms of the influence of large reservoirs on hydrological drought therefore how the optimized regulation of a large reservoir changes downstream flow processes and affects the evolution of hydrological drought need to be researched in depth five comparison methods are commonly used to assess the impact of large reservoirs on the evolution of hydrological drought rangecroft et al 2019 these include the i observed simulated comparison method based on a calibrated hydrological model wu et al 2019 however the uncertainty of simulated results can result in large uncertainty in drought assessments ii the upstream downstream comparison method based on two different hydrometric stations one upstream and one downstream of the reservoir rangecroft et al 2019 however there will be high uncertainty if the relationships between the hydrological processes of the upstream and downstream sections are nonlinear iii the pre post disturbance method compares time periods before and after reservoir regulation wu et al 2018b but this method is limited to the segmentation points e g regulation time of reservoirs of pre and post disturbance time iv the paired catchment comparison method compares two catchment areas with similar climates and catchment features wherein one is regulated by a reservoir and the other is not van loon et al 2019 however suitable paired catchments are very difficult to find v the regulated observed unregulated comparison method tu et al 2018 uses the inflow and outflow information from reservoirs to reconstruct the unregulated streamflow and then compares the hydrological drought characteristics in regulated and unregulated scenarios but this method requires adequate reservoir data methods i and v are relatively similar both use the streamflow reduction method but the former uses the hydrological model simulation method to restore unregulated streamflow while the later uses the relationship between observed inflow and outflow of a reservoir several drought indices including dimensionless and dimensional drought indices have been designed for hydrological drought monitoring and prediction and for water resource management purposes hao et al 2016 li et al 2015 mishra singh 2010 dimensionless drought indices like the standardized runoff index sri shukla wood 2008 and standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 have obvious advantages when applied to multi timescales and can easily compare the drought severity over spatio temporal scales however these indices do not directly reflect the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery as they utilize dimensionless features dimensional drought indices such as the fixed or variable threshold levels ftl or vtls based on percentiles of the flow duration curves e g thresholds between the 70th and 90th percentile are also frequently applied to identify hydrological drought events with non standardized drought characteristics rangecroft et al 2019 van loon 2015 importantly it is more convenient for water resources and drought management if the water deficit during drought can be directly obtained following upon the above reasoning and being guided by the methods used in previous hydrological drought studies the aim of this study was to establish a useful framework for assessing the impact of large reservoir regulation on the response relationships between wr and drought duration and severity our objectives were as follows i to characterize the influence of large reservoir regulation on streamflow and hydrological drought characteristics ii construct the response relationships of wr to drought characteristics and iii to identify possible changes to the response relationships between wr and drought characteristics caused by large reservoir regulation in order to do this in section 2 we present an overview of this study s framework and detailed information regarding the case study data processing and methods the key results and discussion are presented in sections 3 and 4 section 5 contains the main conclusions of this study the findings of this study are critical to understanding the evolution of hydrological drought and can be used to better optimize water resources management for drought control under changing environments 2 methodology 2 1 framework the proposed methodological framework includes the six following steps fig 1 step 1 identify a catchment where the hydrological processes are affected by the regulation of a large reservoir and obtain data on catchment climate reservoir inflow and outflow and observed streamflow step 2 reconstruct the unregulated streamflow in this case the regulated observed unregulated comparison method was used step 3 select a method to determine the hydrological drought threshold for this case the dimensional hydrological drought indices such as ftl or vtls were selected based on the climate features of the study basin van loon van lanen 2013 rangecroft et al 2019 thus a preliminary estimation of the climate features of the study case is needed then a suitable drought threshold level method must be selected to identify the hydrological drought characteristics step 4 determine the hydrological drought characteristics the drought characteristics determined in this study included duration d severity s and intensity i based on run theory yevjevich 1967 step 5 construct the response relationship model of wr with hydrological drought characteristics here we first needed to determine the wr and then chose a linear polynomial or power function to construct the response relationship of wr with hydrological drought characteristics step 6 determine the impact of large reservoir regulation on the response relationship model according to the differences in the response relationships constructed using the unregulated drought characteristics and the regulated observed characteristics the impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship of wr with hydrological drought characteristics was analyzed 2 2 study area and data processing 2 2 1 study area the dongjiang river basin drb 114 47 115 52 24 20 25 12 located in the humid region of southern china fig 2 was selected for this case study the drb drainage area is 35 340 km2 of which the outlet station of boluo hydrometric station controls 25 325 km2 influencing 71 66 of the entire drb basin the basin is subtropical and has a humid monsoon climate the annual precipitation is high but the large majority of the rainfall 80 occurs in the wet season i e from april to september the dry season i e october to march accounts for less than 20 of the annual precipitation and water shortages can become serious tu et al 2015 additionally the drb is an important water supply for the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area there are 800 hydraulic works in the drb including three large reservoirs i e fengshuba xinfengjiang and paipenzhu that ensure water security for the downstream megacities the first operational years of fengshuba xinfengjiang and paipenzhu were 1973 1961 and 1985 and they have total capacities of 19 32 108 m3 139 108 m3 and 12 2 108 m3 respectively previous studies have shown that the hydrological processes within the main stream of the drb have been significantly altered due to reservoir regulation zhang et al 2015 thus the drb can be considered as a typical basin that is suitable for assessing the impact of large reservoir regulation on the change of wr and its response relationship with hydrological drought characteristics 2 2 2 data processing the monthly observed streamflow from january 1956 to december 2015 for the boluo hydrometric station as well as the monthly inflow and outflow from fengshuba xinfengjiang and baipenzhu reservoirs since they began operation until 2011 were collected to test the proposed methodology details of the three reservoirs and the datasets used here are provided in table 1 note that the final years of time series data in the fourth column of table 1 are different so the time period from 1956 to 2010 was selected to standardize the data time series 2 3 reconstruction of unregulated streamflow at boluo hydrometric station according to the inflow and outflow records of the reservoirs the unregulated streamflow records were defined as follows tu et al 2018 van loon van lanen 2013 1 q n q o q q o q in q out where qn and qo represent the unregulated and regulated observed streamflows respectively q is the difference in streamflows due to the regulation and qin and qout refer to the inflow and outflow of the reservoirs respectively therefore the unregulated streamflow at the boluo hydrologic station in the drb was reconstructed based on the inflow and outflow records of all three large reservoirs 2 4 determination of hydrological drought characteristics run theory yevjevich 1967 was used to determine the hydrological drought characteristics including the duration d severity s and intensity i fig 3 according to the rules of run theory if a variable series e g streamflow in a certain month is below the threshold level that month is regarded as a drought period if the variable series remains below the threshold level for a certain period that period is categorized as a hydrological drought event since the climate of this case study i e drb had obvious seasonal climatic features tu et al 2015 the vtls method was combined with run theory according to the guangdong dongjiang river basin water resources allocation plan gopggdp 2008 the management target minimum flow for important sections of the main stream of the drb is 90 the percentages of the cumulative flow duration curve go from low flow to high flow so a 90 threshold q90 for each month from january to december was set as the drought threshold level therefore there were twelve thresholds corresponding to each month s records to identify hydrological drought events when the streamflow for a given month minus the drought threshold for that month was a negative value a hydrological drought event is said to have occurred e g drought 1 and drought 2 in fig 3 thus the threshold in fig 3 is at zero which means that the streamflow in this month was lower than the drought threshold specified for the same period the d is defined as the period in which the streamflow remains lower than the drought threshold the cumulative streamflow deficit during d is termed s the average of s during d is defined as i s is described by the following equation 2 s t ds t dt s t r e a m f l o w i d t i where tds and tdt represent the start and termination times of the drought respectively i is a given month during drought d and dti is the drought threshold for that month previous studies have indicated that any two drought characteristics i e among d s and i can be used to represent all drought characteristics tu et al 2018 therefore for this study d and s were selected to characterize the hydrological drought characteristics 2 5 determination of water required wr for hydrological drought recovery wr was defined as the total water required to recharge the river during the hydrological drought recovery process wu et al 2020 the hydrological drought recovery period was defined as the time from peak intensity pi tpi to the time of drought termination tdt it should be noted that hydrological droughts are characterized by streamflow deficits so the wr is the amount of streamflow required to terminate the hydrological drought due to the cumulative effects of river flow the replenishment streamflow in current month ti relative to the previous month ti 1 was defined as the water required wr to recover to normal after a hydrological drought hence to a certain extent the wr can be considered equal to the pi value i e maximum drought intensity see drought 1 in fig 3 however the hydrological drought recovery process is irregular see drought 2 in fig 3 and river flow during the hydrological drought recovery process is not continuously replenished therefore for the irregular recovery process of hydrological drought the wr can be defined as the accumulation of the positive values of the current month s streamflow streamflowi minus the previous month s streamflow streamflowi 1 during the recovery process this is because when the current month s streamflow minus the previous month s streamflow is less than 0 it means that the current month s drought intensity has worsened compared to the previous month thus wr can be defined by the equation 3 wr pi s t r e a m f l o w t dt d t t dt t pi t dt s t r e a m f l o w i s t r e a m f l o w i 1 where the tpi and tdt represent the time of pi and drought termination respectively note that the streamflowi streamflowi 1 0 and streamflo w t dt d t t dt is the streamflow required for the hydrological drought termination month d t t dt is the drought threshold for the termination month 2 6 construction of the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics the three most commonly used functions the unary linear polynomial and power functions were applied to construct the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics i e d and s based on the unregulated drought variables the unary linear function reflects a simple linear response relationship of wr with hydrological drought characteristics while the polynomial and power functions reflect nonlinear response relationships of wr with hydrological drought characteristics previous studies have found significant nonlinear relationships i e power among drought characteristics wu et al 2017 besides the cross validation method was also used to determine which function best reflected the response relationship of wr with d and s and the coefficients of determination r 2 were used to initially judge the goodness of fit response relationship according to the rule of cross validation method the samples of d s can be grouped to training and test datasets here the ratio of training set to test set was 2 3 as suggested in previous studies shao 1997 the functions with the largest r 2 value in the training set along with the corresponding statistics of the remaining test sample set were used to further validate the goodness of fit of each response relationship model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 r 2 santhi et al 2001 and percent bias pbias legates mccabe 1999 were used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed values of wr for the test set the equations for nse r 2 and pbias are as follows 4 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 6 pbias i 1 n q i s i 100 i 1 n q i where o s o and s are observed simulated average observed and average simulated wr in their respective hydrological drought events i and n is the number of hydrological drought events the observed wr is based on values obtained from the regulated streamflow series and the simulated wr is based on the optimal response relationship model 2 7 impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship the response relationship models constructed using the unregulated drought variables and those constructed using regulated drought variables were compared to determine the impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics the hydrological drought events that were identified in both unregulated and regulated streamflow series and overlapped in time were selected to assess the changes in the response relationships between the wr and drought characteristics due to reservoir regulation 3 results 3 1 management pattern of three large reservoirs in the drb fig 4 a shows the average monthly inflows and outflows of fengshuba reservoir since it started operating in 1973 fig 4b and c show the same information for xinfengjiang and baipenzhu reservoirs but starting from 1961 and 1985 respectively under average conditions at fengshuba reservoir the inflow histogram exceeded the outflow histogram from march to august especially from april to june but the outflow exceeded the inflow from september to february particularly from october to january this meant that fengshuba reservoir should be regulated to store water from march to august and release water from september to february for xinfengjiang reservoir the inflow histogram exceeded the outflow histogram from april to august especially from april to june but the outflow exceeded inflow from september to march for baipenzhu reservoir the inflow histogram exceeded the outflow histogram from april to september particularly from june to september but the outflow exceeded inflow from october to march the outflow of xinfengjiang reservoir did not fluctuate much within the year compared to the other reservoirs which was due to the differences in the regulating rules of the three large reservoirs the main function of xinfengjiang reservoir is hydroelectric power generation and flood control shipping and irrigation are considered secondary the main functions of fengshuba are shipping and hydroelectric power generation and those of baipenzhu are flood control and water supply for the downstream megacity groups overall although the regulation functions of three large reservoirs differed they all played roles in water storage during the wet season and water release during the dry season 3 2 response of streamflow processes to reservoir regulation streamflow duration curves for both unregulated and regulated streams are commonly used to compare the responses of streamflow processes to regulation by large reservoirs lin et al 2017 fig 5 clearly shows that the regulated streamflows were larger than unregulated streamflows from october to march of the following year i e dry season however the regulated streamflows were obviously lower than the unregulated streamflows in april may and june which are actually the flood months in the study basin interestingly the unregulated and regulated streamflows in the high and low streamflow duration curves during july august and september were slightly different that is not all unregulated streamflow duration curves were higher than those of the regulated duration curves july august and september are the summer months in the drb and the regulation of these reservoirs is very complex and weather dependent during this time if a hydrological drought occurs in summer the reservoirs will release water see the low flow duration curves in summer in fig 5 especially august and september for downstream water supply security in contrast if a flood occurs in the summer the main function of three reservoirs is to store water see the high flow duration curves in summer in fig 5 particularly august and september the streamflow processes at the boluo hydrometric station were clearly regulated by the large reservoirs but the effect of this regulation was different in different months during the dry season the reservoirs tended to release water while during the wet season they stored water but the pattern in summer was complicated by unpredictable weather that is in the summer season the large reservoirs will store water during flood periods i e high flow and release water during non flood periods i e low flow 3 3 response of hydrological drought characteristics to reservoir regulation fig 6 shows the box plots for hydrological drought characteristics d and s from unregulated and regulated streamflow series identified using run theory and vtls the hydrological drought series can be seen in fig s1 the average of the hydrological drought durations identified from the regulated streamflow time series was obviously less than that from the unregulated streamflow time series the average hydrological drought duration was just 2 12 months with the reservoir regulation while it was 2 35 months without regulation for the hydrological drought severity the average of s dropped from 282 83 m3 s without regulation to 207 61 m3 s with regulation the average d and s of hydrological drought decreased by 9 79 and 26 59 due to reservoir regulation fig 7 shows the evolution of four typical severe hydrological drought events from unregulated and regulated streamflow time series identified using the same vtls the first hydrological drought event occurred in 1956 and lasted from july to november since there was no reservoir regulation there was no difference between unregulated and regulated streamflows for this drought event the second hydrological drought event happened in 1963 with the unregulated streamflow drought lasting from february to november and regulated streamflow drought lasting from april to september the severity of the drought in the unregulated scenario was clearly worse than in the regulated scenario 1784 26 m3 s vs 921 84 m3 s respectively for the third hydrological drought event which occurred in 1991 the drought in the unregulated scenario lasted from april to june and that in the regulated scenario it lasted from may to june once again the severity was greater in the unregulated streamflow than the regulated streamflow 561 61 m3 s vs 339 13 m3 s respectively the fourth hydrological drought occurred in 2002 and lasted from april to june in the unregulated scenario with a severity of 676 58 m3 s in the regulated scenario the fourth hydrological drought also lasted 3 months from may 2002 to july 2002 but the severity was slightly less 657 87 m3 s although reservoir regulation had little impact on the severity of the fourth hydrological drought it delayed the time at which the drought event occurred overall based on the results presented in figs 6 and 7 reservoir regulation was able to not only reduce drought duration and mitigate drought severity but also delay the occurrence times of hydrological drought events 3 4 response of wr to reservoir regulation according to the run theory in fig 3 and eq 3 the wr value for each hydrological drought event was determined the wr values are shown in fig 8 a unregulated and fig 8b regulated fig 8c contains the box plots of the wr of the hydrological drought events that overlapped in the unregulated and regulated scenarios based on fig 8 the following conclusions were made i there were different wr for different hydrological drought events fig 8a and 8b and as d and s increased wr also increased ii under reservoir regulation some hydrological drought events were not apparent so there was no wr value indicating that regulation by large reservoirs plays an important role in reducing the frequency of hydrological droughts fig 8b iii the box plots of the wr statistics of hydrological drought events that overlapped in the unregulated and regulated time series demonstrated that reservoir regulation significantly reduced the average wr the average wr decreased from 153 12 m3 s unregulated to 117 48 m3 s regulated that is a 23 28 reduction in average wr due to reservoir regulation fig 8c 3 5 response relationship model of wr to hydrological drought characteristics according to the hydrological drought characteristics in the unregulated time series the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics was constructed fig 9 a and 9b show that there were strong relationships between wr and both d and s during the study period the r 2 for the linear relationship between wr and d was 0 56 and that for the linear relationship between wr and s was 0 96 the response relationship of wr to s was obviously stronger than that of wr to d which meant that the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery depended more on the drought severity than drought duration thus the response relationship of wr to s was further modeled using unary linear polynomial and power functions based on the cross validation method the r 2 for the different training sets i e groups in x axis and different functions were obviously different fig 9c but the response relationship model that returned the most stable r 2 values was the power function and all r 2 values were significant however the r 2 values of linear and polynomial functions from different groups fluctuated greatly which may have been because the unary linear and polynomial functions do not account for outliers as well as the power function wu et al 2017 thus the power function was selected as the best function to reflect the response relationship of wr to s and the response relationship model with the largest r 2 for the training dataset was chosen as the optimal function model to simulate wr furthermore we can input the s variable into the optimal function model to obtain the wr variable and validate the performance of the optimal function model fig 9d shows a comparison between simulated and observed wr values based on the optimal function model the simulated wr was close to the observed wr and the accuracy indices nse r 2 and pbias were 0 92 0 97 and 13 57 thus the selected optimal function model i e power function can accurately simulate the response relationship of wr to s 3 6 impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship model fig 10 shows that the response relationship of wr to s was obviously different under unregulated and regulated scenarios for instance in the unregulated scenario the r 2 of the linear response relationship of wr to s was slightly larger than that of power response relationship i e 0 97 vs 0 94 besides both the linear and power fitting lines were close to the 1 1 line however in the regulated scenario there were obvious differences between linear and power fitting lines of the response relationships of wr to s the r 2 of the response relationship in the linear function was obviously less than that of the power function 0 83 vs 0 93 and neither line was close to the 1 1 line like in the unregulated scenario clearly reservoir regulation had a strong effect on the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics transforming it from linear to nonlinear 4 discussion changes to streamflow processes due to regulation by large reservoirs significantly affected the water required wr for hydrological drought recovery and its relationship to hydrological drought characteristics previous studies have indicated that the reservoir regulation can reduce drought duration and mitigate drought severity if a reservoir stores water during the wet season and releases water in the dry season lópez moreno et al 2009 wu et al 2017 2018b however these studies did not consider directly the impacts of large reservoirs on the evolution of wr and its relationship with hydrological drought characteristics in addressing this knowledge gap we found that the large reservoir regulation can reduce the wr for hydrological drought recovery through the mitigation of drought severity fig 7 and fig 8 and thus alter the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics fig 10 we also found that regulation by large reservoirs becomes more complex in summer in the drb fig 5 the main reason was that the study area is prone to compounded extreme climate events e g droughts and extreme high temperatures besides although high temperatures and rain are frequent in summer li et al 2021 the water consumption of downstream megacities also increases he et al 2018 this is exemplified in the coefficient of usable drinking water which was significantly higher during summer in the downstream cities of the drb than in winter the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics underwent a linear to nonlinear transformation due to the regulation by large reservoirs the traditional hydrometeorological relationships in the environment went from being uniform to non stationary due to the changes associated with regulation milly et al 2008 li et al 2015 furthermore the relationships among the internal characteristics of the hydrological system were also non stationary and nonlinear li et al 2015 wu et al 2017 tu et al 2018 we further confirmed that these changes were derived from the evolution of hydrological drought due to regulation although previous studies have found that the evolution of hydrological drought is a complex and nonlinear process wu et al 2017 2018a they only considered the response relationship of hydrological drought to meteorological drought therefore this study represents the first assessment of the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics we found a clear change in response relationship between wr and drought characteristics due to large reservoir regulation as it shifted from linear to nonlinear fig 10 the presented framework enables us to gain a better understanding of the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics under the high intensity human activities especially regarding large reservoir operation as climate conditions and reservoir operation rules vary from basin to basin the applicability of this framework needs to be further discussed nevertheless although different reservoirs have different operating rules it is clear that reservoir regulation impacts the downstream hydrological processes of a basin tu et al 2018 wu et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 recently a previous study of ours used these proposed methods to assess the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery in three basins with limited human activities wu et al 2020 however the responses of wr to drought characteristics were overlooked furthermore the impacts of large reservoirs on the evolution of wr and its responses to drought characteristics were also not considered as seen in the results of this study the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery depended more on drought severity than drought duration however the hydrological cycle is complex and variable among locations roderick et al 2012 this makes hydrological drought recovery extremely complex and dependent on numerous variables peterson et al 2021 many factors should be considered in future studies for example this study did not consider how large reservoirs or multiple reservoirs joint scheduling rules can be optimized in drought periods based on the above results moreover we did not separate the impacts of climate change reservoir rules and other human activities e g land use cover change irrigation water transportation etc on the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics albeit this was due to the current limitations in research technology and data however this study did clearly show that the variation of the response relationship between wr and drought characteristics at the boluo hydrometric station outlet of the study basin was mainly affected by reservoir regulation which agreed with previous studies tu et al 2018 wu et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 this is why comprehensive analyses of hydrological drought recovery based on water cycles and their influencing mechanisms remain an open challenge therefore research should prioritize investigating how different anthropogenic activities impact hydrological processes aghakouchak et al 2021 and by extension hydrological drought wu et al 2021 future studies will consider more detailed information regarding the influence of other human activities on the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics 5 conclusions our study proposed a useful framework to assess the impact of large reservoir regulation on the water required for hydrological drought recovery and its response relationship to drought characteristics using the regulated observed unregulated comparison method combined with the drought threshold levels method the dongjiang river basin which is located in the southern china and contains multiple large reservoirs was used to demonstrate the proposed framework our findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows i large reservoir regulation had a significant influence on hydrological processes but its influence was different in different seasons due to storing and releasing water during the wet and dry seasons respectively the influence of reservoir regulation during summer depended on whether droughts or floods occurred making its performance in summer more complicated than the other seasons in the dongjiang river basin ii as the frequency of hydrological droughts was reduced the average duration and severity of droughts were also reduced the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery was also reduced because of large reservoir regulation iii the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery mainly depended on drought severity rather than drought duration furthermore the regulation by large reservoirs transformed the response relationship between wr for hydrological drought recovery and drought characteristics from linear to nonlinear overall the findings of this study help deepen our understanding of the evolution of hydrological drought under regulated environments this information will help optimize reservoir regulation rules to control and

3982,regulation of streamflow by large reservoirs alters the characteristics of hydrological drought however few studies have focused on the impacts of regulation on the water required wr for hydrological drought recovery nor on the response relationship between wr and drought characteristics i e duration and severity therefore we proposed a comparative approach that integrates reconstructing unregulated streamflow and a drought identification method using variable threshold levels vtls to evaluate the impacts long term 40 years observational datasets for streamflow at a hydrometric station and inflow and outflow at multiple large reservoirs in the dongjiang river basin were used using vtls that accounted for seasonal differences in hydrological processes our method performed well in identifying historical hydrological droughts and their characteristics in the study area the wr mainly depended on drought severity rather than drought duration and there was a clear nonlinear response relationship i e power function between wr and drought severity the performance indices i e r 2 0 92 nse 0 97 pbias 13 57 indicated that the optimal nonlinear function model could accurately simulate the wr of hydrological drought events large reservoirs reduce the frequency of hydrological droughts shorten drought duration and reduce drought severity by storing water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season the presence of reservoirs shifted the relationship between wr and drought severity from linear to nonlinear these findings showed that the proposed methodology can help us to optimize the management of water resources for drought prevention and disaster reduction under changing environments keywords hydrological drought drought recovery water quired response relationship large reservoir dongjiang river basin 1 introduction drought is a recurring water deficit phenomenon in certain climate systems griggs et al 2013 hydrological drought is the continuation and development of meteorological drought precipitation deficit it is usually characterized by a shortage of river flow or surface runoff and is thought to be the most severe type of drought linsley et al 1982 wilhite glantz 1985 the occurrence of hydrological drought can seriously impact ecological systems water resources and human life aghakouchak et al 2021 ashraf et al 2017 bastos et al 2021 van loon 2015 as a multivariate random extreme hydrological process mishra singh 2010 hydrological drought events can be characterized according to their duration time from start to end of a drought severity streamflow or runoff deficit during the drought and intensity mean severity throughout the drought period all of which are interdependent liu et al 2019 lloyd hughes 2012 exploring the evolution of hydrological drought characteristics and their influencing mechanisms has attracted much attention which has produced fruitful results kolachian saghafian 2021 lópez moreno et al 2009 rangecroft et al 2019 vicente serrano et al 2011 van loon 2015 tallaksen van lanen 2004 wu et al 2018a 2021 yang et al 2021 beyond the drought itself the evaluation of drought recovery has been identified as an important component of drought management in recent years huang et al 2021 pan et al 2013 schwalm et al 2017 singh et al 2021 thomas et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 2019 this is because when a hydrological drought event occurs water managers must know how much water will be required before drought conditions are alleviated aghakouchak et al 2015 a few recent studies have evaluated global and local drought recovery patterns and their influencing factors and they have found significant differences in drought recovery patterns among different regions huang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 singh et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 most studies on hydrological drought recovery have looked at soil moisture replenishment or ecosystem function huang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 and measurements estimates of water required for recovery are largely absent a recent study by wu et al 2021 proposed a useful framework for determining the water required wr for hydrological drought recovery from a drought propagation perspective they defined the wr as the amount of water needed to achieve actual cumulative replenishment of river flow following hydrological drought however the relationships between wr and drought characteristics such as duration and severity were not considered in terms of water resources utilization the realization of quantitative estimations of the water required for hydrological drought recovery based on drought characteristics will be an important tool in guiding water resources management planning and drought control the evolution of a drought depends on its environment and can be complex and changeable aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2015 wu et al 2018a for hydrological drought its evolution is made more complicated and irregular by various human activities tallaksen van lanen 2004 van loon et al 2015 wu et al 2018a yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 indicated that human activities have contrasting influences on hydrological drought characteristics in the northern intensification and southern mitigation parts of china and they suggest it is necessary to consider the detailed roles of human activities on the evolution of hydrological drought when developing mitigation and adaptation strategies in china reservoirs are key components of water supply networks and hydropower generation facilities recently an increasing number of studies have investigated the role of reservoir management during drought periods but have reached different conclusions because of different reservoir management patterns chang et al 2020 lópez moreno et al 2009 wu et al 2019 for instance since the construction of the alcántara dam in the upstream portion of the tagus river in spain the downstream basin in portugal has experienced more severe droughts lópez moreno et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 found that the impacts of human activity three gorges dam china on hydrological process intensified during 2003 2012 in yangtze river basin leading to regional differences in hydrological drought characteristics chang et al 2020 indicated that optimizing reservoir scheduling can effectively alleviate water shortages during heavy drought and extreme drought events this can be done by maintaining sufficient water reserves in the reservoir in advance of potential drought conditions the operational activities of reservoirs can reduce the hydrological drought duration and severity but usually only focus on short term hydrological drought events wu et al 2018b 2019 furthermore how the relationships between wr and hydrological drought duration and severity are affected by the regulation by a large reservoir is still not fully understood here we define a large reservoir as a reservoir with a capacity of more than 1 billion cubic meters previous studies have only explored the impacts of large reservoirs on the evolution of hydrological drought in terms of operating or not i e by studying droughts before and after large reservoir construction lópez moreno et al 2009 or based on whether there is a large reservoir in a certain basin wu et al 2017 2018b and have ignored the mechanisms of the influence of large reservoirs on hydrological drought therefore how the optimized regulation of a large reservoir changes downstream flow processes and affects the evolution of hydrological drought need to be researched in depth five comparison methods are commonly used to assess the impact of large reservoirs on the evolution of hydrological drought rangecroft et al 2019 these include the i observed simulated comparison method based on a calibrated hydrological model wu et al 2019 however the uncertainty of simulated results can result in large uncertainty in drought assessments ii the upstream downstream comparison method based on two different hydrometric stations one upstream and one downstream of the reservoir rangecroft et al 2019 however there will be high uncertainty if the relationships between the hydrological processes of the upstream and downstream sections are nonlinear iii the pre post disturbance method compares time periods before and after reservoir regulation wu et al 2018b but this method is limited to the segmentation points e g regulation time of reservoirs of pre and post disturbance time iv the paired catchment comparison method compares two catchment areas with similar climates and catchment features wherein one is regulated by a reservoir and the other is not van loon et al 2019 however suitable paired catchments are very difficult to find v the regulated observed unregulated comparison method tu et al 2018 uses the inflow and outflow information from reservoirs to reconstruct the unregulated streamflow and then compares the hydrological drought characteristics in regulated and unregulated scenarios but this method requires adequate reservoir data methods i and v are relatively similar both use the streamflow reduction method but the former uses the hydrological model simulation method to restore unregulated streamflow while the later uses the relationship between observed inflow and outflow of a reservoir several drought indices including dimensionless and dimensional drought indices have been designed for hydrological drought monitoring and prediction and for water resource management purposes hao et al 2016 li et al 2015 mishra singh 2010 dimensionless drought indices like the standardized runoff index sri shukla wood 2008 and standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 have obvious advantages when applied to multi timescales and can easily compare the drought severity over spatio temporal scales however these indices do not directly reflect the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery as they utilize dimensionless features dimensional drought indices such as the fixed or variable threshold levels ftl or vtls based on percentiles of the flow duration curves e g thresholds between the 70th and 90th percentile are also frequently applied to identify hydrological drought events with non standardized drought characteristics rangecroft et al 2019 van loon 2015 importantly it is more convenient for water resources and drought management if the water deficit during drought can be directly obtained following upon the above reasoning and being guided by the methods used in previous hydrological drought studies the aim of this study was to establish a useful framework for assessing the impact of large reservoir regulation on the response relationships between wr and drought duration and severity our objectives were as follows i to characterize the influence of large reservoir regulation on streamflow and hydrological drought characteristics ii construct the response relationships of wr to drought characteristics and iii to identify possible changes to the response relationships between wr and drought characteristics caused by large reservoir regulation in order to do this in section 2 we present an overview of this study s framework and detailed information regarding the case study data processing and methods the key results and discussion are presented in sections 3 and 4 section 5 contains the main conclusions of this study the findings of this study are critical to understanding the evolution of hydrological drought and can be used to better optimize water resources management for drought control under changing environments 2 methodology 2 1 framework the proposed methodological framework includes the six following steps fig 1 step 1 identify a catchment where the hydrological processes are affected by the regulation of a large reservoir and obtain data on catchment climate reservoir inflow and outflow and observed streamflow step 2 reconstruct the unregulated streamflow in this case the regulated observed unregulated comparison method was used step 3 select a method to determine the hydrological drought threshold for this case the dimensional hydrological drought indices such as ftl or vtls were selected based on the climate features of the study basin van loon van lanen 2013 rangecroft et al 2019 thus a preliminary estimation of the climate features of the study case is needed then a suitable drought threshold level method must be selected to identify the hydrological drought characteristics step 4 determine the hydrological drought characteristics the drought characteristics determined in this study included duration d severity s and intensity i based on run theory yevjevich 1967 step 5 construct the response relationship model of wr with hydrological drought characteristics here we first needed to determine the wr and then chose a linear polynomial or power function to construct the response relationship of wr with hydrological drought characteristics step 6 determine the impact of large reservoir regulation on the response relationship model according to the differences in the response relationships constructed using the unregulated drought characteristics and the regulated observed characteristics the impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship of wr with hydrological drought characteristics was analyzed 2 2 study area and data processing 2 2 1 study area the dongjiang river basin drb 114 47 115 52 24 20 25 12 located in the humid region of southern china fig 2 was selected for this case study the drb drainage area is 35 340 km2 of which the outlet station of boluo hydrometric station controls 25 325 km2 influencing 71 66 of the entire drb basin the basin is subtropical and has a humid monsoon climate the annual precipitation is high but the large majority of the rainfall 80 occurs in the wet season i e from april to september the dry season i e october to march accounts for less than 20 of the annual precipitation and water shortages can become serious tu et al 2015 additionally the drb is an important water supply for the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area there are 800 hydraulic works in the drb including three large reservoirs i e fengshuba xinfengjiang and paipenzhu that ensure water security for the downstream megacities the first operational years of fengshuba xinfengjiang and paipenzhu were 1973 1961 and 1985 and they have total capacities of 19 32 108 m3 139 108 m3 and 12 2 108 m3 respectively previous studies have shown that the hydrological processes within the main stream of the drb have been significantly altered due to reservoir regulation zhang et al 2015 thus the drb can be considered as a typical basin that is suitable for assessing the impact of large reservoir regulation on the change of wr and its response relationship with hydrological drought characteristics 2 2 2 data processing the monthly observed streamflow from january 1956 to december 2015 for the boluo hydrometric station as well as the monthly inflow and outflow from fengshuba xinfengjiang and baipenzhu reservoirs since they began operation until 2011 were collected to test the proposed methodology details of the three reservoirs and the datasets used here are provided in table 1 note that the final years of time series data in the fourth column of table 1 are different so the time period from 1956 to 2010 was selected to standardize the data time series 2 3 reconstruction of unregulated streamflow at boluo hydrometric station according to the inflow and outflow records of the reservoirs the unregulated streamflow records were defined as follows tu et al 2018 van loon van lanen 2013 1 q n q o q q o q in q out where qn and qo represent the unregulated and regulated observed streamflows respectively q is the difference in streamflows due to the regulation and qin and qout refer to the inflow and outflow of the reservoirs respectively therefore the unregulated streamflow at the boluo hydrologic station in the drb was reconstructed based on the inflow and outflow records of all three large reservoirs 2 4 determination of hydrological drought characteristics run theory yevjevich 1967 was used to determine the hydrological drought characteristics including the duration d severity s and intensity i fig 3 according to the rules of run theory if a variable series e g streamflow in a certain month is below the threshold level that month is regarded as a drought period if the variable series remains below the threshold level for a certain period that period is categorized as a hydrological drought event since the climate of this case study i e drb had obvious seasonal climatic features tu et al 2015 the vtls method was combined with run theory according to the guangdong dongjiang river basin water resources allocation plan gopggdp 2008 the management target minimum flow for important sections of the main stream of the drb is 90 the percentages of the cumulative flow duration curve go from low flow to high flow so a 90 threshold q90 for each month from january to december was set as the drought threshold level therefore there were twelve thresholds corresponding to each month s records to identify hydrological drought events when the streamflow for a given month minus the drought threshold for that month was a negative value a hydrological drought event is said to have occurred e g drought 1 and drought 2 in fig 3 thus the threshold in fig 3 is at zero which means that the streamflow in this month was lower than the drought threshold specified for the same period the d is defined as the period in which the streamflow remains lower than the drought threshold the cumulative streamflow deficit during d is termed s the average of s during d is defined as i s is described by the following equation 2 s t ds t dt s t r e a m f l o w i d t i where tds and tdt represent the start and termination times of the drought respectively i is a given month during drought d and dti is the drought threshold for that month previous studies have indicated that any two drought characteristics i e among d s and i can be used to represent all drought characteristics tu et al 2018 therefore for this study d and s were selected to characterize the hydrological drought characteristics 2 5 determination of water required wr for hydrological drought recovery wr was defined as the total water required to recharge the river during the hydrological drought recovery process wu et al 2020 the hydrological drought recovery period was defined as the time from peak intensity pi tpi to the time of drought termination tdt it should be noted that hydrological droughts are characterized by streamflow deficits so the wr is the amount of streamflow required to terminate the hydrological drought due to the cumulative effects of river flow the replenishment streamflow in current month ti relative to the previous month ti 1 was defined as the water required wr to recover to normal after a hydrological drought hence to a certain extent the wr can be considered equal to the pi value i e maximum drought intensity see drought 1 in fig 3 however the hydrological drought recovery process is irregular see drought 2 in fig 3 and river flow during the hydrological drought recovery process is not continuously replenished therefore for the irregular recovery process of hydrological drought the wr can be defined as the accumulation of the positive values of the current month s streamflow streamflowi minus the previous month s streamflow streamflowi 1 during the recovery process this is because when the current month s streamflow minus the previous month s streamflow is less than 0 it means that the current month s drought intensity has worsened compared to the previous month thus wr can be defined by the equation 3 wr pi s t r e a m f l o w t dt d t t dt t pi t dt s t r e a m f l o w i s t r e a m f l o w i 1 where the tpi and tdt represent the time of pi and drought termination respectively note that the streamflowi streamflowi 1 0 and streamflo w t dt d t t dt is the streamflow required for the hydrological drought termination month d t t dt is the drought threshold for the termination month 2 6 construction of the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics the three most commonly used functions the unary linear polynomial and power functions were applied to construct the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics i e d and s based on the unregulated drought variables the unary linear function reflects a simple linear response relationship of wr with hydrological drought characteristics while the polynomial and power functions reflect nonlinear response relationships of wr with hydrological drought characteristics previous studies have found significant nonlinear relationships i e power among drought characteristics wu et al 2017 besides the cross validation method was also used to determine which function best reflected the response relationship of wr with d and s and the coefficients of determination r 2 were used to initially judge the goodness of fit response relationship according to the rule of cross validation method the samples of d s can be grouped to training and test datasets here the ratio of training set to test set was 2 3 as suggested in previous studies shao 1997 the functions with the largest r 2 value in the training set along with the corresponding statistics of the remaining test sample set were used to further validate the goodness of fit of each response relationship model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 r 2 santhi et al 2001 and percent bias pbias legates mccabe 1999 were used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed values of wr for the test set the equations for nse r 2 and pbias are as follows 4 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 6 pbias i 1 n q i s i 100 i 1 n q i where o s o and s are observed simulated average observed and average simulated wr in their respective hydrological drought events i and n is the number of hydrological drought events the observed wr is based on values obtained from the regulated streamflow series and the simulated wr is based on the optimal response relationship model 2 7 impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship the response relationship models constructed using the unregulated drought variables and those constructed using regulated drought variables were compared to determine the impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics the hydrological drought events that were identified in both unregulated and regulated streamflow series and overlapped in time were selected to assess the changes in the response relationships between the wr and drought characteristics due to reservoir regulation 3 results 3 1 management pattern of three large reservoirs in the drb fig 4 a shows the average monthly inflows and outflows of fengshuba reservoir since it started operating in 1973 fig 4b and c show the same information for xinfengjiang and baipenzhu reservoirs but starting from 1961 and 1985 respectively under average conditions at fengshuba reservoir the inflow histogram exceeded the outflow histogram from march to august especially from april to june but the outflow exceeded the inflow from september to february particularly from october to january this meant that fengshuba reservoir should be regulated to store water from march to august and release water from september to february for xinfengjiang reservoir the inflow histogram exceeded the outflow histogram from april to august especially from april to june but the outflow exceeded inflow from september to march for baipenzhu reservoir the inflow histogram exceeded the outflow histogram from april to september particularly from june to september but the outflow exceeded inflow from october to march the outflow of xinfengjiang reservoir did not fluctuate much within the year compared to the other reservoirs which was due to the differences in the regulating rules of the three large reservoirs the main function of xinfengjiang reservoir is hydroelectric power generation and flood control shipping and irrigation are considered secondary the main functions of fengshuba are shipping and hydroelectric power generation and those of baipenzhu are flood control and water supply for the downstream megacity groups overall although the regulation functions of three large reservoirs differed they all played roles in water storage during the wet season and water release during the dry season 3 2 response of streamflow processes to reservoir regulation streamflow duration curves for both unregulated and regulated streams are commonly used to compare the responses of streamflow processes to regulation by large reservoirs lin et al 2017 fig 5 clearly shows that the regulated streamflows were larger than unregulated streamflows from october to march of the following year i e dry season however the regulated streamflows were obviously lower than the unregulated streamflows in april may and june which are actually the flood months in the study basin interestingly the unregulated and regulated streamflows in the high and low streamflow duration curves during july august and september were slightly different that is not all unregulated streamflow duration curves were higher than those of the regulated duration curves july august and september are the summer months in the drb and the regulation of these reservoirs is very complex and weather dependent during this time if a hydrological drought occurs in summer the reservoirs will release water see the low flow duration curves in summer in fig 5 especially august and september for downstream water supply security in contrast if a flood occurs in the summer the main function of three reservoirs is to store water see the high flow duration curves in summer in fig 5 particularly august and september the streamflow processes at the boluo hydrometric station were clearly regulated by the large reservoirs but the effect of this regulation was different in different months during the dry season the reservoirs tended to release water while during the wet season they stored water but the pattern in summer was complicated by unpredictable weather that is in the summer season the large reservoirs will store water during flood periods i e high flow and release water during non flood periods i e low flow 3 3 response of hydrological drought characteristics to reservoir regulation fig 6 shows the box plots for hydrological drought characteristics d and s from unregulated and regulated streamflow series identified using run theory and vtls the hydrological drought series can be seen in fig s1 the average of the hydrological drought durations identified from the regulated streamflow time series was obviously less than that from the unregulated streamflow time series the average hydrological drought duration was just 2 12 months with the reservoir regulation while it was 2 35 months without regulation for the hydrological drought severity the average of s dropped from 282 83 m3 s without regulation to 207 61 m3 s with regulation the average d and s of hydrological drought decreased by 9 79 and 26 59 due to reservoir regulation fig 7 shows the evolution of four typical severe hydrological drought events from unregulated and regulated streamflow time series identified using the same vtls the first hydrological drought event occurred in 1956 and lasted from july to november since there was no reservoir regulation there was no difference between unregulated and regulated streamflows for this drought event the second hydrological drought event happened in 1963 with the unregulated streamflow drought lasting from february to november and regulated streamflow drought lasting from april to september the severity of the drought in the unregulated scenario was clearly worse than in the regulated scenario 1784 26 m3 s vs 921 84 m3 s respectively for the third hydrological drought event which occurred in 1991 the drought in the unregulated scenario lasted from april to june and that in the regulated scenario it lasted from may to june once again the severity was greater in the unregulated streamflow than the regulated streamflow 561 61 m3 s vs 339 13 m3 s respectively the fourth hydrological drought occurred in 2002 and lasted from april to june in the unregulated scenario with a severity of 676 58 m3 s in the regulated scenario the fourth hydrological drought also lasted 3 months from may 2002 to july 2002 but the severity was slightly less 657 87 m3 s although reservoir regulation had little impact on the severity of the fourth hydrological drought it delayed the time at which the drought event occurred overall based on the results presented in figs 6 and 7 reservoir regulation was able to not only reduce drought duration and mitigate drought severity but also delay the occurrence times of hydrological drought events 3 4 response of wr to reservoir regulation according to the run theory in fig 3 and eq 3 the wr value for each hydrological drought event was determined the wr values are shown in fig 8 a unregulated and fig 8b regulated fig 8c contains the box plots of the wr of the hydrological drought events that overlapped in the unregulated and regulated scenarios based on fig 8 the following conclusions were made i there were different wr for different hydrological drought events fig 8a and 8b and as d and s increased wr also increased ii under reservoir regulation some hydrological drought events were not apparent so there was no wr value indicating that regulation by large reservoirs plays an important role in reducing the frequency of hydrological droughts fig 8b iii the box plots of the wr statistics of hydrological drought events that overlapped in the unregulated and regulated time series demonstrated that reservoir regulation significantly reduced the average wr the average wr decreased from 153 12 m3 s unregulated to 117 48 m3 s regulated that is a 23 28 reduction in average wr due to reservoir regulation fig 8c 3 5 response relationship model of wr to hydrological drought characteristics according to the hydrological drought characteristics in the unregulated time series the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics was constructed fig 9 a and 9b show that there were strong relationships between wr and both d and s during the study period the r 2 for the linear relationship between wr and d was 0 56 and that for the linear relationship between wr and s was 0 96 the response relationship of wr to s was obviously stronger than that of wr to d which meant that the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery depended more on the drought severity than drought duration thus the response relationship of wr to s was further modeled using unary linear polynomial and power functions based on the cross validation method the r 2 for the different training sets i e groups in x axis and different functions were obviously different fig 9c but the response relationship model that returned the most stable r 2 values was the power function and all r 2 values were significant however the r 2 values of linear and polynomial functions from different groups fluctuated greatly which may have been because the unary linear and polynomial functions do not account for outliers as well as the power function wu et al 2017 thus the power function was selected as the best function to reflect the response relationship of wr to s and the response relationship model with the largest r 2 for the training dataset was chosen as the optimal function model to simulate wr furthermore we can input the s variable into the optimal function model to obtain the wr variable and validate the performance of the optimal function model fig 9d shows a comparison between simulated and observed wr values based on the optimal function model the simulated wr was close to the observed wr and the accuracy indices nse r 2 and pbias were 0 92 0 97 and 13 57 thus the selected optimal function model i e power function can accurately simulate the response relationship of wr to s 3 6 impact of reservoir regulation on the response relationship model fig 10 shows that the response relationship of wr to s was obviously different under unregulated and regulated scenarios for instance in the unregulated scenario the r 2 of the linear response relationship of wr to s was slightly larger than that of power response relationship i e 0 97 vs 0 94 besides both the linear and power fitting lines were close to the 1 1 line however in the regulated scenario there were obvious differences between linear and power fitting lines of the response relationships of wr to s the r 2 of the response relationship in the linear function was obviously less than that of the power function 0 83 vs 0 93 and neither line was close to the 1 1 line like in the unregulated scenario clearly reservoir regulation had a strong effect on the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics transforming it from linear to nonlinear 4 discussion changes to streamflow processes due to regulation by large reservoirs significantly affected the water required wr for hydrological drought recovery and its relationship to hydrological drought characteristics previous studies have indicated that the reservoir regulation can reduce drought duration and mitigate drought severity if a reservoir stores water during the wet season and releases water in the dry season lópez moreno et al 2009 wu et al 2017 2018b however these studies did not consider directly the impacts of large reservoirs on the evolution of wr and its relationship with hydrological drought characteristics in addressing this knowledge gap we found that the large reservoir regulation can reduce the wr for hydrological drought recovery through the mitigation of drought severity fig 7 and fig 8 and thus alter the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics fig 10 we also found that regulation by large reservoirs becomes more complex in summer in the drb fig 5 the main reason was that the study area is prone to compounded extreme climate events e g droughts and extreme high temperatures besides although high temperatures and rain are frequent in summer li et al 2021 the water consumption of downstream megacities also increases he et al 2018 this is exemplified in the coefficient of usable drinking water which was significantly higher during summer in the downstream cities of the drb than in winter the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics underwent a linear to nonlinear transformation due to the regulation by large reservoirs the traditional hydrometeorological relationships in the environment went from being uniform to non stationary due to the changes associated with regulation milly et al 2008 li et al 2015 furthermore the relationships among the internal characteristics of the hydrological system were also non stationary and nonlinear li et al 2015 wu et al 2017 tu et al 2018 we further confirmed that these changes were derived from the evolution of hydrological drought due to regulation although previous studies have found that the evolution of hydrological drought is a complex and nonlinear process wu et al 2017 2018a they only considered the response relationship of hydrological drought to meteorological drought therefore this study represents the first assessment of the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics we found a clear change in response relationship between wr and drought characteristics due to large reservoir regulation as it shifted from linear to nonlinear fig 10 the presented framework enables us to gain a better understanding of the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics under the high intensity human activities especially regarding large reservoir operation as climate conditions and reservoir operation rules vary from basin to basin the applicability of this framework needs to be further discussed nevertheless although different reservoirs have different operating rules it is clear that reservoir regulation impacts the downstream hydrological processes of a basin tu et al 2018 wu et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 recently a previous study of ours used these proposed methods to assess the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery in three basins with limited human activities wu et al 2020 however the responses of wr to drought characteristics were overlooked furthermore the impacts of large reservoirs on the evolution of wr and its responses to drought characteristics were also not considered as seen in the results of this study the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery depended more on drought severity than drought duration however the hydrological cycle is complex and variable among locations roderick et al 2012 this makes hydrological drought recovery extremely complex and dependent on numerous variables peterson et al 2021 many factors should be considered in future studies for example this study did not consider how large reservoirs or multiple reservoirs joint scheduling rules can be optimized in drought periods based on the above results moreover we did not separate the impacts of climate change reservoir rules and other human activities e g land use cover change irrigation water transportation etc on the response relationship of wr with drought characteristics albeit this was due to the current limitations in research technology and data however this study did clearly show that the variation of the response relationship between wr and drought characteristics at the boluo hydrometric station outlet of the study basin was mainly affected by reservoir regulation which agreed with previous studies tu et al 2018 wu et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 this is why comprehensive analyses of hydrological drought recovery based on water cycles and their influencing mechanisms remain an open challenge therefore research should prioritize investigating how different anthropogenic activities impact hydrological processes aghakouchak et al 2021 and by extension hydrological drought wu et al 2021 future studies will consider more detailed information regarding the influence of other human activities on the response relationship of wr to drought characteristics 5 conclusions our study proposed a useful framework to assess the impact of large reservoir regulation on the water required for hydrological drought recovery and its response relationship to drought characteristics using the regulated observed unregulated comparison method combined with the drought threshold levels method the dongjiang river basin which is located in the southern china and contains multiple large reservoirs was used to demonstrate the proposed framework our findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows i large reservoir regulation had a significant influence on hydrological processes but its influence was different in different seasons due to storing and releasing water during the wet and dry seasons respectively the influence of reservoir regulation during summer depended on whether droughts or floods occurred making its performance in summer more complicated than the other seasons in the dongjiang river basin ii as the frequency of hydrological droughts was reduced the average duration and severity of droughts were also reduced the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery was also reduced because of large reservoir regulation iii the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery mainly depended on drought severity rather than drought duration furthermore the regulation by large reservoirs transformed the response relationship between wr for hydrological drought recovery and drought characteristics from linear to nonlinear overall the findings of this study help deepen our understanding of the evolution of hydrological drought under regulated environments this information will help optimize reservoir regulation rules to control and mitigate droughts by developing water resources and management systems in river basins credit authorship contribution statement jiefeng wu conceptualization methodology writing original draft funding

3983,climate change is one of the most serious threats to aquatic ecosystems in lakes and reservoirs aquatic organisms on the qinghai tibetan plateau in china are particularly susceptible to changes in water temperature and hydraulic status to better characterize the evolution of the thermal and mixing regimes of deep reservoirs under climate change on the qinghai tibetan plateau a two dimensional hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 of pangduo reservoir was established calibrated and verified using observational data we used representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 based on the gfdl esm2m output data after bias correction using the isimip2b dataset to simulate the water temperature distribution from 2021 to 2099 our results show that pangduo reservoir s annual mean surface water temperature has small differences under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 but there are significantly increases of 0 12 c and 0 22 c decade 1 under rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 respectively the water age in the hypolimnion also increases by 0 05 0 92 1 73 and 3 2 d decade 1 under rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 respectively the delay in offset of summer stratification became a key feature in response to climate warming the longest delay change was 3 21 d decade 1 under rcp 8 5 furthermore simulated climate warming caused the compression of the spring convective periods and the strengthening of stratification in summer which commonly weakened or even eliminated the replenishment of dissolved oxygen do to the hypolimnion via vertical mixing the depth of inflow intrusion also increased significantly 0 71 m decade 1 under rcp 8 5 enhancing summer thermal stratification the increase in the depth of inflow intrusion and the extension of the age of hypolimnetic water pose potential threats to water quality and ecological health in the reservoir the concentration of do in the hypolimnion also significantly decreased under rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 these issues may also exist in other dimictic reservoirs and lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau keywords thermal stratification vertical mixing climate change hypolimnetic water dissolved oxygen two dimensional hydrodynamic model 1 introduction climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing aquatic ecosystems worldwide woolway and merchant 2019 lakes and reservoirs are particularly sensitive to climate and respond quickly to changes making them important sentinels of climate change woolway et al 2020 the hydrological processes thermodynamic structure nutritional status and ecosystem functioning of lakes and reservoirs are all expected to respond significantly to climate warming caldwell et al 2020 north et al 2014 thermal stratification is a key physical characteristic of lakes and reservoirs and this is an important underlying factor driving vertical mixing of nutrients wang et al 2020 and dissolved oxygen do rogora et al 2018 within these waterbodies crucially climatic warming will affect the thermal and mixing regimes of lakes and reservoirs it is generally believed for example that warming will lengthen the stratification period and make stratification more stable he et al 2019 sahoo et al 2016 the enhancement of thermal stratification will have a negative impact on aquatic organisms thereby affecting the uses and health of affected waterbodies ptak et al 2020 weber et al 2017 research on the response of thermal stratification to climate change alongside other environmental effects can provide valuable insights for current and future management decisions as well as guide scientific monitoring for evaluating the impacts of climate change the vertical structure of many lakes and reservoirs involves a stratification mixing mechanism across the year magee and wu 2017 zhu et al 2020 periodic vertical overturning is one of the important mechanisms for replenishing do and other substances in the deep water layer schwefel et al 2016 therefore the impact of climate change on such processes has large consequences for the long term safety of the aquatic water environment walsh et al 2020 as thermal expansivity increases with temperature a stronger temperature gradient as well as a higher mean temperature increase stratification schwefel et al 2016 under current climate warming trends slow long term slow warming and short term extreme high temperatures could alter the heat exchange rate at the air water interface and consequently increase the annual heat flux in lakes piccolroaz et al 2020 although the water column warms across the entire depth range the extent of warming diminishes with depth and strengthens stratification relative to mixing processes lewis et al 2019 such shifts in water mixing modes make thermal stratification occur earlier in the year and prolongs the stratification period mi et al 2020 sahoo et al 2016 this strengthened thermal stratification can lead to the occurrence of hypolimnetic hypoxia or anoxia sahoo et al 2013 furthermore strengthened oxygen stratification promotes algal reproduction and delays fish spawning thus affecting the structure and function of lake and reservoir ecosystems piccolroaz et al 2018 such changes also pose risks for drinking water safety and human health czernecki and ptak 2018 the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp has an average altitude of 4 000 m above sea level a s l and widely distributed lakes with a total area of over 4 104 km2 given the development of china s water conservancy projects in the source region of the qtp the region s lakes and reservoirs are of heightened concern qiu 2008 the qtp has a unique atmospheric circulation which has an important impact on the asian monsoon and global climate change ding et al 2007 furthermore the aquatic ecosystem structure on the qtp is vulnerable to disruption by human impacts and environmental change zhu et al 2019 for example the aquatic organisms on the qtp grow slowly and are sensitive to changes in hydraulic conditions including water temperature and flow rate mengzhen et al 2012 therefore the impacts of water temperature changes on the ecological environment are expected to be more significant here than in other locations due to its high altitude temperature monitoring data from bangong co co means lake in the tibetan language and nam co fig 1 on the qtp show that the lakes are dimictic seasonally ice covered with wind and solar radiation being the main drivers of vertical turnover wang et al 2019 simulations of nam co s water temperature show that under climate warming the summer stratification forming time advanced by approximately 4 d decade 1 and the summer stratification period increased by 6 d decade 1 huang et al 2017 although stratification conditions under ice have not yet been examined reservoirs are usually designed to meet specific human requirements such as flood prevention power generation shipping and irrigation chen et al 2016 to maximize storage potential reservoirs commonly have large water catchment areas leading to relatively high flow rates and the presence of more concentrated particulates nutrients and pollutants hayes et al 2017 the inflows to most reservoirs are from a main river and form a interflow intrusion with a prevailing dominant direction whereas natural lakes tend to show a different pattern with inflows becoming quickly mixed chen and fang 2015 while reservoirs formed by damming preexisting rivers can resemble either a storage or run of river system coupled with their artificial control properties internal mixing processes vary from natural lakes zarfl et al 2015 most studies treat reservoirs and lakes as similar waterbodies and consider their response to climate change from a thermodynamic perspective to be comparable at present however there is little known of the thermal behavior and mixing mechanisms of dimictic reservoirs in response to climate change in high altitude areas moreover hypoxic conditions are predominantly controlled by deep mixing in winter the decrease in the maximum mixing depth caused by climate warming directly leads to a significant decrease in do concentrations in the hypolimnion li et al 2020 schwefel et al 2016 nevertheless few studies have examined the mixing process and its influencing factors in dimictic reservoirs during the low temperature period to address these gaps this study was conducted to better understand the evolution of the thermal and mixing regimes in reservoirs in high altitude areas under future climate change scenarios and identify the dominant factors driving these processes we focus on pangduo reservoir a run of river reservoir located on the qtp we investigate changes in thermal and mixing regimes in the reservoir using the two dimensional ce qual w2 model based on representative concentration paths rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 from an ensemble of four different global climate models we develop a characteristic index to quantify the transformation of thermal stratification and mixing mechanisms under the future climate trends providing a scientific and theoretical reference for the adaptive management of reservoirs in the qtp region and other high altitude areas in response to climate change 2 methods 2 1 study site pangduo reservoir is the largest water conservancy project in the qtp region above 4 000 m a s l fig 1 the height of the dam is 62 m and the elevation of the riverbed near the dam is 4 038 m a s l there are two power tunnels 7 m high and 6 m wide at pangduo dam with an entrance bottom elevation of 4 059 m a s l the full capacity of the reservoir below 4 095 m a s l is 12 3 108 m3 the primary functions of pangduo reservoir are to supply irrigation water and generate power but the reservoir is also important for flood control urban water supply and ecological environmental protection to characterize the thermal conditions in the reservoir and provide boundary conditions for model verification we conducted water temperature and meteorological monitoring as summarized in table s a1 2 2 numerical models we used the ce qual w2 model for our research cole and buchak 2003 a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model while this model does not consider variations in river width it can be applied to waterbodies with longitudinal and vertical temperature gradients such as pangduo reservoir the main boundary conditions in the model are inflow outflow inflow water temperature and meteorological conditions water density is driven by temperature and chemical stratification is not considered here an ice component is included in ce qual w2 which is based on an ice cover with ice to air heat exchange conduction through the ice conduction between the underlying water and a melt temperature layer at the bottom of the ice layer this model has been widely applied to reservoirs and river impoundments worldwide the source code is freely available http www ce pdx edu w2 allowing its extension and application using new formulations and algorithms table s a2 there is no input for long wave radiation in ce qual w2 therefore we added an algorithm to read in the long wave radiation based on modified source code 2 2 1 model grid and input data the model grid is shown in fig s a1 with a longitudinal size of 100 300 m and vertical size of 2 m meteorological input data were based on collective representative path rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 of the gfdl esm2m model isimip2b climate data were bias corrected for the required

withdrawal rate and water level changes were assumed to be consistent over the 2021 2099 simulation period no inflow water temperatures were available for the isimip database but a linear regression of measured water temperatures tw and observed air temperatures ta 2016 2017 revealed a high correlation of r2 0 96 tw 0 7684 ta 1 2571 this relationship was used to calculate the inflow temperature based on the projected air temperature within each climate scenario fig s a6 a similar approach can be found in mi et al 2020 and bueche and vetter 2015 2 2 2 model calibration and validation the calibration period of the model was from august 26 to august 31 2016 during the stratification period and the verification period was from september 15 2016 to february 15 2017 the inflow water temperature and meteorological input data included measured data from the observational points shown in fig 1 we used monthly measured data from a ysi exo2 probe and extracted values for the calibration and verification periods for the upstream area of the dam the calibration of the pangduo reservoir ce qual w2 model focused on the shading coefficients shade the wind sheltering coefficient wsc and the light extinction coefficient exh2o which had the greatest influence on the simulated temperature profiles sensitivity analysis showed that when shade was set to 0 8 wsc was 1 0 and exh2o was 0 45 m 1 the generated temperature profile best matched the measured temperature profile fig s a8 and table s a4 the verification period included the low temperature period in winter and the high temperature period in summer simulated and measured variations in the temperatures of the epilimnion the metalimnion and the hypolimnion were generally well matched fig 2 the average error was 0 1 c the standard deviation std was 0 50 c and the root mean square error rmse was 0 498 c during the entire verification period 2 3 statistical analysis and stratification index to better evaluate changes in the thermal stratification and the water temperature stratified structure of the waterbody the buoyancy frequency n 1 s dake and harleman 1969 which indicates the stability of the water column was applied 1 n g ρ 0 ρ z z where ρ z is the density at depth z kg m3 which is assumed to be solely temperature dependent cole and buchak 2003 ρ 0 is the average density of the whole water column kg m3 and g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 the stratification stability index si was selected to quantify the stratification stability of the water column which was calculated as follows sahoo et al 2016 2 si z 0 z l z z ρ z d z where z is the depth of the water column from the surface z0 zl and z are the depths of the surface water the lower end of the water column and the centroid of the water column respectively and ρ z is the water density at depth z water age days describes the duration of time that water remains in a waterbody and is defined as the persistence of water after it enters a reservoir from upstream in ce qual w2 water age was calculated as a variable using transportation equation with the zero order decay rate of 1 d 1 as the value of inflow was set to 0 when entering the reservoir it would increase by 1 per day if it wouldn t been diluted or discharged off from reservoir the source term of water age in transportation equation is as follow cole and buchak 2003 3 s age k k 1 day the temperature of the river water flowing into a reservoir is almost always different from the temperature of the surface meaning that the density is also different whenever the density of the inflow waterbody is equal to the density of the reservoir waterbody the inflow waterbody leaves the river bottom and the inflow intrudes into the reservoir horizontally here the inflow intrusion depth was determined by searching the vertical water temperature in front of the dam from the surface to the bottom for the location where the lake temperature was equal to the inflow water temperature the difference between the water level and the elevation at this isothermal point was adopted as the calculated intrusion depth microsoft excel 2010 was used for all statistical procedures including linear regression analysis and mann kendall tests with a significance level of z 1 96 kendall 1990 mann 1945 3 results 3 1 thermal structure the modeled daily vertical temperature from 2022 to 2099 upstream of the dam showed that pangduo reservoir is a typical dimictic reservoir with similar variations observed in each scenario fig s b1 the water column showed the same vertical temperature structure in april and november in winter the surface remains ice covered and the bottom water temperature is stable at approximately 4 c in summer the water column is thermally stratified with higher surface water temperatures and the thermocline mainly occurs at depths of 20 30 m however due to the variability of the input data a variable inter annual temperature structure was observed in the model to analyze differences between each model scenario further averaged daily data were examined decadally for the 2030s 2060s and 2090s fig 3 the average daily surface water temperatures under the ice during ice covered periods during these decades under rcp 2 6 were stable at 6 61 6 54 and 6 50 c respectively and the difference between the three typical years was 0 11 c however under rcp 8 5 the average temperatures were 6 51 7 13 and 7 85 c respectively which is 1 34 c higher in the 2090s and 2030s projections upstream of the dam between 2022 and 2099 and under the same initial field conditions the average annual surface water temperature during the 78 year simulation period was 7 46 7 56 7 67 8 00 c under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively fig 4 with corresponding rates of change of 0 00 0 05 0 12 and 0 22 c decade 1 respectively rcp 2 6 and 4 5 showed no significant trends zrcp2 6 1 25 1 96 zrcp4 5 1 48 1 96 while the surface water temperature increased significantly under rcp 6 0 and 8 5 zrcp6 0 5 68 1 96 zrcp8 5 8 94 1 96 3 2 reservoir stratification and stability the daily vertical buoyancy frequency from 2022 to 2099 upstream of the dam varied between 0 and 1 2 s 1 in the 0 15 m zone of the epilimnion fig s b2 the average annual surface buoyancy frequency remained stable under rcp 2 6 zrcp2 6 0 21 1 96 but increased significantly under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 2 04 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 3 05 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 86 1 96 furthermore the average annual buoyancy frequency in the thermocline at depths of 20 30 m showed significant upward trends under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 3 10 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 6 75 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 9 08 1 96 the buoyancy frequency for the day with the strongest stratification in summer is shown in fig 5 i e the largest temperature difference between the surface and bottom with stable multi year average dates between july 17 to july 22 under four scenarios with no significant trends rcp 6 0 and 8 5 showed significant upward trends zrcp6 0 1 99 1 96 zrcp8 5 2 03 1 96 the average buoyancy frequency in the thermocline at depths of 20 30 m under each scenario was 0 55 0 56 0 57 and 0 60 s 1 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively and showed significant upward trends under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 2 75 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 2 28 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 06 1 96 fig 6 shows the annual average stratified stability index si upstream of pangduo dam from 2022 to 2099 under the four scenarios with values of 40 68 42 15 44 29 and 49 48 kg m2 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the annual mean si increased significantly under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 4 22 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 7 87 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 9 45 1 96 but was stable under rcp 2 6 zrcp2 6 0 76 1 96 under all future scenarios stratification stability gradually strengthened over time 3 3 water age although the water age distributions under the four scenarios were similar there were some quantitative differences fig s b3 in spring april and autumn november the water age distribution of the water column was at approximately 160 and 55 d respectively in summer due to thermal stratification exchange between the upper and the lower waterbody was prevented and the waterbody was mainly replaced in the middle and upper water column when the water age varied between 10 and 80 d in the autumn retention in the hypolimnion increased to approximately 300 d until vertical turnover occurred under rcp 2 6 the average water age of the hypolimnion in the 2030s 2060s and 2090s was 224 225 and 225 d respectively in comparison under rcp 8 5 the water age at the bottom was 224 233 and 242 d in the 2030s 2060s and 2090s respectively in the 2090s the average age of the hypolimnion increased by 18 6 d relative to the 2030s fig s b4 fig 7 shows the average annual water age at the bottom considered the lowest cell upstream of the dam under each scenario from 2022 to 2099 with the same initial conditions the average age of the bottom water over the 78 year simulation period was 224 226 228 and 232 d under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively with significant corresponding trends of 0 05 zrcp2 6 2 31 1 96 0 92 zrcp4 5 3 62 1 96 1 73 zrcp6 0 7 68 1 96 and 3 2 d decade 1 zrcp8 5 9 40 1 96 these trends indicate that the bottom water remained in place for a progressively longer period and as such became increasingly difficult to replace with new water 4 discussion 4 1 response of the dimictic reservoir to climate warming the temperature structure and stratification of pangduo reservoir showed strong seasonal changes fig 3 and fig 4 during the year there was ice cover from december to march and the reservoir was stably stratified during the rest of the year with two periods of mixing in our analyses we used a temperature difference of 2 c from the surface to bottom to indicate stratification under each scenario from late november to early december air temperatures were below 0 c the heat loss rate from the reservoir accelerated and the surface water temperature cooled and convective sinking occurred the temperature structure tended towards a vertically isothermal structure until the temperature fell to 3 94 c and the further loss of heat in the surface waterbody caused a vertical temperature gradient inversion this structure remained stable under rcp 2 6 but showed delays of 1 1 1 8 and 4 1 d decade 1 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively when ice formed at the surface the ice layer provided thermal protection for the waterbody such that heat exchange shifted from water to air to ice to water heat exchange this ice layer protection mechanism results in a relatively stable waterbody and the temperature inversion is delayed accordingly öğlü et al 2020 until the freezing period is over more than half of the solar energy is absorbed by the upper layers this absorbed heat is no longer used to melt ice cover and the heat budget of the surface waterbody is controlled by penetrating short wave radiation and cooling via surface heat loss li et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the snow cover was not considered in this study because the study area was mostly in the temperate monsoon climate zone and the average precipitation was only 2 mm per month in winter from 1981 to 2010 during the 78 year simulation period under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 climate warming was not sufficient to change the freezing state in winter but in the 2080s to 2090s there were some years without ice cover under the rcp85 scenario fig s b5 in conditions without ice cover the surface water temperature rose and the temperature inversion stratification could disappear the ice thickness was significantly reduced under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 5 00 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 17 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 8 44 1 96 at the same time the number of ice covered days in winter reduced under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 5 70 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 28 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 8 79 1 96 which is consistent with existing studies woolway and merchant 2019 reservoirs typically control larger catchment areas and have more inflows than natural lakes and their catchment areas often show a stronger degree of interaction and greater momentum hayes et al 2017 the outlet structure is an important component of many reservoirs naderi et al 2014 having an overall effect on the waterbody and therefore generating areas of dominant flows akiyama and stefan 1987 for example higher flow rates and the existence of interflow often enhance water mixing and lower water ages compared to lakes hayes et al 2017 in pangduo reservoir the heat of inflow during the warming period is not stored in the waterbody but released through the interflow with discharged water the inflows to lakes are quickly mixed and stagnate for longer than in reservoirs accumulating heat more effectively while summer thermal stratification in erken lake and nam co lake has advanced from 4 d to 3 weeks arvola et al 2009 huang et al 2017 we observed that this was postponed by 0 2 to 6 9 d in pangduo reservoir fig 8 in summer the heat absorption of water bodies is higher than the heat emission such that surface water is continuously heated as a result the surface water temperature rise much faster than in the deep layers meanwhile combined with the effect of interflow and the light extinction of the reservoir the thermocline can appear on the surface and the buoyancy frequency increases which block the vertical exchange of material and energy zhang et al 2014 in our simulations the end of the summer stratification was significantly postponed by 1 17 and 3 21 d decade 1 under rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 1 99 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 93 1 96 respectively but remained stable under rcp 2 6 zrcp2 6 0 42 1 96 and rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 0 28 1 96 fig 8 and fig s b6 there was a long period of stratification in summer after the mixing in spring therefore the spring mixing period is a particularly important do supplementation process the spring mixing period remained stable under rcp 2 6 which significantly decreased by 2 85 3 40 and 4 1 d decade 1 under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 4 81 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 56 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 02 1 96 respectively fig s b7 the thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs may cause a series of environmental impacts especially in the case of do north et al 2014 previous studies show that an increase in the duration of thermal stratification in summer increases the duration of hypoxic conditions in the bottom water foley et al 2011 in our modeling we used a buoyancy frequency of 0 2 s 1 as the threshold value of the average annual thickness of the metalimnion under the four climate scenarios the upper boundary of the metalimnion advanced toward the surface by 0 10 0 59 m over the 78 year simulation period while the lower boundary remained relatively stable average thickness range 0 12 0 43 m however the degree of stratification was not affected by this expansion of the metalimnion fig s b8 whereas buoyancy was gradually strengthened fig 5 for dimictic reservoirs at high altitudes thermal protection during the frozen period and heat loss due to water withdrawal prevent efficient heat accumulation which delays the vertical inversion temperature period furthermore the shortening in the spring mixing period poses a potential risk for water quality finally our model shows the existence of a surface thermocline in summer that block vertical exchanges in the water column and delays stratification 4 2 mixing characteristics in response to climate change an important feature of run of river reservoirs that distinguishes them from lakes is that inflows and outflows are the main driving forces of internal mixing chen et al 2016 inflows push static water in front until the density is equalized forming a dominant layer of intrusion water yildirim and kocabaş 1998 this delivers important nutrients for biogeochemical cycling including carbon and nitrogen becker et al 2010 in pangduo reservoir the inflow intrusion depth was stable during the summer stratification period under rcp 2 6 but significantly increased by 0 28 0 53 and 0 71 m decade 1 under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 3 31 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 56 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 7 80 1 96 respectively fig 9 the invading flow drove nutrients to deeper areas of the reservoir under more intense simulated climate warming the correlation between the inflow intrusion depth and the si strengthened and except for rcp 2 6 was significant r2 0 18 0 50 and 0 75 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively p 0 01 fig 10 these trends indicate that strengthened thermal stratification under warming conditions would dominate the mixing characteristics of the deeper inflow intrusion in the reservoir at the same time due to the extension of the summer stratification period fig s b6 and the increase in water age fig 7 nutrients would remain in the middle and bottom layers of the reservoir for a longer period as long as the respiration rates of organisms in the hypolimnion are moderate under these conditions a waterbody would likely enter a hypoxic or even hypoxic state which could promote the release of endogenous phosphorus in the bottom waters north et al 2014 4 3 effects of climate change on dissolved oxygen under climate warming oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion during the stratification period is increased in lakes and reservoirs zhang et al 2014 and altered stratification characteristics may further affect the do regime in bottom waters furthermore organic matter in the upper layer sinks to the lower layers via a series of decomposition processes that reduce the do content kraemer et al 2017 in pangduo reservoir summertime do in the epilimnion and metalimnion ranged between 5 7 and 6 5 mg l between 84 1 and 95 9 saturation fig s b9 and was significantly depleted in the hypolimnion forming a hypoxic zone do 4 mg l for deep freshwater lakes and reservoirs with seasonal stratification and mixing vertical mixing after stratification is an important and effective mechanism of do replenishment in the hypolimnion sahoo et al 2013 in pangduo reservoir two periods of vertical mixing were identified in spring and autumn in november before winter freezing and in april before the summer stratification period the reservoir was enriched in do average 7 1 mg l here we set up a discussion scenario and performed a rough calculation of the variation trends of do the oxygen consumption rate of the stagnant layer during the summer stratification period was 0 0125 mg l d 1 calculated according to equation 4 as follows 4 v do c d o 1 c d o 2 δ t where cdo1 and cdo2 were the measured do concentrations in april and november 2017 respectively and t was the interval time assuming that the oxygen consumption rate is constant we estimated the do concentrations in the hypolimnion at the end of the stratification under the four climate scenarios fig 11 the do concentration in the hypolimnion significantly decreases under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 being most prominent in deep reservoirs as decomposition can continue for longer before all the organic matter is consumed moreover the period of hypoxia do 4 mg l in the hypolimnion increased significantly under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 fig s b10 once the do concentration in the hypolimnion exceeds the accumulation and replenishment rate of oxygen ito and momii 2015 an anaerobic environment can form which might indirectly lead to the release of soluble endogenous phosphorus north et al 2014 and furthermore anaerobic zones are inefficient at retaining phosphorus garnier et al 2005 we consider these outcomes are based on conservative estimates indeed under the current warming trend the biochemical activity in the reservoir and the oxygen consumption rate of the hypolimnion will likely increase under projected climate warming our simulations indicate that the metalimnion in pangduo reservoir will expand slightly and become strengthened hindering the vertical mixing of the water column compression of the spring mixing period and strengthening of summer stratification will likely greatly weaken the mechanism by which do is supplemented to the hypolimnion through vertical mixing as long as the lake stays dimictic the do supply mechanism would not be completely destroyed hypoxia in the hypolimnion during the summer stratification period is therefore enhanced additionally we expect the inflow intrusion depth to significantly increase under furture climate warming scenarios with thermal stratification further dominating the mixing characteristics in the reservoir finally based on the supply and retention of nutrients in the bottom waters the accumulation of organic matter and the consumption of oxygen in the hypolimnion are promoted which could further threaten water quality 4 4 future perspectives changes in thermal mixing regimes of reservoirs under climate warming threaten water quality security and biodiversity walsh et al 2020 as primary drinking water resources effective reservoir management must balance economic goals and environmental protection requirements weber et al 2017 in many reservoirs in the temperate north utilizing taking water from the hypolimnion is a fundamental strategy this aims to enhance vertical mixing avoid hypoxia and reduce the release of nutrients from sediment çalışkan and elçi 2009 as such the selective water intake mode of reservoirs is an important management model to control thermal regimes both the reservoir areas and downstream rivers this is mainly achieved by drawing water from the epilimnion and metalimnion to adjust the thermal regime in the reservoir area hallnan et al 2020 mi et al 2019 for pangduo reservoir in summer selective water extraction could be adopted to release water from the epilimnion and the upper part of the metalimnion to increase the height of the thermocline and inflow intrusion and thereby dilute the density differences in the upper layers at the end of summer stratification period or earlier releasing water from the hypolimnion would strengthen vertical mixing accelerate the replacement of bottom water and supplement the do supply in autumn for illustration taking 2099 under rcp 8 5 scenario as an example we considered the effect of taking water from the epilimnion from june to july and from august to july from the hypolimnion fig 12 pangduo reservoir did not actually have selective water intakes and here was only a design discussion condition based on june to september water intake test period the average si was 141 78 kg m2 single intake case and 123 03 kg m2 selective intake case respectively the stratification strength of the selective intake case was reduced by 13 2 this effect would continue into winter the average water age of bottom water was 266 14 d single intake case and 256 50 d selective intake case respectively due to the delay in the flow in the reservoir it would be easier to replace the water at the hypolimnion during the cooling period november after the stratification is weakened however it should be noted that thermal stratification is controlled by a range of factors encompassing climatic conditions reservoir operation modes and water intake locations as well as operational safety and economic constraints song et al 2019 further research is needed therefore to examine the individual and combined influences of these different factors previous studies indicate that reservoirs undergo a subtle mixing process over diurnal cycles yang et al 2020 specifically the epilimnion is heated during the day and cools at night consequently heat flux from surface layers fluctuates positively and negatively throughout the day and vertical density convection can occur van emmerik et al 2013 such convective movement promotes the mixing of upper layers of water which generally erodes the stable thermocline structure and can weaken the buoyancy effect during the summer stratification period vercauteren et al 2011 future research is now required to consider the impacts of such diurnal thermal regimes in reservoirs especially with respect to the response of mixing mechanisms to climate change 5 conclusions a two dimensional hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was configured to study the response of thermal and mixing regimes to climate change in the dimictic pangduo reservoir on the qtp based on our results a delay in summer stratification was a key response corresponding to an extension of 1 17 and 3 21 d decade 1 under rcp 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the spring mixing period showed significant compression reducing by 2 85 3 40 and 4 10 d decade 1 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively this is a potential threat to oxygen replenishment in spring under the studied climate warming scenarios the metalimnion expanded slightly while its stratification strength increased preventing vertical mixing in the water column moreover the depth of inflow penetration increased significantly by 0 28 0 53 and 0 71 m decade 1 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively this was associated with enhanced thermal stratification the increase in the inflow intrusion depth and the extension of the retention time of the hypolimnion are potential risks to water quality in this region the do concentrations in the hypolimnion also significantly decreased under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 overall our results provide valuable new evidence to help support the development of appropriate adaptive management strategies for pangduo reservoir as well as similar

3983,climate change is one of the most serious threats to aquatic ecosystems in lakes and reservoirs aquatic organisms on the qinghai tibetan plateau in china are particularly susceptible to changes in water temperature and hydraulic status to better characterize the evolution of the thermal and mixing regimes of deep reservoirs under climate change on the qinghai tibetan plateau a two dimensional hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 of pangduo reservoir was established calibrated and verified using observational data we used representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 based on the gfdl esm2m output data after bias correction using the isimip2b dataset to simulate the water temperature distribution from 2021 to 2099 our results show that pangduo reservoir s annual mean surface water temperature has small differences under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 but there are significantly increases of 0 12 c and 0 22 c decade 1 under rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 respectively the water age in the hypolimnion also increases by 0 05 0 92 1 73 and 3 2 d decade 1 under rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 respectively the delay in offset of summer stratification became a key feature in response to climate warming the longest delay change was 3 21 d decade 1 under rcp 8 5 furthermore simulated climate warming caused the compression of the spring convective periods and the strengthening of stratification in summer which commonly weakened or even eliminated the replenishment of dissolved oxygen do to the hypolimnion via vertical mixing the depth of inflow intrusion also increased significantly 0 71 m decade 1 under rcp 8 5 enhancing summer thermal stratification the increase in the depth of inflow intrusion and the extension of the age of hypolimnetic water pose potential threats to water quality and ecological health in the reservoir the concentration of do in the hypolimnion also significantly decreased under rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 these issues may also exist in other dimictic reservoirs and lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau keywords thermal stratification vertical mixing climate change hypolimnetic water dissolved oxygen two dimensional hydrodynamic model 1 introduction climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing aquatic ecosystems worldwide woolway and merchant 2019 lakes and reservoirs are particularly sensitive to climate and respond quickly to changes making them important sentinels of climate change woolway et al 2020 the hydrological processes thermodynamic structure nutritional status and ecosystem functioning of lakes and reservoirs are all expected to respond significantly to climate warming caldwell et al 2020 north et al 2014 thermal stratification is a key physical characteristic of lakes and reservoirs and this is an important underlying factor driving vertical mixing of nutrients wang et al 2020 and dissolved oxygen do rogora et al 2018 within these waterbodies crucially climatic warming will affect the thermal and mixing regimes of lakes and reservoirs it is generally believed for example that warming will lengthen the stratification period and make stratification more stable he et al 2019 sahoo et al 2016 the enhancement of thermal stratification will have a negative impact on aquatic organisms thereby affecting the uses and health of affected waterbodies ptak et al 2020 weber et al 2017 research on the response of thermal stratification to climate change alongside other environmental effects can provide valuable insights for current and future management decisions as well as guide scientific monitoring for evaluating the impacts of climate change the vertical structure of many lakes and reservoirs involves a stratification mixing mechanism across the year magee and wu 2017 zhu et al 2020 periodic vertical overturning is one of the important mechanisms for replenishing do and other substances in the deep water layer schwefel et al 2016 therefore the impact of climate change on such processes has large consequences for the long term safety of the aquatic water environment walsh et al 2020 as thermal expansivity increases with temperature a stronger temperature gradient as well as a higher mean temperature increase stratification schwefel et al 2016 under current climate warming trends slow long term slow warming and short term extreme high temperatures could alter the heat exchange rate at the air water interface and consequently increase the annual heat flux in lakes piccolroaz et al 2020 although the water column warms across the entire depth range the extent of warming diminishes with depth and strengthens stratification relative to mixing processes lewis et al 2019 such shifts in water mixing modes make thermal stratification occur earlier in the year and prolongs the stratification period mi et al 2020 sahoo et al 2016 this strengthened thermal stratification can lead to the occurrence of hypolimnetic hypoxia or anoxia sahoo et al 2013 furthermore strengthened oxygen stratification promotes algal reproduction and delays fish spawning thus affecting the structure and function of lake and reservoir ecosystems piccolroaz et al 2018 such changes also pose risks for drinking water safety and human health czernecki and ptak 2018 the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp has an average altitude of 4 000 m above sea level a s l and widely distributed lakes with a total area of over 4 104 km2 given the development of china s water conservancy projects in the source region of the qtp the region s lakes and reservoirs are of heightened concern qiu 2008 the qtp has a unique atmospheric circulation which has an important impact on the asian monsoon and global climate change ding et al 2007 furthermore the aquatic ecosystem structure on the qtp is vulnerable to disruption by human impacts and environmental change zhu et al 2019 for example the aquatic organisms on the qtp grow slowly and are sensitive to changes in hydraulic conditions including water temperature and flow rate mengzhen et al 2012 therefore the impacts of water temperature changes on the ecological environment are expected to be more significant here than in other locations due to its high altitude temperature monitoring data from bangong co co means lake in the tibetan language and nam co fig 1 on the qtp show that the lakes are dimictic seasonally ice covered with wind and solar radiation being the main drivers of vertical turnover wang et al 2019 simulations of nam co s water temperature show that under climate warming the summer stratification forming time advanced by approximately 4 d decade 1 and the summer stratification period increased by 6 d decade 1 huang et al 2017 although stratification conditions under ice have not yet been examined reservoirs are usually designed to meet specific human requirements such as flood prevention power generation shipping and irrigation chen et al 2016 to maximize storage potential reservoirs commonly have large water catchment areas leading to relatively high flow rates and the presence of more concentrated particulates nutrients and pollutants hayes et al 2017 the inflows to most reservoirs are from a main river and form a interflow intrusion with a prevailing dominant direction whereas natural lakes tend to show a different pattern with inflows becoming quickly mixed chen and fang 2015 while reservoirs formed by damming preexisting rivers can resemble either a storage or run of river system coupled with their artificial control properties internal mixing processes vary from natural lakes zarfl et al 2015 most studies treat reservoirs and lakes as similar waterbodies and consider their response to climate change from a thermodynamic perspective to be comparable at present however there is little known of the thermal behavior and mixing mechanisms of dimictic reservoirs in response to climate change in high altitude areas moreover hypoxic conditions are predominantly controlled by deep mixing in winter the decrease in the maximum mixing depth caused by climate warming directly leads to a significant decrease in do concentrations in the hypolimnion li et al 2020 schwefel et al 2016 nevertheless few studies have examined the mixing process and its influencing factors in dimictic reservoirs during the low temperature period to address these gaps this study was conducted to better understand the evolution of the thermal and mixing regimes in reservoirs in high altitude areas under future climate change scenarios and identify the dominant factors driving these processes we focus on pangduo reservoir a run of river reservoir located on the qtp we investigate changes in thermal and mixing regimes in the reservoir using the two dimensional ce qual w2 model based on representative concentration paths rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 from an ensemble of four different global climate models we develop a characteristic index to quantify the transformation of thermal stratification and mixing mechanisms under the future climate trends providing a scientific and theoretical reference for the adaptive management of reservoirs in the qtp region and other high altitude areas in response to climate change 2 methods 2 1 study site pangduo reservoir is the largest water conservancy project in the qtp region above 4 000 m a s l fig 1 the height of the dam is 62 m and the elevation of the riverbed near the dam is 4 038 m a s l there are two power tunnels 7 m high and 6 m wide at pangduo dam with an entrance bottom elevation of 4 059 m a s l the full capacity of the reservoir below 4 095 m a s l is 12 3 108 m3 the primary functions of pangduo reservoir are to supply irrigation water and generate power but the reservoir is also important for flood control urban water supply and ecological environmental protection to characterize the thermal conditions in the reservoir and provide boundary conditions for model verification we conducted water temperature and meteorological monitoring as summarized in table s a1 2 2 numerical models we used the ce qual w2 model for our research cole and buchak 2003 a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model while this model does not consider variations in river width it can be applied to waterbodies with longitudinal and vertical temperature gradients such as pangduo reservoir the main boundary conditions in the model are inflow outflow inflow water temperature and meteorological conditions water density is driven by temperature and chemical stratification is not considered here an ice component is included in ce qual w2 which is based on an ice cover with ice to air heat exchange conduction through the ice conduction between the underlying water and a melt temperature layer at the bottom of the ice layer this model has been widely applied to reservoirs and river impoundments worldwide the source code is freely available http www ce pdx edu w2 allowing its extension and application using new formulations and algorithms table s a2 there is no input for long wave radiation in ce qual w2 therefore we added an algorithm to read in the long wave radiation based on modified source code 2 2 1 model grid and input data the model grid is shown in fig s a1 with a longitudinal size of 100 300 m and vertical size of 2 m meteorological input data were based on collective representative path rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 of the gfdl esm2m model isimip2b climate data were bias corrected for the required

socioeconomic inputs to force a wide range of climate impact models using publicly available data currently in the second phase isimip2b was developed in response to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc special report on the 1 5 c target which provides the best scientific basis for political discussions about climate change mitigation and adaptation measures isimip2b data were

esm2m hadgem2 es and miroc5 at daily temporal and 0 5 horizontal resolutions frieler et al 2017 these data were obtained from the earth system grid federation website https esgf llnl gov our climate model selection was constrained by data accuracy which we evaluated based on historical forecasts of air temperature and measured air temperature between 1981 and 2005 the results of this assessment showed that root mean square errors rmses of 3 42 c gfdl esm2m 4 39 c ipsl cm5a lr 3 92 c hadgem2 es and 4 13 c miroc5 respectively with corresponding coefficients of determination r2 of 0 8007 gfdl

withdrawal rate and water level changes were assumed to be consistent over the 2021 2099 simulation period no inflow water temperatures were available for the isimip database but a linear regression of measured water temperatures tw and observed air temperatures ta 2016 2017 revealed a high correlation of r2 0 96 tw 0 7684 ta 1 2571 this relationship was used to calculate the inflow temperature based on the projected air temperature within each climate scenario fig s a6 a similar approach can be found in mi et al 2020 and bueche and vetter 2015 2 2 2 model calibration and validation the calibration period of the model was from august 26 to august 31 2016 during the stratification period and the verification period was from september 15 2016 to february 15 2017 the inflow water temperature and meteorological input data included measured data from the observational points shown in fig 1 we used monthly measured data from a ysi exo2 probe and extracted values for the calibration and verification periods for the upstream area of the dam the calibration of the pangduo reservoir ce qual w2 model focused on the shading coefficients shade the wind sheltering coefficient wsc and the light extinction coefficient exh2o which had the greatest influence on the simulated temperature profiles sensitivity analysis showed that when shade was set to 0 8 wsc was 1 0 and exh2o was 0 45 m 1 the generated temperature profile best matched the measured temperature profile fig s a8 and table s a4 the verification period included the low temperature period in winter and the high temperature period in summer simulated and measured variations in the temperatures of the epilimnion the metalimnion and the hypolimnion were generally well matched fig 2 the average error was 0 1 c the standard deviation std was 0 50 c and the root mean square error rmse was 0 498 c during the entire verification period 2 3 statistical analysis and stratification index to better evaluate changes in the thermal stratification and the water temperature stratified structure of the waterbody the buoyancy frequency n 1 s dake and harleman 1969 which indicates the stability of the water column was applied 1 n g ρ 0 ρ z z where ρ z is the density at depth z kg m3 which is assumed to be solely temperature dependent cole and buchak 2003 ρ 0 is the average density of the whole water column kg m3 and g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 the stratification stability index si was selected to quantify the stratification stability of the water column which was calculated as follows sahoo et al 2016 2 si z 0 z l z z ρ z d z where z is the depth of the water column from the surface z0 zl and z are the depths of the surface water the lower end of the water column and the centroid of the water column respectively and ρ z is the water density at depth z water age days describes the duration of time that water remains in a waterbody and is defined as the persistence of water after it enters a reservoir from upstream in ce qual w2 water age was calculated as a variable using transportation equation with the zero order decay rate of 1 d 1 as the value of inflow was set to 0 when entering the reservoir it would increase by 1 per day if it wouldn t been diluted or discharged off from reservoir the source term of water age in transportation equation is as follow cole and buchak 2003 3 s age k k 1 day the temperature of the river water flowing into a reservoir is almost always different from the temperature of the surface meaning that the density is also different whenever the density of the inflow waterbody is equal to the density of the reservoir waterbody the inflow waterbody leaves the river bottom and the inflow intrudes into the reservoir horizontally here the inflow intrusion depth was determined by searching the vertical water temperature in front of the dam from the surface to the bottom for the location where the lake temperature was equal to the inflow water temperature the difference between the water level and the elevation at this isothermal point was adopted as the calculated intrusion depth microsoft excel 2010 was used for all statistical procedures including linear regression analysis and mann kendall tests with a significance level of z 1 96 kendall 1990 mann 1945 3 results 3 1 thermal structure the modeled daily vertical temperature from 2022 to 2099 upstream of the dam showed that pangduo reservoir is a typical dimictic reservoir with similar variations observed in each scenario fig s b1 the water column showed the same vertical temperature structure in april and november in winter the surface remains ice covered and the bottom water temperature is stable at approximately 4 c in summer the water column is thermally stratified with higher surface water temperatures and the thermocline mainly occurs at depths of 20 30 m however due to the variability of the input data a variable inter annual temperature structure was observed in the model to analyze differences between each model scenario further averaged daily data were examined decadally for the 2030s 2060s and 2090s fig 3 the average daily surface water temperatures under the ice during ice covered periods during these decades under rcp 2 6 were stable at 6 61 6 54 and 6 50 c respectively and the difference between the three typical years was 0 11 c however under rcp 8 5 the average temperatures were 6 51 7 13 and 7 85 c respectively which is 1 34 c higher in the 2090s and 2030s projections upstream of the dam between 2022 and 2099 and under the same initial field conditions the average annual surface water temperature during the 78 year simulation period was 7 46 7 56 7 67 8 00 c under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively fig 4 with corresponding rates of change of 0 00 0 05 0 12 and 0 22 c decade 1 respectively rcp 2 6 and 4 5 showed no significant trends zrcp2 6 1 25 1 96 zrcp4 5 1 48 1 96 while the surface water temperature increased significantly under rcp 6 0 and 8 5 zrcp6 0 5 68 1 96 zrcp8 5 8 94 1 96 3 2 reservoir stratification and stability the daily vertical buoyancy frequency from 2022 to 2099 upstream of the dam varied between 0 and 1 2 s 1 in the 0 15 m zone of the epilimnion fig s b2 the average annual surface buoyancy frequency remained stable under rcp 2 6 zrcp2 6 0 21 1 96 but increased significantly under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 2 04 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 3 05 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 86 1 96 furthermore the average annual buoyancy frequency in the thermocline at depths of 20 30 m showed significant upward trends under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 3 10 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 6 75 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 9 08 1 96 the buoyancy frequency for the day with the strongest stratification in summer is shown in fig 5 i e the largest temperature difference between the surface and bottom with stable multi year average dates between july 17 to july 22 under four scenarios with no significant trends rcp 6 0 and 8 5 showed significant upward trends zrcp6 0 1 99 1 96 zrcp8 5 2 03 1 96 the average buoyancy frequency in the thermocline at depths of 20 30 m under each scenario was 0 55 0 56 0 57 and 0 60 s 1 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively and showed significant upward trends under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 2 75 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 2 28 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 06 1 96 fig 6 shows the annual average stratified stability index si upstream of pangduo dam from 2022 to 2099 under the four scenarios with values of 40 68 42 15 44 29 and 49 48 kg m2 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the annual mean si increased significantly under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 4 22 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 7 87 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 9 45 1 96 but was stable under rcp 2 6 zrcp2 6 0 76 1 96 under all future scenarios stratification stability gradually strengthened over time 3 3 water age although the water age distributions under the four scenarios were similar there were some quantitative differences fig s b3 in spring april and autumn november the water age distribution of the water column was at approximately 160 and 55 d respectively in summer due to thermal stratification exchange between the upper and the lower waterbody was prevented and the waterbody was mainly replaced in the middle and upper water column when the water age varied between 10 and 80 d in the autumn retention in the hypolimnion increased to approximately 300 d until vertical turnover occurred under rcp 2 6 the average water age of the hypolimnion in the 2030s 2060s and 2090s was 224 225 and 225 d respectively in comparison under rcp 8 5 the water age at the bottom was 224 233 and 242 d in the 2030s 2060s and 2090s respectively in the 2090s the average age of the hypolimnion increased by 18 6 d relative to the 2030s fig s b4 fig 7 shows the average annual water age at the bottom considered the lowest cell upstream of the dam under each scenario from 2022 to 2099 with the same initial conditions the average age of the bottom water over the 78 year simulation period was 224 226 228 and 232 d under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively with significant corresponding trends of 0 05 zrcp2 6 2 31 1 96 0 92 zrcp4 5 3 62 1 96 1 73 zrcp6 0 7 68 1 96 and 3 2 d decade 1 zrcp8 5 9 40 1 96 these trends indicate that the bottom water remained in place for a progressively longer period and as such became increasingly difficult to replace with new water 4 discussion 4 1 response of the dimictic reservoir to climate warming the temperature structure and stratification of pangduo reservoir showed strong seasonal changes fig 3 and fig 4 during the year there was ice cover from december to march and the reservoir was stably stratified during the rest of the year with two periods of mixing in our analyses we used a temperature difference of 2 c from the surface to bottom to indicate stratification under each scenario from late november to early december air temperatures were below 0 c the heat loss rate from the reservoir accelerated and the surface water temperature cooled and convective sinking occurred the temperature structure tended towards a vertically isothermal structure until the temperature fell to 3 94 c and the further loss of heat in the surface waterbody caused a vertical temperature gradient inversion this structure remained stable under rcp 2 6 but showed delays of 1 1 1 8 and 4 1 d decade 1 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively when ice formed at the surface the ice layer provided thermal protection for the waterbody such that heat exchange shifted from water to air to ice to water heat exchange this ice layer protection mechanism results in a relatively stable waterbody and the temperature inversion is delayed accordingly öğlü et al 2020 until the freezing period is over more than half of the solar energy is absorbed by the upper layers this absorbed heat is no longer used to melt ice cover and the heat budget of the surface waterbody is controlled by penetrating short wave radiation and cooling via surface heat loss li et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the snow cover was not considered in this study because the study area was mostly in the temperate monsoon climate zone and the average precipitation was only 2 mm per month in winter from 1981 to 2010 during the 78 year simulation period under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 climate warming was not sufficient to change the freezing state in winter but in the 2080s to 2090s there were some years without ice cover under the rcp85 scenario fig s b5 in conditions without ice cover the surface water temperature rose and the temperature inversion stratification could disappear the ice thickness was significantly reduced under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 5 00 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 17 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 8 44 1 96 at the same time the number of ice covered days in winter reduced under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 5 70 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 28 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 8 79 1 96 which is consistent with existing studies woolway and merchant 2019 reservoirs typically control larger catchment areas and have more inflows than natural lakes and their catchment areas often show a stronger degree of interaction and greater momentum hayes et al 2017 the outlet structure is an important component of many reservoirs naderi et al 2014 having an overall effect on the waterbody and therefore generating areas of dominant flows akiyama and stefan 1987 for example higher flow rates and the existence of interflow often enhance water mixing and lower water ages compared to lakes hayes et al 2017 in pangduo reservoir the heat of inflow during the warming period is not stored in the waterbody but released through the interflow with discharged water the inflows to lakes are quickly mixed and stagnate for longer than in reservoirs accumulating heat more effectively while summer thermal stratification in erken lake and nam co lake has advanced from 4 d to 3 weeks arvola et al 2009 huang et al 2017 we observed that this was postponed by 0 2 to 6 9 d in pangduo reservoir fig 8 in summer the heat absorption of water bodies is higher than the heat emission such that surface water is continuously heated as a result the surface water temperature rise much faster than in the deep layers meanwhile combined with the effect of interflow and the light extinction of the reservoir the thermocline can appear on the surface and the buoyancy frequency increases which block the vertical exchange of material and energy zhang et al 2014 in our simulations the end of the summer stratification was significantly postponed by 1 17 and 3 21 d decade 1 under rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 1 99 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 93 1 96 respectively but remained stable under rcp 2 6 zrcp2 6 0 42 1 96 and rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 0 28 1 96 fig 8 and fig s b6 there was a long period of stratification in summer after the mixing in spring therefore the spring mixing period is a particularly important do supplementation process the spring mixing period remained stable under rcp 2 6 which significantly decreased by 2 85 3 40 and 4 1 d decade 1 under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 4 81 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 56 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 6 02 1 96 respectively fig s b7 the thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs may cause a series of environmental impacts especially in the case of do north et al 2014 previous studies show that an increase in the duration of thermal stratification in summer increases the duration of hypoxic conditions in the bottom water foley et al 2011 in our modeling we used a buoyancy frequency of 0 2 s 1 as the threshold value of the average annual thickness of the metalimnion under the four climate scenarios the upper boundary of the metalimnion advanced toward the surface by 0 10 0 59 m over the 78 year simulation period while the lower boundary remained relatively stable average thickness range 0 12 0 43 m however the degree of stratification was not affected by this expansion of the metalimnion fig s b8 whereas buoyancy was gradually strengthened fig 5 for dimictic reservoirs at high altitudes thermal protection during the frozen period and heat loss due to water withdrawal prevent efficient heat accumulation which delays the vertical inversion temperature period furthermore the shortening in the spring mixing period poses a potential risk for water quality finally our model shows the existence of a surface thermocline in summer that block vertical exchanges in the water column and delays stratification 4 2 mixing characteristics in response to climate change an important feature of run of river reservoirs that distinguishes them from lakes is that inflows and outflows are the main driving forces of internal mixing chen et al 2016 inflows push static water in front until the density is equalized forming a dominant layer of intrusion water yildirim and kocabaş 1998 this delivers important nutrients for biogeochemical cycling including carbon and nitrogen becker et al 2010 in pangduo reservoir the inflow intrusion depth was stable during the summer stratification period under rcp 2 6 but significantly increased by 0 28 0 53 and 0 71 m decade 1 under rcp 4 5 zrcp4 5 3 31 1 96 rcp 6 0 zrcp6 0 5 56 1 96 and rcp 8 5 zrcp8 5 7 80 1 96 respectively fig 9 the invading flow drove nutrients to deeper areas of the reservoir under more intense simulated climate warming the correlation between the inflow intrusion depth and the si strengthened and except for rcp 2 6 was significant r2 0 18 0 50 and 0 75 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively p 0 01 fig 10 these trends indicate that strengthened thermal stratification under warming conditions would dominate the mixing characteristics of the deeper inflow intrusion in the reservoir at the same time due to the extension of the summer stratification period fig s b6 and the increase in water age fig 7 nutrients would remain in the middle and bottom layers of the reservoir for a longer period as long as the respiration rates of organisms in the hypolimnion are moderate under these conditions a waterbody would likely enter a hypoxic or even hypoxic state which could promote the release of endogenous phosphorus in the bottom waters north et al 2014 4 3 effects of climate change on dissolved oxygen under climate warming oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion during the stratification period is increased in lakes and reservoirs zhang et al 2014 and altered stratification characteristics may further affect the do regime in bottom waters furthermore organic matter in the upper layer sinks to the lower layers via a series of decomposition processes that reduce the do content kraemer et al 2017 in pangduo reservoir summertime do in the epilimnion and metalimnion ranged between 5 7 and 6 5 mg l between 84 1 and 95 9 saturation fig s b9 and was significantly depleted in the hypolimnion forming a hypoxic zone do 4 mg l for deep freshwater lakes and reservoirs with seasonal stratification and mixing vertical mixing after stratification is an important and effective mechanism of do replenishment in the hypolimnion sahoo et al 2013 in pangduo reservoir two periods of vertical mixing were identified in spring and autumn in november before winter freezing and in april before the summer stratification period the reservoir was enriched in do average 7 1 mg l here we set up a discussion scenario and performed a rough calculation of the variation trends of do the oxygen consumption rate of the stagnant layer during the summer stratification period was 0 0125 mg l d 1 calculated according to equation 4 as follows 4 v do c d o 1 c d o 2 δ t where cdo1 and cdo2 were the measured do concentrations in april and november 2017 respectively and t was the interval time assuming that the oxygen consumption rate is constant we estimated the do concentrations in the hypolimnion at the end of the stratification under the four climate scenarios fig 11 the do concentration in the hypolimnion significantly decreases under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 being most prominent in deep reservoirs as decomposition can continue for longer before all the organic matter is consumed moreover the period of hypoxia do 4 mg l in the hypolimnion increased significantly under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 fig s b10 once the do concentration in the hypolimnion exceeds the accumulation and replenishment rate of oxygen ito and momii 2015 an anaerobic environment can form which might indirectly lead to the release of soluble endogenous phosphorus north et al 2014 and furthermore anaerobic zones are inefficient at retaining phosphorus garnier et al 2005 we consider these outcomes are based on conservative estimates indeed under the current warming trend the biochemical activity in the reservoir and the oxygen consumption rate of the hypolimnion will likely increase under projected climate warming our simulations indicate that the metalimnion in pangduo reservoir will expand slightly and become strengthened hindering the vertical mixing of the water column compression of the spring mixing period and strengthening of summer stratification will likely greatly weaken the mechanism by which do is supplemented to the hypolimnion through vertical mixing as long as the lake stays dimictic the do supply mechanism would not be completely destroyed hypoxia in the hypolimnion during the summer stratification period is therefore enhanced additionally we expect the inflow intrusion depth to significantly increase under furture climate warming scenarios with thermal stratification further dominating the mixing characteristics in the reservoir finally based on the supply and retention of nutrients in the bottom waters the accumulation of organic matter and the consumption of oxygen in the hypolimnion are promoted which could further threaten water quality 4 4 future perspectives changes in thermal mixing regimes of reservoirs under climate warming threaten water quality security and biodiversity walsh et al 2020 as primary drinking water resources effective reservoir management must balance economic goals and environmental protection requirements weber et al 2017 in many reservoirs in the temperate north utilizing taking water from the hypolimnion is a fundamental strategy this aims to enhance vertical mixing avoid hypoxia and reduce the release of nutrients from sediment çalışkan and elçi 2009 as such the selective water intake mode of reservoirs is an important management model to control thermal regimes both the reservoir areas and downstream rivers this is mainly achieved by drawing water from the epilimnion and metalimnion to adjust the thermal regime in the reservoir area hallnan et al 2020 mi et al 2019 for pangduo reservoir in summer selective water extraction could be adopted to release water from the epilimnion and the upper part of the metalimnion to increase the height of the thermocline and inflow intrusion and thereby dilute the density differences in the upper layers at the end of summer stratification period or earlier releasing water from the hypolimnion would strengthen vertical mixing accelerate the replacement of bottom water and supplement the do supply in autumn for illustration taking 2099 under rcp 8 5 scenario as an example we considered the effect of taking water from the epilimnion from june to july and from august to july from the hypolimnion fig 12 pangduo reservoir did not actually have selective water intakes and here was only a design discussion condition based on june to september water intake test period the average si was 141 78 kg m2 single intake case and 123 03 kg m2 selective intake case respectively the stratification strength of the selective intake case was reduced by 13 2 this effect would continue into winter the average water age of bottom water was 266 14 d single intake case and 256 50 d selective intake case respectively due to the delay in the flow in the reservoir it would be easier to replace the water at the hypolimnion during the cooling period november after the stratification is weakened however it should be noted that thermal stratification is controlled by a range of factors encompassing climatic conditions reservoir operation modes and water intake locations as well as operational safety and economic constraints song et al 2019 further research is needed therefore to examine the individual and combined influences of these different factors previous studies indicate that reservoirs undergo a subtle mixing process over diurnal cycles yang et al 2020 specifically the epilimnion is heated during the day and cools at night consequently heat flux from surface layers fluctuates positively and negatively throughout the day and vertical density convection can occur van emmerik et al 2013 such convective movement promotes the mixing of upper layers of water which generally erodes the stable thermocline structure and can weaken the buoyancy effect during the summer stratification period vercauteren et al 2011 future research is now required to consider the impacts of such diurnal thermal regimes in reservoirs especially with respect to the response of mixing mechanisms to climate change 5 conclusions a two dimensional hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was configured to study the response of thermal and mixing regimes to climate change in the dimictic pangduo reservoir on the qtp based on our results a delay in summer stratification was a key response corresponding to an extension of 1 17 and 3 21 d decade 1 under rcp 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the spring mixing period showed significant compression reducing by 2 85 3 40 and 4 10 d decade 1 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively this is a potential threat to oxygen replenishment in spring under the studied climate warming scenarios the metalimnion expanded slightly while its stratification strength increased preventing vertical mixing in the water column moreover the depth of inflow penetration increased significantly by 0 28 0 53 and 0 71 m decade 1 under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively this was associated with enhanced thermal stratification the increase in the inflow intrusion depth and the extension of the retention time of the hypolimnion are potential risks to water quality in this region the do concentrations in the hypolimnion also significantly decreased under rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 overall our results provide valuable new evidence to help support the development of appropriate adaptive management strategies for pangduo reservoir as well as similar

3984,as the critical parameter of the agricultural drought process soil moisture sm has the potential to monitor agricultural drought which can provide practical support for water management in this study a drought index namely soil dryness index sdi was proposed based on long term gridded era 5 land sm and its performance was evaluated furthermore we employed the run theory and copula to study the spatiotemporal drought characteristics based on this index in inner mongolia although the return period of drought events has been assessed in many studies the drought tends to occur with a nonstationary frequency the wavelet transform was then applied to drought area proportion time series in sub regions to study the temporal characteristics of droughts the results show that sdi performs well in monitoring agricultural drought there is strong heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of drought events frequent and low severity droughts dominated arid and semi arid regions while some high severity droughts mainly occurred in humid and semi humid regions mainly in hulunbuir and xing an the droughts especially those with high severity have become much more frequent in the last two decades the period from 2000 to 2010 had seen more frequent droughts in recent 40 years and most 20 year return period droughts occurred during this period these findings could contribute to a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural droughts and provide a reference for future drought trends in inner mongolia keywords soil moisture soil dryness index agricultural drought copula wavelet transform inner mongolia 1 introduction in recent decades decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration have resulted in frequent droughts with global warming spinoni et al 2014 trenberth et al 2014 drought affects many aspects of human life threatening the security of agricultural production and ecosystem vo et al 2020 agricultural food production is exceedingly vulnerable to extreme drought especially in china yu et al 2018 as a substantial production base of the livestock industry and major grain producing region in china inner mongolia needs effective drought risk management huang et al 2015b therefore it is essential and instructive to study the spatiotemporal distribution of drought in inner mongolia the droughts can be typically classified into four categories meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 among which agricultural drought has the most direct effects on grasses and crop yields generally agricultural drought is defined as the lack of sm resulting in reduced crop yields mishra and singh 2010 which is also the most frequent natural disaster and causes the heaviest crop damage in inner mongolia li et al 2014 shen 2008 numerous indices have been proposed or been improved to quantify agricultural droughts they mainly include precipitation based indices such as rainfall anomaly index rai van rooy 1965 and standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 moisture based or moisture balance based indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi the self calibrated pdsi sc pdsi wells et al 2004 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 vegetation based indices such as normalized difference vegetation index anomaly ndvia li et al 2014 pdsi spi and their improvements i e sc pdsi and spei have been used extensively among these indices mishra and singh 2010 pdsi was derived based on a soil water equation and this index incorporated precipitation sm supply runoff and potential evapotranspiration spi was calculated based on only precipitation nevertheless many studies have proved that spi had a better performance in the indication of sm variation sims et al 2002 prediction of crop production quiring and papakryiakou 2003 and extreme drought events extraction lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 than pdsi however some studies showed that temperature rise could not be ignored in the drying process spei was therefore proposed based on spi vicente serrano et al 2010 and it used the influence of evapotranspiration efficiently although these indices are widely used in agricultural drought studies they indicate the conditions in different stages of agricultural drought according to li et al 2014 the agricultural drought process can be simplified as a temporal sequence of precipitation sm vegetation growth and yield we can briefly group the spi and spei into the precipitation stage indices however compared with precipitation sm directly affects transpiration and root water uptake of plants and contributes to vegetation growth liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016b although some vegetation based indices e g ndvia can well indicate agricultural drought water management is of limited significance at the vegetation growth stage because the drought have already affected the vegetation as the critical parameter of the agricultural drought process sm has the potential to indicate agricultural drought conditions which can provide timely and effective water resources management support sridhar et al 2008 long term and time and space continuous sm is the basis of drought monitoring sm is generally obtained based on land surface models regional climate models or remote sensing methods grillakis 2019 nowadays many global sm datasets have been released chen et al 2021 mainly including satellite observed products e g amsre smos smap reanalysis based land surface model products e g era5 land gldas and data fusion products e g cci era5 land provides long term sm with a high spatiotemporal resolution among many sm datasets which is a suitable dataset for agricultural drought monitoring some studies have proved that a good correlation between the era5 land top layer sm and in situ measurements exists muñoz sabater et al 2021 here we focused on applying the index based on sm only as an indicator of agricultural drought then the spei and ndvia are chosen as two indices for comparison many scholars have carried out studies on drought events drought duration and severity are two main characteristics of drought events shiau 2006 stephenson et al 2008 they were commonly extracted using run theory based on index time series such as pdsi and spei drought events and their characteristics are random variables and an event can be considered rare or not rare depending on how often the event happens stephenson et al 2008 therefore probability theory is one of the effective methods to study drought univariate drought characteristics can be easily analyzed because of well developed univariate probability distribution functions however it is challenging to get their joint distribution from univariate distributions when the variables follow different distributions and a correlation between them exists the copula function has been extensively used as a tool to fit the multivariate distribution of drought events because it can model the dependence structure among random variables independently of the marginal distribution ayantobo et al 2019 ayantobo et al 2017 serinaldi et al 2009 shiau 2006 vo et al 2020 moreover the return period of drought events based on a fitted probability distribution is a valuable parameter to assess drought events shiau 2003 shiau 2006 besides drought duration and severity the area extent of drought is also an important factor to consider andreadis et al 2005 sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 the site data can provide long term continuous and accurate meteorological parameters therefore there are many studies on drought monitoring based on site data however station based analysis can hardly provide support for regional drought management ayantobo et al 2017 nevertheless there are some studies exploring the spatial patterns of drought from station information for example ayantobo et al 2017 defined the droughty area proportion as the ratio of the number of meteorological stations experiencing drought to total stations vo et al 2020 employed the hot spot analysis tool to estimate the spatial extreme drought patterns however station data has limited representative information to the study region compared with station data gridded sm data can directly evaluate spatial patterns of drought events moreover drought events may occur with varying frequencies due to global warming heim 2015 zhang et al 2011 even though the return period of drought events can reflect the probability of droughts in different degrees and provide support for drought risk management concentrated droughts can lead to poor management decisions we employed wavelet transforms to explore the occurrence rules of drought events on the time axis in so doing we constructed droughty area proportion time series which were defined as the ratio of droughty area to the total area considering the area extent of droughts the fundamental purpose of this paper is to study the spatiotemporal distribution of drought events in inner mongolia the main novelties of our paper are that 1 a soil dryness index was proposed using gridded sm data era5 land with a high spatial resolution based on which agricultural drought characteristics e g return period were presented on a regional scale 2 the wavelet transform method was employed for the occurrence characteristics frequency and amplitude study of drought events by considering the areal extent of droughts this article is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief introduction of the study area and datasets section 3 provides a description of methods used in this study section 4 is the presentation of the results a further discussion is shown in section 5 and the conclusion is given in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is shown in fig 1 inner mongolia is located in the north of china with an average annual precipitation of 30 500 mm a wide distribution of grasslands throughout inner mongolia and extensively distributed croplands in tongliao chifeng baynnur hohhot and hulunbuir make inner mongolia be the production base of the livestock industry and a major grain producing region in china inner mongolia is a typical arid region in china except for the humid and semi humid regions to the east of dahingganling mountain most parts of inner mongolia are arid and semi arid regions zheng et al 2013 the frequency and intensity of droughts have been proved to increase generally in inner mongolia during the last 500 years peng et al 2018 it is the dark region in northern china shown in the insert in fig 1 and is the area of choice analysed in this article it is of great significance to study the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in inner mongolia for its sustainable development of the economy and ecology 2 2 data 2 2 1 soil moisture data the era5 datasets era5 land hourly data from 1981 to present https doi org 10 24381 cds e2161bac provide sm data with four different soil layers soil layer 1 0 7 cm soil layer 2 7 28 cm soil layer 3 28 100 cm and soil layer 4 100 289 cm we obtained the volume of water m3 m3 in the topsoil layer 0 7 cm from 1981 to 2019 this parameter has a high spatial and temporal resolution about 9 km and hourly respectively we processed the hourly sm data into daily mean sm firstly for further application 2 2 2 meteorological data we selected three meteorological stations tulihe 50434 xiaoergou 50548 and erenhot 53068 in the study area covered by woody savannas croplands and grasslands respectively and monthly precipitation and temperature data from 1981 to 2018 of the three stations were acquired from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html to calculate spei 2 2 3 ndvi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated based on the reflectance of near infrared and red radiation directly reflecting vegetation conditions pettorelli et al 2005 we obtained the third generation ndvi dataset from 1982 to 2015 released by the gimms global inventory modelling and mapping studies of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa from the internet with a spatial resolution of 0 0833 and a temporal resolution of 15 days 3 methods first we proposed an empirical statistical index namely the soil dryness index sdi based on sm data second we extracted drought events over pixel scale by the run theory based on the sdi time series drought severity ds and drought duration dd of each drought event were obtained and their joint distribution is fitted by archimedean copulas third the return period of drought events was calculated based on fitted distributions to study the spatial distribution characteristics of drought events in inner mongolia moreover we employed the wavelet transform to study the temporal distribution characteristics of drought in different degrees in inner mongolia based on the droughty area proportion time series 3 1 definition of soil dryness index commonly drought is defined based on the magnitude of dryness and the duration of the dry period stephenson et al 2008 we firstly proposed the soil dryness index sdi to characterize the degree of dryness here sdi is defined as the degree of drought measured by the sm below a certain threshold when sm exceeds the threshold sdi is 0 a constant absolute value cannot be applied as the threshold over the whole region because of soil texture heterogeneity percentile thresholds may be more suitable for spatial comparisons than a fixed threshold zhang et al 2011 and have been applied in many studies for example the cpc climate prediction center classifies droughts based on sm time series percentiles a 10 percentile is defined as a threshold of severe drought for a 70 year record https www cpc ncep noaa gov products soilmst monitoring therefore we choose a constant value based on the empirical distribution of daily sm time series from 1981 to 2019 the 10th quantile of the time series is taken as the threshold which is pixel specific then the sdi is calculated as follows 1 sdi 0 q sm 10 10 q sm q sm 10 where qsm is the quantile of sm in time series sdi ranges from 0 to 10 and the greater the sdi is the drier the area is the sdi is a statistical drought index based on time series at the point scale 3 2 spei and ndvia herein we calculated the monthly spei based on the station precipitation and temperature to verify the drought indication quality of the sdi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is a wetness condition index based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 this index is suited to detect drought conditions in those places where there is a warming trend because of its use of evapotranspiration moreover this index requires only precipitation and temperature and follows the original standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 calculation procedure the spei includes the effect of temperature firstly the potential evapotranspiration pet is computed based on temperature 2 pet 16 n 12 ndm 30 10 t i m where n is the monthly average sunshine hours which can be calculated based on latitude in radians and the average julian day of the month ndm is the number of days of the month t is the monthly mean temperature i is a heat index being calculated using the following formula 3 i i 1 12 t i 5 1 514 where ti is the average monthly mean temperature for month i m is a constant depending on i 4 m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 792 10 2 i 0 49 then the difference between the monthly precipitation p and pet for the month i is calculated using 5 d i p i p e t i the three parameter log logistic distribution is applied to standardize the d series to obtain the spei the log logistic distribution function is as follows 6 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α β and γ are scale shape and origin parameters respectively the parameters can be calculated by the l moments of the d series where 7a α w 0 2 w 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 7b β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 7c γ w 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β and г is the gamma function ws is obtained by the probability weighted moments 8a w s 1 m i 1 m 1 f i s d i 8b f i i 0 35 m where s 0 1 2 m is the total number of months fi is a frequency estimator then the standardized values of f x is computed using equation 9 9 p 1 f x when p 0 5 the spei is calculated by the following formulas 10a w 2 ln p 10b spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 and d3 0 001308 when p 0 5 the spei is calculated as follows 11a w 2 ln 1 p 11b spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 the core of the agricultural drought is the relationship between sm shortage and crop growth li et al 2014 ndvi can directly reflect vegetation growth conditions based on ndvi ndvi anomaly ndvia was also used as an index of agricultural drought moreover because the ndvi increases during the growing season it is hard to learn the effects of drought on vegetation growth based on ndvi the ndvia is a more suitable variable than ndvi in detecting agricultural drought effects and verifying the performance of sdi here we calculated ndvia and compared it to our sdi the ndvia calculation formula is as follows li et al 2014 12 ndvi a i j ndv i i j n d v i ave j ndv i ave j 100 where i is the i th year j is the j th stage during the growing season ndviai j is the ndvi anomaly in the j th stage of the i th year ndviave j is the average ndvi of the ndvi time series of the j th stage 3 3 determination of drought events and their characteristics drought events and their characteristics including drought duration dd drought severity ds and the inter arrival time dl of neighboring drought events in each pixel are determined by run theory guerrero salazar and yevjevich 1975 the schematic diagram of the determination of drought events and their characteristics based on the sdi time series is shown in fig 2 the dd is the lasting days of a drought event in days the ds is the time integral of sdi in a drought event and is unitless before deriving the drought events and their characteristics the sdi maps were processed under the following considerations 1 if the areal extent of droughty pixels is under a specific value in daily sdi maps these pixels would not be considered as drought 2 the drought event identified by the droughty pixel with a short stretch of days should be ignored therefore we filtered out the drought area that contains 10 pixels about 800 km2 in each sdi map and then ignored the drought events that occurred with 5 or fewer such days a drought occurs with at least six consecutive dry days because these shorter conditions can hardly cause drought effects 3 4 distribution of drought duration dd and drought severity ds many studies have explored the suitable distributions of drought event variables generally the dd can be suitably fitted by an exponential distribution lee et al 2013 shiau 2006 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 or a gamma distribution vo et al 2020 and ds can be suitably fitted by a gamma distribution lee et al 2013 shiau 2006 shiau and shen 2001 the generalized pareto distribution can also be used to estimate the quantile corresponding to a specific exceedance probability stephenson et al 2008 here we selected six candidate probability distributions including exponential normal lognormal gamma weibull and generalized pareto to fit variables dd and ds the probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions of the six distributions are shown in table 1 the parameters of each type were estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method the chi squared test was then used to determine the best distribution of variables in each pixel when the variables are intercorrelated and are modelled by different distributions it is hard to get their multivariate distributions from univariate distributions copulas developed by sklar 1959 can link univariate distribution functions to form multivariate distributions shiau 2006 assuming two variables cumulative density functions are fx x and fy y respectively and fx y x y is their joint distribution function there is copula c satisfying the following formula 13 f x y c f x x f y y conversely for any univariate distributions fx x and fy y and copula c the function fx y x y defined above is a joint distribution with marginal distributions fx x and fy y schweizer and sklar 2011 proved that if fx x and fy y are continuous the copula c is unique among copula functions archimedean copulas have been employed widely because of their convenient construction and a wide range capture of dependence structures ayantobo et al 2019 here we paid particular attention to gumbel clayton and frank from archimedean copulas to construct the joint distribution of dd and ds the cumulative probability density function and density function of the three copulas are as shown in table 2 assuming that we have got the marginal distribution function of ds and dd the following steps were adopted to select the best copulas 1 the maximum likelihood estimation method was employed to estimate the copula dependence parameters θ in table 2 2 rmse index equation 14 was used as a goodness of fit test for copulas to select the most suitable copula function 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i t i 2 where ei and ti are the i th empirical and theoretical value n is the number of samples 3 5 return period of drought events we followed the method proposed by shiau and shen 2001 the return period for ds s and dd d can be expressed respectively as 15a t s e d l 1 f d s s 15b t d e d l 1 f d d d where dl is the inter arrival time illustrated in fig 2 e dl is expectation of dl f d s s and f d d d are the cumulative density function of ds and dd further given the return period t we can calculate the corresponding ds and dd using equation 16a and 16b 16a s f d s 1 1 e d l t 16b d f d d 1 1 e d l t because droughts are bivariate events characterized by both ds and dd the joint return period for ds and dd should be defined it can be defined as return period for ds s and dd d and return period for ds s or dd d and their definitions are as follows shiau 2003 shiau 2006 17a t ds e d l 1 f d d d f d s s c f d d d f d s s 17b t ds e d l 1 c f d d d f d s s where c f d d d f d s s is the copula function of the joint distribution the study has proven that the joint return period defined by equation 17b underestimates the results salvadori et al 2011 vo et al 2020 therefore we calculate the joint return period using equation 17a 3 6 wavelet analysis of drought events return period can provide decision support for response to drought events of different degrees however the time series of drought event occurrence is nonstationary at many different frequencies in recent years extreme drought events have become more frequent giannakopoulos et al 2009 liu et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to study the temporal characteristics of the occurrence of drought events in different degrees wavelet transform can decompose a time series into time and frequency space simultaneously through which we can learn the amplitude of different periods and how the amplitude varies with time the wavelet functions are a set of basic functions that can be generated by translating and scaling the wavelet basis function as follows 18 ψ λ τ t 1 λ ψ t τ λ where λ is the scaling parameter and τ is the translating parameter which determine the width and position of the wavelet basis function respectively here morlet was chosen as the wavelet basis function in this study we use its dicrete form where the parameters λ and τ can be given as follows 19 λ τ 2 j 2 j k where k is a location index ranging from 1 to 2 jn n is the number of observations and j is a scale index ranging from 0 to j j is the total number of scales further the discrete wavelet transform are defined as 20 wt s j k 2 j 2 s t ψ 2 j t k d t where s t is the time series a detailed description of wavelet transform can be found in torrence and compo 1998 here we construct the time series of the droughty area proportion in different dry degrees i e drought events with 1 year 5 year 10 year and 20 year return periods then the wavelet transform morlet wavelet was employed in the time series to study its variation in the frequency of occurrence and amplitude the technical route of this study is shown as fig 3 4 results 4 1 comparison between sdi spei and ndvia the semi monthly sdi and ndvia time series of each station were calculated based on a 3 3 pixel window and the monthly spei time series was calculated using the station precipitation and temperature data the comparison results of the three indices at each station are shown in fig 4 the results show that the three indices had a good consistency a lower value of spei corresponded to a higher value of sdi and subsequently the ndvia decreased moreover we also find that when the spei returns to a higher value the sm is still at a low level high sdi value a temporal sequence of agricultural drought processes in the order of spei sdi and ndvia exists generally the sdi can reflect the drought conditions ndvi deviated to a lower value from the mean value of the same period however some abnormal situations also exist such as the ndvia value in august 1998 at xiaoergou station and in september 2009 at tulihe station which are significantly lower than the average value for the same period the main reason is that a significant amount of precipitation occurred during these periods heavy precipitation resulted in vegetation loss in these two vegetation types nevertheless there are also some occasions that heavy precipitation occurred in erenhot which resulted in a better vegetation growth in grasslands 4 2 droughts properties in inner mongolia fig 5 shows the properties of drought events in inner mongolia during the study period from the number of drought events fig 5a hohhot ulaan chab xilin gol chifeng and tongliao had seen many drought events in contrast hulunbuir experienced fewer drought events in the other cities of inner mongolia the number of drought events showed strongly spatial heterogeneity however from fig 5b c drought events occurred in hulunbuir with a relatively high dd and ds even though these regions experience fewer drought events drought events generally occurred with high ds conversely drought events occurred in hohhot ulaan chab xilin gol chifeng and tongliao generally with lower dd and ds from fig 5e f we can also see that the value of maximum dd and ds of drought events in hulunbuir are much higher than in other parts it is worth noting that hetao plain located in baynnur experienced fewer droughts with low ds fig 6 shows the selection results of the best distribution function in three stations i e tulihe xiaoergou and erenhot located in fig 1 which are some examples for distribution fitting at pixel scale according to the chi square the best distribution functions of dd in tulihe xiaoergou and erenhot are exponential exponential and generalized pareto respectively and the best distribution functions of ds in the three pixels are lognormal weibull and lognormal distribution respectively their joint distribution functions are all gumbel copula based on the rmse selection rule we fitted the univariate and joint distribution of ds and dd of droughts pixel by pixel the results fig 7 show that ds mainly conformed to the lognormal distribution 37 6 of total pixels exponential distribution 21 3 of total pixels and generalized pareto distribution 28 0 of total pixels dd mainly conformed to the lognormal distribution 21 0 of total pixels exponential distribution 17 6 of total pixels and generalized pareto distribution 50 6 of total pixels their joint distribution is mainly the gumbel copula which occupied 76 8 of total pixels and the clayton copula share was insignificant at 0 1 the rest going to frank copula 4 3 return period of drought events the return period of droughts was calculated based on the fitted distribution fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of ds occurring with different return periods drought events occurring with the 1 year return period had a high ds in some regions of xilin gol chifeng and tongliao however with the increase of return period of drought events the droughts are more severe in hulunbuir and the western region of alxa than other regions indicating long return period events occurred with higher ds than other parts fig 9 shows a consistent result with fig 8 these results can also indicate that drought events in hohhot ulaan chab xilin gol chifeng and tongliao were mainly with a dd of 10 40 days and ds of 50 200 drought events occurring in hulunbuir and the western region of alxa were mainly with a dd of 20 90 days and ds of 100 600 droughts should be characterized by both dd and ds therefore the joint return period of drought events was also evaluated here we calculated the joint return period in different drought degrees dd 10 20 30 40 50 60 days and ds correspondingly 50 100 200 300 400 500 respectively the results are shown in fig 10 furthermore the linear relationship between dd and ds was pixel specific therefore we also calculated the joint period of drought events with dd 10 20 30 40 50 60 days and corresponding ds restrained by linear regression of ds to dd the results are shown in fig 11 the results show that drought events with 10 or more days duration had a 2 5 years return period in the hetao plain area of baynnur moreover the return period of drought events occurring with 20 or more days duration exceeds 40 years in this region that is severe droughts are rare here when a dd of drought events exceeds 40 days the joint period of drought events exceeds 40 years in most parts of inner mongolia including baynnur ordos baotou hohhot ulaan chab chifeng xilin gol and most regions of alxa in most regions of hulunbuir and xingan however the droughts with a dd 40 days had a 20 to 40 year return period moreover we calculated the average return period for different degrees of droughts in each city the results were shown in fig 12 we briefly classified the drought into mild droughts 5 days dd 20 days moderate droughts 20 days dd 40 days and severe droughts 40 days dd 60 days the results showed that the return period of droughts increased with the increase of dd or ds however the increasing rate of return period in different cities was different the return periods of droughts with 6 10 days duration were shortest in ordos therefore ordos may have the most frequent mild droughts the return periods of moderate droughts were the longest and grew fastest with the increase of dd or ds in ordos and baoto followed by hohhot ulaan chab baynnur and then followed by tongliao xilin gol and alxa in severe droughts regard hulunbuir and xingan had the shortest return period from another perspective the return period of droughts reflects the rarity of droughts in specific locations we can see that the droughts with the 1 year return period generally had a higher value in dd and ds in the semi arid region however with the return period increasing the dd or ds of droughts increased slowly in the semi arid region in these regions rare drought events generally had lower dd and ds than humid and semi humid regions from the joint return period highly severe droughts with high dd and ds generally occurred in humid and semi humid regions and parts of western regions of inner mongolia for example the droughts with a 60 day duration exhibit a 20 to 40 year return period in these regions above however these droughts occurred in arid and semi arid regions with more than a 40 year return period that is these events rarely happen in these regions and seldom in those experiencing more precipitation as expected 4 4 spatiotemporal distribution of drought events in different drought degrees firstly we divided inner mongolia into three regions as shown in fig 13 region 1 with the humid and semi humid region region 2 with the semi arid region region 3 with the arid region according to the spatial heterogeneity of the basic drought properties then the area proportion time series of droughts with different return periods in these regions were constructed fig 13 shows the area proportions of droughts with different return periods generally region 1 experienced fewer slight droughts droughts with a return period 3 years than region 2 and 3 region 1 has seen many severe droughts droughts with a return period 20 years in 1986 1987 2001 2002 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 2011 especially in 2007 2008 a great proportion of region 1 experienced long term severe droughts region 2 also has seen some severe droughts in 2005 2011 moreover we have compared the area proportion time series with the records table a 1 and table a 2 both statistics show the periods from 1996 to 1998 from 2012 to 2013 are wet periods in inner mongolia based on the records some severe drought years include 1982 1984 1986 1989 1991 1994 1995 1999 2001 2003 2004 2007 2009 and 2015 2017 here we defined severe drought years after the 2000 s as the years with an exposed area of crops 2 million hectares referenced to table a 2 the results of this paper are in good agreement with drought record events despite some uncertainty of recorded drought occurrence time extent and location furthermore we plotted the wavelet power spectrum of area proportion time series of droughts with return period rp 1 year 1 years return period 3 years 10 years return period 20 years and return period 20 years in these three regions the results were shown in figs 14 15 and 16 in region 1 fig 14 droughts with return period 3 years had no significant periodical feature from 1981 to 1998 while a significant 1 year circle of these droughts was shown in recent 20 years specially a 5 year circle of droughts with return period 1 year was also found in region 1 from 2008 to 2017 slight droughts return period 3 years showed a significantly increasing trend in recent 20 years the occurrence of moderate and severe drought in region 1 was mainly concentrated from 2002 to 2011 with a periodical feature of 1 5 years in region 2 fig 15 and region 3 fig 16 however slight droughts return period 1 year showed a significant 1 year circle during almost the whole study period the moderate droughts 10 years return period 20 years had a high frequency of occurrence both in region 2 and region 3 from 2004 to 2011 for severe droughts return period 20 years region 2 has seen significant 6 to 32 month circle from 2004 to 2010 there was also higher frequency of drought occurrence in region 3 from 2005 to 2011 moreover moderate or severe droughts also occurred at high frequency in region 3 which is different from region 1 in summary droughts with a 1 year return period occurred in regions 2 and 3 in most years with a significant 1 year periodical feature however the droughts with a 1 year return period occurred only in 1998 2011 and 2015 2019 with a significant cycle of 1 year in region 1 overall the period from 2000 to 2010 was a period of frequent droughts more frequently as the decade unfolded and droughts with a 20 year return period also frequently occurred during these years which is consistent with the previous study based on spei tong et al 2018 a similar pattern of drought also occurred from 2015 to 2019 therefore attention needs to be paid to future drought management moreover there were almost no extensive drought events from 1993 to 1995 in region 1 however region 2 and 3 experience moderate or severe droughts droughts with return period 10 years during this period 5 discussion 5 1 the performance of sdi we compared the sdi with spei and ndvia here a particular relationship between the 1 month time scale spei and sdi generally exists ndvia varied following sdi with a time lag the result fig 4 shows that a temporal sequence of agricultural drought processes in the order of spei sdi and ndvia exist spei was obtained based on precipitation and evapotranspiration however a vast amount of precipitation may be lost through interception and runoff and not supplied to the soil chen et al 2014 according to yao et al 2013 precipitation 5 mm did not replenish soil water content in the horqin sand land we can also see that even though the spei returns to a higher value the sm is still at a low level fig 4 the variation of sdi lags behind spei and the water supply to soil is limited so that the soil may be in a state of prolonged drought in this study we process the sdi maps by filtering out the small drought areas which can reduce the effect of sm data error to some extent and is also reasonable because of the limited drought effects of such drought extent furthermore we consider a drought event to occur if sm falls below the threshold for at least six consecutive days nevertheless there are some limitations in studying the performance of sdi indicating agricultural droughts the ultimate manifestation of agricultural drought is crop yields or livestock yields based on the productivity of grass however there are intricate relationships between sm deficit and crop yield boken et al 2005 firstly even though the drought is a key parameter affecting crop yields and grass productivity other factors including locust plague also greatly impact vegetation according to some reports e g http www china org cn english 2004 aug 102906 htm fluctuations of crop yields and grass productivity induced by other factors cause indistinct relationships between drought and crop yields secondly the effects of droughts on vegetation may be species specific and stage specific that is drought events with the same drought intensities may cause different losses in crop yield or grass productivity if the droughts occur in different vegetation types or different vegetation growth stages therefore further investigations need to be done to clearly state the relationship between drought and vegetation productivity which serves the definition of drought threshold and extraction of drought events they include what the best threshold for sdi calculation in specific vegetation types is and when the sequence of dry spells starts to cause damage to vegetation 5 2 high spatial heterogeneity of droughts in inner mongolia the spatial distribution of droughts exhibits an apparent heterogeneity fig 5 for example there are two distinct heterogeneous regions in hulunbuir which are divided by dahingganling mountains the mountain range also marks the boundary between semi arid and semi humid regions generally the mild droughts hardly occur in humid regions and arid and semi arid regions are prone to frequent mild drought events some possible arguments for the high spatial heterogeneity include the following aspects on the one hand the precipitation pattern of inner mongolia is quite different middle east inner mongolia is mainly affected by eastern asia monsoon which brings more moisture to middle east regions in comparison western inner mongolia is mainly controlled by the westerlies moreover it is noticeable that fewer high severity droughts also dominate the west part of alxa which may be attributable to the increasing trend of annual total precipitation annual precipitation intensity and maximum daily precipitation amount from 1960 to 2012 in this region huang et al 2015a on the other hand sm fluctuates wildly in arid and semi arid regions being affected by soil texture the soil consists of a higher proportion of sandy soil in arid and semi arid regions generally the soil with a high sand content has a low water holding capacity and tends to lose water as expected shukla 2013 5 3 spatiotemporal distribution of droughts in inner mongolia even though the return period can reflect the probability of drought occurrence the frequency and the amplitude of different periods of droughts are changing vastly as shown in figs 14 16 the results show that droughts have occurred much more frequently in recent 20 years than before which may be induced by the intensification of global warming giannakopoulos et al 2009 liu et al 2016 zarch et al 2015 some studies also confirmed the increased frequency of drought occurrence in inner mongolia in recent decades for example a study proves the existence of an abrupt change point in 1999 in inner mongolia after which the drought intensity increased significantly liu et al 2016 pdsi showed a significant downward trend in hulunbuir xing an and tongliao on a pixel scale study from 1982 to 2012 zhang et al 2016a based on pdsi and spi time series zhai et al 2010 also found that songhuajiang river basin in northeastern china has seen the most frequent dry years in the period of 2001 2005 since the 1960 s moreover the most significant increases of drought areas were found in northeastern china from the end of the 1990 s to 2003 zou et al 2005 which is consistent with the increasing drought areas in region 1 fig 13 in addition to a significant 1 year circle of drought occurrence in most of the study period there is also a periodical feature of 2 5 years especially for high return period droughts which may be associated with el niño southern oscillation enso variability bao et al 2015 generally the precipitation in inner mongolia is mainly affected by the moisture from the pacific ocean the dahingganling mountains have substantial effects on moisture transmission that may be the reason why arid and semi arid regions also experienced severe drought in some wet years of region 1 e g in 1993 1995 6 conclusion this paper aims to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural drought in inner mongolia firstly we proposed a soil moisture based index the soil dryness index sdi based on gridded era 5 land soil moisture sm data which is the basis of agricultural drought monitoring and its performance is evaluated in drought monitoring we then employed run theory to extract the droughts based on the sdi time series two main features drought duration dd and drought severity ds were obtained the return period of droughts was calculated based on the best fitted distribution of dd and ds in the end we constructed the area proportion time series of droughts in three subregions and employed the wavelet transform to study their frequency and amplitude the main findings include 1 the sdi is a suitable variable to monitor agriculture drought 2 a strong heterogeneity in drought distribution exists in inner mongolia humid semi humid regions and the western part of alxa were mainly dominated by high severity high ds and dd droughts and fewer droughts occurred in the last four decades however arid and semi arid regions were dominated by frequent and low severity low ds and dd droughts 3 for the return period respective high severity droughts occurred with the longest return period in ordos and baotou and the return period increased fastest in these two cities with the increase of ds or dd on the contrary high severity droughts were with the shortest return period in hulunbuir and xing an 4 the frequency of droughts is quite different in different drought regimes and their increasing within time in the regions despite this the decade from 2000 to 2010 was a period of frequent droughts in the whole study area and most 20 year return period droughts occurred during this period especially in humid and semi humid regions author contributions shuohao cai conceived and designed this study carried out the analysis and drafted the

3984,as the critical parameter of the agricultural drought process soil moisture sm has the potential to monitor agricultural drought which can provide practical support for water management in this study a drought index namely soil dryness index sdi was proposed based on long term gridded era 5 land sm and its performance was evaluated furthermore we employed the run theory and copula to study the spatiotemporal drought characteristics based on this index in inner mongolia although the return period of drought events has been assessed in many studies the drought tends to occur with a nonstationary frequency the wavelet transform was then applied to drought area proportion time series in sub regions to study the temporal characteristics of droughts the results show that sdi performs well in monitoring agricultural drought there is strong heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of drought events frequent and low severity droughts dominated arid and semi arid regions while some high severity droughts mainly occurred in humid and semi humid regions mainly in hulunbuir and xing an the droughts especially those with high severity have become much more frequent in the last two decades the period from 2000 to 2010 had seen more frequent droughts in recent 40 years and most 20 year return period droughts occurred during this period these findings could contribute to a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural droughts and provide a reference for future drought trends in inner mongolia keywords soil moisture soil dryness index agricultural drought copula wavelet transform inner mongolia 1 introduction in recent decades decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration have resulted in frequent droughts with global warming spinoni et al 2014 trenberth et al 2014 drought affects many aspects of human life threatening the security of agricultural production and ecosystem vo et al 2020 agricultural food production is exceedingly vulnerable to extreme drought especially in china yu et al 2018 as a substantial production base of the livestock industry and major grain producing region in china inner mongolia needs effective drought risk management huang et al 2015b therefore it is essential and instructive to study the spatiotemporal distribution of drought in inner mongolia the droughts can be typically classified into four categories meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 among which agricultural drought has the most direct effects on grasses and crop yields generally agricultural drought is defined as the lack of sm resulting in reduced crop yields mishra and singh 2010 which is also the most frequent natural disaster and causes the heaviest crop damage in inner mongolia li et al 2014 shen 2008 numerous indices have been proposed or been improved to quantify agricultural droughts they mainly include precipitation based indices such as rainfall anomaly index rai van rooy 1965 and standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 moisture based or moisture balance based indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi the self calibrated pdsi sc pdsi wells et al 2004 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 vegetation based indices such as normalized difference vegetation index anomaly ndvia li et al 2014 pdsi spi and their improvements i e sc pdsi and spei have been used extensively among these indices mishra and singh 2010 pdsi was derived based on a soil water equation and this index incorporated precipitation sm supply runoff and potential evapotranspiration spi was calculated based on only precipitation nevertheless many studies have proved that spi had a better performance in the indication of sm variation sims et al 2002 prediction of crop production quiring and papakryiakou 2003 and extreme drought events extraction lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 than pdsi however some studies showed that temperature rise could not be ignored in the drying process spei was therefore proposed based on spi vicente serrano et al 2010 and it used the influence of evapotranspiration efficiently although these indices are widely used in agricultural drought studies they indicate the conditions in different stages of agricultural drought according to li et al 2014 the agricultural drought process can be simplified as a temporal sequence of precipitation sm vegetation growth and yield we can briefly group the spi and spei into the precipitation stage indices however compared with precipitation sm directly affects transpiration and root water uptake of plants and contributes to vegetation growth liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016b although some vegetation based indices e g ndvia can well indicate agricultural drought water management is of limited significance at the vegetation growth stage because the drought have already affected the vegetation as the critical parameter of the agricultural drought process sm has the potential to indicate agricultural drought conditions which can provide timely and effective water resources management support sridhar et al 2008 long term and time and space continuous sm is the basis of drought monitoring sm is generally obtained based on land surface models regional climate models or remote sensing methods grillakis 2019 nowadays many global sm datasets have been released chen et al 2021 mainly including satellite observed products e g amsre smos smap reanalysis based land surface model products e g era5 land gldas and data fusion products e g cci era5 land provides long term sm with a high spatiotemporal resolution among many sm datasets which is a suitable dataset for agricultural drought monitoring some studies have proved that a good correlation between the era5 land top layer sm and in situ measurements exists muñoz sabater et al 2021 here we focused on applying the index based on sm only as an indicator of agricultural drought then the spei and ndvia are chosen as two indices for comparison many scholars have carried out studies on drought events drought duration and severity are two main characteristics of drought events shiau 2006 stephenson et al 2008 they were commonly extracted using run theory based on index time series such as pdsi and spei drought events and their characteristics are random variables and an event can be considered rare or not rare depending on how often the event happens stephenson et al 2008 therefore probability theory is one of the effective methods to study drought univariate drought characteristics can be easily analyzed because of well developed univariate probability distribution functions however it is challenging to get their joint distribution from univariate distributions when the variables follow different distributions and a correlation between them exists the copula function has been extensively used as a tool to fit the multivariate distribution of drought events because it can model the dependence structure among random variables independently of the marginal distribution ayantobo et al 2019 ayantobo et al 2017 serinaldi et al 2009 shiau 2006 vo et al 2020 moreover the return period of drought events based on a fitted probability distribution is a valuable parameter to assess drought events shiau 2003 shiau 2006 besides drought duration and severity the area extent of drought is also an important factor to consider andreadis et al 2005 sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 the site data can provide long term continuous and accurate meteorological parameters therefore there are many studies on drought monitoring based on site data however station based analysis can hardly provide support for regional drought management ayantobo et al 2017 nevertheless there are some studies exploring the spatial patterns of drought from station information for example ayantobo et al 2017 defined the droughty area proportion as the ratio of the number of meteorological stations experiencing drought to total stations vo et al 2020 employed the hot spot analysis tool to estimate the spatial extreme drought patterns however station data has limited representative information to the study region compared with station data gridded sm data can directly evaluate spatial patterns of drought events moreover drought events may occur with varying frequencies due to global warming heim 2015 zhang et al 2011 even though the return period of drought events can reflect the probability of droughts in different degrees and provide support for drought risk management concentrated droughts can lead to poor management decisions we employed wavelet transforms to explore the occurrence rules of drought events on the time axis in so doing we constructed droughty area proportion time series which were defined as the ratio of droughty area to the total area considering the area extent of droughts the fundamental purpose of this paper is to study the spatiotemporal distribution of drought events in inner mongolia the main novelties of our paper are that 1 a soil dryness index was proposed using gridded sm data era5 land with a high spatial resolution based on which agricultural drought characteristics e g return period were presented on a regional scale 2 the wavelet transform method was employed for the occurrence characteristics frequency and amplitude study of drought events by considering the areal extent of droughts this article is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief introduction of the study area and datasets section 3 provides a description of methods used in this study section 4 is the presentation of the results a further discussion is shown in section 5 and the conclusion is given in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is shown in fig 1 inner mongolia is located in the north of china with an average annual precipitation of 30 500 mm a wide distribution of grasslands throughout inner mongolia and extensively distributed croplands in tongliao chifeng baynnur hohhot and hulunbuir make inner mongolia be the production base of the livestock industry and a major grain producing region in china inner mongolia is a typical arid region in china except for the humid and semi humid regions to the east of dahingganling mountain most parts of inner mongolia are arid and semi arid regions zheng et al 2013 the frequency and intensity of droughts have been proved to increase generally in inner mongolia during the last 500 years peng et al 2018 it is the dark region in northern china shown in the insert in fig 1 and is the area of choice analysed in this article it is of great significance to study the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in inner mongolia for its sustainable development of the economy and ecology 2 2 data 2 2 1 soil moisture data the era5 datasets era5 land hourly data from 1981 to present https doi org 10 24381 cds e2161bac provide sm data with four different soil layers soil layer 1 0 7 cm soil layer 2 7 28 cm soil layer 3 28 100 cm and soil layer 4 100 289 cm we obtained the volume of water m3 m3 in the topsoil layer 0 7 cm from 1981 to 2019 this parameter has a high spatial and temporal resolution about 9 km and hourly respectively we processed the hourly sm data into daily mean sm firstly for further application 2 2 2 meteorological data we selected three meteorological stations tulihe 50434 xiaoergou 50548 and erenhot 53068 in the study area covered by woody savannas croplands and grasslands respectively and monthly precipitation and temperature data from 1981 to 2018 of the three stations were acquired from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html to calculate spei 2 2 3 ndvi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated based on the reflectance of near infrared and red radiation directly reflecting vegetation conditions pettorelli et al 2005 we obtained the third generation ndvi dataset from 1982 to 2015 released by the gimms global inventory modelling and mapping studies of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa from the internet with a spatial resolution of 0 0833 and a temporal resolution of 15 days 3 methods first we proposed an empirical statistical index namely the soil dryness index sdi based on sm data second we extracted drought events over pixel scale by the run theory based on the sdi time series drought severity ds and drought duration dd of each drought event were obtained and their joint distribution is fitted by archimedean copulas third the return period of drought events was calculated based on fitted distributions to study the spatial distribution characteristics of drought events in inner mongolia moreover we employed the wavelet transform to study the temporal distribution characteristics of drought in different degrees in inner mongolia based on the droughty area proportion time series 3 1 definition of soil dryness index commonly drought is defined based on the magnitude of dryness and the duration of the dry period stephenson et al 2008 we firstly proposed the soil dryness index sdi to characterize the degree of dryness here sdi is defined as the degree of drought measured by the sm below a certain threshold when sm exceeds the threshold sdi is 0 a constant absolute value cannot be applied as the threshold over the whole region because of soil texture heterogeneity percentile thresholds may be more suitable for spatial comparisons than a fixed threshold zhang et al 2011 and have been applied in many studies for example the cpc climate prediction center classifies droughts based on sm time series percentiles a 10 percentile is defined as a threshold of severe drought for a 70 year record https www cpc ncep noaa gov products soilmst monitoring therefore we choose a constant value based on the empirical distribution of daily sm time series from 1981 to 2019 the 10th quantile of the time series is taken as the threshold which is pixel specific then the sdi is calculated as follows 1 sdi 0 q sm 10 10 q sm q sm 10 where qsm is the quantile of sm in time series sdi ranges from 0 to 10 and the greater the sdi is the drier the area is the sdi is a statistical drought index based on time series at the point scale 3 2 spei and ndvia herein we calculated the monthly spei based on the station precipitation and temperature to verify the drought indication quality of the sdi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is a wetness condition index based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 this index is suited to detect drought conditions in those places where there is a warming trend because of its use of evapotranspiration moreover this index requires only precipitation and temperature and follows the original standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 calculation procedure the spei includes the effect of temperature firstly the potential evapotranspiration pet is computed based on temperature 2 pet 16 n 12 ndm 30 10 t i m where n is the monthly average sunshine hours which can be calculated based on latitude in radians and the average julian day of the month ndm is the number of days of the month t is the monthly mean temperature i is a heat index being calculated using the following formula 3 i i 1 12 t i 5 1 514 where ti is the average monthly mean temperature for month i m is a constant depending on i 4 m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 792 10 2 i 0 49 then the difference between the monthly precipitation p and pet for the month i is calculated using 5 d i p i p e t i the three parameter log logistic distribution is applied to standardize the d series to obtain the spei the log logistic distribution function is as follows 6 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α β and γ are scale shape and origin parameters respectively the parameters can be calculated by the l moments of the d series where 7a α w 0 2 w 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 7b β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 7c γ w 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β and г is the gamma function ws is obtained by the probability weighted moments 8a w s 1 m i 1 m 1 f i s d i 8b f i i 0 35 m where s 0 1 2 m is the total number of months fi is a frequency estimator then the standardized values of f x is computed using equation 9 9 p 1 f x when p 0 5 the spei is calculated by the following formulas 10a w 2 ln p 10b spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 and d3 0 001308 when p 0 5 the spei is calculated as follows 11a w 2 ln 1 p 11b spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 the core of the agricultural drought is the relationship between sm shortage and crop growth li et al 2014 ndvi can directly reflect vegetation growth conditions based on ndvi ndvi anomaly ndvia was also used as an index of agricultural drought moreover because the ndvi increases during the growing season it is hard to learn the effects of drought on vegetation growth based on ndvi the ndvia is a more suitable variable than ndvi in detecting agricultural drought effects and verifying the performance of sdi here we calculated ndvia and compared it to our sdi the ndvia calculation formula is as follows li et al 2014 12 ndvi a i j ndv i i j n d v i ave j ndv i ave j 100 where i is the i th year j is the j th stage during the growing season ndviai j is the ndvi anomaly in the j th stage of the i th year ndviave j is the average ndvi of the ndvi time series of the j th stage 3 3 determination of drought events and their characteristics drought events and their characteristics including drought duration dd drought severity ds and the inter arrival time dl of neighboring drought events in each pixel are determined by run theory guerrero salazar and yevjevich 1975 the schematic diagram of the determination of drought events and their characteristics based on the sdi time series is shown in fig 2 the dd is the lasting days of a drought event in days the ds is the time integral of sdi in a drought event and is unitless before deriving the drought events and their characteristics the sdi maps were processed under the following considerations 1 if the areal extent of droughty pixels is under a specific value in daily sdi maps these pixels would not be considered as drought 2 the drought event identified by the droughty pixel with a short stretch of days should be ignored therefore we filtered out the drought area that contains 10 pixels about 800 km2 in each sdi map and then ignored the drought events that occurred with 5 or fewer such days a drought occurs with at least six consecutive dry days because these shorter conditions can hardly cause drought effects 3 4 distribution of drought duration dd and drought severity ds many studies have explored the suitable distributions of drought event variables generally the dd can be suitably fitted by an exponential distribution lee et al 2013 shiau 2006 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 or a gamma distribution vo et al 2020 and ds can be suitably fitted by a gamma distribution lee et al 2013 shiau 2006 shiau and shen 2001 the generalized pareto distribution can also be used to estimate the quantile corresponding to a specific exceedance probability stephenson et al 2008 here we selected six candidate probability distributions including exponential normal lognormal gamma weibull and generalized pareto to fit variables dd and ds the probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions of the six distributions are shown in table 1 the parameters of each type were estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method the chi squared test was then used to determine the best distribution of variables in each pixel when the variables are intercorrelated and are modelled by different distributions it is hard to get their multivariate distributions from univariate distributions copulas developed by sklar 1959 can link univariate distribution functions to form multivariate distributions shiau 2006 assuming two variables cumulative density functions are fx x and fy y respectively and fx y x y is their joint distribution function there is copula c satisfying the following formula 13 f x y c f x x f y y conversely for any univariate distributions fx x and fy y and copula c the function fx y x y defined above is a joint distribution with marginal distributions fx x and fy y schweizer and sklar 2011 proved that if fx x and fy y are continuous the copula c is unique among copula functions archimedean copulas have been employed widely because of their convenient construction and a wide range capture of dependence structures ayantobo et al 2019 here we paid particular attention to gumbel clayton and frank from archimedean copulas to construct the joint distribution of dd and ds the cumulative probability density function and density function of the three copulas are as shown in table 2 assuming that we have got the marginal distribution function of ds and dd the following steps were adopted to select the best copulas 1 the maximum likelihood estimation method was employed to estimate the copula dependence parameters θ in table 2 2 rmse index equation 14 was used as a goodness of fit test for copulas to select the most suitable copula function 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i t i 2 where ei and ti are the i th empirical and theoretical value n is the number of samples 3 5 return period of drought events we followed the method proposed by shiau and shen 2001 the return period for ds s and dd d can be expressed respectively as 15a t s e d l 1 f d s s 15b t d e d l 1 f d d d where dl is the inter arrival time illustrated in fig 2 e dl is expectation of dl f d s s and f d d d are the cumulative density function of ds and dd further given the return period t we can calculate the corresponding ds and dd using equation 16a and 16b 16a s f d s 1 1 e d l t 16b d f d d 1 1 e d l t because droughts are bivariate events characterized by both ds and dd the joint return period for ds and dd should be defined it can be defined as return period for ds s and dd d and return period for ds s or dd d and their definitions are as follows shiau 2003 shiau 2006 17a t ds e d l 1 f d d d f d s s c f d d d f d s s 17b t ds e d l 1 c f d d d f d s s where c f d d d f d s s is the copula function of the joint distribution the study has proven that the joint return period defined by equation 17b underestimates the results salvadori et al 2011 vo et al 2020 therefore we calculate the joint return period using equation 17a 3 6 wavelet analysis of drought events return period can provide decision support for response to drought events of different degrees however the time series of drought event occurrence is nonstationary at many different frequencies in recent years extreme drought events have become more frequent giannakopoulos et al 2009 liu et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to study the temporal characteristics of the occurrence of drought events in different degrees wavelet transform can decompose a time series into time and frequency space simultaneously through which we can learn the amplitude of different periods and how the amplitude varies with time the wavelet functions are a set of basic functions that can be generated by translating and scaling the wavelet basis function as follows 18 ψ λ τ t 1 λ ψ t τ λ where λ is the scaling parameter and τ is the translating parameter which determine the width and position of the wavelet basis function respectively here morlet was chosen as the wavelet basis function in this study we use its dicrete form where the parameters λ and τ can be given as follows 19 λ τ 2 j 2 j k where k is a location index ranging from 1 to 2 jn n is the number of observations and j is a scale index ranging from 0 to j j is the total number of scales further the discrete wavelet transform are defined as 20 wt s j k 2 j 2 s t ψ 2 j t k d t where s t is the time series a detailed description of wavelet transform can be found in torrence and compo 1998 here we construct the time series of the droughty area proportion in different dry degrees i e drought events with 1 year 5 year 10 year and 20 year return periods then the wavelet transform morlet wavelet was employed in the time series to study its variation in the frequency of occurrence and amplitude the technical route of this study is shown as fig 3 4 results 4 1 comparison between sdi spei and ndvia the semi monthly sdi and ndvia time series of each station were calculated based on a 3 3 pixel window and the monthly spei time series was calculated using the station precipitation and temperature data the comparison results of the three indices at each station are shown in fig 4 the results show that the three indices had a good consistency a lower value of spei corresponded to a higher value of sdi and subsequently the ndvia decreased moreover we also find that when the spei returns to a higher value the sm is still at a low level high sdi value a temporal sequence of agricultural drought processes in the order of spei sdi and ndvia exists generally the sdi can reflect the drought conditions ndvi deviated to a lower value from the mean value of the same period however some abnormal situations also exist such as the ndvia value in august 1998 at xiaoergou station and in september 2009 at tulihe station which are significantly lower than the average value for the same period the main reason is that a significant amount of precipitation occurred during these periods heavy precipitation resulted in vegetation loss in these two vegetation types nevertheless there are also some occasions that heavy precipitation occurred in erenhot which resulted in a better vegetation growth in grasslands 4 2 droughts properties in inner mongolia fig 5 shows the properties of drought events in inner mongolia during the study period from the number of drought events fig 5a hohhot ulaan chab xilin gol chifeng and tongliao had seen many drought events in contrast hulunbuir experienced fewer drought events in the other cities of inner mongolia the number of drought events showed strongly spatial heterogeneity however from fig 5b c drought events occurred in hulunbuir with a relatively high dd and ds even though these regions experience fewer drought events drought events generally occurred with high ds conversely drought events occurred in hohhot ulaan chab xilin gol chifeng and tongliao generally with lower dd and ds from fig 5e f we can also see that the value of maximum dd and ds of drought events in hulunbuir are much higher than in other parts it is worth noting that hetao plain located in baynnur experienced fewer droughts with low ds fig 6 shows the selection results of the best distribution function in three stations i e tulihe xiaoergou and erenhot located in fig 1 which are some examples for distribution fitting at pixel scale according to the chi square the best distribution functions of dd in tulihe xiaoergou and erenhot are exponential exponential and generalized pareto respectively and the best distribution functions of ds in the three pixels are lognormal weibull and lognormal distribution respectively their joint distribution functions are all gumbel copula based on the rmse selection rule we fitted the univariate and joint distribution of ds and dd of droughts pixel by pixel the results fig 7 show that ds mainly conformed to the lognormal distribution 37 6 of total pixels exponential distribution 21 3 of total pixels and generalized pareto distribution 28 0 of total pixels dd mainly conformed to the lognormal distribution 21 0 of total pixels exponential distribution 17 6 of total pixels and generalized pareto distribution 50 6 of total pixels their joint distribution is mainly the gumbel copula which occupied 76 8 of total pixels and the clayton copula share was insignificant at 0 1 the rest going to frank copula 4 3 return period of drought events the return period of droughts was calculated based on the fitted distribution fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of ds occurring with different return periods drought events occurring with the 1 year return period had a high ds in some regions of xilin gol chifeng and tongliao however with the increase of return period of drought events the droughts are more severe in hulunbuir and the western region of alxa than other regions indicating long return period events occurred with higher ds than other parts fig 9 shows a consistent result with fig 8 these results can also indicate that drought events in hohhot ulaan chab xilin gol chifeng and tongliao were mainly with a dd of 10 40 days and ds of 50 200 drought events occurring in hulunbuir and the western region of alxa were mainly with a dd of 20 90 days and ds of 100 600 droughts should be characterized by both dd and ds therefore the joint return period of drought events was also evaluated here we calculated the joint return period in different drought degrees dd 10 20 30 40 50 60 days and ds correspondingly 50 100 200 300 400 500 respectively the results are shown in fig 10 furthermore the linear relationship between dd and ds was pixel specific therefore we also calculated the joint period of drought events with dd 10 20 30 40 50 60 days and corresponding ds restrained by linear regression of ds to dd the results are shown in fig 11 the results show that drought events with 10 or more days duration had a 2 5 years return period in the hetao plain area of baynnur moreover the return period of drought events occurring with 20 or more days duration exceeds 40 years in this region that is severe droughts are rare here when a dd of drought events exceeds 40 days the joint period of drought events exceeds 40 years in most parts of inner mongolia including baynnur ordos baotou hohhot ulaan chab chifeng xilin gol and most regions of alxa in most regions of hulunbuir and xingan however the droughts with a dd 40 days had a 20 to 40 year return period moreover we calculated the average return period for different degrees of droughts in each city the results were shown in fig 12 we briefly classified the drought into mild droughts 5 days dd 20 days moderate droughts 20 days dd 40 days and severe droughts 40 days dd 60 days the results showed that the return period of droughts increased with the increase of dd or ds however the increasing rate of return period in different cities was different the return periods of droughts with 6 10 days duration were shortest in ordos therefore ordos may have the most frequent mild droughts the return periods of moderate droughts were the longest and grew fastest with the increase of dd or ds in ordos and baoto followed by hohhot ulaan chab baynnur and then followed by tongliao xilin gol and alxa in severe droughts regard hulunbuir and xingan had the shortest return period from another perspective the return period of droughts reflects the rarity of droughts in specific locations we can see that the droughts with the 1 year return period generally had a higher value in dd and ds in the semi arid region however with the return period increasing the dd or ds of droughts increased slowly in the semi arid region in these regions rare drought events generally had lower dd and ds than humid and semi humid regions from the joint return period highly severe droughts with high dd and ds generally occurred in humid and semi humid regions and parts of western regions of inner mongolia for example the droughts with a 60 day duration exhibit a 20 to 40 year return period in these regions above however these droughts occurred in arid and semi arid regions with more than a 40 year return period that is these events rarely happen in these regions and seldom in those experiencing more precipitation as expected 4 4 spatiotemporal distribution of drought events in different drought degrees firstly we divided inner mongolia into three regions as shown in fig 13 region 1 with the humid and semi humid region region 2 with the semi arid region region 3 with the arid region according to the spatial heterogeneity of the basic drought properties then the area proportion time series of droughts with different return periods in these regions were constructed fig 13 shows the area proportions of droughts with different return periods generally region 1 experienced fewer slight droughts droughts with a return period 3 years than region 2 and 3 region 1 has seen many severe droughts droughts with a return period 20 years in 1986 1987 2001 2002 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 2011 especially in 2007 2008 a great proportion of region 1 experienced long term severe droughts region 2 also has seen some severe droughts in 2005 2011 moreover we have compared the area proportion time series with the records table a 1 and table a 2 both statistics show the periods from 1996 to 1998 from 2012 to 2013 are wet periods in inner mongolia based on the records some severe drought years include 1982 1984 1986 1989 1991 1994 1995 1999 2001 2003 2004 2007 2009 and 2015 2017 here we defined severe drought years after the 2000 s as the years with an exposed area of crops 2 million hectares referenced to table a 2 the results of this paper are in good agreement with drought record events despite some uncertainty of recorded drought occurrence time extent and location furthermore we plotted the wavelet power spectrum of area proportion time series of droughts with return period rp 1 year 1 years return period 3 years 10 years return period 20 years and return period 20 years in these three regions the results were shown in figs 14 15 and 16 in region 1 fig 14 droughts with return period 3 years had no significant periodical feature from 1981 to 1998 while a significant 1 year circle of these droughts was shown in recent 20 years specially a 5 year circle of droughts with return period 1 year was also found in region 1 from 2008 to 2017 slight droughts return period 3 years showed a significantly increasing trend in recent 20 years the occurrence of moderate and severe drought in region 1 was mainly concentrated from 2002 to 2011 with a periodical feature of 1 5 years in region 2 fig 15 and region 3 fig 16 however slight droughts return period 1 year showed a significant 1 year circle during almost the whole study period the moderate droughts 10 years return period 20 years had a high frequency of occurrence both in region 2 and region 3 from 2004 to 2011 for severe droughts return period 20 years region 2 has seen significant 6 to 32 month circle from 2004 to 2010 there was also higher frequency of drought occurrence in region 3 from 2005 to 2011 moreover moderate or severe droughts also occurred at high frequency in region 3 which is different from region 1 in summary droughts with a 1 year return period occurred in regions 2 and 3 in most years with a significant 1 year periodical feature however the droughts with a 1 year return period occurred only in 1998 2011 and 2015 2019 with a significant cycle of 1 year in region 1 overall the period from 2000 to 2010 was a period of frequent droughts more frequently as the decade unfolded and droughts with a 20 year return period also frequently occurred during these years which is consistent with the previous study based on spei tong et al 2018 a similar pattern of drought also occurred from 2015 to 2019 therefore attention needs to be paid to future drought management moreover there were almost no extensive drought events from 1993 to 1995 in region 1 however region 2 and 3 experience moderate or severe droughts droughts with return period 10 years during this period 5 discussion 5 1 the performance of sdi we compared the sdi with spei and ndvia here a particular relationship between the 1 month time scale spei and sdi generally exists ndvia varied following sdi with a time lag the result fig 4 shows that a temporal sequence of agricultural drought processes in the order of spei sdi and ndvia exist spei was obtained based on precipitation and evapotranspiration however a vast amount of precipitation may be lost through interception and runoff and not supplied to the soil chen et al 2014 according to yao et al 2013 precipitation 5 mm did not replenish soil water content in the horqin sand land we can also see that even though the spei returns to a higher value the sm is still at a low level fig 4 the variation of sdi lags behind spei and the water supply to soil is limited so that the soil may be in a state of prolonged drought in this study we process the sdi maps by filtering out the small drought areas which can reduce the effect of sm data error to some extent and is also reasonable because of the limited drought effects of such drought extent furthermore we consider a drought event to occur if sm falls below the threshold for at least six consecutive days nevertheless there are some limitations in studying the performance of sdi indicating agricultural droughts the ultimate manifestation of agricultural drought is crop yields or livestock yields based on the productivity of grass however there are intricate relationships between sm deficit and crop yield boken et al 2005 firstly even though the drought is a key parameter affecting crop yields and grass productivity other factors including locust plague also greatly impact vegetation according to some reports e g http www china org cn english 2004 aug 102906 htm fluctuations of crop yields and grass productivity induced by other factors cause indistinct relationships between drought and crop yields secondly the effects of droughts on vegetation may be species specific and stage specific that is drought events with the same drought intensities may cause different losses in crop yield or grass productivity if the droughts occur in different vegetation types or different vegetation growth stages therefore further investigations need to be done to clearly state the relationship between drought and vegetation productivity which serves the definition of drought threshold and extraction of drought events they include what the best threshold for sdi calculation in specific vegetation types is and when the sequence of dry spells starts to cause damage to vegetation 5 2 high spatial heterogeneity of droughts in inner mongolia the spatial distribution of droughts exhibits an apparent heterogeneity fig 5 for example there are two distinct heterogeneous regions in hulunbuir which are divided by dahingganling mountains the mountain range also marks the boundary between semi arid and semi humid regions generally the mild droughts hardly occur in humid regions and arid and semi arid regions are prone to frequent mild drought events some possible arguments for the high spatial heterogeneity include the following aspects on the one hand the precipitation pattern of inner mongolia is quite different middle east inner mongolia is mainly affected by eastern asia monsoon which brings more moisture to middle east regions in comparison western inner mongolia is mainly controlled by the westerlies moreover it is noticeable that fewer high severity droughts also dominate the west part of alxa which may be attributable to the increasing trend of annual total precipitation annual precipitation intensity and maximum daily precipitation amount from 1960 to 2012 in this region huang et al 2015a on the other hand sm fluctuates wildly in arid and semi arid regions being affected by soil texture the soil consists of a higher proportion of sandy soil in arid and semi arid regions generally the soil with a high sand content has a low water holding capacity and tends to lose water as expected shukla 2013 5 3 spatiotemporal distribution of droughts in inner mongolia even though the return period can reflect the probability of drought occurrence the frequency and the amplitude of different periods of droughts are changing vastly as shown in figs 14 16 the results show that droughts have occurred much more frequently in recent 20 years than before which may be induced by the intensification of global warming giannakopoulos et al 2009 liu et al 2016 zarch et al 2015 some studies also confirmed the increased frequency of drought occurrence in inner mongolia in recent decades for example a study proves the existence of an abrupt change point in 1999 in inner mongolia after which the drought intensity increased significantly liu et al 2016 pdsi showed a significant downward trend in hulunbuir xing an and tongliao on a pixel scale study from 1982 to 2012 zhang et al 2016a based on pdsi and spi time series zhai et al 2010 also found that songhuajiang river basin in northeastern china has seen the most frequent dry years in the period of 2001 2005 since the 1960 s moreover the most significant increases of drought areas were found in northeastern china from the end of the 1990 s to 2003 zou et al 2005 which is consistent with the increasing drought areas in region 1 fig 13 in addition to a significant 1 year circle of drought occurrence in most of the study period there is also a periodical feature of 2 5 years especially for high return period droughts which may be associated with el niño southern oscillation enso variability bao et al 2015 generally the precipitation in inner mongolia is mainly affected by the moisture from the pacific ocean the dahingganling mountains have substantial effects on moisture transmission that may be the reason why arid and semi arid regions also experienced severe drought in some wet years of region 1 e g in 1993 1995 6 conclusion this paper aims to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural drought in inner mongolia firstly we proposed a soil moisture based index the soil dryness index sdi based on gridded era 5 land soil moisture sm data which is the basis of agricultural drought monitoring and its performance is evaluated in drought monitoring we then employed run theory to extract the droughts based on the sdi time series two main features drought duration dd and drought severity ds were obtained the return period of droughts was calculated based on the best fitted distribution of dd and ds in the end we constructed the area proportion time series of droughts in three subregions and employed the wavelet transform to study their frequency and amplitude the main findings include 1 the sdi is a suitable variable to monitor agriculture drought 2 a strong heterogeneity in drought distribution exists in inner mongolia humid semi humid regions and the western part of alxa were mainly dominated by high severity high ds and dd droughts and fewer droughts occurred in the last four decades however arid and semi arid regions were dominated by frequent and low severity low ds and dd droughts 3 for the return period respective high severity droughts occurred with the longest return period in ordos and baotou and the return period increased fastest in these two cities with the increase of ds or dd on the contrary high severity droughts were with the shortest return period in hulunbuir and xing an 4 the frequency of droughts is quite different in different drought regimes and their increasing within time in the regions despite this the decade from 2000 to 2010 was a period of frequent droughts in the whole study area and most 20 year return period droughts occurred during this period especially in humid and semi humid regions author contributions shuohao cai conceived and designed this study carried out the analysis and drafted the
