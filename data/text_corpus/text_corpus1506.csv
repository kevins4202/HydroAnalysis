7530,partitioning of rainfall at the soil atmosphere interface is important for both surface and subsurface hydrology and influences many events of major hydrologic interest such as runoff generation aquifer recharge and transport of pollutants in surface waters as well as the vadose zone this partitioning is achieved through the process of infiltration that has been widely investigated at the local scale and more recently also at the field scale by models that were designed for horizontal surfaces however infiltration overland flows and deep flows in most real situations are generated by rainfall over sloping surfaces that bring in additional effects therefore existing models for local infiltration into homogeneous and layered soils and those as for field scale infiltration have to be adapted to account for the effects of surface slope various studies have investigated the role of surface slope on infiltration based on a theoretical formulations for the dynamics of infiltration extensions of the green ampt approach and from laboratory and field experiments however conflicting results have been reported in the scientific literature on the role of surface slope on infiltration we summarize the salient points from previous studies and provide plausible reasons for discrepancies in conclusions of previous authors thus leading to a critical assessment of the current state of our understanding on this subject we offer suggestions for future efforts to advance our knowledge of infiltration over sloping surfaces keywords hillslope hydrology overland flow infiltration process infiltration modeling 1 introduction the process of infiltration is controlled by many factors including soil depth and geomorphology soil hydraulic properties and rainfall or climatic properties the spatio temporal evolution of infiltration rates under natural conditions cannot be currently deduced by direct measurements alone at any scale of interest in applied hydrology therefore the use of infiltration models that rely on measurable quantities is of fundamental importance even though the representation of the natural processes of areal infiltration over both flat and sloping surfaces is needed in hydrologic models research activity has been limited to the development of local or point infiltration models for many years a variety of local infiltration models for vertically homogeneous soils with constant initial soil water content and over horizontal surfaces have been proposed green and ampt 1911 kostiakov 1932 horton 1940 holtan 1961 swartzendruber 1987 philip 1957a b c soil conservation service 1972 smith and parlange 1978 broadbridge and white 1988 dagan and bresler 1983 corradini et al 1994 furthermore for isolated storms and when ponding is not achieved instantly extended forms of the philip model chow et al 1988 green ampt model mein and larson 1973 chu 1978 and the smith and parlange model parlange et al 1982 are widely used however for complex rainfall patterns involving rainfall hiatus periods or a rainfall rate after time to ponding less than soil infiltration capacity these models are not directly applicable because the assumption of uniform initial soil moisture cannot be met for successive storms alternatively an approach for the application of the aforementioned classical models was developed mls 1980 péschke and kutílek 1982 verma 1982 starting from the time compression approximation proposed by reeves and miller 1975 for post hiatus rainfall producing immediate ponding however smith et al 1993 by comparison with results of the richards equation showed that the last approach was not sufficiently accurate because it neglects the soil water redistribution process which is particularly important when long periods with a light rainfall or a rainfall hiatus occur a more general model that combines infiltration and redistribution was provided by corradini et al 1997 starting from the darcy and continuity equations then combined with a conceptual representation of the wetting soil moisture profile natural soils are rarely vertically homogeneous in hydrological simulations the estimate of effective rainfall can be reasonably schematized by a two layered vertical profile mualem et al 1993 taha et al 1997 a general semi analytical conceptual model for crusted soils was formulated by smith et al 1999 and was extended by corradini et al 2000 to represent infiltration and reinfiltration after a redistribution period under any rainfall pattern and for any two layered soil where either layer may be more or less permeable than the other for a much more permeable upper layer and under more restrictive rainfall patterns a simpler semi empirical conceptual model was presented by corradini et al 2011 under conditions of surface saturation a simple green ampt based model was proposed chow et al 1988 in applied hydrology upscaling of point infiltration modeling to the field scale is required to estimate the areal average infiltration this is a complex task because of the natural spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic soil properties nielsen et al 1973 warrick and nielsen 1980 greminger et al 1985 sharma et al 1987 loague and gander 1990 and particularly of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity russo and bresler 1981 1982 that may be assumed as a random field with a lognormal univariate probability distribution some models representing infiltration at the field scale have been proposed with saturated hydraulic conductivity ks assumed as a random variable at the soil surface for both uniform smith and goodrich 2000 govindaraju et al 2001 and non uniform soils corradini et al 2011 govindaraju et al 2012 in the vertical direction further models were developed to describe the effects of a joint horizontal variability of ks and rainfall rate r wood et al 1986 castelli 1996 govindaraju et al 2006 morbidelli et al 2006 and of the spatial variability of initial soil moisture content θi smith and goodrich 2000 the role of the heterogeneity of θi combined with uniform values of ks and r or with ks randomly variable has been widely analyzed for different spatial scales bronstert and bardossy 1999 morbidelli et al 2012 hu et al 2015 most of the above mentioned models consider a horizontal soil surface or one with a low slope that does not affect the infiltration process however in most real situations infiltration occurs in surfaces characterized by different gradients beven 2002 fiori et al 2007 and the role of surface slope on infiltration is not clear in fact the results obtained by some theoretical philip 1991 chen and young 2006 wang et al 2018 and experimental investigations nassif and wilson 1975 sharma et al 1983 poesen 1984 cerdà and garcía fayos 1997 fox et al 1997 chaplot and le bissonais 2000 janeau et al 2003 assouline and ben hur 2006 essig et al 2009 ribolzi et al 2011 patin et al 2012 lv et al 2013 morbidelli et al 2015 mu et al 2015 khan et al 2016 morbidelli et al 2016 lead to rather contrasting conclusions suggesting an improved understanding and modeling of infiltration over sloping surfaces is required the overall intent of this paper is to highlight the state of the art on the slope infiltration relationship and provide guidance for future developments on the basis of available results 2 theoretical formulations 2 1 analytical formulation let consider a long planar hillslope consisting of a homogeneous isotropic soil with slope angle γ and cartesian rectangular spatial coordinates x and z with x and z positive in the horizontal downslope direction and in the downward vertical direction respectively let introduce also the rotated coordinates x z as defined in fig 1 for explicitly accounting for slope 1 x x cos γ z sin γ 2 z x sin γ z cos γ according to philip 1957b and philip 1969 the equation that governs unsaturated soil water movement may be expressed in the form 3 θ t d θ dk d θ θ z with t the time θ the volumetric soil water content d the soil diffusivity and k the hydraulic conductivity being d and k typically nonlinear functions of θ we first examine the dynamics of infiltration and downslope water transport by searching for the solution of eq 3 under the conditions 4 t 0 z 0 θ θ 0 5 t 0 z 0 θ θ 1 where θ0 is the uniform initial volumetric soil water content and θ1 is the value of θ associated to the capillary head ψ1 at which water is available at the soil surface z 0 under the hypothesis of negligible depth of free water excess on the hillslope ψ1 0 and θ1 is the saturated volumetric soil water content expressing eq 3 in terms of x and z we derive 6 θ t d θ dk d θ θ x sin γ θ z cos γ except for a small upper area of the hillslope the relevant solution of eq 6 subject to the conditions of eqs 4 and 5 is basically independent of x and depends only on z and t on this basis we may rewrite eq 6 as 7 θ t z d θ z dk d θ θ z cos γ we note that eq 7 subject to eqs 4 and 5 is formally identical to the classical one dimensional infiltration equation if k is substituted by k cos γ reverting to the non rotated axes x and z eq 7 becomes 8 θ t z d θ z sec 2 γ dk d θ θ z the vertical component of the unsaturated water flux v may be expressed as 9 v k d θ z while its value at the surface z x sin γ v0 may be considered the infiltration rate of standard hydrologic practice provided by 10 v 0 k 1 d θ z z x sin γ where k1 stands for k θ1 we can introduce analogous quantities in terms of rotated coordinates x z denoting with vn the infiltration rate normal to the hillslope 11 v n k cos γ d θ z and its value for z 0 vn0 12 v n 0 k 1 cos γ d θ z z 0 the theoretical approach above descripted states that the gravitational effect in the direction normal to the slope decreases by a factor cos γ and entails a small reduction of the infiltration rate while capillary forces are invariant along these lines philip 1991 suggested an analytical series solution and two simplified relationships for different time intervals in order to explicit the comparison with infiltration rate for a horizontal soil surface he proposed these ratios 13 lim t 0 v n 0 γ v n 0 0 1 14 lim t v n 0 γ v n 0 0 cos γ at short times when the capillary forces drive the process the infiltration rate normal to the slope doesn t depend on the slope angle see eq 13 on the contrary at very long times when only gravitational forces play a role vn0 reduces with cos γ being the gravity force only vertical 2 2 conceptual formulation from eq 7 it may be derived that except for the difference of coordinate system the only change needed for describing infiltration over a sloping surface is to substitute k with k cos γ and only the component of the water flux normal to the soil surface is changed by cos γ on the contrary the downslope component of gravity does produce flow but it does not modify the soil moisture profile along the normal direction on a planar slope because the flow field is independent of x as a consequence as an approximation the green ampt ga model can be rearranged including the same modification on the basis of darcy s law chen and young 2006 proposed a modified version of the ga model for a sloping surface under ponded conditions as 15 v n k e z f cos γ s f h z f with ke the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity zf the depth of the wetting front along the direction normal to the slope surface sf the wetting front capillary head h the ponding water head on the surface and zf cos γ the gravitational head at the wetting front see fig 2 physically each variable is considered to remain invariant along the downslope direction being the ponding depth on a sloping surface usually small if compared to the wetting front capillary head sf in their theoretical analysis chen and young 2006 treated it as a revision to sf the cumulative infiltration depth in the normal direction in can be determined as 16 i n θ s θ i z f taking the derivative of i with respect to time and substituting into eq 15 yields 17 dz f dt k e θ s θ i z f cos γ s f h z f by integration with respect to time eq 17 provides 18 t θ s θ i k e cos γ z f s f h cos γ ln z f cos γ s f h s f h substituting eq 16 into eq 18 yields the following simplified form 19 k e t cos γ i n sm cos γ ln 1 i n cos γ sm with s sf h and m θs θi eq 19 that is the key equation of the ga model describes in an implicit way the variation in time of cumulative infiltration depth chen and young 2006 expanded the second term of the right hand side of eq 19 with a taylor series on in around point in 0 and keeping the first two terms in the series yielded 20 k e t 1 2 i h 2 cos 2 γ sm with ih in cos γ the cumulative depth in the vertical direction this solution is valid only for small time according to the converging range of taylor series the variable ih compares infiltration on a slope to that on a horizontal surface but with the same horizontal projection lengths as 21 i h γ i h 0 1 cos γ this implies that the sloping surface increases the infiltration at small t by a factor 1 cos γ for t or for high infiltration depths eq 19 can be approximated as 22 k e t i h which highlights that the slope effect reduces with time and vanishes at very long t therefore according to chen and young 2006 infiltration at small times is controlled by capillary forces which would be independent of slope angle in case of homogeneous and isotropic soils however when the slope angle increases the slope length increases and consequently also the total infiltration volume increases for long t or large in the gravity becomes the control mechanism and the normal flux would be reduced by the factor cos γ this effect cancels with increasing slope length and the net slope effect essentially vanishes the results by chen and young 2006 obtained through a modified form of the ga model depend by the condition of identical slope horizontal projection lengths in fact despite apparently in contrast to the above results by philip 1991 the modified ga model was compared to a solution of richards equation on a sloping surface and was shown to match well wang et al 2018 proposed a new theoretical formulation involving the estimate of ponding time and infiltration on hillslopes under both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions the infiltrability equation was developed by integration of darcy s law for sloping surfaces and incorporating the flux concentration equation sivapalan and milly 1989 as 23 t 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d θ θ θ i n k i 2 f ln i n n cos γ i n k i cos γ n k i cos γ i n n cos γ d θ where in is the infiltrability normal to the surface slope t is time f θ θi θs θi and n ki k θ ki f eq 23 leads to a scaling relation between infiltration on sloping surfaces and horizontal surfaces under ponding conditions the normal infiltration rate on a sloping surface reduces to that on horizontal surface scaled through a proportionality factor equal to cos γ by taking 1 cos2 γ times the time for the horizontal plane 24 t γ t 0 cos 2 γ where t γ and t 0 are the times for slope and horizontal plane respectively associated to the same value of infiltrability for time to ponding tp wang et al 2018 proposed the following equation 25 t p 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d θ θ θ i r k i f r k i k θ k i d θ where r is a constant rainfall rate and they found that the ponding time for hillslopes can be estimated from that of horizontal plane through eq 24 after ponding and under steady rainfall conditions eq 23 could be solved for temporal evolution of infiltration alternatively in order to avoid the required computational effort wang et al 2018 selected an explicit empirical relation that links the infiltration rate with time including the slope effect as 26 i n at b k s cos γ where a and b are parameters related to initial soil moisture content soil type and rainfall intensity a procedure to extend the approach to unsteady rainfall was also included the proposed approach was validated by comparison with results obtained by hydrus 1d and by the modified ga model for sloping surfaces chen and young 2006 3 experimental evidence investigations to address the understanding of the effect of surface slope on the infiltration process have been performed through some experiments in both laboratory nassif and wilson 1975 poesen 1984 fox et al 1997 assouline and ben hur 2006 essig et al 2009 lv et al 2013 morbidelli et al 2015 mu et al 2015 khan et al 2016 morbidelli et al 2016 and field sharma et al 1983 cerdà and garcía fayos 1997 chaplot and le bissonais 2000 janeau et al 2003 ribolzi et al 2011 patin et al 2012 settings even though these studies provided conflicting results as to whether infiltration increase or decrease with slope all of them provided useful insights 3 1 laboratory simulations useful conclusions were derived by essig et al 2009 and morbidelli et al 2015 2016 by examining results obtained from a long series of laboratory experiments conducted with an experimental system consisting of a soil box with characteristics shown in fig 3 and the slope adjustable in the range 1 25 study soils of thickness 67 cm obtained from natural soils over 7 cm of gravel to speed the drainage of the percolated water from the soil a rainfall simulator based on sprinklers of water under pressure provided by a pump that produces a uniform rainfall distributed over the soil surface of intensity calibrated in advance and chosen through the appropriate combination of sprinkler type and water pressure tipping bucket sensors that provided continuous surface and deep flow at the downstream soil boundary time domain reflectometry sensors that collect continuous observations of the average soil water content at different depths in two vertical profiles a first set of 50 experiments was discussed by essig et al 2009 with three different soil types a clay loam a loam and a sandy loam each soil type designation hereinafter is based on the usda classification slopes ranging from 1 to 15 and rainfall rates in the range 10 30 mm h 1 for each experiment rainfall was applied to reach soil saturation throughout the box surface runoff and deep flow were collected for up to 24 h it was observed that the time to ponding increased as rainfall intensities decreased surface flowrate normalized by the average rainfall rate versus time were used to compare runoff rates for different slopes soil types and rainfall rates for the clay loam soil the slope had a great positive effect on the steady state surface flow based on kinematic wave theory the time of concentration should be under one hour however the duration of the observed receding limb of surface flow was longer than expected after the rainfall was turned off this tail was more prominent for steeper slopes and less evident for coarse soils the normalized infiltration rates for the clay loam soil essig et al 2009 suggested the presence of soil water outflow near saturation i e a seepage face but this was not as obvious for the loam and the sandy loam soils on the basis of the above theoretical formulations one would expect that the normalized steady deep flow should only vary by a factor of cos γ but the results reported in essig et al 2009 did not conform to this expectation and the steady deep flow decreased by much larger amounts with slope angle three different mathematical models were employed to explain the measured data the authors proposed an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity that empirically accounts for slope effects to obtain realistic agreements with measurements of overland flow deep flow and water content at different depths after an on overall analysis of the observed results essig et al 2009 postulated that relationships between rainfall and surface runoff and deep flow were being influenced by the following aspects the walls of the sand box enforced a condition of zero flux normal to the boundary this might be altering the flow pattern sufficiently so that the flow was strongly influenced by wall effects a longer recession tail particularly for the steeper slopes in the clay loam soil suggested the existence of return flow from saturated areas this return flow if it exists would be more noticeable for steep slopes and for fine textured soils the infiltration of water moving on the sloping soil surface was different from the case of infiltration over a flat surface where the ponded water had no momentum in the direction tangential to the slope to shed more light on these issues morbidelli et al 2015 carried out a second set of 15 laboratory experiments with two important modifications surface runoff assimilation by a technique which enabled to perform measurements in the middle of the box along the slope much lower values of the ratio r ks changed from 2 3 to 0 7 1 3 the first modification allowed the authors to eliminate the effect of the downstream boundary on the separation between surface and subsurface flows the second modification extended the investigation to commonly observed rainfall rates and assured the absence of both erosion and sealing layer results by morbidelli et al 2015 indicate that even for moderate rainfall rates the variation of the subsurface flow with γ is very evident their results which refer substantially to conditions with prevailing gravitational effects do not agree with any theoretical result and further support the trends shown by essig et al 2009 morbidelli et al 2015 suggested the existence of a relation between the decrease of the steady deep flow with γ and the shear stress at the soil surface as a basis for estimating an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity to be used in the existing infiltration models for horizontal surfaces in this context the role of the surface roughness remained an open problem to be addressed through specific field and laboratory experiments furthermore for bare sloping surfaces morbidelli et al 2015 noted the production of surface runoff even for r ks in a subsequent set of laboratory experiments morbidelli et al 2016 provided experimental evidence on the role of roughness in the relation between infiltration and slope angle twenty eight new simulations were performed by the same experimental system but using a grassy soil surface morbidelli et al 2016 provided fresh evidence of the relationship between γ and infiltration rate on a grassy soil and remarked the significant differences existing between bare and grassy soils their laboratory simulations highlighted that the effect of slope gradient on infiltration rate was greatly reduced by the grassy soil surface with a smaller decrease of the steady infiltration rate for γ in the range 1 15 more specifically their results provided evidence of the existence of an effective soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ke γ associated with rainfall rates that yielded surface runoff and steady deep flow for each γ value this quantity decreased from ks for γ 1 down to 0 8 ks for γ 10 the divergence with results computed by theoretical formulations is much more significant in the case of a bare soil for which from morbidelli et al 2015 ke γ 10 0 2 ks a common feature of slopes with grassy soils and bare soils concerns the production of surface runoff for ke r ks that is in unsaturated soils furthermore 1 the trials presented in the work for a grassy soil by morbidelli et al 2016 coupled with those earlier described for bare soils by essig et al 2009 and morbidelli et al 2015 suggest that the magnitude of the effects of γ on the gravitational component of infiltration rate is determined by a mechanism independent of the formation of rills or a sealing layer in fact the experiments were not affected by the last two processes which influenced several previous investigations 2 the formation of a two layered soil due to the grass growth cannot describe the effects of γ on the infiltration rate and 3 the relation between γ and infiltration rate is strictly dependent on the surface roughness along the same lines nassif and wilson 1975 fox et al 1997 mu et al 2015 and khan et al 2016 conducted laboratory experiments and found that the infiltration rate decreased with increasing slope angle nassif and wilson 1975 used a laboratory apparatus of horizontal dimensions 6 15 4 10 m and soil depth 0 22 m and an artificial rainfall generator to collect data about runoff and infiltration in different soil types and for different surface slopes among other results they emphasized that the increase of slope had little effect on runoff in relatively impermeable soils and significant effects on natural soils with an increase up to 16 and 24 in bare and grassed surfaces respectively they also observed a critical slope over which the peak runoff became invariant fox et al 1997 used a sandy loam soil susceptible to surface crusting fox 1994 packed in a 100 40 10 cm trays by applying successive layers with light compaction and smoothing between layers the trays were set at different slope angles in the range 1 5 21 5 subjected to rainfall rate in the range 38 2 56 3 mm h 1 each with duration of 90 min infiltration was calculated from the overland flow rate and mictotensiometers and micromorphological analysis were used to characterize seal formation infiltration rate decreased with increasing slope angle until 11 5 and remained unchanged at steeper slope angles the image analysis of pore characteristics clearly suggested that the slope angle had no significant impact on surface seal development the estimated change in mean overland flow depth with slope angle was in the order of about 1 mm and from visual observations it never appeared to exceed a few mm within any flow thread in the presence of a sub seal pressure head from about 100 mm to 200 mm an additional positive pressure head at the surface of 1 mm is insignificant and in itself would not increase the infiltration rate so the change in overland flow depth did not add sufficient pressure head to account for the change in observed infiltration rate however the increase in depth would be sufficient to submerge significant portions of the high locations of the microtopography hence small changes in flow depth may increase the infiltration rate by submerging areas of slightly greater hydraulic conductivity around the more stable aggregates mu et al 2015 conducted laboratory simulations to study the effects of various factors including the slope gradient on the runoff generation mechanism in a soil cultivated with spring maize during three growing stages jointing stage tasseling stage and mature stage they selected a sandy loam soil packed in a 200 50 60 cm steel bin with slope variable in the range 0 30 through some experimental trials with different combinations of rainfall intensity slope gradient and growing phase they found that the overland flow and the cumulative runoff increased with the increase of rainfall rate and slope in each vegetation stage within a single growing stage of spring maize they found that the runoff coefficient increased with increasing slope because of to a decrease in the soil infiltration rate and proposed an empirical relationship that provides the runoff coefficient by a logarithmic dependency on the sine of slope largest runoff coefficients were found for the mature stage with values increasing from 0 22 to 0 41 for slopes changing from 5 to 20 under a rainfall rate of 0 5 mm min khan et al 2016 adopted an artificial rainfall generator with 324 nozzles and runoff trays that could be adjusted to the desired slope angle in the range 5 25 they conducted 72 simulation runs under numerous combinations both in mulched and un mulched silty loam soils with rainfall intensities ranging between 33 mm h 1 and 120 mm h 1 the duration for each rainfall event was 1 h and steady conditions were never reached khan et al 2016 found that infiltration rate decreased with an increase in slope and increased with an increase in rainfall intensity they concluded that the effect of rainfall intensity on the infiltration rate changed with the slope angle due to the creation of different micro relief features and that in mulched soil the water infiltration rate significantly increased with an increase in rainfall intensity at all slope angles because of the uniform surface conditions under the mulch layers these trends agreed with those showed by essig et al 2009 and morbidelli et al 2015 2016 with the magnitudes of the reduction in infiltration with slope much larger than expected from all theoretical studies on the other hand poesen 1984 found that the infiltration rate increased with increasing slope angle in fact his experimental results were characterized by a decrease in runoff with increasing slope for soils subjected to surface crust formation specifically the runoff coefficient was found to be higher for a 2 slope than a 15 slope and the mean percolation coefficient was lower for the 2 than 15 slope these results incidentally very similar to results by assouline and ben hur 2006 indicated a positive relationship between slope and infiltration rate which was more pronounced for soils with water content at field capacity or greater poesen 1984 attributed the decreased runoff to either a thinner soil crust or increased rill erosion on the steeper slopes and concluded that 1 surface sealing is inversely related to slope so steeper slopes would have a thinner compressed soil layer than flatter slopes and would be more prone to infiltration 2 steeper slopes erode more quickly and increased erosion forms deeper rills thus the surface area over which infiltration can occur becomes larger and 3 in the absence of erosion and surface sealing the slope would not be expected to affect the infiltration process of particular interest are also the analyses conducted to clarify the effect of different slope angles on water movement during unsaturated stages for example laboratory experiments were carried out by lv et al 2013 considering the redistribution process in a variable slope soil tank from 0 to 30 with a homogeneous and isotropic sandy loam soil the results showed that increasing the slope became larger the gradient of soil water potential in the lateral downslope direction parallel to the slope surface it was concluded that the water movement in the lateral downslope direction parallel to the slope surface was more sensitive to changes in the slope angle than the component normal to the slope surface lv et al 2013 also observed that the influence of the slope angle on the flow component normal to the slope surface was greatest at a certain depth into the soil 3 2 field experiments with the main objective to analyze the effect of slope angle on interrill erosion for different plot sizes and to identify possible detachment and transport processes involved in the relations between slope rain characteristics and plot sizes chaplot and le bissonais 2000 conducted a detailed study in an experimental field located in the northwest part of the paris basin the site was characterized by silty loam soils very susceptible to soil crusting the experimental field was about 100 m in length and located in the middle of a convexo concave catena with slope gradients of about 2 4 8 and 2 from top to bottom three 1 1 m bounded plots were established at three positions along the catena with slopes 2 4 and 8 two additional 2 5 m bounded plots were selected at the 4 and 8 slope positions six natural rainfall events total rainfall depth of about 100 mm intensities in the range 1 31 8 00 mm h 1 in addition to artificial rainfalls with intensities up to 50 mm h 1 were considered flow depth and detention capacity were very low because of initially smooth crusted surfaces infiltration rates were computed from runoff rates and rainfall intensity as slope increased from 2 to 8 infiltration decreased from 1 to 0 5 mm h 1 for low intensity natural rains from 4 to 1 mm h 1 for 8 mm h 1 natural rain and from 15 to 5 mm h 1 for 50 mm h 1 artificial rainfall increase in flow velocity with slope steepness and length was considered to be a possible explanation of the slope effect on runoff no rills occurred in this study the slope effect on runoff was substantially the same for both the 10 m2 and 1 m2 plots scale effect on runoff does not seem to be important for the range of scales adopted earlier sharma et al 1983 had conducted field experiments for a period of six years on a representative loamy sand soil plots with slopes ranging from 0 5 to 10 and slope lengths ranging from 5 12 m to 14 5 m were used under natural rainfall depths they found that with dry antecedent soil conditions infiltration was governed by rainfall depth whereas with wet antecedent soil conditions raindrop impact which formed a crust over the soil surface was the deciding factor infiltration decreased significantly with increasing slope due to reduction in the time available for rainfall to infiltrate but a slope length had no substantial effect opposite conclusions were reached by janeau et al 2003 about infiltrability and slope gradient under field conditions through experiments on a gravelly loamy soil occupying the upper half of a cultivated convex hill in northern thailand fifteen 1 1 m plots with slope gradients in the range 16 63 were selected and different artificial rainfall patterns were chosen the steady final infiltration rate increased sharply with increasing slope gradient microaggregates tended to behave like sand and became tightly packed on moderate slopes packing crust from these results janeau et al 2003 deduced that the vertical component of kinetic energy greater on moderate slope had a prevailing role furthermore they asserted that 1 on steep slopes the horizontal component of the kinetic energy was transformed into shear stress impeding the development of crusts so that water could still infiltrate and 2 on steeper slopes the water film was thinner thereby limiting the role of splash janeau et al 2003 concluded that the relationship between slope gradient and infiltrability is affected by the soil nature and should be investigated considering surface crusting processes infiltration experiments conducted by ribolzi et al 2011 in two small plots characterized by very different slopes with rainfall intensities in the range 60 120 mm h 1 produced results similar to that previously described janeau et al 2003 final infiltration rates of 6 mm h 1 and 21 mm h 1 were obtained for the 30 and 75 slopes respectively these experiments confirm the hypothesis that higher effective rainfall intensity is responsible for the development of less permeable erosion crust under low slope gradients whereas more permeable structural crust develop under high slope gradients finally during a long term survey of a small agricultural basin in lao patin et al 2012 achieved interesting results as part of analyses of surface runoff formation at plot scale they observed that infiltrability decreased when slope increased up to approximately 50 and increased with slope for steeper slopes 50 probably due to two opposite trends when the soil is covered at least partly with vegetation crust cover remains limited and infiltration can decrease normally with increasing slope when the soil is bare as commonly observed for steep slope the opposed relationship is achieved due to lesser development of crust 4 assessment and future developments table 1 provides a summary of the experimental work dealing with infiltration on sloping surfaces and includes efforts on theoretical conceptual analyses along with experiments carried out in both laboratory and field settings this article suggests that the interaction between surface and subsurface waters seems to be more nuanced than would be suggested by our current understanding of infiltration processes the role of slope on infiltration is complicated by many confounding factors such as rainfall or applied water intensity microtopography vegetation soil texture and vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in soil properties consequently the conclusions from previous studies have been mixed and even contradictory perhaps because the results of the experiments studying the role of slope on infiltration were also influenced by one or more of these confounding factors in different ways there is growing laboratory evidence that the reduction in infiltration occurs beyond the cos γ factor expected during steady saturated conditions this is especially prominent for infiltration over bare slopes and for clay soils and becomes less prominent for vegetated surfaces and sandy soils when studies have reported an apparent increase in infiltration this has perhaps been due to the formation of a sealing layer or because of some complications introduced through rill formation experiments that were designed to eliminate these effects have reinforced this behavior of increased infiltration beyond what is expected from a cosine of the slope angle the number of repeated and repeatable experiments from multiple research groups suggests that this trend is not merely measurement error or experimental aberration and warrants careful scrutiny the development and testing of new theoretical underpinnings for to describe infiltration on sloping surfaces is needed to move the science forward while researchers have postulated that tangential velocities at the soil surface the increased depth of water in microtopographic depressions or shear stress exerted by the overland water on the soil surface might cause this apparent increase in infiltration rates a comprehensive theory is still lacking studies have suggested the idea of an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity to offer an empirical correction but have not offered a theoretical basis that would allow this understanding to be extended to other cases beyond those covered by the range of experiments a physical explanation followed by supporting mathematical formulation would be an important step in either supporting the hypothesis of increased infiltration with slope or provide refutation of this notion and provide an explanation for the experimental results that support this hypothesis such a theory would also serve to inform us as to what future experiments to conduct and what to measure to close the gaps in our understanding researchers conducting field scale experiments have to contend with the natural spatial variability in hydraulic properties of soils and the associated role of run on experimental efforts often measure averaged quantities such as rainfall and runoff from the entire field i e integrated responses as was noted earlier it is very difficult to make independent point scale measurements at all space and time scales and therefore need both a good local model as noted in the previous paragraph and a description of the nature of the spatial variation of hydraulic properties to perform upscaling studies extensions of infiltration models to watershed scales are of course further complicated with variability at more spatial scales and the role of channel networks and current practice relies on calibration and corroboration approaches at these scales this operational process will have to be the state of practice until a meaningful way of upscaling knowledge from sub grid scales is developed acknowledgment this research was mainly financed by the italian ministry of education university and research prin 2015 
7530,partitioning of rainfall at the soil atmosphere interface is important for both surface and subsurface hydrology and influences many events of major hydrologic interest such as runoff generation aquifer recharge and transport of pollutants in surface waters as well as the vadose zone this partitioning is achieved through the process of infiltration that has been widely investigated at the local scale and more recently also at the field scale by models that were designed for horizontal surfaces however infiltration overland flows and deep flows in most real situations are generated by rainfall over sloping surfaces that bring in additional effects therefore existing models for local infiltration into homogeneous and layered soils and those as for field scale infiltration have to be adapted to account for the effects of surface slope various studies have investigated the role of surface slope on infiltration based on a theoretical formulations for the dynamics of infiltration extensions of the green ampt approach and from laboratory and field experiments however conflicting results have been reported in the scientific literature on the role of surface slope on infiltration we summarize the salient points from previous studies and provide plausible reasons for discrepancies in conclusions of previous authors thus leading to a critical assessment of the current state of our understanding on this subject we offer suggestions for future efforts to advance our knowledge of infiltration over sloping surfaces keywords hillslope hydrology overland flow infiltration process infiltration modeling 1 introduction the process of infiltration is controlled by many factors including soil depth and geomorphology soil hydraulic properties and rainfall or climatic properties the spatio temporal evolution of infiltration rates under natural conditions cannot be currently deduced by direct measurements alone at any scale of interest in applied hydrology therefore the use of infiltration models that rely on measurable quantities is of fundamental importance even though the representation of the natural processes of areal infiltration over both flat and sloping surfaces is needed in hydrologic models research activity has been limited to the development of local or point infiltration models for many years a variety of local infiltration models for vertically homogeneous soils with constant initial soil water content and over horizontal surfaces have been proposed green and ampt 1911 kostiakov 1932 horton 1940 holtan 1961 swartzendruber 1987 philip 1957a b c soil conservation service 1972 smith and parlange 1978 broadbridge and white 1988 dagan and bresler 1983 corradini et al 1994 furthermore for isolated storms and when ponding is not achieved instantly extended forms of the philip model chow et al 1988 green ampt model mein and larson 1973 chu 1978 and the smith and parlange model parlange et al 1982 are widely used however for complex rainfall patterns involving rainfall hiatus periods or a rainfall rate after time to ponding less than soil infiltration capacity these models are not directly applicable because the assumption of uniform initial soil moisture cannot be met for successive storms alternatively an approach for the application of the aforementioned classical models was developed mls 1980 péschke and kutílek 1982 verma 1982 starting from the time compression approximation proposed by reeves and miller 1975 for post hiatus rainfall producing immediate ponding however smith et al 1993 by comparison with results of the richards equation showed that the last approach was not sufficiently accurate because it neglects the soil water redistribution process which is particularly important when long periods with a light rainfall or a rainfall hiatus occur a more general model that combines infiltration and redistribution was provided by corradini et al 1997 starting from the darcy and continuity equations then combined with a conceptual representation of the wetting soil moisture profile natural soils are rarely vertically homogeneous in hydrological simulations the estimate of effective rainfall can be reasonably schematized by a two layered vertical profile mualem et al 1993 taha et al 1997 a general semi analytical conceptual model for crusted soils was formulated by smith et al 1999 and was extended by corradini et al 2000 to represent infiltration and reinfiltration after a redistribution period under any rainfall pattern and for any two layered soil where either layer may be more or less permeable than the other for a much more permeable upper layer and under more restrictive rainfall patterns a simpler semi empirical conceptual model was presented by corradini et al 2011 under conditions of surface saturation a simple green ampt based model was proposed chow et al 1988 in applied hydrology upscaling of point infiltration modeling to the field scale is required to estimate the areal average infiltration this is a complex task because of the natural spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic soil properties nielsen et al 1973 warrick and nielsen 1980 greminger et al 1985 sharma et al 1987 loague and gander 1990 and particularly of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity russo and bresler 1981 1982 that may be assumed as a random field with a lognormal univariate probability distribution some models representing infiltration at the field scale have been proposed with saturated hydraulic conductivity ks assumed as a random variable at the soil surface for both uniform smith and goodrich 2000 govindaraju et al 2001 and non uniform soils corradini et al 2011 govindaraju et al 2012 in the vertical direction further models were developed to describe the effects of a joint horizontal variability of ks and rainfall rate r wood et al 1986 castelli 1996 govindaraju et al 2006 morbidelli et al 2006 and of the spatial variability of initial soil moisture content θi smith and goodrich 2000 the role of the heterogeneity of θi combined with uniform values of ks and r or with ks randomly variable has been widely analyzed for different spatial scales bronstert and bardossy 1999 morbidelli et al 2012 hu et al 2015 most of the above mentioned models consider a horizontal soil surface or one with a low slope that does not affect the infiltration process however in most real situations infiltration occurs in surfaces characterized by different gradients beven 2002 fiori et al 2007 and the role of surface slope on infiltration is not clear in fact the results obtained by some theoretical philip 1991 chen and young 2006 wang et al 2018 and experimental investigations nassif and wilson 1975 sharma et al 1983 poesen 1984 cerdà and garcía fayos 1997 fox et al 1997 chaplot and le bissonais 2000 janeau et al 2003 assouline and ben hur 2006 essig et al 2009 ribolzi et al 2011 patin et al 2012 lv et al 2013 morbidelli et al 2015 mu et al 2015 khan et al 2016 morbidelli et al 2016 lead to rather contrasting conclusions suggesting an improved understanding and modeling of infiltration over sloping surfaces is required the overall intent of this paper is to highlight the state of the art on the slope infiltration relationship and provide guidance for future developments on the basis of available results 2 theoretical formulations 2 1 analytical formulation let consider a long planar hillslope consisting of a homogeneous isotropic soil with slope angle γ and cartesian rectangular spatial coordinates x and z with x and z positive in the horizontal downslope direction and in the downward vertical direction respectively let introduce also the rotated coordinates x z as defined in fig 1 for explicitly accounting for slope 1 x x cos γ z sin γ 2 z x sin γ z cos γ according to philip 1957b and philip 1969 the equation that governs unsaturated soil water movement may be expressed in the form 3 θ t d θ dk d θ θ z with t the time θ the volumetric soil water content d the soil diffusivity and k the hydraulic conductivity being d and k typically nonlinear functions of θ we first examine the dynamics of infiltration and downslope water transport by searching for the solution of eq 3 under the conditions 4 t 0 z 0 θ θ 0 5 t 0 z 0 θ θ 1 where θ0 is the uniform initial volumetric soil water content and θ1 is the value of θ associated to the capillary head ψ1 at which water is available at the soil surface z 0 under the hypothesis of negligible depth of free water excess on the hillslope ψ1 0 and θ1 is the saturated volumetric soil water content expressing eq 3 in terms of x and z we derive 6 θ t d θ dk d θ θ x sin γ θ z cos γ except for a small upper area of the hillslope the relevant solution of eq 6 subject to the conditions of eqs 4 and 5 is basically independent of x and depends only on z and t on this basis we may rewrite eq 6 as 7 θ t z d θ z dk d θ θ z cos γ we note that eq 7 subject to eqs 4 and 5 is formally identical to the classical one dimensional infiltration equation if k is substituted by k cos γ reverting to the non rotated axes x and z eq 7 becomes 8 θ t z d θ z sec 2 γ dk d θ θ z the vertical component of the unsaturated water flux v may be expressed as 9 v k d θ z while its value at the surface z x sin γ v0 may be considered the infiltration rate of standard hydrologic practice provided by 10 v 0 k 1 d θ z z x sin γ where k1 stands for k θ1 we can introduce analogous quantities in terms of rotated coordinates x z denoting with vn the infiltration rate normal to the hillslope 11 v n k cos γ d θ z and its value for z 0 vn0 12 v n 0 k 1 cos γ d θ z z 0 the theoretical approach above descripted states that the gravitational effect in the direction normal to the slope decreases by a factor cos γ and entails a small reduction of the infiltration rate while capillary forces are invariant along these lines philip 1991 suggested an analytical series solution and two simplified relationships for different time intervals in order to explicit the comparison with infiltration rate for a horizontal soil surface he proposed these ratios 13 lim t 0 v n 0 γ v n 0 0 1 14 lim t v n 0 γ v n 0 0 cos γ at short times when the capillary forces drive the process the infiltration rate normal to the slope doesn t depend on the slope angle see eq 13 on the contrary at very long times when only gravitational forces play a role vn0 reduces with cos γ being the gravity force only vertical 2 2 conceptual formulation from eq 7 it may be derived that except for the difference of coordinate system the only change needed for describing infiltration over a sloping surface is to substitute k with k cos γ and only the component of the water flux normal to the soil surface is changed by cos γ on the contrary the downslope component of gravity does produce flow but it does not modify the soil moisture profile along the normal direction on a planar slope because the flow field is independent of x as a consequence as an approximation the green ampt ga model can be rearranged including the same modification on the basis of darcy s law chen and young 2006 proposed a modified version of the ga model for a sloping surface under ponded conditions as 15 v n k e z f cos γ s f h z f with ke the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity zf the depth of the wetting front along the direction normal to the slope surface sf the wetting front capillary head h the ponding water head on the surface and zf cos γ the gravitational head at the wetting front see fig 2 physically each variable is considered to remain invariant along the downslope direction being the ponding depth on a sloping surface usually small if compared to the wetting front capillary head sf in their theoretical analysis chen and young 2006 treated it as a revision to sf the cumulative infiltration depth in the normal direction in can be determined as 16 i n θ s θ i z f taking the derivative of i with respect to time and substituting into eq 15 yields 17 dz f dt k e θ s θ i z f cos γ s f h z f by integration with respect to time eq 17 provides 18 t θ s θ i k e cos γ z f s f h cos γ ln z f cos γ s f h s f h substituting eq 16 into eq 18 yields the following simplified form 19 k e t cos γ i n sm cos γ ln 1 i n cos γ sm with s sf h and m θs θi eq 19 that is the key equation of the ga model describes in an implicit way the variation in time of cumulative infiltration depth chen and young 2006 expanded the second term of the right hand side of eq 19 with a taylor series on in around point in 0 and keeping the first two terms in the series yielded 20 k e t 1 2 i h 2 cos 2 γ sm with ih in cos γ the cumulative depth in the vertical direction this solution is valid only for small time according to the converging range of taylor series the variable ih compares infiltration on a slope to that on a horizontal surface but with the same horizontal projection lengths as 21 i h γ i h 0 1 cos γ this implies that the sloping surface increases the infiltration at small t by a factor 1 cos γ for t or for high infiltration depths eq 19 can be approximated as 22 k e t i h which highlights that the slope effect reduces with time and vanishes at very long t therefore according to chen and young 2006 infiltration at small times is controlled by capillary forces which would be independent of slope angle in case of homogeneous and isotropic soils however when the slope angle increases the slope length increases and consequently also the total infiltration volume increases for long t or large in the gravity becomes the control mechanism and the normal flux would be reduced by the factor cos γ this effect cancels with increasing slope length and the net slope effect essentially vanishes the results by chen and young 2006 obtained through a modified form of the ga model depend by the condition of identical slope horizontal projection lengths in fact despite apparently in contrast to the above results by philip 1991 the modified ga model was compared to a solution of richards equation on a sloping surface and was shown to match well wang et al 2018 proposed a new theoretical formulation involving the estimate of ponding time and infiltration on hillslopes under both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions the infiltrability equation was developed by integration of darcy s law for sloping surfaces and incorporating the flux concentration equation sivapalan and milly 1989 as 23 t 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d θ θ θ i n k i 2 f ln i n n cos γ i n k i cos γ n k i cos γ i n n cos γ d θ where in is the infiltrability normal to the surface slope t is time f θ θi θs θi and n ki k θ ki f eq 23 leads to a scaling relation between infiltration on sloping surfaces and horizontal surfaces under ponding conditions the normal infiltration rate on a sloping surface reduces to that on horizontal surface scaled through a proportionality factor equal to cos γ by taking 1 cos2 γ times the time for the horizontal plane 24 t γ t 0 cos 2 γ where t γ and t 0 are the times for slope and horizontal plane respectively associated to the same value of infiltrability for time to ponding tp wang et al 2018 proposed the following equation 25 t p 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d θ θ θ i r k i f r k i k θ k i d θ where r is a constant rainfall rate and they found that the ponding time for hillslopes can be estimated from that of horizontal plane through eq 24 after ponding and under steady rainfall conditions eq 23 could be solved for temporal evolution of infiltration alternatively in order to avoid the required computational effort wang et al 2018 selected an explicit empirical relation that links the infiltration rate with time including the slope effect as 26 i n at b k s cos γ where a and b are parameters related to initial soil moisture content soil type and rainfall intensity a procedure to extend the approach to unsteady rainfall was also included the proposed approach was validated by comparison with results obtained by hydrus 1d and by the modified ga model for sloping surfaces chen and young 2006 3 experimental evidence investigations to address the understanding of the effect of surface slope on the infiltration process have been performed through some experiments in both laboratory nassif and wilson 1975 poesen 1984 fox et al 1997 assouline and ben hur 2006 essig et al 2009 lv et al 2013 morbidelli et al 2015 mu et al 2015 khan et al 2016 morbidelli et al 2016 and field sharma et al 1983 cerdà and garcía fayos 1997 chaplot and le bissonais 2000 janeau et al 2003 ribolzi et al 2011 patin et al 2012 settings even though these studies provided conflicting results as to whether infiltration increase or decrease with slope all of them provided useful insights 3 1 laboratory simulations useful conclusions were derived by essig et al 2009 and morbidelli et al 2015 2016 by examining results obtained from a long series of laboratory experiments conducted with an experimental system consisting of a soil box with characteristics shown in fig 3 and the slope adjustable in the range 1 25 study soils of thickness 67 cm obtained from natural soils over 7 cm of gravel to speed the drainage of the percolated water from the soil a rainfall simulator based on sprinklers of water under pressure provided by a pump that produces a uniform rainfall distributed over the soil surface of intensity calibrated in advance and chosen through the appropriate combination of sprinkler type and water pressure tipping bucket sensors that provided continuous surface and deep flow at the downstream soil boundary time domain reflectometry sensors that collect continuous observations of the average soil water content at different depths in two vertical profiles a first set of 50 experiments was discussed by essig et al 2009 with three different soil types a clay loam a loam and a sandy loam each soil type designation hereinafter is based on the usda classification slopes ranging from 1 to 15 and rainfall rates in the range 10 30 mm h 1 for each experiment rainfall was applied to reach soil saturation throughout the box surface runoff and deep flow were collected for up to 24 h it was observed that the time to ponding increased as rainfall intensities decreased surface flowrate normalized by the average rainfall rate versus time were used to compare runoff rates for different slopes soil types and rainfall rates for the clay loam soil the slope had a great positive effect on the steady state surface flow based on kinematic wave theory the time of concentration should be under one hour however the duration of the observed receding limb of surface flow was longer than expected after the rainfall was turned off this tail was more prominent for steeper slopes and less evident for coarse soils the normalized infiltration rates for the clay loam soil essig et al 2009 suggested the presence of soil water outflow near saturation i e a seepage face but this was not as obvious for the loam and the sandy loam soils on the basis of the above theoretical formulations one would expect that the normalized steady deep flow should only vary by a factor of cos γ but the results reported in essig et al 2009 did not conform to this expectation and the steady deep flow decreased by much larger amounts with slope angle three different mathematical models were employed to explain the measured data the authors proposed an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity that empirically accounts for slope effects to obtain realistic agreements with measurements of overland flow deep flow and water content at different depths after an on overall analysis of the observed results essig et al 2009 postulated that relationships between rainfall and surface runoff and deep flow were being influenced by the following aspects the walls of the sand box enforced a condition of zero flux normal to the boundary this might be altering the flow pattern sufficiently so that the flow was strongly influenced by wall effects a longer recession tail particularly for the steeper slopes in the clay loam soil suggested the existence of return flow from saturated areas this return flow if it exists would be more noticeable for steep slopes and for fine textured soils the infiltration of water moving on the sloping soil surface was different from the case of infiltration over a flat surface where the ponded water had no momentum in the direction tangential to the slope to shed more light on these issues morbidelli et al 2015 carried out a second set of 15 laboratory experiments with two important modifications surface runoff assimilation by a technique which enabled to perform measurements in the middle of the box along the slope much lower values of the ratio r ks changed from 2 3 to 0 7 1 3 the first modification allowed the authors to eliminate the effect of the downstream boundary on the separation between surface and subsurface flows the second modification extended the investigation to commonly observed rainfall rates and assured the absence of both erosion and sealing layer results by morbidelli et al 2015 indicate that even for moderate rainfall rates the variation of the subsurface flow with γ is very evident their results which refer substantially to conditions with prevailing gravitational effects do not agree with any theoretical result and further support the trends shown by essig et al 2009 morbidelli et al 2015 suggested the existence of a relation between the decrease of the steady deep flow with γ and the shear stress at the soil surface as a basis for estimating an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity to be used in the existing infiltration models for horizontal surfaces in this context the role of the surface roughness remained an open problem to be addressed through specific field and laboratory experiments furthermore for bare sloping surfaces morbidelli et al 2015 noted the production of surface runoff even for r ks in a subsequent set of laboratory experiments morbidelli et al 2016 provided experimental evidence on the role of roughness in the relation between infiltration and slope angle twenty eight new simulations were performed by the same experimental system but using a grassy soil surface morbidelli et al 2016 provided fresh evidence of the relationship between γ and infiltration rate on a grassy soil and remarked the significant differences existing between bare and grassy soils their laboratory simulations highlighted that the effect of slope gradient on infiltration rate was greatly reduced by the grassy soil surface with a smaller decrease of the steady infiltration rate for γ in the range 1 15 more specifically their results provided evidence of the existence of an effective soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ke γ associated with rainfall rates that yielded surface runoff and steady deep flow for each γ value this quantity decreased from ks for γ 1 down to 0 8 ks for γ 10 the divergence with results computed by theoretical formulations is much more significant in the case of a bare soil for which from morbidelli et al 2015 ke γ 10 0 2 ks a common feature of slopes with grassy soils and bare soils concerns the production of surface runoff for ke r ks that is in unsaturated soils furthermore 1 the trials presented in the work for a grassy soil by morbidelli et al 2016 coupled with those earlier described for bare soils by essig et al 2009 and morbidelli et al 2015 suggest that the magnitude of the effects of γ on the gravitational component of infiltration rate is determined by a mechanism independent of the formation of rills or a sealing layer in fact the experiments were not affected by the last two processes which influenced several previous investigations 2 the formation of a two layered soil due to the grass growth cannot describe the effects of γ on the infiltration rate and 3 the relation between γ and infiltration rate is strictly dependent on the surface roughness along the same lines nassif and wilson 1975 fox et al 1997 mu et al 2015 and khan et al 2016 conducted laboratory experiments and found that the infiltration rate decreased with increasing slope angle nassif and wilson 1975 used a laboratory apparatus of horizontal dimensions 6 15 4 10 m and soil depth 0 22 m and an artificial rainfall generator to collect data about runoff and infiltration in different soil types and for different surface slopes among other results they emphasized that the increase of slope had little effect on runoff in relatively impermeable soils and significant effects on natural soils with an increase up to 16 and 24 in bare and grassed surfaces respectively they also observed a critical slope over which the peak runoff became invariant fox et al 1997 used a sandy loam soil susceptible to surface crusting fox 1994 packed in a 100 40 10 cm trays by applying successive layers with light compaction and smoothing between layers the trays were set at different slope angles in the range 1 5 21 5 subjected to rainfall rate in the range 38 2 56 3 mm h 1 each with duration of 90 min infiltration was calculated from the overland flow rate and mictotensiometers and micromorphological analysis were used to characterize seal formation infiltration rate decreased with increasing slope angle until 11 5 and remained unchanged at steeper slope angles the image analysis of pore characteristics clearly suggested that the slope angle had no significant impact on surface seal development the estimated change in mean overland flow depth with slope angle was in the order of about 1 mm and from visual observations it never appeared to exceed a few mm within any flow thread in the presence of a sub seal pressure head from about 100 mm to 200 mm an additional positive pressure head at the surface of 1 mm is insignificant and in itself would not increase the infiltration rate so the change in overland flow depth did not add sufficient pressure head to account for the change in observed infiltration rate however the increase in depth would be sufficient to submerge significant portions of the high locations of the microtopography hence small changes in flow depth may increase the infiltration rate by submerging areas of slightly greater hydraulic conductivity around the more stable aggregates mu et al 2015 conducted laboratory simulations to study the effects of various factors including the slope gradient on the runoff generation mechanism in a soil cultivated with spring maize during three growing stages jointing stage tasseling stage and mature stage they selected a sandy loam soil packed in a 200 50 60 cm steel bin with slope variable in the range 0 30 through some experimental trials with different combinations of rainfall intensity slope gradient and growing phase they found that the overland flow and the cumulative runoff increased with the increase of rainfall rate and slope in each vegetation stage within a single growing stage of spring maize they found that the runoff coefficient increased with increasing slope because of to a decrease in the soil infiltration rate and proposed an empirical relationship that provides the runoff coefficient by a logarithmic dependency on the sine of slope largest runoff coefficients were found for the mature stage with values increasing from 0 22 to 0 41 for slopes changing from 5 to 20 under a rainfall rate of 0 5 mm min khan et al 2016 adopted an artificial rainfall generator with 324 nozzles and runoff trays that could be adjusted to the desired slope angle in the range 5 25 they conducted 72 simulation runs under numerous combinations both in mulched and un mulched silty loam soils with rainfall intensities ranging between 33 mm h 1 and 120 mm h 1 the duration for each rainfall event was 1 h and steady conditions were never reached khan et al 2016 found that infiltration rate decreased with an increase in slope and increased with an increase in rainfall intensity they concluded that the effect of rainfall intensity on the infiltration rate changed with the slope angle due to the creation of different micro relief features and that in mulched soil the water infiltration rate significantly increased with an increase in rainfall intensity at all slope angles because of the uniform surface conditions under the mulch layers these trends agreed with those showed by essig et al 2009 and morbidelli et al 2015 2016 with the magnitudes of the reduction in infiltration with slope much larger than expected from all theoretical studies on the other hand poesen 1984 found that the infiltration rate increased with increasing slope angle in fact his experimental results were characterized by a decrease in runoff with increasing slope for soils subjected to surface crust formation specifically the runoff coefficient was found to be higher for a 2 slope than a 15 slope and the mean percolation coefficient was lower for the 2 than 15 slope these results incidentally very similar to results by assouline and ben hur 2006 indicated a positive relationship between slope and infiltration rate which was more pronounced for soils with water content at field capacity or greater poesen 1984 attributed the decreased runoff to either a thinner soil crust or increased rill erosion on the steeper slopes and concluded that 1 surface sealing is inversely related to slope so steeper slopes would have a thinner compressed soil layer than flatter slopes and would be more prone to infiltration 2 steeper slopes erode more quickly and increased erosion forms deeper rills thus the surface area over which infiltration can occur becomes larger and 3 in the absence of erosion and surface sealing the slope would not be expected to affect the infiltration process of particular interest are also the analyses conducted to clarify the effect of different slope angles on water movement during unsaturated stages for example laboratory experiments were carried out by lv et al 2013 considering the redistribution process in a variable slope soil tank from 0 to 30 with a homogeneous and isotropic sandy loam soil the results showed that increasing the slope became larger the gradient of soil water potential in the lateral downslope direction parallel to the slope surface it was concluded that the water movement in the lateral downslope direction parallel to the slope surface was more sensitive to changes in the slope angle than the component normal to the slope surface lv et al 2013 also observed that the influence of the slope angle on the flow component normal to the slope surface was greatest at a certain depth into the soil 3 2 field experiments with the main objective to analyze the effect of slope angle on interrill erosion for different plot sizes and to identify possible detachment and transport processes involved in the relations between slope rain characteristics and plot sizes chaplot and le bissonais 2000 conducted a detailed study in an experimental field located in the northwest part of the paris basin the site was characterized by silty loam soils very susceptible to soil crusting the experimental field was about 100 m in length and located in the middle of a convexo concave catena with slope gradients of about 2 4 8 and 2 from top to bottom three 1 1 m bounded plots were established at three positions along the catena with slopes 2 4 and 8 two additional 2 5 m bounded plots were selected at the 4 and 8 slope positions six natural rainfall events total rainfall depth of about 100 mm intensities in the range 1 31 8 00 mm h 1 in addition to artificial rainfalls with intensities up to 50 mm h 1 were considered flow depth and detention capacity were very low because of initially smooth crusted surfaces infiltration rates were computed from runoff rates and rainfall intensity as slope increased from 2 to 8 infiltration decreased from 1 to 0 5 mm h 1 for low intensity natural rains from 4 to 1 mm h 1 for 8 mm h 1 natural rain and from 15 to 5 mm h 1 for 50 mm h 1 artificial rainfall increase in flow velocity with slope steepness and length was considered to be a possible explanation of the slope effect on runoff no rills occurred in this study the slope effect on runoff was substantially the same for both the 10 m2 and 1 m2 plots scale effect on runoff does not seem to be important for the range of scales adopted earlier sharma et al 1983 had conducted field experiments for a period of six years on a representative loamy sand soil plots with slopes ranging from 0 5 to 10 and slope lengths ranging from 5 12 m to 14 5 m were used under natural rainfall depths they found that with dry antecedent soil conditions infiltration was governed by rainfall depth whereas with wet antecedent soil conditions raindrop impact which formed a crust over the soil surface was the deciding factor infiltration decreased significantly with increasing slope due to reduction in the time available for rainfall to infiltrate but a slope length had no substantial effect opposite conclusions were reached by janeau et al 2003 about infiltrability and slope gradient under field conditions through experiments on a gravelly loamy soil occupying the upper half of a cultivated convex hill in northern thailand fifteen 1 1 m plots with slope gradients in the range 16 63 were selected and different artificial rainfall patterns were chosen the steady final infiltration rate increased sharply with increasing slope gradient microaggregates tended to behave like sand and became tightly packed on moderate slopes packing crust from these results janeau et al 2003 deduced that the vertical component of kinetic energy greater on moderate slope had a prevailing role furthermore they asserted that 1 on steep slopes the horizontal component of the kinetic energy was transformed into shear stress impeding the development of crusts so that water could still infiltrate and 2 on steeper slopes the water film was thinner thereby limiting the role of splash janeau et al 2003 concluded that the relationship between slope gradient and infiltrability is affected by the soil nature and should be investigated considering surface crusting processes infiltration experiments conducted by ribolzi et al 2011 in two small plots characterized by very different slopes with rainfall intensities in the range 60 120 mm h 1 produced results similar to that previously described janeau et al 2003 final infiltration rates of 6 mm h 1 and 21 mm h 1 were obtained for the 30 and 75 slopes respectively these experiments confirm the hypothesis that higher effective rainfall intensity is responsible for the development of less permeable erosion crust under low slope gradients whereas more permeable structural crust develop under high slope gradients finally during a long term survey of a small agricultural basin in lao patin et al 2012 achieved interesting results as part of analyses of surface runoff formation at plot scale they observed that infiltrability decreased when slope increased up to approximately 50 and increased with slope for steeper slopes 50 probably due to two opposite trends when the soil is covered at least partly with vegetation crust cover remains limited and infiltration can decrease normally with increasing slope when the soil is bare as commonly observed for steep slope the opposed relationship is achieved due to lesser development of crust 4 assessment and future developments table 1 provides a summary of the experimental work dealing with infiltration on sloping surfaces and includes efforts on theoretical conceptual analyses along with experiments carried out in both laboratory and field settings this article suggests that the interaction between surface and subsurface waters seems to be more nuanced than would be suggested by our current understanding of infiltration processes the role of slope on infiltration is complicated by many confounding factors such as rainfall or applied water intensity microtopography vegetation soil texture and vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in soil properties consequently the conclusions from previous studies have been mixed and even contradictory perhaps because the results of the experiments studying the role of slope on infiltration were also influenced by one or more of these confounding factors in different ways there is growing laboratory evidence that the reduction in infiltration occurs beyond the cos γ factor expected during steady saturated conditions this is especially prominent for infiltration over bare slopes and for clay soils and becomes less prominent for vegetated surfaces and sandy soils when studies have reported an apparent increase in infiltration this has perhaps been due to the formation of a sealing layer or because of some complications introduced through rill formation experiments that were designed to eliminate these effects have reinforced this behavior of increased infiltration beyond what is expected from a cosine of the slope angle the number of repeated and repeatable experiments from multiple research groups suggests that this trend is not merely measurement error or experimental aberration and warrants careful scrutiny the development and testing of new theoretical underpinnings for to describe infiltration on sloping surfaces is needed to move the science forward while researchers have postulated that tangential velocities at the soil surface the increased depth of water in microtopographic depressions or shear stress exerted by the overland water on the soil surface might cause this apparent increase in infiltration rates a comprehensive theory is still lacking studies have suggested the idea of an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity to offer an empirical correction but have not offered a theoretical basis that would allow this understanding to be extended to other cases beyond those covered by the range of experiments a physical explanation followed by supporting mathematical formulation would be an important step in either supporting the hypothesis of increased infiltration with slope or provide refutation of this notion and provide an explanation for the experimental results that support this hypothesis such a theory would also serve to inform us as to what future experiments to conduct and what to measure to close the gaps in our understanding researchers conducting field scale experiments have to contend with the natural spatial variability in hydraulic properties of soils and the associated role of run on experimental efforts often measure averaged quantities such as rainfall and runoff from the entire field i e integrated responses as was noted earlier it is very difficult to make independent point scale measurements at all space and time scales and therefore need both a good local model as noted in the previous paragraph and a description of the nature of the spatial variation of hydraulic properties to perform upscaling studies extensions of infiltration models to watershed scales are of course further complicated with variability at more spatial scales and the role of channel networks and current practice relies on calibration and corroboration approaches at these scales this operational process will have to be the state of practice until a meaningful way of upscaling knowledge from sub grid scales is developed acknowledgment this research was mainly financed by the italian ministry of education university and research prin 2015 
7531,permeable pavement is a stormwater control measure commonly selected in both new and retrofit applications however there is limited information about the clogging mechanism of these systems that effects the infiltration a permeable pavement site located at the seitz elementary school on fort riley kansas was selected for this study an 80 space parking lot was built behind the school as part of an epa collaboration with the u s army the parking lot design includes a permeable interlocking concrete pavement section along the downgradient edge this study monitored the clogging progress of the pavement section using twelve water content reflectometers and three buried tipping bucket rain gauges this clogging dynamic investigation was divided into three stages namely pre clogged transitional and clogged recorded initial relative water content of all three stages were significantly and negatively correlated to antecedent dry weather periods with stronger correlations during clogged conditions the peak relative water content correlation with peak rainfall 10 min intensity was significant for the water content reflectometers located on the western edge away from the eastern edge this correlation was strongest during transition stage once clogged rainfall measurements no longer correlated with the buried tipping bucket rain gauges both water content reflectometers and buried tipping bucket rain gauges showed the progress of surface clogging for every 6 mm of rain clogging advanced 1 mm across the surface the results generally support the hypothesis that the clogging progresses from the upgradient to the downgradient edge the magnitude of the contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics are effective factors on rate and progression of clogging keywords green infrastructure permeable pavement clogging water content reflectometer tipping bucket rain gauge 1 introduction replacing natural environment with impervious surfaces including roofs

effects of urbanization usepa 2015 rowe et al 2016 gi can potentially reduce the runoff volume and the contaminant load reaching the receiving water permeable pavement is a gi technology that has multiple benefits for the urban environment permeable pavements have been implemented in the forms of porous asphalt pervious concrete and permeable interlocking concrete pavement collins et al 2008 brown and borst 2015 research has indicated the potential of permeable interlocking concrete pavers picp systems as a technology to reduce both the runoff volume and pollutant removals booth and leavitt 1999 fassman and blackbourn 2011 brown and borst 2015 however to maximize the stormwater quantity and quality performance of these systems and to better design and prepare maintenance guidelines continuous monitoring is of interest to engineers and policy makers permeable pavement is an infiltration system that passes stormwater runoff into the soil internal and external factors including native soil weather and surrounding land use can affect a permeable pavers site existing soil condition particularly the infiltration rate is an important internal factor that affects the performance of a permeable pavement system while systems placed over permeable soils are expected to perform studies of various types of permeable pavement systems have shown functionality even when installed over both low permeable and impermeable soils fassman and blackbourn 2010 drake et al 2014 during rainfall events sediment washes from the surface of the upstream contributing drainage area and moves toward the permeable pavement sections and as a result of infiltration particles accumulate within the openings this accumulation and addition of fine particles make the surface of a permeable pavement clog and generally progresses from the upgradient toward the down gradient brown and borst 2013 permeable pavement s clogging is the main problem that reduces the surface infiltration of these systems and also is a barrier toward wider implementation of this technology welker et al 2013 this ratio of the contributing drainage area to the working width of the permeable pavement is a design factor and the rate of clogging is expected to be faster with larger drainage areas than a smaller one brown and borst 2013 generally clogging particles are from biological chemical or physical sources yong et al 2013 most field studies measured the initial infiltration rates and the changes over time as a metric to investigate the permeable pavement s hydrological performance and clogging progress booth and leavitt 1999 brattebo and booth 2003 brown and borst 2014 different aspects of clogging mechanisms have been conducted by earlier studies through laboratory experiments haselbach 2010 ehsaei 2013 field investigations bean et al 2007 pezzaniti et al 2009 lucke and beecham 2011 and modelling deo et al 2010 haselbach 2010 investigated the effects of extreme events and runoff with high loads of clay on pervious concrete clogging concluding that the clay particles accumulated on the upper layers of the pavement and surface sweeping followed by rinsing was an efficient way to return infiltration to an acceptable level welker et al 2013 performed intensive vacuuming to collect materials from the opening of the pavers to investigate the types of deposited materials on the pore spaces and particle sizes they found that most of the materials came from the raveled permeable pavement and few fines were associated with migration of particles and organic matter from the surrounding drainage area yong et al 2013 developed a regression model to predict physical clogging after a series of laboratory experiments they concluded that clogging was highly correlated with runoff s volume and flow rate radfar and rockaway 2016 developed a new model for clogging prediction using artificial neural networks in this study peak 5 min intensity the previous rainfall depth and the cumulative rainfall depth from the start of the study were the most effective parameters on predicting the hydrologic performance of the permeable pavement stander et al 2013 used water content reflectometers wcrs to measure permeable pavement and rain garden performance it was concluded that wcrs successfully quantified size and timing of the wetting front as runoff moves through soil and non soil media in low impact development lid practices wcrs were also used by ehsaei 2013 in a flume experiment at the edison environmental center eec designed to link the effect of slope and paver s gap sizes on creation and progress of clogging in an earlier study by brown and borst 2013 unevenly distributed wcrs with higher density near the upgradient were used for a spatial infiltration study of clogging pattern and progression for permeable pavement strips along a street in louisville kentucky however there are limited studies on the continuous monitoring of picp internal hydrologic processes and clogging mechanisms this study monitored the mechanism and progress of clogging on a picp pavement as part of a mild sloped parking lot at an elementary school using embedded wcrs cs650 campbell and tipping bucket rain gauges tb4 campbell this study also investigated the required maintenance to keep the picp function within the accepted levels the distribution of wcrs also provide the opportunity to study the clogging in two dimension as a secondary objective of this study 2 experimental set up this study was conducted at the seitz elementary school a leed silver certified building in the camp forsyth area of fort riley kansas fort riley has a temperate continental climate characterized by hot summers cold dry winters moderate winds low humidity and a pronounced peak in rainfall late in the spring and in the first half of summer prevailing winds are from the south to southwest during most of the year but during february and march the prevailing winds are from the north usarmy 2014 the army designed and constructed an 80 space parking lot with a picp section fig 1 the picp section captures direct rainfall and parking lot runoff from the adjacent parking area and conveys it into the underground layers the design of the picp section s underground volume was based on the capture of 100 of the 5 year 24 h rainfall event 107 70 cm and assumes a nominal 40 aggregate porosity in the storage gallery the contributing drainage area is 1833 m2 and the area of the picp section is 175 70 m2 the parking lot has been mainly used by parents as a pickup drop off area to collect and treat the direct rainfall and run on from the adjacent parking lot area and also because of low permeability of the native soil the drainage area under the permeable pavement was designed in three sections this design provided enough space and time for water to be infiltrated the dimension of the underground is 3 20 m width 54 90 m length 3 30 m depth the three layers of the underground section from the top to the bottom are 5 10 cm thick bedding layer of american association of state of highway transportation ashto no 8 aggregate a 15 25 cm choker consisting of ashto no 57 and a 3 10 m storage gallery of ashto no 2 fig 2 the trench walls and bottom were covered by non woven double needle punch geotextile layer based on previous research brown and borst 2013 it was expected that the picp surface would clog as solids carried by the runoff accumulated in the aggregate filled paver gaps initially filling the most upgradient gaps and forcing the water to gaps farther downgradient wcrs were embedded at the interface of the choker and storage gallery layers at the depth of 20 32 cm to monitor the clogging progress following the recommendation by brown and borst 2013 in this study the wcrs were placed in rows of three at four locations equally spaced across the paver surface see fig 1 wcrs were designed to monitor moisture levels in mineral soils but they have been demonstrated to provide relative moisture content in aggregate brown and borst 2013 stander et al 2013 the relative moisture levels indicated by the sensors can be used to distinguish when the surface above the sensor is receiving moisture from direct rainfall or the large influx associated with the progression of the wetting front to the surface above the sensor the data loggers with hardwired sensors are programmed to send recorded volumetric water content electrical conductivity temperature dielectric permittivity period average and voltage ratio data tables the generated tables are sent in the form of 1 min and 10 min to the master logger at defined intervals using the radios connected to the loggers the operation of the reflectometer can be adversely affected by large conductivities associated with winter salt operation campbell scientific 2015 and in such cases the recorded data were excluded from the analysis this study used tipping bucket rain gauges as a second approach to investigate the clogging mechanism and progression three tb4 model tipping bucket rain gauges campbell scientific 2010 were buried under the column 2 of wcrs numbered wcr4 wcr5 and wcr6 figs 1 and 2 a weather station was installed on the southwest corner of the school roof the weather station monitored rainfall and other climatological parameters the data logger was programed to record all readings at 1 minute intervals during rain events and 10 min intervals otherwise the 1 min and 10 min data were stored in separate data tables the 1 min data were continued until there were 12 h without rain separately time of tip files were also generated from the rain gauges each tip represented 0 254 mm 0 010 in of rainfall the maximum capacity of the tipping bucket is 456 mm hr definition of event in this study was a period with at least 2 54 mm of rainfall measured by tipping bucket rain gauge and dry inter event of at least 6 h brown and borst 2013 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 it was expected that the picp surface infiltration rates would be similar to rainfall intensities before the clogging progressed to the buried tipping bucket rain gauge locations as the clogging front reaches the rain gauge location the measured rates were expected to increase dramatically as the rain gauge would be subject to both runoff and rainfall intensity as the clogging front advances past the embedded rain gauge location the measured rate of tips was expected to decrease these rain gauges were hard wired to a data logger and similar to the wcrs from the significant events 1 min and 10 min data were generated 3 statistical analysis initially the datasets were tested for normality using shapiro wilk tests in addition in case of non normal distribution for correlation studies a nonparametric test spearman rank order was used for wcrs and tipping bucket rain gauges correlation tests against rainfall intensity and antecedent dry weather period adwp for comparisons between wcrs responses for runoff versus rainfall nonparametric kruskal wallis anova and median tests were used multiple comparison p values 2 tailed with a significance level of α 0 05 were used to test for difference between the variables all statistical analyses were computed using statistica 9 1 statsoft 2009 4 results 4 1 rainfall events during this study the time between the finish of the last rainfall and start of the new event considered as adwp fifty two rainfall events were investigated in this study seventy six percent of the total rainfall volume occurred from mid spring to early fall of 2016 these events were divided into pre clogged transition and clogged stages according to the selected threshold in section 4 2 table 1 shows the rainfall characteristics 4 2 selecting threshold a simple approach to detect events is based on defining thresholds values to compare the sensor readings bahrepour et al 2012 because of the presence of linear relationship between cumulative rainfall and clogging progress along the pavement section it is possible to find a threshold for determining the clogging rate across permeable pavement sections brown and borst 2013 kazemi 2014 according to the maximum relative water content mrwc recording from the wcrs along the picp the mrwc threshold to identify when surface runoff was infiltrating over the wcr was tested at 0 08 m3 m3 and in increments of 0 01 m3 m3 to 0 16 m3 m3 the first and last measurement exceeding each threshold were plotted against cumulative rainfall depth since installation of monitoring equipment for each wcr along the picp at 0 11 m3 m3 the largest correlation coefficient was calculated and then this threshold selected for this study fig 3 shows a least squares linear regression of distance on cumulative rainfall computed for both the first and last measurement to exceed 0 11 m3 m3 4 3 wcrs and correlation to rainfall runoff characteristics the adwp and rainfall peak 10 min intensity are recognized as correlated parameters to wcrs initial and peak relative water content brown and borst 2013 this study also tested correlation of the recorded initial relative water content irwc against adwp and results are reported in table 2 data were divided into three stages namely pre clogged transitional and clogged and then analyzed for correlation investigations pre clogged condition was attributed to the period that mrwc readings of wcrs were 0 11 m3 m3 transitional stage was represented by the period from the start of clogging to the completely clogged condition or the period between the first and the last time that wcrs readings were 0 11 m3 m3 all wcrs readings 0 11 m3 m3 after the transitional period were considered among clogged period all the irwc measured by wcrs during clogged stage and most of the sensor s initial relative water content during pre clogged and transitional period were significantly and negatively correlated to adwp as shown in table 2 during transition and clogged periods stronger correlations resulted and because of reduced infiltration rate less water infiltrated from picp surface correlation among mrwcs with rainfall peak 10 min intensities were studied for the defined categories of pre clogged transition and clogged wcr1 wcr3 to wcr10 and wcr12 showed positive correlation during transition period as reported in table 2 in clogged stage wcr2 wcr3 wcr6 through wcr9 showed significant difference with rainfall peak 10 min intensities while just few of the wcrs wcr6 wcr9 wcr11 wcr12 showed statistically significant difference during pre clogged condition the reason for not showing a significant correlation in the pre clogged period is because the pavement was new and pristine and water infiltrated with various and predominantly larger rates than the rainfall intensities for the clogged stage few of the wcrs did not show significant correlation with 10 min rainfall intensities and this is mainly because of the progress of the clogging front across the picp 4 4 clogging investigation using water content reflectometers wcr recordings were used to investigate the clogging appearance and development across the picp section it was expected that contributing drainage area runoff carries solids and deposition of these materials cause the picp section starts to clog progression of clogging from the upgradient edge toward a location just upgradient of a wcr more water from the contributing drainage area will infiltrate over the wcr leading to larger corresponding response as the clogging front progresses downgradient from a wcr location the clogged surface allows less water to infiltrate over the wcr with a smaller corresponding response observed fig 4 shows maximum relative water content versus time event number for wcrs located at distance of 0 80 m 1 60 m and 2 40 m from the upgradient edge the results showed that from the event number 1 which was one of the largest rainfall events monitored and had 76 20 mm h intensity table 1 clogging had already progressed 0 80 m from the upgradient edge when the average mrwc recorded 0 14 m3 m3 after events number 14 15 and 16 it was evident the clogging front had already passed those wcrs located nearest to the upgradient edge the maximum 10 min rainfall peak intensity during this study happened for the event of 04 25 2016 with 102 10 mm h after this storm the clogging front progressed further downgradient the upgradient picp was clogging and infiltration rates of this area of the permeable pavement section were reduced the results of the recorded mrwc located at 1 60 m from the upgradient edge showed evidence of clogging after event of 05 23 2016 the clogging front advanced to distance of 2 40 m from the upgradient edge after events of 05 25 2016 and 05 27 2016 fig 5 shows the standing water on the picp section after progression of clogging the results indicate that nearly one year after the installation of picp maintenance is required to return the picp infiltrating function 4 5 differences in response for runoff versus direct rainfall in order to investigate the wcrs responses to rainfall versus runoff the wcrs were analyzed using nonparametric kruskal wallis anova for the three distinguished conditions of pre clogged transitional and clogged and results are presented in table 3 there was not a statistical significant difference among wcrs during pre clogged stages while all showed significant difference during transitional and clogging periods this indicates that during pre clogging the wcrs near the contributing drainage area were receiving surface runoff and the wcrs that located far from the upgradient received direct rainfall significant difference during clogging period shows non uniform distribution of clogging front over the picp section and at this condition the wcrs located in eastern side of the picp showed less recording 4 6 tipping bucket rain gauges and correlation to rainfall runoff characteristics similar to wcrs the correlations among the roof rain gauge and three buried tipping bucket rain gauges were investigated using the same three periods of pre clogged transition and clogged with the goal to distinguish these three periods table 4 shows the results of correlation investigation for 10 min rainfall and runoff intensities there was a significant correlation between the roof s rain gauge and middle and south buried tipping rain gauge during pre clogged stage a similar result was evident for the roof s rain gauge and north buried tipping rain gauge during transition period however there was not a significant correlation among roof rain gauge 10 min peak rainfall intensity and all three buried tipping rain gauge peak 10 min runoff intensities during clogged period 4 7 clogging investigation through buried tipping bucket rain gauges as shown in figs 1 and 2 the tipping bucket rain gauges were buried under wcr4 wcr5 and wcr6 both continuous and event based cumulative rainfall and runoff were recorded from the roof rain gauge and the three buried tipping bucket rain gauges fig 6 shows that all four rain gauges initially recorded similar amounts of water until start of the event of 12 13 2015 when the north rain gauge cumulative runoff curve rises faster this signifies the beginning of clogging of the picp upgradient of the north rain gauge the data were normalized by dividing the cumulative recording of each buried rain gauge per event by the cumulative recording of the roof rain gauge in each event the results are reported in fig 7 the north rain gauge cumulative recording during each event gradually increased fig 6 and the normalized ratio also increased from 4 70 to 7 60 9 20 and then 18 20 after event of 04 20 2016 fig 7 the ratio increased until it reached a maximum of 103 during the event of 04 25 2016 after this stage the clogging front passed the north rain gauge location the normalized ratio value of the north rain gauged then dropped to 8 90 and then 1 80 after the events of 05 17 2016 05 27 2016 indicating the surface above the north rain gauge clogged this result generally showed that although the northern zone of the picp is clogged it still allows a small amount of water to infiltrate early on for both the middle and south rain gauges normalized ratio values increased from about 1 00 to values approaching 4 00 then as the surface above the north rain gauge clogged the normalized values increased to 27 70 for middle rain gauge and 26 40 for the south rain gauge after events of 05 24 25 2016 similar to north rain gauge increase on 4 20 2016 the increased ratio for the middle and south rain gauge also mean that the clogging front was progressing to the middle rain gauge the event based normalized values for the middle rain gauge decreased to smaller values but then increased to 22 40 on 08 07 2016 46 60 on 08 26 2016 and then a maximum value of 114 60 during the event of 09 14 2016 indicating that the area above the middle rain gauge would soon be clogged the south rain gauge showed its peak value during the event of 12 04 2016 when it reached the value of 65 80 these results support the hypothesis that clogging progressed from the upgradient to downgradient 4 8 clogging rate the slopes for the first and last response to exceed the 0 11 m3 m3 threshold were 0 615 and 0 008 m mm and the coefficients of correlation were 0 99 and 0 94 respectively in the studies by brown and borst 2013 and kazemi 2014 the larger correlation coefficient was observed for the last time exceeded the selected threshold as explained earlier installing wcrs in three rows and four columns provides the opportunity to study the clogging rate in two dimensions the same threshold limit of 0 11 m3 m3 was used and the clogging rate was calculated for each row and column for the first and last time that mrwc exceeded this threshold limit separately the results of average clogging rate for the first and last time exceeded threshold are reported in table 5 the rows and columns shown in fig 1 4 9 effect of drainage area on clogging the results of this study were used with the results of two earlier studies table 6 to investigate the effects of design parameters of contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics from the earlier studies that were conducted in louisville kentucky and edison new jersey sites the former had a larger and the latter a smaller contributing drainage area located upstream of the permeable pavement section brown and borst 2013 results of all three studies were used to find a relation between the contributing drainage area and the number of the required maintenance events per year as shown in fig 8 5 discussion in this study wcrs and buried tipping bucket rain gauges were employed to investigate the progression of clogging on a permeable interlocking concert pavement section the permeable section was part of an 80 space parking lot in seitz elementary school in fort riley kansas the rainfall pattern in the study area showed non uniform distribution with fewer storm events during winter and most of the large storm events occurring from mid spring through early fall as a result more runoff generated from the contributing drainage area and more likely the potential for clogging of the picp is larger after large events of mid spring through summer three periods of namely pre clogged transition and clogged were defined to evaluate the results of both embedded sensors there was negative correlation among the wcrs initial relative water content with adwp during all three stages of pre clogged transition and clogged stages the significant negative correlation between irwc and adwp confirmed that wcrs can measure drying between events similar to what occurs in soil the calculated correlation was stronger during the clogged and the pre clogged stages than transitional stage these results are similar to the results of tdrs that used to monitor a permeable pavement strips in louisville ky by brown and borst 2013 wcr1 and wcr3 to wcr10 wcr12 showed statistically positive correlation between wcrs peak relative water contents and rainfall peak 10 min intensities during the transitional period while 33 and 50 of the wcrs that were located farther from the upgradient edge showed significant correlation during pre clogged and clogged periods the reason for non significant correlation in the pre clogged period for the wcrs located farther from the upgradient edge is because the downgradient pavement initially had larger infiltration rates during the clogged period the picp infiltration was less than rainfall intensity from the wcrs recording it was possible to distinguish whether the area above the wcrs is receiving water from direct rainfall or runoff from the contributing drainage area these results are similar to the results of earlier studies by brown and borst 2013 and stander et al 2013 for the wcrs as recommended by brown and borst 2013 wcrs were evenly distributed across the picp this arrangement also gave the opportunity to monitor the clogging in two dimensions of upgradient toward down gradient and from western edge to eastern edge the results showed that the clogging started from the upgradient and progressed into the downgradient and west edge direction also a lateral progression of clogging was evident in a direction from west edge into the east edge of picp at a louisville site with a permeable pavement strip system located along a road with a curb the progression of clogging was perpendicular to the contributing drainage area runoff flow direction during the design and construction of the parking lot efforts were made to direct all of the contributing drainage area s runoff to spread uniformly over the pavement section width however the results showed that some of the wcrs located on the far east side of the pavement section received less runoff during this study these results are similar to the finding of ehsaei 2013 that conducted wetting and clogging front on a pavement section with underlying layers in a laboratory scale experiment another possibility for smaller recording of the far east sensors could be the deposition of the particles and debris from the earlier events thus changing the runoff direction and hence the runoff did not infiltrate over these reflectometers during the following events feasibility of using buried tipping bucket rain gauges as a tool to investigate the mechanism and progression of clogging was conducted in this study peak 10 min rainfall and runoff intensities were compared during the pre clogged stage 10 min runoff intensity of both the middle and south buried tipping bucket rain gauge showed a significant correlation with rainfall peak 10 min intensity in the transition period the north rain gauge showed a significant correlation with rainfall intensities the clogged stage peak 10 min run off recorded by all three buried tipping bucket rain gauges did not show correlation with 10 min peak rainfall intensity similar to wcrs the buried tipping rain gauges were also installed in the direction of the upgradient toward the opposite gradient the buried tipping bucket rain gauges were able to show the generation and advancement of clogging along the picp section in consistent with wcrs before clogging at each rain gauge location the recorded infiltration by rain gauges was similar or larger than the rainfall intensities while after clogging the infiltration rates calculated from buried rain gauges were remarkably smaller the wcrs measurement provide useful information for clogging investigation and also for recommending the required yearly maintenance recordings of buried tipping bucket rain gauges and wcrs confirmed that picp was not completely clogged and showed some degrees of infiltration for a series of wcrs along the picp the timing of the measureable change in response by the wcr versus similar rainfall intensities can be used to indicate surface clogging progression rate this can help to establish a maintenance schedule selecting the proper threshold for mrwc to differentiate between direct rainfall infiltration compared to surface runoff is critical as mentioned earlier it is likely that the threshold is location and instrument specific brown and borst 2013 and may also be influenced by construction materials clogging rate results showed that clogging progressed at the average rate of 0 006 m mm 0 50 ft in from upgradient to downgradient and also the average rate of 0 211 m mm 17 58 ft in from the west edge to the east edge of picp the results from a series of wcrs installed in the direction of expected clogging in louisville indicated that surface clogging was advancing at a rate of about 0 123 m mm of rainfall based on the first three months of monitoring brown and borst 2013 based on this rate of surface clogging and the annual rainfall depth in louisville the 36 6 m long control required about four maintenance events per year in louisville whereas in fort riley annual maintenance is required it can be concluded that clogging rate is dependent on the size of the contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics further investigation of the wcrs and tipping bucket data showed that the clogging progress was slower on the northern half of the picp and quicker on the south half this happened mainly because of the increase in drainage area and because of the greater frequency of rainfall events in late spring and summer it can be concluded that rainfall characteristic is one of the main drivers of the clogging these results are in agreement with findings of yong et al 2013 that found clogging was highly correlated with runoff s volume and flow rate additionally radfar and rockaway 2016 concluded the previous rainfall depth and the cumulative rainfall depth from the start of the study were the most effective parameters on the hydrologic performance of the permeable pavement it is recommended when the clogging front reached the 75 of the width of the picp or when the transition stage started the maintenance should be scheduled the ratio of the contributing drainage area to permeable pavement area is an important factor for recommending maintenance this ratio was largest for the louisville study and it was smallest at the edison site this helps explain why louisville needed maintenance after three months fort riley after 12 months and why edison required no maintenances even after seven years of use it is recommended for designing a parking lot system that includes picp section the ratio of contributing drainage area to the picp area should be between 2 1 and 5 1 njdep 2004 smith 2006 however in this study the ratio was 10 50 which helps explain the progression of clogging in less than a year a cost benefit study would help to select which options of narrow deep or wider shallow of gi is useful lack of flexibility and adaptability is one of the weakness of the threshold based classifications techniques bahrepour et al 2012 it has been suggested for the studies that when early detection of the event is necessary data mining methods can be used for data interpretation novel reputation based voting and the decision tree is one of the applied method of machine learning techniques to detect many real world events that show specific patterns bahrepour et al 2012 the embedded sensors such as water content reflectometer have been used in earlier study by brown and borst 2013 on non array placement in this study sensors were installed in an array pattern for further investigations results of earlier studies showed if the sensors installed properly those can work for several years one important issue with the embedded sensor is the careful installation of the sensors if those installed correctly there will not be any communication issues during the study in this study two data loggers were used for recording and transferring the data the results of this study showed that the embedded sensors can be used in the larger area however validating the recorded data is one of the common issues of the large wireless networks a method has been proposed by chen et al 2017 to reduce the traffic and required communications and to increase validity of the recorded data 6 conclusion and recommendations permeable pavement is generally designed to treat stormwater that falls on the actual pavement surface area and accept run on from adjacent impervious areas monitoring of clogging progression of the surface of a picp section that was part of a parking lot was conducted in this study with wcr placement that was spread out across the picp it was possible to monitor the clogging in two dimensions one along the upgradient edge into the opposite edge and one from the west edge along the east edge or generally along the length of the picp section wcrs and buried tipping rain gauges were consistent in predicting the clogging progression of picp section these instruments are useful tools for monitoring the permeable pavement performance in remote areas developing a mobile application and connecting the sensors recording with the application will provide useful information regarding clogging and scheduling maintenance for the owners both embedded wcrs and buried tipping bucket rain gauges were located at 25 50 and 75 from the upgradient edge and in this study with this placement it was possible to track progression of clogging it is recommended when the clogging front reached the 75 of the width of the picp or when the transition stage started the maintenance should be scheduled because of increased contributing drainage area potentially the clogging will progress quicker after this point further studies on the rainfall characteristics the ratio of the contributing drainage area the drainage area land use and economy of the permeable pavements are helpful for scheduling more accurate maintenance practice and success of the project additionally studies on pavement section evaporation before and after clogging may be useful acknowledgments this article was supported in part by an appointment to the orise research participant program supported by an

7531,permeable pavement is a stormwater control measure commonly selected in both new and retrofit applications however there is limited information about the clogging mechanism of these systems that effects the infiltration a permeable pavement site located at the seitz elementary school on fort riley kansas was selected for this study an 80 space parking lot was built behind the school as part of an epa collaboration with the u s army the parking lot design includes a permeable interlocking concrete pavement section along the downgradient edge this study monitored the clogging progress of the pavement section using twelve water content reflectometers and three buried tipping bucket rain gauges this clogging dynamic investigation was divided into three stages namely pre clogged transitional and clogged recorded initial relative water content of all three stages were significantly and negatively correlated to antecedent dry weather periods with stronger correlations during clogged conditions the peak relative water content correlation with peak rainfall 10 min intensity was significant for the water content reflectometers located on the western edge away from the eastern edge this correlation was strongest during transition stage once clogged rainfall measurements no longer correlated with the buried tipping bucket rain gauges both water content reflectometers and buried tipping bucket rain gauges showed the progress of surface clogging for every 6 mm of rain clogging advanced 1 mm across the surface the results generally support the hypothesis that the clogging progresses from the upgradient to the downgradient edge the magnitude of the contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics are effective factors on rate and progression of clogging keywords green infrastructure permeable pavement clogging water content reflectometer tipping bucket rain gauge 1 introduction replacing natural environment with impervious surfaces including roofs roads highways and bridges have led to increase of seasonal flooding and easy movement of pollutants into the receiving surface water and groundwater the increased magnitude and the number of flooding events also caused the conventional urban drainage systems not to be able to control and convey all the runoff events throughout a whole year green infrastructure gi is one option to reduce the effects of urbanization usepa 2015 rowe et al 2016 gi can potentially reduce the runoff volume and the contaminant load reaching the receiving water permeable pavement is a gi technology that has multiple benefits for the urban environment permeable pavements have been implemented in the forms of porous asphalt pervious concrete and permeable interlocking concrete pavement collins et al 2008 brown and borst 2015 research has indicated the potential of permeable interlocking concrete pavers picp systems as a technology to reduce both the runoff volume and pollutant removals booth and leavitt 1999 fassman and blackbourn 2011 brown and borst 2015 however to maximize the stormwater quantity and quality performance of these systems and to better design and prepare maintenance guidelines continuous monitoring is of interest to engineers and policy makers permeable pavement is an infiltration system that passes stormwater runoff into the soil internal and external factors including native soil weather and surrounding land use can affect a permeable pavers site existing soil condition particularly the infiltration rate is an important internal factor that affects the performance of a permeable pavement system while systems placed over permeable soils are expected to perform studies of various types of permeable pavement systems have shown functionality even when installed over both low permeable and impermeable soils fassman and blackbourn 2010 drake et al 2014 during rainfall events sediment washes from the surface of the upstream contributing drainage area and moves toward the permeable pavement sections and as a result of infiltration particles accumulate within the openings this accumulation and addition of fine particles make the surface of a permeable pavement clog and generally progresses from the upgradient toward the down gradient brown and borst 2013 permeable pavement s clogging is the main problem that reduces the surface infiltration of these systems and also is a barrier toward wider implementation of this technology welker et al 2013 this ratio of the contributing drainage area to the working width of the permeable pavement is a design factor and the rate of clogging is expected to be faster with larger drainage areas than a smaller one brown and borst 2013 generally clogging particles are from biological chemical or physical sources yong et al 2013 most field studies measured the initial infiltration rates and the changes over time as a metric to investigate the permeable pavement s hydrological performance and clogging progress booth and leavitt 1999 brattebo and booth 2003 brown and borst 2014 different aspects of clogging mechanisms have been conducted by earlier studies through laboratory experiments haselbach 2010 ehsaei 2013 field investigations bean et al 2007 pezzaniti et al 2009 lucke and beecham 2011 and modelling deo et al 2010 haselbach 2010 investigated the effects of extreme events and runoff with high loads of clay on pervious concrete clogging concluding that the clay particles accumulated on the upper layers of the pavement and surface sweeping followed by rinsing was an efficient way to return infiltration to an acceptable level welker et al 2013 performed intensive vacuuming to collect materials from the opening of the pavers to investigate the types of deposited materials on the pore spaces and particle sizes they found that most of the materials came from the raveled permeable pavement and few fines were associated with migration of particles and organic matter from the surrounding drainage area yong et al 2013 developed a regression model to predict physical clogging after a series of laboratory experiments they concluded that clogging was highly correlated with runoff s volume and flow rate radfar and rockaway 2016 developed a new model for clogging prediction using artificial neural networks in this study peak 5 min intensity the previous rainfall depth and the cumulative rainfall depth from the start of the study were the most effective parameters on predicting the hydrologic performance of the permeable pavement stander et al 2013 used water content reflectometers wcrs to measure permeable pavement and rain garden performance it was concluded that wcrs successfully quantified size and timing of the wetting front as runoff moves through soil and non soil media in low impact development lid practices wcrs were also used by ehsaei 2013 in a flume experiment at the edison environmental center eec designed to link the effect of slope and paver s gap sizes on creation and progress of clogging in an earlier study by brown and borst 2013 unevenly distributed wcrs with higher density near the upgradient were used for a spatial infiltration study of clogging pattern and progression for permeable pavement strips along a street in louisville kentucky however there are limited studies on the continuous monitoring of picp internal hydrologic processes and clogging mechanisms this study monitored the mechanism and progress of clogging on a picp pavement as part of a mild sloped parking lot at an elementary school using embedded wcrs cs650 campbell and tipping bucket rain gauges tb4 campbell this study also investigated the required maintenance to keep the picp function within the accepted levels the distribution of wcrs also provide the opportunity to study the clogging in two dimension as a secondary objective of this study 2 experimental set up this study was conducted at the seitz elementary school a leed silver certified building in the camp forsyth area of fort riley kansas fort riley has a temperate continental climate characterized by hot summers cold dry winters moderate winds low humidity and a pronounced peak in rainfall late in the spring and in the first half of summer prevailing winds are from the south to southwest during most of the year but during february and march the prevailing winds are from the north usarmy 2014 the army designed and constructed an 80 space parking lot with a picp section fig 1 the picp section captures direct rainfall and parking lot runoff from the adjacent parking area and conveys it into the underground layers the design of the picp section s underground volume was based on the capture of 100 of the 5 year 24 h rainfall event 107 70 cm and assumes a nominal 40 aggregate porosity in the storage gallery the contributing drainage area is 1833 m2 and the area of the picp section is 175 70 m2 the parking lot has been mainly used by parents as a pickup drop off area to collect and treat the direct rainfall and run on from the adjacent parking lot area and also because of low permeability of the native soil the drainage area under the permeable pavement was designed in three sections this design provided enough space and time for water to be infiltrated the dimension of the underground is 3 20 m width 54 90 m length 3 30 m depth the three layers of the underground section from the top to the bottom are 5 10 cm thick bedding layer of american association of state of highway transportation ashto no 8 aggregate a 15 25 cm choker consisting of ashto no 57 and a 3 10 m storage gallery of ashto no 2 fig 2 the trench walls and bottom were covered by non woven double needle punch geotextile layer based on previous research brown and borst 2013 it was expected that the picp surface would clog as solids carried by the runoff accumulated in the aggregate filled paver gaps initially filling the most upgradient gaps and forcing the water to gaps farther downgradient wcrs were embedded at the interface of the choker and storage gallery layers at the depth of 20 32 cm to monitor the clogging progress following the recommendation by brown and borst 2013 in this study the wcrs were placed in rows of three at four locations equally spaced across the paver surface see fig 1 wcrs were designed to monitor moisture levels in mineral soils but they have been demonstrated to provide relative moisture content in aggregate brown and borst 2013 stander et al 2013 the relative moisture levels indicated by the sensors can be used to distinguish when the surface above the sensor is receiving moisture from direct rainfall or the large influx associated with the progression of the wetting front to the surface above the sensor the data loggers with hardwired sensors are programmed to send recorded volumetric water content electrical conductivity temperature dielectric permittivity period average and voltage ratio data tables the generated tables are sent in the form of 1 min and 10 min to the master logger at defined intervals using the radios connected to the loggers the operation of the reflectometer can be adversely affected by large conductivities associated with winter salt operation campbell scientific 2015 and in such cases the recorded data were excluded from the analysis this study used tipping bucket rain gauges as a second approach to investigate the clogging mechanism and progression three tb4 model tipping bucket rain gauges campbell scientific 2010 were buried under the column 2 of wcrs numbered wcr4 wcr5 and wcr6 figs 1 and 2 a weather station was installed on the southwest corner of the school roof the weather station monitored rainfall and other climatological parameters the data logger was programed to record all readings at 1 minute intervals during rain events and 10 min intervals otherwise the 1 min and 10 min data were stored in separate data tables the 1 min data were continued until there were 12 h without rain separately time of tip files were also generated from the rain gauges each tip represented 0 254 mm 0 010 in of rainfall the maximum capacity of the tipping bucket is 456 mm hr definition of event in this study was a period with at least 2 54 mm of rainfall measured by tipping bucket rain gauge and dry inter event of at least 6 h brown and borst 2013 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 it was expected that the picp surface infiltration rates would be similar to rainfall intensities before the clogging progressed to the buried tipping bucket rain gauge locations as the clogging front reaches the rain gauge location the measured rates were expected to increase dramatically as the rain gauge would be subject to both runoff and rainfall intensity as the clogging front advances past the embedded rain gauge location the measured rate of tips was expected to decrease these rain gauges were hard wired to a data logger and similar to the wcrs from the significant events 1 min and 10 min data were generated 3 statistical analysis initially the datasets were tested for normality using shapiro wilk tests in addition in case of non normal distribution for correlation studies a nonparametric test spearman rank order was used for wcrs and tipping bucket rain gauges correlation tests against rainfall intensity and antecedent dry weather period adwp for comparisons between wcrs responses for runoff versus rainfall nonparametric kruskal wallis anova and median tests were used multiple comparison p values 2 tailed with a significance level of α 0 05 were used to test for difference between the variables all statistical analyses were computed using statistica 9 1 statsoft 2009 4 results 4 1 rainfall events during this study the time between the finish of the last rainfall and start of the new event considered as adwp fifty two rainfall events were investigated in this study seventy six percent of the total rainfall volume occurred from mid spring to early fall of 2016 these events were divided into pre clogged transition and clogged stages according to the selected threshold in section 4 2 table 1 shows the rainfall characteristics 4 2 selecting threshold a simple approach to detect events is based on defining thresholds values to compare the sensor readings bahrepour et al 2012 because of the presence of linear relationship between cumulative rainfall and clogging progress along the pavement section it is possible to find a threshold for determining the clogging rate across permeable pavement sections brown and borst 2013 kazemi 2014 according to the maximum relative water content mrwc recording from the wcrs along the picp the mrwc threshold to identify when surface runoff was infiltrating over the wcr was tested at 0 08 m3 m3 and in increments of 0 01 m3 m3 to 0 16 m3 m3 the first and last measurement exceeding each threshold were plotted against cumulative rainfall depth since installation of monitoring equipment for each wcr along the picp at 0 11 m3 m3 the largest correlation coefficient was calculated and then this threshold selected for this study fig 3 shows a least squares linear regression of distance on cumulative rainfall computed for both the first and last measurement to exceed 0 11 m3 m3 4 3 wcrs and correlation to rainfall runoff characteristics the adwp and rainfall peak 10 min intensity are recognized as correlated parameters to wcrs initial and peak relative water content brown and borst 2013 this study also tested correlation of the recorded initial relative water content irwc against adwp and results are reported in table 2 data were divided into three stages namely pre clogged transitional and clogged and then analyzed for correlation investigations pre clogged condition was attributed to the period that mrwc readings of wcrs were 0 11 m3 m3 transitional stage was represented by the period from the start of clogging to the completely clogged condition or the period between the first and the last time that wcrs readings were 0 11 m3 m3 all wcrs readings 0 11 m3 m3 after the transitional period were considered among clogged period all the irwc measured by wcrs during clogged stage and most of the sensor s initial relative water content during pre clogged and transitional period were significantly and negatively correlated to adwp as shown in table 2 during transition and clogged periods stronger correlations resulted and because of reduced infiltration rate less water infiltrated from picp surface correlation among mrwcs with rainfall peak 10 min intensities were studied for the defined categories of pre clogged transition and clogged wcr1 wcr3 to wcr10 and wcr12 showed positive correlation during transition period as reported in table 2 in clogged stage wcr2 wcr3 wcr6 through wcr9 showed significant difference with rainfall peak 10 min intensities while just few of the wcrs wcr6 wcr9 wcr11 wcr12 showed statistically significant difference during pre clogged condition the reason for not showing a significant correlation in the pre clogged period is because the pavement was new and pristine and water infiltrated with various and predominantly larger rates than the rainfall intensities for the clogged stage few of the wcrs did not show significant correlation with 10 min rainfall intensities and this is mainly because of the progress of the clogging front across the picp 4 4 clogging investigation using water content reflectometers wcr recordings were used to investigate the clogging appearance and development across the picp section it was expected that contributing drainage area runoff carries solids and deposition of these materials cause the picp section starts to clog progression of clogging from the upgradient edge toward a location just upgradient of a wcr more water from the contributing drainage area will infiltrate over the wcr leading to larger corresponding response as the clogging front progresses downgradient from a wcr location the clogged surface allows less water to infiltrate over the wcr with a smaller corresponding response observed fig 4 shows maximum relative water content versus time event number for wcrs located at distance of 0 80 m 1 60 m and 2 40 m from the upgradient edge the results showed that from the event number 1 which was one of the largest rainfall events monitored and had 76 20 mm h intensity table 1 clogging had already progressed 0 80 m from the upgradient edge when the average mrwc recorded 0 14 m3 m3 after events number 14 15 and 16 it was evident the clogging front had already passed those wcrs located nearest to the upgradient edge the maximum 10 min rainfall peak intensity during this study happened for the event of 04 25 2016 with 102 10 mm h after this storm the clogging front progressed further downgradient the upgradient picp was clogging and infiltration rates of this area of the permeable pavement section were reduced the results of the recorded mrwc located at 1 60 m from the upgradient edge showed evidence of clogging after event of 05 23 2016 the clogging front advanced to distance of 2 40 m from the upgradient edge after events of 05 25 2016 and 05 27 2016 fig 5 shows the standing water on the picp section after progression of clogging the results indicate that nearly one year after the installation of picp maintenance is required to return the picp infiltrating function 4 5 differences in response for runoff versus direct rainfall in order to investigate the wcrs responses to rainfall versus runoff the wcrs were analyzed using nonparametric kruskal wallis anova for the three distinguished conditions of pre clogged transitional and clogged and results are presented in table 3 there was not a statistical significant difference among wcrs during pre clogged stages while all showed significant difference during transitional and clogging periods this indicates that during pre clogging the wcrs near the contributing drainage area were receiving surface runoff and the wcrs that located far from the upgradient received direct rainfall significant difference during clogging period shows non uniform distribution of clogging front over the picp section and at this condition the wcrs located in eastern side of the picp showed less recording 4 6 tipping bucket rain gauges and correlation to rainfall runoff characteristics similar to wcrs the correlations among the roof rain gauge and three buried tipping bucket rain gauges were investigated using the same three periods of pre clogged transition and clogged with the goal to distinguish these three periods table 4 shows the results of correlation investigation for 10 min rainfall and runoff intensities there was a significant correlation between the roof s rain gauge and middle and south buried tipping rain gauge during pre clogged stage a similar result was evident for the roof s rain gauge and north buried tipping rain gauge during transition period however there was not a significant correlation among roof rain gauge 10 min peak rainfall intensity and all three buried tipping rain gauge peak 10 min runoff intensities during clogged period 4 7 clogging investigation through buried tipping bucket rain gauges as shown in figs 1 and 2 the tipping bucket rain gauges were buried under wcr4 wcr5 and wcr6 both continuous and event based cumulative rainfall and runoff were recorded from the roof rain gauge and the three buried tipping bucket rain gauges fig 6 shows that all four rain gauges initially recorded similar amounts of water until start of the event of 12 13 2015 when the north rain gauge cumulative runoff curve rises faster this signifies the beginning of clogging of the picp upgradient of the north rain gauge the data were normalized by dividing the cumulative recording of each buried rain gauge per event by the cumulative recording of the roof rain gauge in each event the results are reported in fig 7 the north rain gauge cumulative recording during each event gradually increased fig 6 and the normalized ratio also increased from 4 70 to 7 60 9 20 and then 18 20 after event of 04 20 2016 fig 7 the ratio increased until it reached a maximum of 103 during the event of 04 25 2016 after this stage the clogging front passed the north rain gauge location the normalized ratio value of the north rain gauged then dropped to 8 90 and then 1 80 after the events of 05 17 2016 05 27 2016 indicating the surface above the north rain gauge clogged this result generally showed that although the northern zone of the picp is clogged it still allows a small amount of water to infiltrate early on for both the middle and south rain gauges normalized ratio values increased from about 1 00 to values approaching 4 00 then as the surface above the north rain gauge clogged the normalized values increased to 27 70 for middle rain gauge and 26 40 for the south rain gauge after events of 05 24 25 2016 similar to north rain gauge increase on 4 20 2016 the increased ratio for the middle and south rain gauge also mean that the clogging front was progressing to the middle rain gauge the event based normalized values for the middle rain gauge decreased to smaller values but then increased to 22 40 on 08 07 2016 46 60 on 08 26 2016 and then a maximum value of 114 60 during the event of 09 14 2016 indicating that the area above the middle rain gauge would soon be clogged the south rain gauge showed its peak value during the event of 12 04 2016 when it reached the value of 65 80 these results support the hypothesis that clogging progressed from the upgradient to downgradient 4 8 clogging rate the slopes for the first and last response to exceed the 0 11 m3 m3 threshold were 0 615 and 0 008 m mm and the coefficients of correlation were 0 99 and 0 94 respectively in the studies by brown and borst 2013 and kazemi 2014 the larger correlation coefficient was observed for the last time exceeded the selected threshold as explained earlier installing wcrs in three rows and four columns provides the opportunity to study the clogging rate in two dimensions the same threshold limit of 0 11 m3 m3 was used and the clogging rate was calculated for each row and column for the first and last time that mrwc exceeded this threshold limit separately the results of average clogging rate for the first and last time exceeded threshold are reported in table 5 the rows and columns shown in fig 1 4 9 effect of drainage area on clogging the results of this study were used with the results of two earlier studies table 6 to investigate the effects of design parameters of contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics from the earlier studies that were conducted in louisville kentucky and edison new jersey sites the former had a larger and the latter a smaller contributing drainage area located upstream of the permeable pavement section brown and borst 2013 results of all three studies were used to find a relation between the contributing drainage area and the number of the required maintenance events per year as shown in fig 8 5 discussion in this study wcrs and buried tipping bucket rain gauges were employed to investigate the progression of clogging on a permeable interlocking concert pavement section the permeable section was part of an 80 space parking lot in seitz elementary school in fort riley kansas the rainfall pattern in the study area showed non uniform distribution with fewer storm events during winter and most of the large storm events occurring from mid spring through early fall as a result more runoff generated from the contributing drainage area and more likely the potential for clogging of the picp is larger after large events of mid spring through summer three periods of namely pre clogged transition and clogged were defined to evaluate the results of both embedded sensors there was negative correlation among the wcrs initial relative water content with adwp during all three stages of pre clogged transition and clogged stages the significant negative correlation between irwc and adwp confirmed that wcrs can measure drying between events similar to what occurs in soil the calculated correlation was stronger during the clogged and the pre clogged stages than transitional stage these results are similar to the results of tdrs that used to monitor a permeable pavement strips in louisville ky by brown and borst 2013 wcr1 and wcr3 to wcr10 wcr12 showed statistically positive correlation between wcrs peak relative water contents and rainfall peak 10 min intensities during the transitional period while 33 and 50 of the wcrs that were located farther from the upgradient edge showed significant correlation during pre clogged and clogged periods the reason for non significant correlation in the pre clogged period for the wcrs located farther from the upgradient edge is because the downgradient pavement initially had larger infiltration rates during the clogged period the picp infiltration was less than rainfall intensity from the wcrs recording it was possible to distinguish whether the area above the wcrs is receiving water from direct rainfall or runoff from the contributing drainage area these results are similar to the results of earlier studies by brown and borst 2013 and stander et al 2013 for the wcrs as recommended by brown and borst 2013 wcrs were evenly distributed across the picp this arrangement also gave the opportunity to monitor the clogging in two dimensions of upgradient toward down gradient and from western edge to eastern edge the results showed that the clogging started from the upgradient and progressed into the downgradient and west edge direction also a lateral progression of clogging was evident in a direction from west edge into the east edge of picp at a louisville site with a permeable pavement strip system located along a road with a curb the progression of clogging was perpendicular to the contributing drainage area runoff flow direction during the design and construction of the parking lot efforts were made to direct all of the contributing drainage area s runoff to spread uniformly over the pavement section width however the results showed that some of the wcrs located on the far east side of the pavement section received less runoff during this study these results are similar to the finding of ehsaei 2013 that conducted wetting and clogging front on a pavement section with underlying layers in a laboratory scale experiment another possibility for smaller recording of the far east sensors could be the deposition of the particles and debris from the earlier events thus changing the runoff direction and hence the runoff did not infiltrate over these reflectometers during the following events feasibility of using buried tipping bucket rain gauges as a tool to investigate the mechanism and progression of clogging was conducted in this study peak 10 min rainfall and runoff intensities were compared during the pre clogged stage 10 min runoff intensity of both the middle and south buried tipping bucket rain gauge showed a significant correlation with rainfall peak 10 min intensity in the transition period the north rain gauge showed a significant correlation with rainfall intensities the clogged stage peak 10 min run off recorded by all three buried tipping bucket rain gauges did not show correlation with 10 min peak rainfall intensity similar to wcrs the buried tipping rain gauges were also installed in the direction of the upgradient toward the opposite gradient the buried tipping bucket rain gauges were able to show the generation and advancement of clogging along the picp section in consistent with wcrs before clogging at each rain gauge location the recorded infiltration by rain gauges was similar or larger than the rainfall intensities while after clogging the infiltration rates calculated from buried rain gauges were remarkably smaller the wcrs measurement provide useful information for clogging investigation and also for recommending the required yearly maintenance recordings of buried tipping bucket rain gauges and wcrs confirmed that picp was not completely clogged and showed some degrees of infiltration for a series of wcrs along the picp the timing of the measureable change in response by the wcr versus similar rainfall intensities can be used to indicate surface clogging progression rate this can help to establish a maintenance schedule selecting the proper threshold for mrwc to differentiate between direct rainfall infiltration compared to surface runoff is critical as mentioned earlier it is likely that the threshold is location and instrument specific brown and borst 2013 and may also be influenced by construction materials clogging rate results showed that clogging progressed at the average rate of 0 006 m mm 0 50 ft in from upgradient to downgradient and also the average rate of 0 211 m mm 17 58 ft in from the west edge to the east edge of picp the results from a series of wcrs installed in the direction of expected clogging in louisville indicated that surface clogging was advancing at a rate of about 0 123 m mm of rainfall based on the first three months of monitoring brown and borst 2013 based on this rate of surface clogging and the annual rainfall depth in louisville the 36 6 m long control required about four maintenance events per year in louisville whereas in fort riley annual maintenance is required it can be concluded that clogging rate is dependent on the size of the contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics further investigation of the wcrs and tipping bucket data showed that the clogging progress was slower on the northern half of the picp and quicker on the south half this happened mainly because of the increase in drainage area and because of the greater frequency of rainfall events in late spring and summer it can be concluded that rainfall characteristic is one of the main drivers of the clogging these results are in agreement with findings of yong et al 2013 that found clogging was highly correlated with runoff s volume and flow rate additionally radfar and rockaway 2016 concluded the previous rainfall depth and the cumulative rainfall depth from the start of the study were the most effective parameters on the hydrologic performance of the permeable pavement it is recommended when the clogging front reached the 75 of the width of the picp or when the transition stage started the maintenance should be scheduled the ratio of the contributing drainage area to permeable pavement area is an important factor for recommending maintenance this ratio was largest for the louisville study and it was smallest at the edison site this helps explain why louisville needed maintenance after three months fort riley after 12 months and why edison required no maintenances even after seven years of use it is recommended for designing a parking lot system that includes picp section the ratio of contributing drainage area to the picp area should be between 2 1 and 5 1 njdep 2004 smith 2006 however in this study the ratio was 10 50 which helps explain the progression of clogging in less than a year a cost benefit study would help to select which options of narrow deep or wider shallow of gi is useful lack of flexibility and adaptability is one of the weakness of the threshold based classifications techniques bahrepour et al 2012 it has been suggested for the studies that when early detection of the event is necessary data mining methods can be used for data interpretation novel reputation based voting and the decision tree is one of the applied method of machine learning techniques to detect many real world events that show specific patterns bahrepour et al 2012 the embedded sensors such as water content reflectometer have been used in earlier study by brown and borst 2013 on non array placement in this study sensors were installed in an array pattern for further investigations results of earlier studies showed if the sensors installed properly those can work for several years one important issue with the embedded sensor is the careful installation of the sensors if those installed correctly there will not be any communication issues during the study in this study two data loggers were used for recording and transferring the data the results of this study showed that the embedded sensors can be used in the larger area however validating the recorded data is one of the common issues of the large wireless networks a method has been proposed by chen et al 2017 to reduce the traffic and required communications and to increase validity of the recorded data 6 conclusion and recommendations permeable pavement is generally designed to treat stormwater that falls on the actual pavement surface area and accept run on from adjacent impervious areas monitoring of clogging progression of the surface of a picp section that was part of a parking lot was conducted in this study with wcr placement that was spread out across the picp it was possible to monitor the clogging in two dimensions one along the upgradient edge into the opposite edge and one from the west edge along the east edge or generally along the length of the picp section wcrs and buried tipping rain gauges were consistent in predicting the clogging progression of picp section these instruments are useful tools for monitoring the permeable pavement performance in remote areas developing a mobile application and connecting the sensors recording with the application will provide useful information regarding clogging and scheduling maintenance for the owners both embedded wcrs and buried tipping bucket rain gauges were located at 25 50 and 75 from the upgradient edge and in this study with this placement it was possible to track progression of clogging it is recommended when the clogging front reached the 75 of the width of the picp or when the transition stage started the maintenance should be scheduled because of increased contributing drainage area potentially the clogging will progress quicker after this point further studies on the rainfall characteristics the ratio of the contributing drainage area the drainage area land use and economy of the permeable pavements are helpful for scheduling more accurate maintenance practice and success of the project additionally studies on pavement section evaporation before and after clogging may be useful acknowledgments this article was supported in part by an appointment to the orise research participant program supported by an

7532,the skill of hydrologic models such as those used in operational flood prediction is currently restricted by the availability of flow gauges and by the quality of the streamflow data used for calibration the increased availability of remote sensing products provides the opportunity to further improve the model forecasting skill a joint calibration scheme using streamflow measurements and remote sensing derived soil moisture values was examined and compared with a streamflow only calibration scheme the efficacy of the two calibration schemes was tested in three modelling setups 1 a lumped model 2 a semi distributed model with only the outlet gauge available for calibration and 3 a semi distributed model with multiple gauges available for calibration the joint calibration scheme was found to slightly degrade the streamflow prediction at gauged sites during the calibration period compared with streamflow only calibration but improvement was found at the same gauged sites during the independent validation period a more consistent and statistically significant improvement was achieved at gauged sites not used in the calibration due to the spatial information introduced by the remotely sensed soil moisture data it was also found that the impact of using soil moisture for calibration tended to be stronger at the upstream and tributary sub catchments than at the downstream sub catchments keywords calibration soil moisture streamflow forecasting remote sensing 1 introduction river flooding is one the most destructive natural hazards accounting for a

system catchment hydrologic models simulate the runoff generation i e either rainfall runoff or snowmelt runoff and the flow concentration and propagation processes within a catchment and its river

observed data either through batch calibration to address systematic errors using historical observations or data assimilation to address random errors using real time observations li et al 2016

streamflow forecasting models emerton et al 2016 pagano et al 2016 to optimize their performance hydrologic models tend to be calibrated against all available gauged streamflow data nevertheless it has been found that the models have reached their accuracy limit unless new types of observations are integrated loumagne et al 2001b thanks to recent advances in remote sensing techniques there is a great opportunity to introduce remotely sensed land surface state variables to further improve the model performance grimaldi et al 2016 li et al 2016 soil moisture is an important variable in catchment hydrologic processes legates et al 2011 it is used as an indicator of catchment wetness which is an essential initial condition for hydrologic models it has been generally found that a wet catchment has a higher chance to lead to a high runoff ratio and thus more likely to lead to a high flow event indicating a high risk of flooding li et al 2014 however the availability of ground based soil moisture monitoring sites is limited furthermore these are point measurements only representing a small spatial range romano 2014 remote sensing techniques provide a tool to obtain spatially distributed near surface soil moisture information from space consequently they have attracted increased interest by hydrologic communities liu et al 2012 remotely sensed soil moisture has been widely integrated into soil moisture accounting or land surface models to improve near surface and or root zone soil moisture simulation meanwhile the hydrologic communities have also introduced remotely sensed soil moisture for streamflow prediction li et al 2016 among those soil moisture constrained streamflow prediction studies there has been a major effort on investigating the impact of soil moisture data assimilation on forecasting hindcasting skills goodrich et al 1994 ottlé and vidal madjar 1994 loumagne et al 2001a b pauwels et al 2001 quesney et al 2001 pauwels et al 2002 aubert et

2016 rajib et al 2016 kundu et al 2017 lópez lópez et al 2017 in situ soil moisture data were introduced for lumped hydrologic model calibration showing that adding soil moisture information additional to streamflow observations can improve the robustness of the model parameter estimation which has the potential to lead to more accurate streamflow forecasts zhang et al 2015 thorstensen et al 2016 shahrban 2017 however when remotely sensed soil moisture data were used it was found to be hard to achieve a consistent improvement in streamflow prediction parajka et al 2006 2009 along with the development of earth observation techniques the temporal coverage of remotely sensed soil moisture products has been significantly improved e g with satellite revisit improved from 35 days in the synthetic aperture radar on european remote sensing satellites sar ers to 1 3 days in the advanced scatterometer ascat the soil moisture ocean salinity smos and the soil moisture active passive smap missions this provides a potential to further improve the batch calibration recent related studies have been focused on implementing these advanced remotely sensed soil moisture products to calibrate a water resources accounting model kunnath poovakka et al 2016 distributed hydrologic models sutanudjaja et al 2014 silvestro et al 2015 lópez lópez et al 2017 and semi distributed hydrologic models rajib et al 2016 kundu et al 2017 certain levels of improvement on streamflow simulations were achieved by calibrating hydrologic models against remotely sensed soil moisture data compared with uncalibrated models kunnath poovakka et al 2016 kundu et al 2017 lópez lópez et al 2017 however streamflow estimates still tended to be better when the model was calibrated against streamflow measurements lópez lópez et al 2017 therefore as kundu et al 2017 pointed out at the end of their article there is a need to test the potential of using remotely sensed soil moisture data together with streamflow measurements for batch calibration of hydrologic models a couple of studies have investigated soil moisture streamflow joint calibration schemes sutanudjaja et al 2014 silvestro et al 2015 rajib et al 2016 and it has been found that introducing soil moisture information in addition to streamflow measurements can address the equifinality issues and thus lead to benefits in streamflow prediction while these findings are encouraging there has not been a study that investigated the impact of using soil moisture streamflow joint calibration on streamflow prediction at ungauged locations which is a practical question faced by operational hydrologic community from the practical perspective it is not always the case that a catchment has either no flow gauges or a dense gauge network there are many catchments with a limited number of flow gauges available for model calibration e g http www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html a typical example is that only one gauge at the outlet of a catchment can be used for calibration while there is a practical demand to predict streamflow at certain internal locations in that case the forecasting hindcasting skill in internal sub catchments are normally not satisfactory remote sensing techniques provide spatially distributed information of soil moisture however whether including remotely sensed soil moisture data in addition to the limited number of flow gauges for model calibration can benefit forecasting at the ungauged internal locations has not been fully addressed which is the main research question for this study to test the added value of including remotely sensed soil moisture for batch calibration a joint calibration scheme using remotely sensed soil moisture and gauged streamflow data was compared with a traditional streamflow only calibration scheme through lumped and semi distributed model setups the model performance was evaluated at both gauged gauges used for calibration and ungauged gauges not used for calibration locations for the calibration period as well as for an independent validation period in a hindcasting mode i e with observed forcing data 2 catchments and data two catchments in southeast australia were used for this study fig 1 the first is the clarence river catchment upstream of lilydale the catchment is mainly covered by eucalyptus forest with the main stream draining from northwest to southeast with a quick flow propagation 1 day the second is the condamine river catchment upstream of chinchilla which adjoins the clarence the upstream area is mainly covered by eucalyptus forest while the downstream area is mainly covered by rainfed cropping farm and pasture with the main stream draining from southeast to northwest with a slow flow propagation 4 6 days the two catchments are geographically close to each other but the hydrologic features are quite different the vegetation density is relatively high in the clarence and low in the condamine impacting the quality of remotely sensed soil moisture products the relatively short flow response time in the clarence relative to the condamine may affect the impact of initial catchment wetness on the streamflow forecasts these different features make the two catchments a good comparative case study the two catchments were delineated into sub catchments fig 1 using the australian hydrological geospatial fabric http www bom gov au water geofabric specifically this was done in two major steps choose the forecasting locations and set them to be the outlets of sub catchments and delineate the boundary of each sub catchment by tracking the contributing area upstream through the river network each forecasting location was manually chosen based on two criteria 1 there is a flow gauge available and 2 its related sub catchment is large enough to cover at least one smos pixel e g with an area of over 625 km2 data used in this study include potential evapotranspiration pet gauged precipitation gauged streamflow remotely sensed near surface soil moisture and remotely sensed fractional vegetation cover fc for january 2010 june 2014 the pet precipitation and fc were used as model inputs while the streamflow and soil moisture data were used for model calibration and or validation the monthly gridded australian water availability project awap pet dataset raupach et al 2009 raupach et al 2012 which was estimated from observed solar radiation using the method developed by priestley and taylor 1972 was used in this study the sub catchment pet values were extracted according to the sub catchment boundaries described in section 3 and converted into hourly records with the assumption that it is constant within each month the variability of pet within a month was ignored in this study nevertheless it has been noted that the variation in pet has much less impact on streamflow than rainfall in rainfall runoff modelling samain and pauwels 2013 bennett et al 2014 for this reason the use of the monthly awap pet for hourly streamflow forecasting has been widely implemented in australia pagano et al 2011a li et al 2014 2015 bennett et al 2016 gauged precipitation data were quality controlled against awap daily rainfall based on a two step approach robertson et al 2015 including inconsistent data anomalously high or low flows censoring based on double mass plots and low quality gauge removal according to the correlation with awap daily precipitation the quality controlled hourly rainfall was then spatially interpolated to sub catchments from rain gauges within a 10 km range of each entire catchment using an inverse distance weighted method six streamflow gauges from the clarence and five from the condamine were selected as calibration validation locations detailed in section 3 3 according to the continuity of the streamflow data and needs for the sub catchment delineation hourly streamflow data of the clarence and condamine basins were obtained from the new south wales department of primary industries water http www water nsw gov au and the queensland department of natural resources and mines https water monitoring information qld gov au respectively soil moisture was extracted from the smos level 3 product reanalysis version provided by the centre aval de traitement des données smos catds which is a grid based dataset with an ascending pass at about 6 am and a descending pass at about 6 pm local time the approximate 43 km resolution data have been posted onto a grid size of about 25 km with a temporal revisit of 1 3 days the soil moisture data were extracted according to the sub catchment boundaries and then averaged into each sub catchment by area weighting average the monthly fc was retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro with a resolution of 500 m as the scale of the fc data is much smaller than the scale of the sub catchments the fc data were extracted by the sub catchment boundaries and then directly averaged for each sub catchment the fc was also assumed to be constant within each month 3 methodology 3 1 experiment design riverine flood forecasting can be performed using a lumped or distributed semi distributed catchment modelling system depending on the catchment size availability of streamflow gauges and rain gauge density in this study two calibration schemes were applied in three model setups for a total of six experiment scenarios table 1 the two calibration schemes were 1 a traditional calibration using gauged streamflow only and 2 a joint calibration using both streamflow and soil moisture data the three model setups were 1 a lumped model 2 a semi distributed model semi 1 with the assumption that only one streamflow gauge at each catchment outlet was available for model calibration and 3 a semi distributed model semi 2 with the assumption that all the streamflow gauges at the outlets of the sub catchments were available for calibration the catchment sub catchment boundaries are shown in fig 1 the pet fc and soil moisture were sampled into either a single value for each catchment for the lumped model or different values for the sub catchments for the semi 1 and semi 2 the precipitation was interpolated into the centroids of the sub catchments for semi 1 and semi 2 and then integrated into a single value for the lumped model by area weighted average according to the areas of the sub catchments for the semi 1 the same set of parameters was estimated for all sub catchments while all other internal sub catchments were assumed to be ungauged and the measurements there were only used for validation for the semi 2 each sub catchment was calibrated in sequence from upstream to downstream using the gauged streamflow at its outlet the streamflow and soil moisture data used for calibration were assumed to be accurate i e observational uncertainties were not considered 3 2 the hydrologic model gr models modèle du génie rural have been widely used by operational hydrologic forecasting communities for instance the australian bureau of meteorology incorporates the gr4h an hourly 4 parameter gr model as the core of their operational 7 day streamflow forecasting service http www bom gov au water 7daystreamflow one challenge of using remotely sensed near surface soil moisture data to constrain the gr4h is the different meaning of soil moisture between the model and the remote sensing data specifically like many other conceptual rainfall runoff models the gr4h parameterizes the catchment wetness into a single bulk soil water storage which is not directly comparable with remotely sensed near surface soil moisture to better accept remote sensing information loumagne et al 1996 reparameterized the soil water storage of the gr4j a daily version of gr4h into a two layer system namely the grhum in which a near surface soil moisture layer is embedded into the bulk soil moisture layer and the two layers have the same rainfall input francois et al 2003 improved the original grhum into a new version namely the grkal in which two independent near surface and root zone soil moisture layers are parameterized and the drainage from the near surface layer is used as the input for the root zone layer in this study an hourly version of the grkal was adopted to simulate the rainfall runoff and catchment routing processes fig 2 provides a schematic of the model the model can be viewed as two sub models 1 a two layer soil moisture accounting sub model and 2 a catchment routing sub model in the soil moisture accounting sub model the total precipitation pn is firstly split into infiltration ps and direct runoff pn ps ps entering into the near surface soil layer is then drained through a two layer soil system the actual total evapotranspiration et is calculated as the sum of the et from the near surface layer and the transpiration from the root zone layer the output of the near surface layer is used as the input for the root zone layer hydraulic exchange and the final output of the two layer system is the percolation from the root zone layer perc the perc is then added to pn ps as a total runoff pr which then enters the catchment routing sub model the catchment routing part of the grkal is essentially the same as that of the gr4h i e it incorporates two unit hydrographs and one nonlinear routing storage to represent the time delay caused by the runoff concentration process specifically pr is divided into two parts with a fixed ratio 10 of pr is routed through a single unit hydrograph uh2 while 90 of pr is routed through a cascade of another unit hydrograph uh1 and a routing store r f nominally represents underground water exchanges between the modelled catchment and the adjacent catchments details about the model were described by francois et al 2003 in the lumped model setup the grkal was used as a standalone tool to simulate the rainfall runoff the overland flow routing and the river channel routing processes in the semi distributed model setups the semi 1 and semi 2 the grkal was used to simulate the hydrologic processes in each sub catchment and the output of the grkal from each sub catchment was entered into a linear muskingum river model and routed to the outlet of the entire catchment the muskingum model simplifies the shallow water equations based on a finite difference approximation it parameterizes the water storage in the flow wave and river network through a triangular wedge and rectangular prism details about the muskingum model were described by nash 1959 and cunge 1969 3 3 the calibration approach the streamflow only calibration was designed according to the strategy implemented in the operational 7 day streamflow forecasting service by australian bureau of meteorology the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona algorithm sce ua duan et al 1992 which is currently used for the 7 day streamflow forecasting was used to find the globally optimal parameter set for the objective function it has been a tradition in the course of developing the forecasting system in australia to use an unweighted average of several metrics sensitive to different range of flows e g high flows low flows mid range flows and bias pagano et al 2011b bennett et al 2014 li et al 2015 bennett et al 2016 this is because the use of a hybrid objective can strength its ability to result in a more robust model to better simulate the whole range of flows which is also important in the catchments investigated in this paper e g drought and floods are frequent in the condamine and can happen during the same year therefore the objective function chosen in this study eq 1 is expressed as an unweighted mean of two nash sutcliffe model efficiency scores of log transformed flows sensitive to low flows eq 2 and box cox transformed flows sensitive to mid range flows eq 3 a kling gupta efficiency coefficient score sensitive to high flows and variance eq 4 and a mean bias score eq 5 1 f q f log ns f boxns f kge f bias where 2 f log ns t 1 t c ln

sim 1 2 with q sim t and q obs t being streamflow simulations and observations at time t in the calibration period t c ν is the smallest non zero streamflow observation in t c r is the pearson correlation coefficient between q sim and q obs q sim t and q obs t are the box cox transformed streamflow which can be expressed as 6 q q 1 γ 1 γ where γ denotes a transformation parameter which was set to be 0 3 as suggested by li et al 2015 for the joint calibration scheme a joint objective function which is essentially a weighted average between the objective function for streamflow and the objective function for soil moisture was proposed in this study as 7 f jo int a f q 1 a f sm where a is a weighting coefficient and f sm is a single nash sutcliffe model efficiency score between the modelled s sim t and remotely sensed soil moisture s obs t as 8 f sm i 1 t c s sim t s obs t 2 i 1 t c s sim t s obs 2 a key point of the joint objective function is to define a so as to appropriately emphasize the importance of soil moisture information in the original grkal paper francois et al 2003 suggested to give a weight of 5 7 to streamflow when near surface soil moisture root zone soil moisture and streamflow were jointly used for model calibration with the justification that streamflow should account for a larger weight than soil moisture as the objective was streamflow forecasting nevertheless only near surface soil moisture data was used in this study and therefore it was not justified to adopt the weight suggested in that paper with the consideration of their suggestion a trial and error process was applied to analyze a suitable value of a values of 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 were tested resulting in minimum objective function values of 0 19 0 16 0 15 0 18 and 0 20 in the clarence and 0 36 0 31 0 27 0 29 and 0 33 in the condamine respectively for the semi 1 model setups therefore the value of 0 7 for a was chosen for this study as it exhibited the lowest objective function value in the lumped model setup only one lumped model parameter set was obtained through calibration in the semi 1 model setup described in table 1 as only the gauge at the catchment outlet was assumed to be available for calibration parameters were set to be spatially uniform for all sub catchments to reduce potential equifinality issues due to over parameterization except for the parameter l fig 2 representing the length of the two unit hydrographs as shown by li et al 2013 the natural response time of australian catchments can typically be formulated as a power function of the catchment area therefore the calibrated l was scaled by the square root of each sub catchment area to represent the natural concentration delay in the semi 2 model setup as all internal and outlet gauges were used for calibration the calibration was done from the upstream sub catchments to the downstream sub catchments and independent parameter sets were estimated for sub catchments 4 results the hourly hydrologic model was calibrated for all six scenarios specified in table 1 using the data from january 2010 to december 2012 with the first three months being a warm up period the calibrated parameter sets were then applied for model prediction in an independent validation period from january 2013 to june 2014 through a hindcasting mode the performance of the modelling system was evaluated in both the calibration and validation periods in terms of streamflow predictions two statistics including the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ns and f q defined in eq 1 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the streamflow predictions as shown in tables 2 5 more specifically tables 2 and 3 list ns and f q in the clarence catchment for the calibration and validation periods respectively tables 4 and 5 show the same results for the condamine catchment both statistics were calculated for the continuous hourly streamflow predictions within the whole calibration validation period the ns was used to evaluate the predictive skill with an emphasis on high flows while f q was used to demonstrate the model performance in accordance with the objective function used for calibration higher ns and lower f q values indicate a better model prediction 4 1 comparison among models for the lumped model setup the entire catchment clarence condamine was assumed to be one bucket and the streamflow was only simulated at the catchment outlet lilydale chinchilla therefore the evaluation statistics ns and f q were not calculated at the internal locations for the lumped modelling scenarios according to tables 2 5 the lumped model resulted in a much lower ns and higher f q values compared with semi distributed models in both catchments and both the calibration and validation periods for instance the q cali for the lumped model gave a ns f q of 0 71 0 29 at lilydale and 0 54 0 49 at chinchilla during the calibration period which were worse than the 0 83 0 14 and 0 70 0 27 obtained for the semi 1 at lilydale and chinchilla respectively this indicates that the lumped model is not suitable for such large catchments lumped systems are generally limited in representing the spatial distribution of forcing and parameters which can lead to unsatisfactory results for large catchments in the condamine the main river is long the catchment shape is narrow and the flow velocity is slow due to the relatively flat topography therefore the unit hydrograph type routing in the grkal is not suited to simulate the flow propagation in this river system for this reason the performance of the lumped model at chinchilla was even worse than that at lilydale according to the ns and f q values shown in tables 2 5 the semi distributed model calibrated against all internal and outlet gauges semi 2 generally outperformed the model calibrated against only the outlet gauge semi 1 the difference between the semi 1 and semi 2 was relatively slight at the catchment outlets e g the differences in ns f q between the two systems were 0 02 0 01 at lilydale and 0 07 0 07 at chinchilla respectively during the calibration period in q cali this is because both semi distributed models employ distributed forcing and model structures while the only difference being that the parameters were distributed in space in the semi 2 but set to be uniform in the semi 1 however the performance differences were much more obvious at internal locations this is expected as the internal sub catchments were not calibrated against the internal gauges in the semi 1 the relative strength of the three model setups did not change when soil moisture was included in the calibration i e the semi 2 still performed best with the ns between 0 65 and 0 82 and the f q between 0 11 and 0 30 while the lumped was still the worst with the ns between 0 48 and 0 68 and the f q between 0 29 and 0 55 however the impact of soil moisture on streamflow prediction varied among different modelling settings in the lumped and semi 2 scenarios the joint calibration scheme generally degraded the ns and f q during the calibration periods compared with the traditional streamflow calibration scheme with a ns decrease between 0 01 and 0 08 and a f q increase between 0 and 0 07 as shown in tables 2 5 nevertheless a certain level of improvement was seen in the validation period at some of the gauges more consistent improvement by using soil moisture information was obtained in the semi 1 in both the calibration and validation periods it should be noted that in the semi 1 all the internal sites were assumed to be ungauged while in the lumped and semi 2 setups all evaluations were conducted at gauged locations 4 2 impact of soil moisture at gauged locations the predictions at ungauged locations are highlighted by the boxes in tables 2 5 and thus the gauged examples are those outside the boxes the ns and f q values summarized in tables 2 5 indicate a consistent degradation in streamflow caused by using soil moisture data at gauged locations during the calibration period this is also illustrated in fig 3 a and c during the events in the calibration period the joint calibration led to worse predictions compared with the streamflow calibration at both lilydale and chinhilla this is reasonable as minimizing error in streamflow was expected to lead to optimal streamflow estimation while introducing additional soil moisture information sacrificed the optimality of the streamflow simulation to reduce errors in the soil moisture nevertheless although the degradation was consistent in the calibration period it is encouraging to find the forecasts were improved this can be explained as an equifinality issue in streamflow optimization different parameter sets can lead to similar performance for streamflow but with different results for other variables such as near surface soil moisture sutanudjaja et al 2014 silvestro et al 2015 therefore minimizing errors from both near surface soil moisture and streamflow has the potential to lead to more robust parameter sets which improve the modelled soil moisture without impeding streamflow predictability significantly in the calibration period the improved robustness then has the potential to result in more accurate streamflow future forecasts this was to a certain extent shown in this case study considering all the gauges in the two catchments for the three model setups table 3 and 5 9 out of 15 gauged cases were improved in terms of ns while 10 out of 15 were improved in terms of f q by joint calibration in the independent validation period the events in the validation period at lilydale and chinchilla are shown in fig 3 b and d the improvement was observed during the first peak flow at lilydale while similarly during both flood peaks at chinchilla 4 3 impact of soil moisture at ungauged locations the predictions at ungauged locations are highlighted by the boxes in tables 2 5 contrary to the gauged locations streamflow predictions at ungauged locations were found to be more consistently improved by using soil moisture for the calibration specifically 4 locations out of 5 in the clarence and 3 locations out of 4 in the condamine exhibited a higher ns and a lower f q by joint calibration in both the calibration and validation periods this is also illustrated in fig 4 which shows that the joint calibration improved the prediction of some of the flood peaks in the calibration and validation events at paddys flat and tummaville the improvement was more obvious than in gauged locations this can be explained as follows when streamflow gauges are limited the spatially distributed soil moisture information becomes the only information for internal sub catchments introducing soil moisture into the model calibration essentially strengthens the model in predicting the spatial variability of hydrologic variables e g soil moisture and streamflow 5 discussion 5 1 impact of sub catchment locations the impact at the ungauged sub catchments caused by introducing soil moisture information was found to vary with the location of the sub catchments for instance the difference in ns between the streamflow calibration and the joint calibration was relatively small at the downstream locations e g jackadgery in the clarence and loudouns bridge in the condamine while the differences tended to be larger at the upstream and tributary locations e g paddys flat drake broadmeadows and nymboida in the clarence as well as warwick tummaville and fairview in the condamine a similar pattern was also found in f q values this can be explained by the fact that the downstream locations are closer to the calibration gauge and thus more constrained by the streamflow data the upstream and tributary sub catchments compensated each other to optimize the flow prediction at the outlet being more sensitive to the spatial variability brought by the soil moisture information this was extremely obvious at warwick whose ns f q was improved from 0 49 0 46 to 0 60 0 37 in the calibration period and 0 45 0 56 to 0 55 0 44 in the validation period as it was the most distant sub catchment to chinchilla in a long river system it should be pointed out that not all upstream and tributary sub catchments were improved by using soil moisture e g degradations were found at nymboida and fairview in both the calibration and validation periods nevertheless whether the predictions were improved or not the difference impact of soil moisture tended to be stronger at the upstream and tributary sub catchments rather than at the downstream sub catchments 5 2 significance of the improvement as discussed before including soil moisture information into model calibration reduced the possible equifinality in global optimization this brought benefits in two aspects firstly although minimizing errors in soil moisture simulation degraded the performance in streamflow prediction the improved robustness in the calibration was found to exhibit the potential to improve streamflow predictions during an independent validation period implying a possibility to improve future forecasts secondly remotely sensed soil moisture brought useful spatial information to reduce the equifinality issue caused by the lack of streamflow gauges and thus led to improvements in streamflow predictions at ungauged locations however the improvements in the gauged and ungauged locations were not consistent in all sub catchments according to the results shown in this study to check the significance of such improvements hypothesis student t tests were conducted for four groups of paired samples 1 pairs of ns at ungauged locations from the streamflow calibration and joint calibration schemes within the boxes in tables 2 5 2 pairs of f q at ungauged locations from the two calibration schemes 3 pairs of ns at gauged locations from the two calibration schemes but just in the independent validation period outside the boxes in tables 3 and 5 and 4 pairs of f q at gauged locations from the two calibration schemes in the independent validation period the key procedure to conduct the hypothesis test is summarized as follows null hypothesis the mean difference is assumed to be equal to or smaller than zero i e including soil moisture for calibration does not significantly improve the performance statistics ns or f q alternative hypothesis the mean difference is greater than zero i e including soil moisture for calibration significantly improves the performance statistics calculate sample differences d i ns ns i jo int cali ns i q cali or d i f q f q i jo int cali f q i q cali calculate the mean of the sample differences d calculate the standard deviation of the sample differences σ 1 n i 1 n d i d 2 where n is the sample size 15 for gauged cases and 18 for ungauged cases calculate the test statistic t d 0 σ n calculate the probability p of the test statistic based on the student t distribution test the null hypothesis by comparing p with target significance degree fig 5 compares the distribution of the ns and f q for the streamflow calibration and joint calibration schemes while fig 6 shows the histograms of the sample difference distribution it can be inferred that the improvement at ungauged locations brought by using soil moisture information is relatively more notable while the improvement at gauged locations brought by the soil moisture in the validation period is relatively less notable the results from the hypothesis tests are summarized in table 6 the p values probability of the test statistics for ungauged locations were 0 0077 0 01 for ns and 0 0004 0 01 for f q which indicate that the null hypothesis should be rejected in terms of both ns and f q the improvement was significant at both 0 05 and 0 01 significance degrees the p values for gauged locations were 0 0953 0 05 for ns and 0 0637 0 05 for f q which imply that the improvement was not significant with a significance degree of 0 05 according to the tests it can be concluded that introducing remotely sensed soil moisture data in addition to the gauged streamflow for hydrologic model calibration brought statistically significant improvement to streamflow prediction at ungauged locations whilst including soil moisture during calibration degraded the streamflow prediction at gauged locations to a slight extent there was a possibility to improve the future forecasts at those gauged locations due to the more robust model parameter sets however the improvements obtained in this particular case were not statistically significant this should be further explored in other catchments in the future 5 3 limitations in addressing uncertainties the joint calibration approach proposed in this study exhibited a stronger capability to address systematic errors in parameters compared with the traditional streamflow only calibration approach nevertheless other sources of uncertainties from inputs initial conditions and model structure were not addressed in this study for instance in this case study the sub catchment rainfall data were spatially interpolated from gauged rainfall which is prone to instrumental and interpolation uncertainties the uncertainty related to the interpolation process can be significant when the topography is complex and the rain gauges are sparse although the impact of pet was found to be much less than the rainfall samain and pauwels 2013 bennett et al 2014 the use of monthly interpolated gridded pet does ignore its variability within each month the model structure and parameter uncertainties can also be considerable due to the high conceptualization in the hydrologic models e g the grkal and linear muskingum routing procedure used in this study these uncertainties could potentially be further addressed through real time updating by assimilating soil moisture and or streamflow measurements wanders et al 2014b alvarez garreton et al 2015 lievens et al 2015 therefore it would be necessary to investigate how remotely sensed soil moisture can benefit the hydrologic prediction through an integrated calibration and real time data assimilation system a better estimation of the sources of uncertainties e g through error decomposition approaches li et al 2014 mazrooei et al 2015 could also be beneficial for understanding the potential of various uncertainty reduction approaches e g batch calibration and data assimilation in operational forecasting forecasted rainfall and pet need to be used to force the model which can bring additional uncertainties and affect the performance of the joint calibration approach examined in this study therefore it is necessary to extend this study to operational streamflow forecasting scenarios with the consideration of forecasted forcing uncertainties 6 conclusions this paper presented a joint calibration scheme using gauged streamflow and smos near surface soil moisture the joint calibration scheme was compared with a traditional streamflow only calibration scheme in three model setups i e a lumped model a semi distributed model with only the gauge at the outlet available and a semi distributed model with multiple gauges available it was found that semi distributed models are more suitable than lumped models in representing forcing and parameter spatial variability so as to produce more accurate streamflow predictions at the catchment outlets the increase of the streamflow gauge availability to a large extent improved the performance of the semi distributed model regardless of using soil moisture data for calibration however the impact of the soil moisture varied among different model setups a slight degradation in streamflow simulation was generally found at the calibration locations during the calibration period when soil moisture was used for calibration which is expected however improvements were also obtained in the independent validation period for some sub catchments e g 9 out of 15 gauged cases were improved while 5 cases were degraded slightly in terms of the ns although the improvement did not pass the overall significance test it unveiled a potential to improve future forecasts through the identification of more robust parameter sets by including soil moisture information in the calibration future work can be dedicated to employ multiple sources of remotely sensed soil moisture data to further address this issue a more consistent improvement brought by using soil moisture data was identified at ungauged sub catchments this finding was consistent with some previous studies in which data assimilation approaches was applied e g wanders et al 2014a found that internal locations were improved by integrating soil moisture into a process based model using the ensemble kalman filter however there has not been a study before to investigate the potential to improve ungauged internal locations when batch calibration is used it should also be noted that the physical linkage between soil moisture and streamflow is typically strong in process based models and it make sense to detect improvements in streamflow estimation when soil moisture simulation is improved in those models it is encouraging to find similar improvements at ungauged locations through batch calibration in a conceptual hydrologic model and the improvement passed the statistical significance test furthermore it was also found that the improvement was stronger at upstream and tributary sub catchments than the downstream locations the usefulness of soil moisture data for model calibration needs to be investigated under operational forecasting scenarios in future work it would also be beneficial to use soil moisture for both batch calibration and data assimilation in an integrated system to maximize the value brought by soil moisture information

7532,the skill of hydrologic models such as those used in operational flood prediction is currently restricted by the availability of flow gauges and by the quality of the streamflow data used for calibration the increased availability of remote sensing products provides the opportunity to further improve the model forecasting skill a joint calibration scheme using streamflow measurements and remote sensing derived soil moisture values was examined and compared with a streamflow only calibration scheme the efficacy of the two calibration schemes was tested in three modelling setups 1 a lumped model 2 a semi distributed model with only the outlet gauge available for calibration and 3 a semi distributed model with multiple gauges available for calibration the joint calibration scheme was found to slightly degrade the streamflow prediction at gauged sites during the calibration period compared with streamflow only calibration but improvement was found at the same gauged sites during the independent validation period a more consistent and statistically significant improvement was achieved at gauged sites not used in the calibration due to the spatial information introduced by the remotely sensed soil moisture data it was also found that the impact of using soil moisture for calibration tended to be stronger at the upstream and tributary sub catchments than at the downstream sub catchments keywords calibration soil moisture streamflow forecasting remote sensing 1 introduction river flooding is one the most destructive natural hazards accounting for a significant proportion of disaster related fatalities economic losses and ecological damage pagano et al 2014 haynes et al 2016 a timely accurate and reliable flood warning typically achieved through an event based or continuous streamflow forecasting system is critical for inundation analysis emergency preparedness and response sene 2008 as a core component of a typical streamflow forecasting system catchment hydrologic models simulate the runoff generation i e either rainfall runoff or snowmelt runoff and the flow concentration and propagation processes within a catchment and its river network while these models can be empirical conceptual or process based implemented in a lumped or distributed manner they all suffer from uncertainties caused by forcing data model physics initial condition quantification and parameter estimation to reduce these uncertainties and to meet the accuracy requirement of the streamflow forecasting application these models are typically constrained by observed data either through batch calibration to address systematic errors using historical observations or data assimilation to address random errors using real time observations li et al 2016 although various data assimilation algorithms have been proposed and implemented batch calibration is still an important and widely used tool due to the highly conceptualized parameterizations in many streamflow forecasting models emerton et al 2016 pagano et al 2016 to optimize their performance hydrologic models tend to be calibrated against all available gauged streamflow data nevertheless it has been found that the models have reached their accuracy limit unless new types of observations are integrated loumagne et al 2001b thanks to recent advances in remote sensing techniques there is a great opportunity to introduce remotely sensed land surface state variables to further improve the model performance grimaldi et al 2016 li et al 2016 soil moisture is an important variable in catchment hydrologic processes legates et al 2011 it is used as an indicator of catchment wetness which is an essential initial condition for hydrologic models it has been generally found that a wet catchment has a higher chance to lead to a high runoff ratio and thus more likely to lead to a high flow event indicating a high risk of flooding li et al 2014 however the availability of ground based soil moisture monitoring sites is limited furthermore these are point measurements only representing a small spatial range romano 2014 remote sensing techniques provide a tool to obtain spatially distributed near surface soil moisture information from space consequently they have attracted increased interest by hydrologic communities liu et al 2012 remotely sensed soil moisture has been widely integrated into soil moisture accounting or land surface models to improve near surface and or root zone soil moisture simulation meanwhile the hydrologic communities have also introduced remotely sensed soil moisture for streamflow prediction li et al 2016 among those soil moisture constrained streamflow prediction studies there has been a major effort on investigating the impact of soil moisture data assimilation on forecasting hindcasting skills goodrich et al 1994 ottlé and vidal madjar 1994 loumagne et al 2001a b pauwels et al 2001 quesney et al 2001 pauwels et al 2002 aubert et

uncalibrated models kunnath poovakka et al 2016 kundu et al 2017 lópez lópez et al 2017 however streamflow estimates still tended to be better when the model was calibrated against streamflow measurements lópez lópez et al 2017 therefore as kundu et al 2017 pointed out at the end of their article there is a need to test the potential of using remotely sensed soil moisture data together with streamflow measurements for batch calibration of hydrologic models a couple of studies have investigated soil moisture streamflow joint calibration schemes sutanudjaja et al 2014 silvestro et al 2015 rajib et al 2016 and it has been found that introducing soil moisture information in addition to streamflow measurements can address the equifinality issues and thus lead to benefits in streamflow prediction while these findings are encouraging there has not been a study that investigated the impact of using soil moisture streamflow joint calibration on streamflow prediction at ungauged locations which is a practical question faced by operational hydrologic community from the practical perspective it is not always the case that a catchment has either no flow gauges or a dense gauge network there are many catchments with a limited number of flow gauges available for model calibration e g http www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html a typical example is that only one gauge at the outlet of a catchment can be used for calibration while there is a practical demand to predict streamflow at certain internal locations in that case the forecasting hindcasting skill in internal sub catchments are normally not satisfactory remote sensing techniques provide spatially distributed information of soil moisture however whether including remotely sensed soil moisture data in addition to the limited number of flow gauges for model calibration can benefit forecasting at the ungauged internal locations has not been fully addressed which is the main research question for this study to test the added value of including remotely sensed soil moisture for batch calibration a joint calibration scheme using remotely sensed soil moisture and gauged streamflow data was compared with a traditional streamflow only calibration scheme through lumped and semi distributed model setups the model performance was evaluated at both gauged gauges used for calibration and ungauged gauges not used for calibration locations for the calibration period as well as for an independent validation period in a hindcasting mode i e with observed forcing data 2 catchments and data two catchments in southeast australia were used for this study fig 1 the first is the clarence river catchment upstream of lilydale the catchment is mainly covered by eucalyptus forest with the main stream draining from northwest to southeast with a quick flow propagation 1 day the second is the condamine river catchment upstream of chinchilla which adjoins the clarence the upstream area is mainly covered by eucalyptus forest while the downstream area is mainly covered by rainfed cropping farm and pasture with the main stream draining from southeast to northwest with a slow flow propagation 4 6 days the two catchments are geographically close to each other but the hydrologic features are quite different the vegetation density is relatively high in the clarence and low in the condamine impacting the quality of remotely sensed soil moisture products the relatively short flow response time in the clarence relative to the condamine may affect the impact of initial catchment wetness on the streamflow forecasts these different features make the two catchments a good comparative case study the two catchments were delineated into sub catchments fig 1 using the australian hydrological geospatial fabric http www bom gov au water geofabric specifically this was done in two major steps choose the forecasting locations and set them to be the outlets of sub catchments and delineate the boundary of each sub catchment by tracking the contributing area upstream through the river network each forecasting location was manually chosen based on two criteria 1 there is a flow gauge available and 2 its related sub catchment is large enough to cover at least one smos pixel e g with an area of over 625 km2 data used in this study include potential evapotranspiration pet gauged precipitation gauged streamflow remotely sensed near surface soil moisture and remotely sensed fractional vegetation cover fc for january 2010 june 2014 the pet precipitation and fc were used as model inputs while the streamflow and soil moisture data were used for model calibration and or validation the monthly gridded australian water availability project awap pet dataset raupach et al 2009 raupach et al 2012 which was estimated from observed solar radiation using the method developed by priestley and taylor 1972 was used in this study the sub catchment pet values were extracted according to the sub catchment boundaries described in section 3 and converted into hourly records with the assumption that it is constant within each month the variability of pet within a month was ignored in this study nevertheless it has been noted that the variation in pet has much less impact on streamflow than rainfall in rainfall runoff modelling samain and pauwels 2013 bennett et al 2014 for this reason the use of the monthly awap pet for hourly streamflow forecasting has been widely implemented in australia pagano et al 2011a li et al 2014 2015 bennett et al 2016 gauged precipitation data were quality controlled against awap daily rainfall based on a two step approach robertson et al 2015 including inconsistent data anomalously high or low flows censoring based on double mass plots and low quality gauge removal according to the correlation with awap daily precipitation the quality controlled hourly rainfall was then spatially interpolated to sub catchments from rain gauges within a 10 km range of each entire catchment using an inverse distance weighted method six streamflow gauges from the clarence and five from the condamine were selected as calibration validation locations detailed in section 3 3 according to the continuity of the streamflow data and needs for the sub catchment delineation hourly streamflow data of the clarence and condamine basins were obtained from the new south wales department of primary industries water http www water nsw gov au and the queensland department of natural resources and mines https water monitoring information qld gov au respectively soil moisture was extracted from the smos level 3 product reanalysis version provided by the centre aval de traitement des données smos catds which is a grid based dataset with an ascending pass at about 6 am and a descending pass at about 6 pm local time the approximate 43 km resolution data have been posted onto a grid size of about 25 km with a temporal revisit of 1 3 days the soil moisture data were extracted according to the sub catchment boundaries and then averaged into each sub catchment by area weighting average the monthly fc was retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro with a resolution of 500 m as the scale of the fc data is much smaller than the scale of the sub catchments the fc data were extracted by the sub catchment boundaries and then directly averaged for each sub catchment the fc was also assumed to be constant within each month 3 methodology 3 1 experiment design riverine flood forecasting can be performed using a lumped or distributed semi distributed catchment modelling system depending on the catchment size availability of streamflow gauges and rain gauge density in this study two calibration schemes were applied in three model setups for a total of six experiment scenarios table 1 the two calibration schemes were 1 a traditional calibration using gauged streamflow only and 2 a joint calibration using both streamflow and soil moisture data the three model setups were 1 a lumped model 2 a semi distributed model semi 1 with the assumption that only one streamflow gauge at each catchment outlet was available for model calibration and 3 a semi distributed model semi 2 with the assumption that all the streamflow gauges at the outlets of the sub catchments were available for calibration the catchment sub catchment boundaries are shown in fig 1 the pet fc and soil moisture were sampled into either a single value for each catchment for the lumped model or different values for the sub catchments for the semi 1 and semi 2 the precipitation was interpolated into the centroids of the sub catchments for semi 1 and semi 2 and then integrated into a single value for the lumped model by area weighted average according to the areas of the sub catchments for the semi 1 the same set of parameters was estimated for all sub catchments while all other internal sub catchments were assumed to be ungauged and the measurements there were only used for validation for the semi 2 each sub catchment was calibrated in sequence from upstream to downstream using the gauged streamflow at its outlet the streamflow and soil moisture data used for calibration were assumed to be accurate i e observational uncertainties were not considered 3 2 the hydrologic model gr models modèle du génie rural have been widely used by operational hydrologic forecasting communities for instance the australian bureau of meteorology incorporates the gr4h an hourly 4 parameter gr model as the core of their operational 7 day streamflow forecasting service http www bom gov au water 7daystreamflow one challenge of using remotely sensed near surface soil moisture data to constrain the gr4h is the different meaning of soil moisture between the model and the remote sensing data specifically like many other conceptual rainfall runoff models the gr4h parameterizes the catchment wetness into a single bulk soil water storage which is not directly comparable with remotely sensed near surface soil moisture to better accept remote sensing information loumagne et al 1996 reparameterized the soil water storage of the gr4j a daily version of gr4h into a two layer system namely the grhum in which a near surface soil moisture layer is embedded into the bulk soil moisture layer and the two layers have the same rainfall input francois et al 2003 improved the original grhum into a new version namely the grkal in which two independent near surface and root zone soil moisture layers are parameterized and the drainage from the near surface layer is used as the input for the root zone layer in this study an hourly version of the grkal was adopted to simulate the rainfall runoff and catchment routing processes fig 2 provides a schematic of the model the model can be viewed as two sub models 1 a two layer soil moisture accounting sub model and 2 a catchment routing sub model in the soil moisture accounting sub model the total precipitation pn is firstly split into infiltration ps and direct runoff pn ps ps entering into the near surface soil layer is then drained through a two layer soil system the actual total evapotranspiration et is calculated as the sum of the et from the near surface layer and the transpiration from the root zone layer the output of the near surface layer is used as the input for the root zone layer hydraulic exchange and the final output of the two layer system is the percolation from the root zone layer perc the perc is then added to pn ps as a total runoff pr which then enters the catchment routing sub model the catchment routing part of the grkal is essentially the same as that of the gr4h i e it incorporates two unit hydrographs and one nonlinear routing storage to represent the time delay caused by the runoff concentration process specifically pr is divided into two parts with a fixed ratio 10 of pr is routed through a single unit hydrograph uh2 while 90 of pr is routed through a cascade of another unit hydrograph uh1 and a routing store r f nominally represents underground water exchanges between the modelled catchment and the adjacent catchments details about the model were described by francois et al 2003 in the lumped model setup the grkal was used as a standalone tool to simulate the rainfall runoff the overland flow routing and the river channel routing processes in the semi distributed model setups the semi 1 and semi 2 the grkal was used to simulate the hydrologic processes in each sub catchment and the output of the grkal from each sub catchment was entered into a linear muskingum river model and routed to the outlet of the entire catchment the muskingum model simplifies the shallow water equations based on a finite difference approximation it parameterizes the water storage in the flow wave and river network through a triangular wedge and rectangular prism details about the muskingum model were described by nash 1959 and cunge 1969 3 3 the calibration approach the streamflow only calibration was designed according to the strategy implemented in the operational 7 day streamflow forecasting service by australian bureau of meteorology the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona algorithm sce ua duan et al 1992 which is currently used for the 7 day streamflow forecasting was used to find the globally optimal parameter set for the objective function it has been a tradition in the course of developing the forecasting system in australia to use an unweighted average of several metrics sensitive to different range of flows e g high flows low flows mid range flows and bias pagano et al 2011b bennett et al 2014 li et al 2015 bennett et al 2016 this is because the use of a hybrid objective can strength its ability to result in a more robust model to better simulate the whole range of flows which is also important in the catchments investigated in this paper e g drought and floods are frequent in the condamine and can happen during the same year therefore the objective function chosen in this study eq 1 is expressed as an unweighted mean of two nash sutcliffe model efficiency scores of log transformed flows sensitive to low flows eq 2 and box cox transformed flows sensitive to mid range flows eq 3 a kling gupta efficiency coefficient score sensitive to high flows and variance eq 4 and a mean bias score eq 5 1 f q f log ns f boxns f kge f bias where 2 f log ns t 1 t c ln

sim 1 2 with q sim t and q obs t being streamflow simulations and observations at time t in the calibration period t c ν is the smallest non zero streamflow observation in t c r is the pearson correlation coefficient between q sim and q obs q sim t and q obs t are the box cox transformed streamflow which can be expressed as 6 q q 1 γ 1 γ where γ denotes a transformation parameter which was set to be 0 3 as suggested by li et al 2015 for the joint calibration scheme a joint objective function which is essentially a weighted average between the objective function for streamflow and the objective function for soil moisture was proposed in this study as 7 f jo int a f q 1 a f sm where a is a weighting coefficient and f sm is a single nash sutcliffe model efficiency score between the modelled s sim t and remotely sensed soil moisture s obs t as 8 f sm i 1 t c s sim t s obs t 2 i 1 t c s sim t s obs 2 a key point of the joint objective function is to define a so as to appropriately emphasize the importance of soil moisture information in the original grkal paper francois et al 2003 suggested to give a weight of 5 7 to streamflow when near surface soil moisture root zone soil moisture and streamflow were jointly used for model calibration with the justification that streamflow should account for a larger weight than soil moisture as the objective was streamflow forecasting nevertheless only near surface soil moisture data was used in this study and therefore it was not justified to adopt the weight suggested in that paper with the consideration of their suggestion a trial and error process was applied to analyze a suitable value of a values of 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 were tested resulting in minimum objective function values of 0 19 0 16 0 15 0 18 and 0 20 in the clarence and 0 36 0 31 0 27 0 29 and 0 33 in the condamine respectively for the semi 1 model setups therefore the value of 0 7 for a was chosen for this study as it exhibited the lowest objective function value in the lumped model setup only one lumped model parameter set was obtained through calibration in the semi 1 model setup described in table 1 as only the gauge at the catchment outlet was assumed to be available for calibration parameters were set to be spatially uniform for all sub catchments to reduce potential equifinality issues due to over parameterization except for the parameter l fig 2 representing the length of the two unit hydrographs as shown by li et al 2013 the natural response time of australian catchments can typically be formulated as a power function of the catchment area therefore the calibrated l was scaled by the square root of each sub catchment area to represent the natural concentration delay in the semi 2 model setup as all internal and outlet gauges were used for calibration the calibration was done from the upstream sub catchments to the downstream sub catchments and independent parameter sets were estimated for sub catchments 4 results the hourly hydrologic model was calibrated for all six scenarios specified in table 1 using the data from january 2010 to december 2012 with the first three months being a warm up period the calibrated parameter sets were then applied for model prediction in an independent validation period from january 2013 to june 2014 through a hindcasting mode the performance of the modelling system was evaluated in both the calibration and validation periods in terms of streamflow predictions two statistics including the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ns and f q defined in eq 1 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the streamflow predictions as shown in tables 2 5 more specifically tables 2 and 3 list ns and f q in the clarence catchment for the calibration and validation periods respectively tables 4 and 5 show the same results for the condamine catchment both statistics were calculated for the continuous hourly streamflow predictions within the whole calibration validation period the ns was used to evaluate the predictive skill with an emphasis on high flows while f q was used to demonstrate the model performance in accordance with the objective function used for calibration higher ns and lower f q values indicate a better model prediction 4 1 comparison among models for the lumped model setup the entire catchment clarence condamine was assumed to be one bucket and the streamflow was only simulated at the catchment outlet lilydale chinchilla therefore the evaluation statistics ns and f q were not calculated at the internal locations for the lumped modelling scenarios according to tables 2 5 the lumped model resulted in a much lower ns and higher f q values compared with semi distributed models in both catchments and both the calibration and validation periods for instance the q cali for the lumped model gave a ns f q of 0 71 0 29 at lilydale and 0 54 0 49 at chinchilla during the calibration period which were worse than the 0 83 0 14 and 0 70 0 27 obtained for the semi 1 at lilydale and chinchilla respectively this indicates that the lumped model is not suitable for such large catchments lumped systems are generally limited in representing the spatial distribution of forcing and parameters which can lead to unsatisfactory results for large catchments in the condamine the main river is long the catchment shape is narrow and the flow velocity is slow due to the relatively flat topography therefore the unit hydrograph type routing in the grkal is not suited to simulate the flow propagation in this river system for this reason the performance of the lumped model at chinchilla was even worse than that at lilydale according to the ns and f q values shown in tables 2 5 the semi distributed model calibrated against all internal and outlet gauges semi 2 generally outperformed the model calibrated against only the outlet gauge semi 1 the difference between the semi 1 and semi 2 was relatively slight at the catchment outlets e g the differences in ns f q between the two systems were 0 02 0 01 at lilydale and 0 07 0 07 at chinchilla respectively during the calibration period in q cali this is because both semi distributed models employ distributed forcing and model structures while the only difference being that the parameters were distributed in space in the semi 2 but set to be uniform in the semi 1 however the performance differences were much more obvious at internal locations this is expected as the internal sub catchments were not calibrated against the internal gauges in the semi 1 the relative strength of the three model setups did not change when soil moisture was included in the calibration i e the semi 2 still performed best with the ns between 0 65 and 0 82 and the f q between 0 11 and 0 30 while the lumped was still the worst with the ns between 0 48 and 0 68 and the f q between 0 29 and 0 55 however the impact of soil moisture on streamflow prediction varied among different modelling settings in the lumped and semi 2 scenarios the joint calibration scheme generally degraded the ns and f q during the calibration periods compared with the traditional streamflow calibration scheme with a ns decrease between 0 01 and 0 08 and a f q increase between 0 and 0 07 as shown in tables 2 5 nevertheless a certain level of improvement was seen in the validation period at some of the gauges more consistent improvement by using soil moisture information was obtained in the semi 1 in both the calibration and validation periods it should be noted that in the semi 1 all the internal sites were assumed to be ungauged while in the lumped and semi 2 setups all evaluations were conducted at gauged locations 4 2 impact of soil moisture at gauged locations the predictions at ungauged locations are highlighted by the boxes in tables 2 5 and thus the gauged examples are those outside the boxes the ns and f q values summarized in tables 2 5 indicate a consistent degradation in streamflow caused by using soil moisture data at gauged locations during the calibration period this is also illustrated in fig 3 a and c during the events in the calibration period the joint calibration led to worse predictions compared with the streamflow calibration at both lilydale and chinhilla this is reasonable as minimizing error in streamflow was expected to lead to optimal streamflow estimation while introducing additional soil moisture information sacrificed the optimality of the streamflow simulation to reduce errors in the soil moisture nevertheless although the degradation was consistent in the calibration period it is encouraging to find the forecasts were improved this can be explained as an equifinality issue in streamflow optimization different parameter sets can lead to similar performance for streamflow but with different results for other variables such as near surface soil moisture sutanudjaja et al 2014 silvestro et al 2015 therefore minimizing errors from both near surface soil moisture and streamflow has the potential to lead to more robust parameter sets which improve the modelled soil moisture without impeding streamflow predictability significantly in the calibration period the improved robustness then has the potential to result in more accurate streamflow future forecasts this was to a certain extent shown in this case study considering all the gauges in the two catchments for the three model setups table 3 and 5 9 out of 15 gauged cases were improved in terms of ns while 10 out of 15 were improved in terms of f q by joint calibration in the independent validation period the events in the validation period at lilydale and chinchilla are shown in fig 3 b and d the improvement was observed during the first peak flow at lilydale while similarly during both flood peaks at chinchilla 4 3 impact of soil moisture at ungauged locations the predictions at ungauged locations are highlighted by the boxes in tables 2 5 contrary to the gauged locations streamflow predictions at ungauged locations were found to be more consistently improved by using soil moisture for the calibration specifically 4 locations out of 5 in the clarence and 3 locations out of 4 in the condamine exhibited a higher ns and a lower f q by joint calibration in both the calibration and validation periods this is also illustrated in fig 4 which shows that the joint calibration improved the prediction of some of the flood peaks in the calibration and validation events at paddys flat and tummaville the improvement was more obvious than in gauged locations this can be explained as follows when streamflow gauges are limited the spatially distributed soil moisture information becomes the only information for internal sub catchments introducing soil moisture into the model calibration essentially strengthens the model in predicting the spatial variability of hydrologic variables e g soil moisture and streamflow 5 discussion 5 1 impact of sub catchment locations the impact at the ungauged sub catchments caused by introducing soil moisture information was found to vary with the location of the sub catchments for instance the difference in ns between the streamflow calibration and the joint calibration was relatively small at the downstream locations e g jackadgery in the clarence and loudouns bridge in the condamine while the differences tended to be larger at the upstream and tributary locations e g paddys flat drake broadmeadows and nymboida in the clarence as well as warwick tummaville and fairview in the condamine a similar pattern was also found in f q values this can be explained by the fact that the downstream locations are closer to the calibration gauge and thus more constrained by the streamflow data the upstream and tributary sub catchments compensated each other to optimize the flow prediction at the outlet being more sensitive to the spatial variability brought by the soil moisture information this was extremely obvious at warwick whose ns f q was improved from 0 49 0 46 to 0 60 0 37 in the calibration period and 0 45 0 56 to 0 55 0 44 in the validation period as it was the most distant sub catchment to chinchilla in a long river system it should be pointed out that not all upstream and tributary sub catchments were improved by using soil moisture e g degradations were found at nymboida and fairview in both the calibration and validation periods nevertheless whether the predictions were improved or not the difference impact of soil moisture tended to be stronger at the upstream and tributary sub catchments rather than at the downstream sub catchments 5 2 significance of the improvement as discussed before including soil moisture information into model calibration reduced the possible equifinality in global optimization this brought benefits in two aspects firstly although minimizing errors in soil moisture simulation degraded the performance in streamflow prediction the improved robustness in the calibration was found to exhibit the potential to improve streamflow predictions during an independent validation period implying a possibility to improve future forecasts secondly remotely sensed soil moisture brought useful spatial information to reduce the equifinality issue caused by the lack of streamflow gauges and thus led to improvements in streamflow predictions at ungauged locations however the improvements in the gauged and ungauged locations were not consistent in all sub catchments according to the results shown in this study to check the significance of such improvements hypothesis student t tests were conducted for four groups of paired samples 1 pairs of ns at ungauged locations from the streamflow calibration and joint calibration schemes within the boxes in tables 2 5 2 pairs of f q at ungauged locations from the two calibration schemes 3 pairs of ns at gauged locations from the two calibration schemes but just in the independent validation period outside the boxes in tables 3 and 5 and 4 pairs of f q at gauged locations from the two calibration schemes in the independent validation period the key procedure to conduct the hypothesis test is summarized as follows null hypothesis the mean difference is assumed to be equal to or smaller than zero i e including soil moisture for calibration does not significantly improve the performance statistics ns or f q alternative hypothesis the mean difference is greater than zero i e including soil moisture for calibration significantly improves the performance statistics calculate sample differences d i ns ns i jo int cali ns i q cali or d i f q f q i jo int cali f q i q cali calculate the mean of the sample differences d calculate the standard deviation of the sample differences σ 1 n i 1 n d i d 2 where n is the sample size 15 for gauged cases and 18 for ungauged cases calculate the test statistic t d 0 σ n calculate the probability p of the test statistic based on the student t distribution test the null hypothesis by comparing p with target significance degree fig 5 compares the distribution of the ns and f q for the streamflow calibration and joint calibration schemes while fig 6 shows the histograms of the sample difference distribution it can be inferred that the improvement at ungauged locations brought by using soil moisture information is relatively more notable while the improvement at gauged locations brought by the soil moisture in the validation period is relatively less notable the results from the hypothesis tests are summarized in table 6 the p values probability of the test statistics for ungauged locations were 0 0077 0 01 for ns and 0 0004 0 01 for f q which indicate that the null hypothesis should be rejected in terms of both ns and f q the improvement was significant at both 0 05 and 0 01 significance degrees the p values for gauged locations were 0 0953 0 05 for ns and 0 0637 0 05 for f q which imply that the improvement was not significant with a significance degree of 0 05 according to the tests it can be concluded that introducing remotely sensed soil moisture data in addition to the gauged streamflow for hydrologic model calibration brought statistically significant improvement to streamflow prediction at ungauged locations whilst including soil moisture during calibration degraded the streamflow prediction at gauged locations to a slight extent there was a possibility to improve the future forecasts at those gauged locations due to the more robust model parameter sets however the improvements obtained in this particular case were not statistically significant this should be further explored in other catchments in the future 5 3 limitations in addressing uncertainties the joint calibration approach proposed in this study exhibited a stronger capability to address systematic errors in parameters compared with the traditional streamflow only calibration approach nevertheless other sources of uncertainties from inputs initial conditions and model structure were not addressed in this study for instance in this case study the sub catchment rainfall data were spatially interpolated from gauged rainfall which is prone to instrumental and interpolation uncertainties the uncertainty related to the interpolation process can be significant when the topography is complex and the rain gauges are sparse although the impact of pet was found to be much less than the rainfall samain and pauwels 2013 bennett et al 2014 the use of monthly interpolated gridded pet does ignore its variability within each month the model structure and parameter uncertainties can also be considerable due to the high conceptualization in the hydrologic models e g the grkal and linear muskingum routing procedure used in this study these uncertainties could potentially be further addressed through real time updating by assimilating soil moisture and or streamflow measurements wanders et al 2014b alvarez garreton et al 2015 lievens et al 2015 therefore it would be necessary to investigate how remotely sensed soil moisture can benefit the hydrologic prediction through an integrated calibration and real time data assimilation system a better estimation of the sources of uncertainties e g through error decomposition approaches li et al 2014 mazrooei et al 2015 could also be beneficial for understanding the potential of various uncertainty reduction approaches e g batch calibration and data assimilation in operational forecasting forecasted rainfall and pet need to be used to force the model which can bring additional uncertainties and affect the performance of the joint calibration approach examined in this study therefore it is necessary to extend this study to operational streamflow forecasting scenarios with the consideration of forecasted forcing uncertainties 6 conclusions this paper presented a joint calibration scheme using gauged streamflow and smos near surface soil moisture the joint calibration scheme was compared with a traditional streamflow only calibration scheme in three model setups i e a lumped model a semi distributed model with only the gauge at the outlet available and a semi distributed model with multiple gauges available it was found that semi distributed models are more suitable than lumped models in representing forcing and parameter spatial variability so as to produce more accurate streamflow predictions at the catchment outlets the increase of the streamflow gauge availability to a large extent improved the performance of the semi distributed model regardless of using soil moisture data for calibration however the impact of the soil moisture varied among different model setups a slight degradation in streamflow simulation was generally found at the calibration locations during the calibration period when soil moisture was used for calibration which is expected however improvements were also obtained in the independent validation period for some sub catchments e g 9 out of 15 gauged cases were improved while 5 cases were degraded slightly in terms of the ns although the improvement did not pass the overall significance test it unveiled a potential to improve future forecasts through the identification of more robust parameter sets by including soil moisture information in the calibration future work can be dedicated to employ multiple sources of remotely sensed soil moisture data to further address this issue a more consistent improvement brought by using soil moisture data was identified at ungauged sub catchments this finding was consistent with some previous studies in which data assimilation approaches was applied e g wanders et al 2014a found that internal locations were improved by integrating soil moisture into a process based model using the ensemble kalman filter however there has not been a study before to investigate the potential to improve ungauged internal locations when batch calibration is used it should also be noted that the physical linkage between soil moisture and streamflow is typically strong in process based models and it make sense to detect improvements in streamflow estimation when soil moisture simulation is improved in those models it is encouraging to find similar improvements at ungauged locations through batch calibration in a conceptual hydrologic model and the improvement passed the statistical significance test furthermore it was also found that the improvement was stronger at upstream and tributary sub catchments than the downstream locations the usefulness of soil moisture data for model calibration needs to be investigated under operational forecasting scenarios in future work it would also be beneficial to use soil moisture for both batch calibration and data assimilation in an integrated system to maximize the value brought by soil moisture information

7533,biotic leaf transpiration t and abiotic evaporation e are the two major pathways by which water is transferred from land surfaces to the atmosphere earth system models simulating the terrestrial

horizontal grid resolution of 1 km that the inclusion of surface and groundwater lateral flow increased the domain averaged t et ratio from 47 13 to 62 12 which better agrees with estimates from recent isotope based methods at continental scales the attainable horizontal grid resolution is mainly limited by the available computational resources to achieve horizontal grid resolutions on the order of 1 10 km and the availability of high resolution atmospheric forcing data 10 km including soil and landuse data however at these grid resolutions without additional subgrid parameterizations the simulated surface energy flux partitioning may depend on the grid resolution itself coarsening of the grid resolution smoothens the local slopes and removes small scale soil water convergence and divergences zones along simulated river corridors and water divides and impacts the soil moisture distribution leading to an effectively reduced drainage zhang and montgomery 1994 kuo et al 1999 sulis

of the manuscript is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 describes the model and the experiment design for this study results and discussions are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively finally conclusions are presented in section 6 2 model description the hydrological component of the terrestrial systems modeling platform terrsysmp shrestha et al 2014 2015 consists of the ncar community

the models can be found in shrestha et al 2014 and shrestha et al 2015 here we briefly discuss the relevant parameterization in the land surface model which controls the pathways of evapotranspiration in clm3 5 the surface heterogeneity of a grid cell is represented using a subgrid tile approach at different hierarchy levels with five landunits multiple soil columns and 17 plant functional types pfts which also includes the bare soil i e without vegetation an explicit canopy layer represents the pfts and a lookup table provides the pft specific photosynthetic optical aerodynamic and vertical root distribution parameters while a grid cell can include multiple pfts e g 80 crop and 20 bare soil in this study we use one soil column and one pft in each grid cell solar radiation absorbed by the canopy and the ground below is computed via radiative transfer within vegetative canopies which depends on the incoming solar radiation lai and optical properties of the pft the latter remain constant in time et from a vegetated surface is computed as the sum of water vapor flux due to canopy evaporation from wet leaf surfaces transpiration from dry leaf surfaces and evaporation from ground below the stomatal resistance for computing canopy transpiration is coupled to photosynthesis based on the models of farquhar et al 1980 and collatz et al 1991 leaf photosynthesis is a prognostic variable and depends on the maximum rate of carboxylation which again depends on pft specific photosynthetic parameters including leaf temperature and is downregulated for nitrogen limitation and root zone soil moisture limitation for vegetated surface ground evaporation depends on the aerodynamic resistance and the humidity gradient between ground and canopy soil surface specific humidity is computed by scaling the saturation specific humidity at soil temperature with a factor which is a weighted combination of values for snow and soil the soil is a function of surface soil water matric potential and ground temperature excessive soil evaporation for no snow conditions is reduced by an additional soil resistance term which depends on the relative saturation of the top layer and decreases exponentially with the increase in relative saturation 3 experiment design terrsysmp was set up over the inde catchment 325 km2 encompassing the wehebach tributary 50 m amsl and drains the northern foothills of the lower eifel mountain range 600 m amsl in western germany this model setup is consistent with the one used in shrestha et al 2015 land use in the region based on clm3 5 plant functional types pfts changes from mostly agricultural crops c1n near the foothills to needle leaf evergreen trees nle and broadleaf deciduous trees bld along the northern slopes of eifel mountain range the urban land cover in the catchment 17 of catchment area is represented as agricultural canopy c1f with a fixed leaf area index lai 0 6 as the urban module is absent in clm3 5 this is not meant to represent the actual physical processes over the urban area but the use of fixed low lai reduces the local control of vegetation in these areas when investigating the impact of grid resolution on simulated physical processes a uniform soil texture is used which largely follows the information found in bk50 1 50 000 scale data http www gd nrw de pr shop informationssysteme bk50d htm by using a complete homogeneous soil texture we also remove any effects of scaling of soil hydraulic properties the available 15 m landuse data waldhoff 2012 and 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm topography data were aggregated to 120 240 480 and 960 m horizontal grid resolution by assigning each grid cell with its dominant pft according to the high resolution data with successive grid coarsening when aggregating topography the skewness of the distribution of plan curvature changes from 0 07 to 99 43 while its kurtosis varies from 3 64 to 13273 9 similarly for the profile curvature skewness and kurtosis change from approximately 0 24 to 0 92 and 0 59 to 5 66 respectively in this study a wet and a dry year were chosen with average accumulated annual precipitation of 1002 mm year 2009 and 695 mm year 2011 respectively for the catchment based on seven year cosmo de forcing data 2007 2015 2011 has the minimum annual precipitation whereas the annual precipitation for 2009 is closer to the median value similar as the year 2009 2010 was also wet year relative to 2011 with an annual rainfall of 944 mm the model was spunup over a 6 year period for the different spatial resolutions using the same annual atmospheric forcing data cosmo de analysis with 2 8 km resolution the spin up for 2009 and 2011 was done separately using the same hydrostatic profile with groundwater table depth at 5 m below the land surface for soil moisture initialization this approach was chosen to generate consistent initial conditions dependent only on the simulated year the temporal evolution of total unsaturated storage approaches a quasi equilibrium state in the fifth year see shrestha et al 2015 for details the output for the sixth year 2009 or 2011 is analyzed with respect to the groundwater table gwt depth and the pathways of water fluxes for evaporation and transpiration during the months of april to september with higher incoming solar radiation for our analysis the coarser grid resolution output was disaggregated to the highest resolution by attributing to each high resolution 120 m 120 m grid cell the same value of the coarser grid cell to which it belonged 4 results coarsening of the grid resolution shifts the frequency distribution of gwt depth for both years towards shallower depths fig 1 the modeled domain and time averaged gwt depth and standard deviation for april to september for 2009 were 3 55 4 60 m 1 88 2 96 m 0 56 1 26 m 0 16 0 28 m for the grid resolutions 120 m 240 m 480 m and 960 m respectively for 2011 the values were 5 43 5 58 m 3 60 4 33 m 1 85 2 72 m 0 78 1 32 m respectively at 120 m grid resolution the gwt depth distribution is similar for both years with only a slightly higher frequency of zones with shallow gwt depth 0 2 m for the wetter year the shift towards higher frequencies of shallower gwt depths with grid coarsening depends on the overall soil moisture and thus annual precipitation for the wetter year the zones with shallow gwt depth 0 2 m increase substantially with grid coarsening at the expense of regions with deeper gwt depths while for the drier year the shift from deep gwt depths results in substantial increase in zones with gwt depth from 0 2 to 0 8 m we now examine the dependence of e and t and t et on the horizontal grid resolution fig 2 a shows the spatial pft distribution with gwt depths deeper than 1 6 m during mid june for 2009 and 2011 which remains similar throughout the year this threshold of 1 6 m is applied to mask the regions with shallow gwt as observed in the frequency distribution of coarsest model runs for both years see fig 1 zones with deeper gwt depth are mostly found along the hillslopes while the masked out shallow gwt regions stretch along the streams and the flat area near the inde outlet the mask for the wet year 2009 has slightly smaller coverage compared to the dry year 2011 mean and standard deviation of the solar radiation absorbed by vegetation and ground do not change much with grid coarsening the sum of solar radiation absorbed by ground s abg and vegetation s abv is similar for both crop pfts with the tree pfts absorbing more 27 wm 2 for nle and 16 wm 2 for bld from april to september for both years however the partitioning of the solar radiation s abg s abv is strongly controlled by the lai and the optical parameters of the pfts and thus differ substantially the crops exhibit higher ratios of s abg s abv compared to trees with highest magnitude for c1f due to the fixed low lai value grid coarsening however has no significant effect on the absorbed solar radiation and its partitioning to vegetation and ground grid resolution effects are paramount for the state of the soil and its effect on the turbulent fluxes the domain averaged top 10 cm relative soil moisture s w for all pfts increases with the grid coarsening while its variance decreases fig 3 in the wet year 2009 s w increases from 0 55 to 0 90 for forested areas e g bld and from 0 54 to 0 88 for agricultural areas e g c1n during the dry year 2011 s w changes from 0 46 to 0 67 and from 0 46 to 0 70 for forested bld and agricultural c1n areas respectively for both years the domain averaged plant transpiration for different pfts t does not change much with the increase in soil moisture due to grid coarsening while evaporation e does fig 3 this effect is stronger for pfts with low lai due to the higher amounts of solar radiation absorbed by the ground see fig 2b and higher available soil moisture for ground evaporation fig 3a and b the bare soil evaporation parameterization which depends on the available soil moisture on the top layer dominates this behavior accordingly total evapotranspiration increases with grid coarsening and thereby decreases the domain average t et for all pfts fig 3a and b this decrease is relatively higher for the wet year than for the dry year the magnitudes of the variation of e and t et ratio in terms of mean and one standard deviation are presented in table 1 and 2 e is higher for the 2009 compared to 2011 because of the higher available soil moisture vegetation cover strongly controls the local ground evaporation depending on the pft optical parameters and the leaf area index lai with their higher transmissivity for incoming radiation the variation in ground evaporation is higher for crops compared to forest and even higher for crops with low lai at 120 m grid resolution the t et is similar in both years for all pfts 58 59 for needle leaf evergreen trees 71 72 for broadleaf deciduous trees 48 51 for agricultural crop and 21 24 for crop with fixed low lai with grid coarsening from 120 to 960 m the t et decreases by different magnitudes between the wet and dry year for different pfts see table 2 for the wet year t et decreases between 10 14 for crops and 10 11 for trees for the dry year its decrease is around 10 for the crops and 4 6 for trees in terms of domain average including all pfts the t et decreases with grid coarsening by around 5 and 8 for the dry and wet year respectively 5 discussions this study addresses the grid resolution dependence of t et simulated by physically based models which include surface and 3d subsurface lateral flow grid coarsening decreases the mean and variance of gwt depth an effect more amplified during the wet year the induced increase in near surface soil moisture increases the ground evaporation while transpiration remained almost constant accordingly in the central european mid latitude climate regime root zone soil moisture is usually not the limiting factor for transpiration thus with respect to transpiration the system is energy limited modeled ground evaporation mainly depends on the upper layer soil moisture and increases with moister soil suggesting a water limited state according to the study by maxwell and condon 2016 the inclusion of surface and groundwater lateral flow increases the domain averaged t et for the continental us by almost 15 in a more recent study using a modified budyko framework freund and kirchner 2017 also illustrate variable biases on estimated et depending on hypothetical transfer of water due to gravity between regions of different altitudes and aridity showing the complexity of including lateral flow our work suggests that for wet regimes the increased grid resolution might increase t et ratios as found in maxwell and condon 2016 due to non local control on soil moisture which however is overall lower than the effect of including lateral flow itself due to the strong local control of vegetation the increase in t et ratios was even lower for the dry year compared to the wet year we also investigated the impact of the initial condition on t et ratio for the dry year to account for the antecedent conditions by conducting a 6 year model spin up for 2009 and then running the model from jan 2009 to dec 2011 for this approach the domain average soil moistures for 2011 compared to the earlier approach values in brackets were 0 64 0 60 0 69 0 64 0 75 0 69 and 0 77 0 74 for 120 m 240 m 480 m and 960 m respectively although the soil moisture is higher for all grid resolutions with the new runs as expected the changes in mean soil moisture and t et with grid coarsening remains similar between the two approaches besides the uncertainty in t et due to horizontal grid resolution will also depend on the distribution of land surface heterogeneity in the domain where vegetation type and lai was found to exert strong control additional uncertainties in t et do arise from photosynthetic parameters of simulated vegetation e g sulis et al 2015 root water uptake parameterizations e g zeng et al 1998 feddes et al 2001 li et al 2013 wang

et al 1996 lawrence et al 2012 tang and riley 2013 jefferson and maxwell 2015 example sulis et al 2015 showed that the inclusion of crop specific photosynthetic parameters from measurements improved the surface energy flux partitioning for energy limited system similar improvements were also shown by li et al 2013 with modified root water uptake function for arid ecosystems while the tuning of the parameters based on single column simulations are important for predictions their affect on t et estimates for regional domains with the inclusion of lateral flow needs further investigations 6 conclusions using terrsysmp horizontal grid coarsening from 120 m to 960 m for the inde catchment was found to decrease the simulated domain averaged t et by almost 5 8 due to the increased soil evaporation caused by the increase in near surface soil moisture this sensitivity primarily arises from the aggregation of topography at coarser resolution which smoothens spatial topographic features for efficiently redistributing the surface and groundwater the modeled t et does however depend on the energy and water limited sates of modeled transpiration and ground evaporation respectively as found for the inde catchment which can be seen as representative for mid latitude central to western european catchments additionally the distribution of vegetation type and the lai did affect the

grid coarsening when aggregating topography the skewness of the distribution of plan curvature changes from 0 07 to 99 43 while its kurtosis varies from 3 64 to 13273 9 similarly for the profile curvature skewness and kurtosis change from approximately 0 24 to 0 92 and 0 59 to 5 66 respectively in this study a wet and a dry year were chosen with average accumulated annual precipitation of 1002 mm year 2009 and 695 mm year 2011 respectively for the catchment based on seven year cosmo de forcing data 2007 2015 2011 has the minimum annual precipitation whereas the annual precipitation for 2009 is closer to the median value similar as the year 2009 2010 was also wet year relative to 2011 with an annual rainfall of 944 mm the model was spunup over a 6 year period for the different spatial resolutions using the same annual atmospheric forcing data cosmo de analysis with 2 8 km resolution the spin up for 2009 and 2011 was done separately using the same hydrostatic profile with groundwater table depth at 5 m below the land surface for soil moisture initialization this approach was chosen to generate consistent initial conditions dependent only on the simulated year the temporal evolution of total unsaturated storage approaches a quasi equilibrium state in the fifth year see shrestha et al 2015 for details the output for the sixth year 2009 or 2011 is analyzed with respect to the groundwater table gwt depth and the pathways of water fluxes for evaporation and transpiration during the months of april to september with higher incoming solar radiation for our analysis the coarser grid resolution output was disaggregated to the highest resolution by attributing to each high resolution 120 m 120 m grid cell the same value of the coarser grid cell to which it belonged 4 results coarsening of the grid resolution shifts the frequency distribution of gwt depth for both years towards shallower depths fig 1 the modeled domain and time averaged gwt depth and standard deviation for april to september for 2009 were 3 55 4 60 m 1 88 2 96 m 0 56 1 26 m 0 16 0 28 m for the grid resolutions 120 m 240 m 480 m and 960 m respectively for 2011 the values were 5 43 5 58 m 3 60 4 33 m 1 85 2 72 m 0 78 1 32 m respectively at 120 m grid resolution the gwt depth distribution is similar for both years with only a slightly higher frequency of zones with shallow gwt depth 0 2 m for the wetter year the shift towards higher frequencies of shallower gwt depths with grid coarsening depends on the overall soil moisture and thus annual precipitation for the wetter year the zones with shallow gwt depth 0 2 m increase substantially with grid coarsening at the expense of regions with deeper gwt depths while for the drier year the shift from deep gwt depths results in substantial increase in zones with gwt depth from 0 2 to 0 8 m we now examine the dependence of e and t and t et on the horizontal grid resolution fig 2 a shows the spatial pft distribution with gwt depths deeper than 1 6 m during mid june for 2009 and 2011 which remains similar throughout the year this threshold of 1 6 m is applied to mask the regions with shallow gwt as observed in the frequency distribution of coarsest model runs for both years see fig 1 zones with deeper gwt depth are mostly found along the hillslopes while the masked out shallow gwt regions stretch along the streams and the flat area near the inde outlet the mask for the wet year 2009 has slightly smaller coverage compared to the dry year 2011 mean and standard deviation of the solar radiation absorbed by vegetation and ground do not change much with grid coarsening the sum of solar radiation absorbed by ground s abg and vegetation s abv is similar for both crop pfts with the tree pfts absorbing more 27 wm 2 for nle and 16 wm 2 for bld from april to september for both years however the partitioning of the solar radiation s abg s abv is strongly controlled by the lai and the optical parameters of the pfts and thus differ substantially the crops exhibit higher ratios of s abg s abv compared to trees with highest magnitude for c1f due to the fixed low lai value grid coarsening however has no significant effect on the absorbed solar radiation and its partitioning to vegetation and ground grid resolution effects are paramount for the state of the soil and its effect on the turbulent fluxes the domain averaged top 10 cm relative soil moisture s w for all pfts increases with the grid coarsening while its variance decreases fig 3 in the wet year 2009 s w increases from 0 55 to 0 90 for forested areas e g bld and from 0 54 to 0 88 for agricultural areas e g c1n during the dry year 2011 s w changes from 0 46 to 0 67 and from 0 46 to 0 70 for forested bld and agricultural c1n areas respectively for both years the domain averaged plant transpiration for different pfts t does not change much with the increase in soil moisture due to grid coarsening while evaporation e does fig 3 this effect is stronger for pfts with low lai due to the higher amounts of solar radiation absorbed by the ground see fig 2b and higher available soil moisture for ground evaporation fig 3a and b the bare soil evaporation parameterization which depends on the available soil moisture on the top layer dominates this behavior accordingly total evapotranspiration increases with grid coarsening and thereby decreases the domain average t et for all pfts fig 3a and b this decrease is relatively higher for the wet year than for the dry year the magnitudes of the variation of e and t et ratio in terms of mean and one standard deviation are presented in table 1 and 2 e is higher for the 2009 compared to 2011 because of the higher available soil moisture vegetation cover strongly controls the local ground evaporation depending on the pft optical parameters and the leaf area index lai with their higher transmissivity for incoming radiation the variation in ground evaporation is higher for crops compared to forest and even higher for crops with low lai at 120 m grid resolution the t et is similar in both years for all pfts 58 59 for needle leaf evergreen trees 71 72 for broadleaf deciduous trees 48 51 for agricultural crop and 21 24 for crop with fixed low lai with grid coarsening from 120 to 960 m the t et decreases by different magnitudes between the wet and dry year for different pfts see table 2 for the wet year t et decreases between 10 14 for crops and 10 11 for trees for the dry year its decrease is around 10 for the crops and 4 6 for trees in terms of domain average including all pfts the t et decreases with grid coarsening by around 5 and 8 for the dry and wet year respectively 5 discussions this study addresses the grid resolution dependence of t et simulated by physically based models which include surface and 3d subsurface lateral flow grid coarsening decreases the mean and variance of gwt depth an effect more amplified during the wet year the induced increase in near surface soil moisture increases the ground evaporation while transpiration remained almost constant accordingly in the central european mid latitude climate regime root zone soil moisture is usually not the limiting factor for transpiration thus with respect to transpiration the system is energy limited modeled ground evaporation mainly depends on the upper layer soil moisture and increases with moister soil suggesting a water limited state according to the study by maxwell and condon 2016 the inclusion of surface and groundwater lateral flow increases the domain averaged t et for the continental us by almost 15 in a more recent study using a modified budyko framework freund and kirchner 2017 also illustrate variable biases on estimated et depending on hypothetical transfer of water due to gravity between regions of different altitudes and aridity showing the complexity of including lateral flow our work suggests that for wet regimes the increased grid resolution might increase t et ratios as found in maxwell and condon 2016 due to non local control on soil moisture which however is overall lower than the effect of including lateral flow itself due to the strong local control of vegetation the increase in t et ratios was even lower for the dry year compared to the wet year we also investigated the impact of the initial condition on t et ratio for the dry year to account for the antecedent conditions by conducting a 6 year model spin up for 2009 and then running the model from jan 2009 to dec 2011 for this approach the domain average soil moistures for 2011 compared to the earlier approach values in brackets were 0 64 0 60 0 69 0 64 0 75 0 69 and 0 77 0 74 for 120 m 240 m 480 m and 960 m respectively although the soil moisture is higher for all grid resolutions with the new runs as expected the changes in mean soil moisture and t et with grid coarsening remains similar between the two approaches besides the uncertainty in t et due to horizontal grid resolution will also depend on the distribution of land surface heterogeneity in the domain where vegetation type and lai was found to exert strong control additional uncertainties in t et do arise from photosynthetic parameters of simulated vegetation e g sulis et al 2015 root water uptake parameterizations e g zeng et al 1998 feddes et al 2001 li et al 2013 wang et al 2016 fu et al 2016 ferguson et al 2016 canopy radiative transfer controlling solar radiation absorbed by the ground e g bonan et al 2014 and bare soil evaporation parameterizations e g sellers et al 1996 lawrence et al 2012 tang and riley 2013 jefferson and maxwell 2015 example sulis et al 2015 showed that the inclusion of crop specific photosynthetic parameters from measurements improved the surface energy flux partitioning for energy limited system similar improvements were also shown by li et al 2013 with modified root water uptake function for arid ecosystems while the tuning of the parameters based on single column simulations are important for predictions their affect on t et estimates for regional domains with the inclusion of lateral flow needs further investigations 6 conclusions using terrsysmp horizontal grid coarsening from 120 m to 960 m for the inde catchment was found to decrease the simulated domain averaged t et by almost 5 8 due to the increased soil evaporation caused by the increase in near surface soil moisture this sensitivity primarily arises from the aggregation of topography at coarser resolution which smoothens spatial topographic features for efficiently redistributing the surface and groundwater the modeled t et does however depend on the energy and water limited sates of modeled transpiration and ground evaporation respectively as found for the inde catchment which can be seen as representative for mid latitude central to western european catchments additionally the distribution of vegetation type and the lai did affect the

7534,mean response time mrt is a metric describing the propagation of catchment hydraulic behavior that reflects both hydro climatic conditions and catchment characteristics to provide a comprehensive understanding of catchment response over a longer time scale for hydraulic processes the mrt function for baseflow generation was derived using an instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh model that describes the subsurface response to effective rainfall inputs iuh parameters were estimated based on the match test between the autocorrelation function acfs derived from the filtered base flow time series and from the iuh parameters under the glue framework regionalization of mrt was conducted using estimates and hydroclimate landscape indices in 22 sub basins of the jinghe river basin jrb in the loess plateau of northwest china results indicate there is strong equifinality in determination of the best parameter sets but the median values of the mrt estimates are relatively stable in the acceptable range of the parameters mrts vary markedly over the studied sub basins ranging from tens of days to more than a year climate topography and geomorphology were identified as three first order controls on recharge baseflow response processes human activities involving the cultivation of permanent crops may elongate the baseflow mrt and hence increase the dynamic storage cross validation suggests the model can be used to estimate mrts in ungauged catchments in similar regions of throughout the loess plateau the proposed method provides a systematic approach for mrt estimation and regionalization in terms of hydroclimate and catchment characteristics which is helpful in the sustainable water resources utilization and ecological protection in the loess plateau keywords baseflow separation mean response time instantaneous unit hydrograph regionalization the jinghe river basin 1 introduction streamflow is a commonly available integrated signal of surface and subsurface flow observed at the outlet of a basin due to strong heterogeneity of precipitation and catchment conditions in space and time precipitation is subject to rather complex transmission processes in a catchment thus hydrologists have made great efforts to quantify water travel times as metrics for capturing the integrated nature of the streamflow generation processes in terms of the basin scale partitioning storage and release of water to streams gupta and mesa 1988 kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 given the spatial variability in landscape characteristics and precipitation inputs the probability distribution function pdf of travel times have been applied to provide a general stochastic description of runoff generation and hydrologic response gupta and mesa 1988 focused on flow flux the pdf of travel time also defined as the response time distribution rtd indicates the speed and volume of outflow with which a catchment responds to water input precipitation gupta and mesa 1988 botter et al 2010 roa garćıa and weiler 2010 in recent years chemical and isotopic signatures of streamflow have been used to show that a sizable proportion of runoff from the hydrologic response of catchment transport volumes is comprised of old water already stored in the control volume i e water particles injected at times preceding the event were observed in the runoff weiler et al 2003 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 botter et al 2010 mcdonnell and beven 2014 focused on water particles the pdf of the travel time also defined as the travel or transit time distribution ttd describes the distribution of times that each molecule of water takes to arrive at the catchment outlet from all locations in the catchment mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 integrating how catchment properties control its hydrologic and chemical responses botter et al 2010 the mean transit time mtt derived from the chemical and isotopic signatures in a catchment is usually much longer than the hydraulic response of to rainfall inputs which can be defined in terms of a mean response time mrt botter et al 2010 roa garćıa and weiler 2010 mcdonnell and beven 2014 as a fundamental and useful metric for describing the transmission of catchment hydraulic behavior mcdonnell and beven 2014 hale and mcdonnell 2016 the catchment mrt can be estimated only using commonly observed rainfall and streamflow data the popularly used pdf for the rainfall runoff response is the instantaneous unit hydrographs iuh which is the runoff hydrograph in response to a unit of rainfall instantaneously injected into the basin gupta and mesa 1988 botter et al 2010 since the pdf of mrt e g the iuh can be determined through some simple conceptual frameworks e g linear storage reservoirs nash 1957 it provides a tool to develop simple and effective rainfall runoff models beven 2011 hydrological similarity metrics and runoff estimation for an ungauged catchment gupta and mesa 1988 rodríguez iturbe et al 1979 an assumption of the iuh scheme is linear and time invariant the linear iuh refers to a linear input output system whose output for a linear combination of inputs are the same as a linear combination of individual responses to those inputs the time invariant iuh means that the output does not depend on when an input was applied beven 2011 however the hydrograph consisting of surface flow and subsurface flow usually responds to precipitation in a non linear way weiler and mcdonnell 2006 beven 2011 the nonlinear rainfall runoff response mostly arises from the dynamic interaction between the saturated unsaturated subsurface flow and surface flow botter et al 2010 beven 2011 and different time scales of the responses although many studies have derived various non linear equations to capture rainfall runoff response behaviors e g amorocho and brandstetter 1971 jakeman and hornberger 1993 sivapalan et al 2002 an effective way is to separate streamflow into various components for minimizing the non linear effect as far as possible for the baseflow response the time invariant assumption may be not valid due to seasonal variability and or longer term trend from climate change and human activities one effective approach to eliminate seasonality and or trend in the recharge and baseflow simultaneously is via the classical decomposition model under a stochastic framework e g sarino and serrano 1990 the decomposition from the long term series obtains the mean state of the catchment storage and a random series which can be used for estimation of the mean mrt over the long term period by the classical iuh the simplicity of the iuh approach may result in substantial errors in mrt estimation such errors can arise from the assumptions made in development of the differential equations of pdf and the inherent simplifications in the streamflow process effective rainfall estimation jakeman and hornberger 1993 botter et al 2007 streamflow observation data and the parameter calibration therefore there is also a need to evaluate the mrt uncertainty associated with such errors sarino and serrano 1990 previous studies illustrated that catchment characteristics such as soils soulsby et al 2006 topography mcguire et al 2005 geology hale and mcdonnell 2016 vegetation land use pilgrim et al 1988 or a suite of controls hrachowitz et al 2009 exert dominant influences on the subsurface runoff processes and thus spatial variability in mrt in the loess plateau of northwest china the transitional climate ranging from semi humid to semi arid and highly erodible loess soils result in dramatically spatial and temporal variations of geomorphic and hydrological features the main geomorphic landforms on the loess plateau are tableland a large flat surface hill ridge and various gullies in the region of the vast loess tableland normally with thick soils and dry climate the infiltration wetting front generally reaches only shallow depths e g several meters gates et al 2011 peng et al 2015 and most infiltrated water is lost for evapotranspiration chen et al 2007 in the low loess gullies or nearby the stream network most infiltrated water becomes baseflow gates et al 2011 the precipitation is mainly concentrated in july august and september accounting for 60 70 of total annual precipitation mostly in the form of high intensity storms shi and shao 2000 baseflow is the primary water resource utilized in the region and varies markedly in space and time under natural and anthropogenic influences generally in areas with high gully density ground cracking is also well developed and soil erosion intensity is high and conversely concentrated recharge for baseflow meanwhile human activities such as agricultural land uses and re forestation can significantly affect soil water dynamic chen et al 2007 that partitions water fluxes at the land surface and recharge of groundwater for instance tree and shrub plantations may result in reductions in subsurface recharge in afforested areas in the loess plateau gates et al 2011 since late 1990s chinese government has promoted re forestation and sediment storage dam building in the region for preventing soil erosion it is important to know how the remarkable variability in climate and landscape affects streamflow characteristics and water storage in this important region regionalization of the spatial pattern of hydrological processes can identify how and to what extent climate landscape factors control basin hydrological functions which can in turn provide important information for hydrologic prediction and water resource management in ungauged catchments hrachowitz et al 2009 garambois et al 2015 thus estimation of the spatial variations in mrt and subsurface storage has the potential to provide very useful insights into regional water resources and can contribute to planning for sustainable water resource utilization and ecological protection in the loess plateau thus the main objective of this research is to comprehensively analyze how to estimate and regionalize baseflow mrt in the region using routine observations of long term streamflow and geomorphologic data and how reliable the mrt estimated and regionalized results are the analysis and evaluation were performed in the jinghe river basin jrb one of main basins in the loess plateau center of northwest china the specific aims of this study include 1 to obtain stationary baseflow series by baseflow separation and de seasonalization operations 2 to estimate the iuh based mrt and its associated storage and recharge over the jrb 3 to regionalize mrt by regression analysis using identified landscape variables that control mrt and 4 to verify the proposed methods using cross validation and uncertainty analysis 2 study area and data the jrb located in the central loess plateau of northwestern china 34 24 37 20 n 106 20 108 48 e is one of the main tributaries of the yellow river fig 1 a the jrb has an area of 45 373 km2 the climate is dominated by the continental monsoon a large proportion of the jrb is characterized by a semi arid climate toward the north an exception is the southwest boundary which has a semi humid climate the average annual precipitation increases from 250 mm in the north to 710 mm in the south and conversely the average annual potential evapotranspiration decreases from 1200 mm in the north to 950 mm in the south nearly 60 70 of precipitation occurs between june and september the land surface elevation of the basin averages 1424 m with a large spatial variation from 441 to 2922 m it decreases gradually from the northwest to the south fig 1a the dominant landform is the loess tableland lt and loess hill lh 41 7 and 48 8 of the basin respectively fig 1b in the semi arid area and the remainder is rocky mountain rm and loess covered mountain lm 4 3 and 5 2 of the basin respectively fig 1b in the semi humid area the rm and lm are often referred to as a wet island providing an important regional water source yu et al 2009 even though this occupies only a small portion of the overall basin the basin slope is 12 3 on average steeper in the higher rocky mountainous areas and the loess hills and gullies but flatter in the loess tableland and broad river valleys quaternary loess is the most widely distributed soil type covering more than 80 of the total basin where the deposits are very thick 50 80 m and famous for soil erosion the lt and lh areas are occupied by a higher percentage of sand and a lower percentage of clay accounting for about 50 and 14 21 of the basin respectively comparatively the rm areas have a lower percentage of sand and a higher percentage of clay resulting in the spatial heterogeneity of soils table 1 toward northwestern drier areas vegetation cover ratios reduce and dominant vegetation change from forest to shrub timber prairie and desert grass the land use of the basin is mostly farmland in the lt and broad valleys and forest and grass in the high elevation areas of rm and lh respectively in this study 22 sub basins with areas ranging 60 4640 km2 were available in terms of hydrological gauging stations in the jrb and used for analysis fig 1a and table 1 streamflow data used in this study are daily observation time series provided by the bureau of hydrology ministry of water resources p r china to minimize problems from varying record lengths or data resolution for capturing different levels of climatic variability hrachowitz et al 2009 16 gauging stations with the same streamflow record of 11 years during the period of 1977 1987 were used for mrt estimation an additional five stations with a record length of 4 8 years over the same period were also used table 1 the sub basin annual precipitation in the corresponding periods was calculated based on 61 rainfall stations fig 1c using the thiessen polygons method in that each study area is divided into polygons with each polygon having a single gauge observation thiessen 1911 otieno 2014 3 methodology 3 1 baseflow separation and seasonality elimination recursive digital filtering rdf is one of the most commonly used methods for baseflow separation due to its simplicity stability reproducibility and objectivity nathan and mcmahon 1990 eckhardt 2005 many different rdf configurations have been proposed in the literatures to filter a low frequency signal i e baseflow from the total streamflow hydrograph including the lyne and hollick lh filter nathan and mcmahon 1990 the chapman one parameter algorithm chapman and maxwell 1996 and the eckhardt filter eckhardt 2005 in this study the one parameter rdf introduced by lyne and hollick 1979 was used for baseflow separation due to its simplicity 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered surface flow at time step t q t is the original streamflow and α is the filter parameter the filtered base flow is thus defined as q t q t the filter can be passed over the streamflow data three times forward backward and forward the filter parameter α affects the degree of attenuation and the number of passes determining the degree of smoothing the most acceptable range of α is 0 90 0 95 nathan and mcmahon 1990 since the filtered baseflow series may be nonstationary due to the markedly seasonal variability in the study region de seasonalization hipel and mcleod 1995 was achieved by subtracting the seasonal means and dividing the seasonal standard deviation of baseflow series let y y t t z be the daily baseflow series the mean and standard deviation for the mth season are calculated by μ m 1 n i 1 n y i m and σ m 1 n i 1 n y i m μ m 2 respectively in which y i m is the average baseflow in the mth month in the i year n is the length of years of the observations thus the daily de seasonalized baseflow series y i m d in the ith year mth month and dth day is 2 y i m d y i m d μ m σ m where y i m d is the daily baseflow obtained by lh filter the de seasonalized baseflow series y i m d denoted by y t and thereafter is regarded as a stationary time series 3 2 derivation of mrt from iuh for the de seasonalized baseflow series the de seasonalized baseflow as the output signal y t at time t comes from input signal x t τ at time t τ i e response of baseflow to recharge with a lag time τ mathematically y t can be estimated through the convolution integral of the transfer function g τ and x t τ over time 3 y t 0 g τ x t τ d τ where τ is the time lag between input and output the transfer function g τ represents the lumped response time distribution rtd when the input can be treated as a sequence of uniform and instantaneous i e daily signals the basin output can be simply modeled by a succession of routings through linear storage reservoirs dooge 1959 nash 1957 e g a cascade of n linear reservoirs each with storage constant k thus the transfer function g τ is exactly the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh as popularly expressed dooge 1959 nash 1957 4 g t 1 k n γ n e t k t n 1 where γ is the gamma function and t is the time of impulses instantaneous input since iuh or the transfer function interprets the probability distribution function of the time for the input signal effective rainfall pulse injected at a given time reaching the outlet rodríguez iturbe and valdes 1979 mrt can be estimated by the first moment of the transfer function eq 4 that equals to nk dooge 1959 nash 1957 3 3 iuh parameter estimation iuh parameters n and k are popularly calibrated in terms of the observed streamflow discharge and the estimated effective rainfall since mrt can be alternatively treated as the lag time between precipitation input and streamflow output signal under assumption of time invariant mrt can be estimated using correlation and or spectral analysis on input and output signatures adji and bahtiar 2016 zhang et al 2013 in this study n and k were calibrated based on the match test between autocorrelation function acfs estimated from the de seasonalized baseflow series and derived from the iuh parameters of n and k under the glue framework beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 given the de seasonalized time series y t its autocorrelation function acf can be directly estimated as follows 5 r τ t 1 n τ y t τ y y t y t 1 n y t y 2 where r τ is acf estimation by the de seasonalized time series y t at lag τ y is mean of the time series τ is lag time where τ 0 1 m m n for a stationary baseflow series as the output of a linear time invariant system its acf ρ τ depending on iuh parameters can be expressed as follows details can be referred to quimpo 1974 6 ρ τ k 2 π τ 2 τ k n γ n γ 2 n 1 b n 1 2 τ k where b n 1 2 τ k is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order n 1 2 n and k are the parameters of iuh expressed as eq 4 therefore after the observed streamflow series was filtered and de seasonalized given the filtered parameter of α the persistent characteristics of the baseflow response represented by the acf can be directly calculated by r τ in eq 5 and derived from ρ τ in eq 6 given the parameters of n and k then the three parameters of α n and k involved in acf can be calibrated by matching the persistence of r τ with ρ τ according to the likelihood measure calculation based on modeling residuals the acceptability of each matching can be evaluated here the comparable likelihood measure of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used for comparing the behaviors of different matching acfs 7 nse 1 τ 1 τ max r τ ρ τ 2 τ 1 τ max r τ r 2 where r τ and ρ τ are acfs at the τ lag from the estimation of eqs 5 and 6 respectively r is the mean value of r τ at all the considered lags τ 1 2 τ max in this study the maximum lag τ max was set to be the point once the value of r τ is smaller than its upper significance bound at the significance level of 0 05 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 was used for analyzing uncertainty and determining acceptability of the acfs matches given the feasible ranges of α along with n and k to ensure a sufficient sample of the matches was retained to form a meaningful cumulative distribution of predictions the threshold efficiency measure of 0 7 ritter and monoz carpena 2013 is chosen i e the goodness of fit of acfs is rejected when nse 0 7 prior information of the parameters of α n and k such as their expected distribution and feasible ranges plays a crucial role on the acfs matching test the parameter of the recursive filter α for baseflow separation may markedly affect estimation of iuh parameters of n and k however there is no objective way of assessing how well the filter predicts actual baseflow even though the most acceptable range of 0 9 0 95 and some suggested values such as 0 925 by arnold et al 1995 and nathan and mcmahon 1990 have previously been used there are not specific ranges for n and k as they vary with basin characteristics according to the parametric plots of the acf responses to white noise of linear system for different values of n using τ k as a dimensionless variable derived by quimpo 1974 the feasible ranges for n and k are set as 0 5 2 0 and 1 τ max the maximum lag for ρ τ defined in eq 6 respectively therefore using the most acceptable ranges of α 0 9 0 95 n 0 5 2 0 and k 1 τ max these three parameters were calibrated jointly using the trial and error method combined with the framework of glue as follows 1 separate the baseflow using the lh filter i e eq 1 given a specific value of parameter α i that alternatively changes within the range 0 90 0 95 with an incremental step of 0 002 i e i 1 n n 0 95 0 90 0 002 1 26 2 estimate acf of r i τ by eq 5 in terms of the de seasonalized baseflow series from the filtered series using α i the maximum lag τ max i for r i τ was set to be the point once the value of r i τ is smaller than its upper significance bound at the significance level of 0 05 3 calculate acf of ρ i j τ by eq 6 given a specific value for the pairs of n and k that alternatively change within the range of 0 5 2 0 for n and 1 τ max i for k with an incremental step at 0 1 and 1 respectively here n and k were sampled from a predefined uniform distribution with m 2 0 5 0 1 1 τ max i monte carlo realizations i e j 1 2 m 4 calculate the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse i j based on r i τ and ρ i j τ estimations from the procedures of 2 and 3 respectively 5 repeat 1 4 to obtain nse i j for all the specific α i and n k j given the acceptable matches that nse 0 7 the calibrated parameter sets of α io and n k jo were obtained therefore there will be a large number of retained parameter sets to derive the glue estimates of mrt typically the glue derived median prediction is generally a better predictor than the best prediction with the highest nse blasone et al 2008 beven and freer 2001 prediction uncertainty bounds were defined as percentiles of the derived prediction from the universe of behavioral parameter combinations blasone et al 2008 here the 90 confidence bounds were defined by using the 5th and 95th percentiles of the prediction derived from the retained parameter subsets and median values of nk in each sub basin were treated as mrt estimates and used in the following related analysis 3 4 mrt related storage and recharge the mean dynamic storage changes driving the baseflow variations as the saturated zone rises and falls can be estimated by product of the mrt and the mean baseflow 8 s 0 0864 mrt q b where s

baseflow mrt 3 5 1 basin landscape descriptors for regionalization of mrt eighteen descriptors of the climate and landscape in the 22 sub basins were selected in table 1 the selected descriptors can be classified into indicators of climate topography geomorphology land use cover and soils in addition to sub basin area a km2 the climatic indicator is the areal mean of annual precipitation amount p during the study period the topographic descriptors include sub basin average elevation tel slope tsl and relative elevation tre the relative elevation tre is defined as the height above the nearest drainage channel and is the normalized topography according to the local relative heights along the drainage network refer to rennó et al 2008 in details these topographic descriptors are generated using a dem with a resolution of 90 m http srtm csi cgiar org geomorphologic indicators are represented by the areal percentage of loess tableland glt loess hill glh loess covering mountain glm and rocky mountain grm estimated according to the geomorphic map of the jrb based on slope sl and relative elevation re the geomorphology was further defined as low plain sl 10 and re 20 m high plain sl 10 and re greater than 20 m or hillslope sl greater than 10 indicated by the areal percentage of low plain glp high plain ghp and hillslope ghs in each sub basin the low plain is located in the flat valley near rivers while the high plain in the loess tableland and loess terrace land use cover indicators are classified by three categories of forest grassland and permanent crop represented by the areal percentage of forest lfr grassland lgr and permanent crop lcr respectively the land use cover information in the study area was extracted from the land use and cover change lucc data of china in 1980 soils are characterized by three orders of particle size sand sd with particle size in the range of 0 063 2 0 mm silt st with particle size in the range of 0 002 0 063 mm and clay cl with particle size 0 002 mm denoted by sub basin average content of sd st and cl as ssd sst and scl respectively data of both land use cover and soils come from data centre for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn 3 5 2 mrt regionalization by regression analysis identifying the relationship between the predictors and the descriptors e g mrts vs the above basin indicators is a popular method used for regionalization in this study the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework was applied to develop the relationship between the mrts and sub basin descriptors gamlss assumes that independent observations o i for i 1 2 n have distribution function f o o i θ i where θ i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ p i is a vector of p distribution parameters accounting for location scale and shape random variable characteristics rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 the distribution parameters are related to covariates by monotonic link functions g l for l 1 2 p which can be modeled as a function of selected explanatory variables in this study two parameters distributions using log normal distribution logno the gamma distribution ga and the weibull distribution wei were selected as candidates to capture the possible characteristic of skewness in the dependent variable of mrt table 2 the relationship between distribution parameters of μ mean value of mrts and the sub basin descriptors can be modeled as 10 g μ φ β where μ is the mean value of mrts given a specific distribution e g logno ga or wei g is the link function here it is log φ is a matrix of explanatory variables β is the vectors of coefficients of the models in this study linear terms were used to capture this dependence to identify the relative importance of various sub basin indicators for mrts the stepwise backward model was applied to select explanatory variables using akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 to ensure that the fitted models can adequately describe the systematic structure with the white noise residuals the first two statistical moments of the residuals and the probability plot correlation coefficient i e the filliben correlation coefficient filliben 1975 were examined the worm plot van buuren and fredriks 2001 was used as a visual analysis of the residuals all of the calculations were performed using the r based gamlss package http mirror bjtu edu cn cran both aic and nse were used to evaluate model goodness of fit to evaluate the performance of the fitted model in mrt predictions at ungauged sites the error statistics from leave one out cross validation stone 1974 efron and gong 1983 were used as the measure of the prediction errors the cross validation prediction error was estimated by 11 v cv 1 n i 1 n mrt i i mrt i 2 where mrti is the mrt estimate at sub basin i obtained in section 3 2 which represents the true value of the mrt mrt i i is the mrt prediction at sub basin i by the regression model thus the coefficient of determination based on cross validation is laaha and bloschl 2006 12 r cv 2 1 v cv v o where v o is the spatial variance of the observed mrt over all the tested sub basins estimated using the true value of the mrt to avoid the adverse influence of highly correlated descriptors the best fit model was examined for the multi collinearity using the variance inflation factor vif and the determinant of the correlation matrix det belsley 1991 when vif 10 and det greater than 0 001 it implies that no multicollinearity is present hrachowitz et al 2009 4 results 4 1 regional streamflow features the marked differences in streamflow variability at the 22 sites are evident in terms of flow duration curves from the daily observation data during the study period fig 2 for example for the hd sub basin with the largest percentage of the loess tableland glt in the driest north streamflow shows the sharpest rise and decline of the hydrograph the red thick line as climate shifts toward the wetter south and the geomorphologic conditions change to the loess hilly region e g yle in the yellow thick line the loess covering mountain region e g bld in the green thick line and the rocky mountain region e g sgk in the blue thick line streamflow variation is attenuated and the flow duration curves become relatively smooth 4 2 sub basin parameters and mrts as the lh filter parameter of α is set to lie within the range of 0 90 0 95 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the acceptable range of iuh parameters of n and k that meet the nse threshold of 0 7 for the acfs match test were calibrated in table 3 the numerous retained parameter sets from the monte carlo analysis can be used for estimation of the mrt and associated variables the highest nse for the acfs match test is mostly greater than 0 9 over the tested sub basins and more than half of the sub basins have nse larger than 0 8 indicating good fits of the acfs from the estimations by eqs 5 and 6 the scatter plots of combinations of α n and k within the acceptable ranges vs the corresponding nse values were illustrated in fig 3 taking the four representative sub basins selected the same as fig 2 an example a variety of combinations of α n and k values satisfy the nse 0 7 criteria indicating strong equifinality in determination of the best parameter sets generally n and k are more sensitive and identifiable than α as shown in fig 3 the posterior cumulative distribution of parameter α shows less deviation from the original uniform distribution in contrast the cumulative distributions of n and k show greater deviation from the original uniform distribution this means that the persistence characteristics of baseflow series represented by acfs are not sensitive to the filter parameter α but sensitive to the iuh parameters of n and k fig 4 shows the scatter plot of mrt and bfi simulation from combinations of the acceptable parameter ranges against nse values and the histogram plots for mrt estimates in the four typical sub basins it illustrates that numerous mrt and bfi correspond to the nse larger than 0 7 table 3 summaries results from the glue simulations of acfs for all sub basins number of behavioral sets nse 0 7 ranges 195 tlp 42 313 ljh although nse for the best match of acfs could be higher than 0 9 for the most sub basins its occurrence frequency is lower e g percentage of acceptable behaviors reduces as nse increases in table 3 to find the most feasible mrts in each of the sub basins statistical frequency for the various mrts occurrence in the behavioral sets are shown in fig 4 upper right the significant skewness indicates that high probability of the mrt estimates is close to that of the median the occurrence frequency of nse distribution conditioned on the median mrt in fig 4 lower left shows higher frequency for larger nse values as summarized in table 4 mean of the nse conditioned on the median mrt is larger than 0 8 in 73 16 out of 22 sub basins which indicates high stability and reliability in the mrt estimation and the associated variables thus the median mrt was adopted for estimating bfi and other associated variables such as subsurface water storage as shown in table 4 the median mrts range from 11 0 days hd in the northern loess tableland to 415 2 days bld in the southern loess covering mountain over the sub basins tested for the sub basins in the dry loess hills and tableland hd yle jq hjh and yxz in the north of fig 1 the estimated mrts are relatively short ranging from several days to 2 months in contrast for the sub basins in the wet rocky mountain rm qsg sgk tlp and pl and loess covering mountain ak and ht in the southwest of fig 1 the estimated mrts are longer varying by 3 9 months however the largest mrts ranging between 6 and 18 months occur in the sub basins with mixtures of the loess tableland and loess covering mountain region in the southern area of the jrb ljh nx zjg and zh in fig 1 this indicates that sub basins with composite conditions of geomorphology in the wet climate lengthen the mrts according to the median mrts for the 22 sub basins the filtered baseflow qb and estimated bfi annual average dynamic storage s and baseflow recharge rate rr were listed in table 4 the estimated s ranges 0 10 hjh 90 63 zjg mcm year or approximately 0 60 hd 62 27 bld of the annual mean streamflow amount pas in table 4 the estimated rr ranges 0 07 hd 61 62 qsg mm year about 0 02 9 90 of annual precipitation amount pap in table 4 spatially the sub basins in the north loess plateau have shorter mrts and thus smaller qb bfi s and rr in comparison with the sub basins in the south rocky mountain and loess covering mountain region the average mrts for the north sub basins no 13 22 in table 4 is 57 days corresponding to 0 54 m3 s for qb and 0 40 for bfi and producing 2 41 mcm yr for s and 1 66 mm yr for rr much smaller than the averages of 213 days for mrts 1 55 m3 s for qb 0 59 for bfi 27 5 mcm yr for s and 30 4 mm yr for rr in the south sub basins no 1 12 in table 4 4 3 regionalization of mrt the marked variations of mrts over the 22 sub basins are consistent with the dramatic variations of climate landscape features sub basin mrts and their climate landscape descriptors were statistically tested in terms of pearson s correlation coefficients r and the associated significance values p as shown in table 5 it indicates that mrts are significantly correlated with the descriptors of p glt glm lfr and ssd at the 0 05 significance level in which p glt glm and ssd are tested to be significant at the significance level of 0 01 due to the complex structure of interconnections among the descriptors the actual relationships between mrts and the descriptors are frequently masked in this study a stepwise backward selection method was applied to select the best fit models logno ga and wei that quantity relationship between mrts and independent predictors as summarized in table 6 all three candidate models give good fits with r2 ranging 0 89 0 91 and a good performance in ungauged site prediction according to the results of cross validation with r cv 2 ranging 0 79 0 83 additionally the three models select similar explanatory variables for mrts estimation according to the worm plots fig 5 for a good fit the data points should be clustered along the red solid line but within the two dashed black lines which correspond to the 95 confidence limits the three candidate models are acceptable at the 95 confidence level although the model with wei distribution best captures variation of mrts over the tested sub basins results of multicollinearity test indicate all vif 10 and det greater than 0 001 table 7 illustrating there is no multicollinearity between the explanatory variables of all the three candidate models comparatively the performance of the model with ga distribution is best with the highest goodness of fit r2 0 91 and cross validation r cv 2 0 83 in table 6 and graphically illustrated in fig 6 so ga distribution was selected for mrts estimation and the identified main controlling factors are climate p topography tre geomorphology glp ghs and glm and land use cover lcr tables 6 and 7 according to the developed models shown in tables 5 and 6 mrts are positively correlated with p tre glm and lcr and negatively with glp and ghs it indicates that the wetter sub basins accompanying with areas with larger relative elevation tre higher ratio of loess covered mountain glm and permanent crop lcr have longer mrts in contrast the sub basins occupied by a higher ratio of low plains glp and steeper hillslopes ghs have shorter mrts in comparison to the univariate correlation analysis in table 5 the multiply regression model derived from gamlss analysis provides insight into the interactive nature of climate landscape factors 5 discussion and conclusions mrt is a fundamentally important catchment metric for understanding hydrological processes which can reflect the integrated catchment response to precipitation variation in terms of flow and storage dynamics in this study taking the jrb as an example and using routine observations of streamflow we estimated mrts from iuh of the baseflow with parameters calibrated using a match test between acfs derived from the filtered base flow series and from the iuh parameters under a glue framework the most important landscape controls of mrt were identified through correlation analysis and regression models regionalization of mrts provides us a reliable path to evaluate hydraulic characteristics in ungauged catchments the uncertainty in baseflow mrt estimation induced by unmeasurable effective rainfall is unavoidable regardless of the statistical method used e g cross correlation and spectral analysis or conceptual model e g iuh model in this study focusing on the structural relationship between the stochastic model and iuh targeting the best match of baseflow acfs derived from parameters associated with baseflow separation and iuh we provide a reasonable approach to estimate hydrological response function and thus infer mrt using routine streamflow observations nevertheless there is high equifinality in the parameter sets used in the iuh and the filter approach for determination of mrt according to the glue analysis numerous combinations of α n and k values were adopted for baseflow mrt estimation the insensitive parameter of α controlling baseflow separation possibly varies from basin to basin tan et al 2009 li et al 2014 within the most acceptable range of α 0 90 0 95 nathan and mcmahon 1990 uncertainty of the sensitive parameters of n and k could lead to a large range of mrt estimation e g around 307 8 552 8 days at bld sub basin at the confidence level of 90 nevertheless the median mrt derived from acceptable parameter sets proved to be stable and reliable in the estimation of mrt for different catchments our mrt values in the study basin are similar to previous estimations using other hydrological dynamic storage approaches for example the groundwater resident time ranges from 34 to 342 days estimated by the baseflow recession analysis technique over sub basins in wuding river bain in the loess plateau zhu et al 2010 our s estimates based on mrts ranges 0 10 90 63 mcm year over the 22 sub basins or approximately 0 60 62 27 of the annual mean streamflow amount and rr estimates range from 0 07 to 61 62 mm year about 0 02 9 90 of annual precipitation amount this estimated range of rr covers the previous estimation of rr in a range of 9 18 mm year by using one dimensional soil moisture model and detail soil moisture observations at changwu agro ecological station in the gully regions of the loess plateau huang and gallichand 2006 however our estimated rr in the loess plateau sub basins for 12 22 in table 4 is less than the estimates of 33 and 55 mm derived from the tracer based methods e g a chloride mass balance at xifeng and guyuan in the loess plateau with similar climate huang and pang 2011 it can be inferred that the thick loess soils could store a large proportion of older water that is released over a longer period of time the mrts ranging from 11 to 415 days over the 22 sub basins reflects the highly heterogeneous climate landscape features controlling baseflow processes mrts generally decrease toward the north where precipitation becomes lower and hydrograph is more flashy i e less baseflow the shorter mrts in the range of 11 to 36 days are spread in the north loess platea areas such as hd jq yle and hjh with the sub basin areas ranging 528 4640 km2 the longer mrts are located in the south where baseflow accounts for a larger portion of streamflow more than 50 mrts regionalization indicates that the wetter sub basins accompanied with areas of larger relative elevation tre higher ratio of loess covered mountains glm and permanent crop lcr have longer mrts in contrast the sub basins occupied by a higher ratio of low plains glp and steeper hillslopes ghs have shorter mrts complex geomorphology increases the mrts e g the longest mrts within the range of 258 to 397 days are located in the loess covered mountainous sub basins the interplay between precipitation topography geomorphology and land use captures the mrt characteristics and thus the dynamic storage linkage with runoff response i e how the catchment hydraulic behavior is transmitted climate topography and geomorphology were identified as three first order controls on recharge baseflow response processes according to the significance level in the regression analysis climate indicated by mean annual precipitation volume was identified as the dominant control on baseflow hydraulic behaviors by both higher univariate correlation analysis and regression analysis that may closely relate with the controlling role of climate on the characteristics of the soil profile and thus the water content and storage capacity wang et al 2010 2011 meanwhile it also controls both timing and volume of recharge processes botter et al 2010 areas in the region with a higher ratio of low plains glp and steeper hillslopes ghs will normally show a flashy response to rainfall recharge and have a higher probability of floods and or landslides xu et al 2017 however rough terrain detected by larger relative elevation tre reveals strong correlation with longer response time of the subsurface hydrological processes that may be because steeper regions normally have more integrated drainage networks and higher storage capacities such as in the lm region pilgrim et al 1988 shi and shao 2000 these identified factors that showing controlling influences on recharge baseflow response in this study were coincidently with factors that controlling the temporal dynamics features of layer averaged soil moisture demonstrated by qiu et al 2001 and the topographic zonation of infiltration characteristics indicated by li et al 1995 in the study areas that are hydro geologically similar to the jrb in the study region current knowledge indicate that the predominant runoff mechanism is hortonian overland flow where the rate of rainfall exceeds the potential rate of infiltration kang et al 2001 the spatial differences in infiltration capacity cause areas producing runoff were mostly in the gully bottoms and along stream channels pilgrim et al 1988 fang et al 2008 precipitation topography and geomorphology features display significant effect on runoff generation in the loess region fang et al 2008 also on deep soil content wang et al 2012 and subsequently on baseflow recharge a key question is how human activities e g change of land use can affect catchment hydraulic behaviors such as baseflow mrt and dynamic storage in the semiarid loess plateau region land use can significantly affect aspects of the dried soil layer that can interfere in the cycle in soil plant atmosphere systems by preventing water interchange between upper soil layer and groundwater wang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 the cultivation of permanent crop increases the depth of the responsive soil and decreases the thickness of dry soil layer and hence maintains larger soil water content and higher more stable field capacity compared with grassland and forest wang et al 2011 that is consistent with the longer response time in regions with higher percentage of permanent crop area inferred in this study meanwhile irrigation may enhance recharge and induce an increase in the dynamic storage the estimation of mrt and dynamic storage that depends on climate landscape factors provides very important information for evaluation of spatial distribution of water resources and thus will be helpful for making measures for sustainable water resources utilization and ecological protection in

7534,mean response time mrt is a metric describing the propagation of catchment hydraulic behavior that reflects both hydro climatic conditions and catchment characteristics to provide a comprehensive understanding of catchment response over a longer time scale for hydraulic processes the mrt function for baseflow generation was derived using an instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh model that describes the subsurface response to effective rainfall inputs iuh parameters were estimated based on the match test between the autocorrelation function acfs derived from the filtered base flow time series and from the iuh parameters under the glue framework regionalization of mrt was conducted using estimates and hydroclimate landscape indices in 22 sub basins of the jinghe river basin jrb in the loess plateau of northwest china results indicate there is strong equifinality in determination of the best parameter sets but the median values of the mrt estimates are relatively stable in the acceptable range of the parameters mrts vary markedly over the studied sub basins ranging from tens of days to more than a year climate topography and geomorphology were identified as three first order controls on recharge baseflow response processes human activities involving the cultivation of permanent crops may elongate the baseflow mrt and hence increase the dynamic storage cross validation suggests the model can be used to estimate mrts in ungauged catchments in similar regions of throughout the loess plateau the proposed method provides a systematic approach for mrt estimation and regionalization in terms of hydroclimate and catchment characteristics which is helpful in the sustainable water resources utilization and ecological protection in the loess plateau keywords baseflow separation mean response time instantaneous unit hydrograph regionalization the jinghe river basin 1 introduction streamflow is a commonly available integrated signal of surface and subsurface flow observed at the outlet of a basin due to strong heterogeneity of precipitation and catchment conditions in space and time precipitation is subject to rather complex transmission processes in a catchment thus hydrologists have made great efforts to quantify water travel times as metrics for capturing the integrated nature of the streamflow generation processes in terms of the basin scale partitioning storage and release of water to streams gupta and mesa 1988 kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 given the spatial variability in landscape characteristics and precipitation inputs the probability distribution function pdf of travel times have been applied to provide a general stochastic description of runoff generation and hydrologic response gupta and mesa 1988 focused on flow flux the pdf of travel time also defined as the response time distribution rtd indicates the speed and volume of outflow with which a catchment responds to water input precipitation gupta and mesa 1988 botter et al 2010 roa garćıa and weiler 2010 in recent years chemical and isotopic signatures of streamflow have been used to show that a sizable proportion of runoff from the hydrologic response of catchment transport volumes is comprised of old water already stored in the control volume i e water particles injected at times preceding the event were observed in the runoff weiler et al 2003 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 botter et al 2010 mcdonnell and beven 2014 focused on water particles the pdf of the travel time also defined as the travel or transit time distribution ttd describes the distribution of times that each molecule of water takes to arrive at the catchment outlet from all locations in the catchment mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 integrating how catchment properties control its hydrologic and chemical responses botter et al 2010 the mean transit time mtt derived from the chemical and isotopic signatures in a catchment is usually much longer than the hydraulic response of to rainfall inputs which can be defined in terms of a mean response time mrt botter et al 2010 roa garćıa and weiler 2010 mcdonnell and beven 2014 as a fundamental and useful metric for describing the transmission of catchment hydraulic behavior mcdonnell and beven 2014 hale and mcdonnell 2016 the catchment mrt can be estimated only using commonly observed rainfall and streamflow data the popularly used pdf for the rainfall runoff response is the instantaneous unit hydrographs iuh which is the runoff hydrograph in response to a unit of rainfall instantaneously injected into the basin gupta and mesa 1988 botter et al 2010 since the pdf of mrt e g the iuh can be determined through some simple conceptual frameworks e g linear storage reservoirs nash 1957 it provides a tool to develop simple and effective rainfall runoff models beven 2011 hydrological similarity metrics and runoff estimation for an ungauged catchment gupta and mesa 1988 rodríguez iturbe et al 1979 an assumption of the iuh scheme is linear and time invariant the linear iuh refers to a linear input output system whose output for a linear combination of inputs are the same as a linear combination of individual responses to those inputs the time invariant iuh means that the output does not depend on when an input was applied beven 2011 however the hydrograph consisting of surface flow and subsurface flow usually responds to precipitation in a non linear way weiler and mcdonnell 2006 beven 2011 the nonlinear rainfall runoff response mostly arises from the dynamic interaction between the saturated unsaturated subsurface flow and surface flow botter et al 2010 beven 2011 and different time scales of the responses although many studies have derived various non linear equations to capture rainfall runoff response behaviors e g amorocho and brandstetter 1971 jakeman and hornberger 1993 sivapalan et al 2002 an effective way is to separate streamflow into various components for minimizing the non linear effect as far as possible for the baseflow response the time invariant assumption may be not valid due to seasonal variability and or longer term trend from climate change and human activities one effective approach to eliminate seasonality and or trend in the recharge and baseflow simultaneously is via the classical decomposition model under a stochastic framework e g sarino and serrano 1990 the decomposition from the long term series obtains the mean state of the catchment storage and a random series which can be used for estimation of the mean mrt over the long term period by the classical iuh the simplicity of the iuh approach may result in substantial errors in mrt estimation such errors can arise from the assumptions made in development of the differential equations of pdf and the inherent simplifications in the streamflow process effective rainfall estimation jakeman and hornberger 1993 botter et al 2007 streamflow observation data and the parameter calibration therefore there is also a need to evaluate the mrt uncertainty associated with such errors sarino and serrano 1990 previous studies illustrated that catchment characteristics such as soils soulsby et al 2006 topography mcguire et al 2005 geology hale and mcdonnell 2016 vegetation land use pilgrim et al 1988 or a suite of controls hrachowitz et al 2009 exert dominant influences on the subsurface runoff processes and thus spatial variability in mrt in the loess plateau of northwest china the transitional climate ranging from semi humid to semi arid and highly erodible loess soils result in dramatically spatial and temporal variations of geomorphic and hydrological features the main geomorphic landforms on the loess plateau are tableland a large flat surface hill ridge and various gullies in the region of the vast loess tableland normally with thick soils and dry climate the infiltration wetting front generally reaches only shallow depths e g several meters gates et al 2011 peng et al 2015 and most infiltrated water is lost for evapotranspiration chen et al 2007 in the low loess gullies or nearby the stream network most infiltrated water becomes baseflow gates et al 2011 the precipitation is mainly concentrated in july august and september accounting for 60 70 of total annual precipitation mostly in the form of high intensity storms shi and shao 2000 baseflow is the primary water resource utilized in the region and varies markedly in space and time under natural and anthropogenic influences generally in areas with high gully density ground cracking is also well developed and soil erosion intensity is high and conversely concentrated recharge for baseflow meanwhile human activities such as agricultural land uses and re forestation can significantly affect soil water dynamic chen et al 2007 that partitions water fluxes at the land surface and recharge of groundwater for instance tree and shrub plantations may result in reductions in subsurface recharge in afforested areas in the loess plateau gates et al 2011 since late 1990s chinese government has promoted re forestation and sediment storage dam building in the region for preventing soil erosion it is important to know how the remarkable variability in climate and landscape affects streamflow characteristics and water storage in this important region regionalization of the spatial pattern of hydrological processes can identify how and to what extent climate landscape factors control basin hydrological functions which can in turn provide important information for hydrologic prediction and water resource management in ungauged catchments hrachowitz et al 2009 garambois et al 2015 thus estimation of the spatial variations in mrt and subsurface storage has the potential to provide very useful insights into regional water resources and can contribute to planning for sustainable water resource utilization and ecological protection in the loess plateau thus the main objective of this research is to comprehensively analyze how to estimate and regionalize baseflow mrt in the region using routine observations of long term streamflow and geomorphologic data and how reliable the mrt estimated and regionalized results are the analysis and evaluation were performed in the jinghe river basin jrb one of main basins in the loess plateau center of northwest china the specific aims of this study include 1 to obtain stationary baseflow series by baseflow separation and de seasonalization operations 2 to estimate the iuh based mrt and its associated storage and recharge over the jrb 3 to regionalize mrt by regression analysis using identified landscape variables that control mrt and 4 to verify the proposed methods using cross validation and uncertainty analysis 2 study area and data the jrb located in the central loess plateau of northwestern china 34 24 37 20 n 106 20 108 48 e is one of the main tributaries of the yellow river fig 1 a the jrb has an area of 45 373 km2 the climate is dominated by the continental monsoon a large proportion of the jrb is characterized by a semi arid climate toward the north an exception is the southwest boundary which has a semi humid climate the average annual precipitation increases from 250 mm in the north to 710 mm in the south and conversely the average annual potential evapotranspiration decreases from 1200 mm in the north to 950 mm in the south nearly 60 70 of precipitation occurs between june and september the land surface elevation of the basin averages 1424 m with a large spatial variation from 441 to 2922 m it decreases gradually from the northwest to the south fig 1a the dominant landform is the loess tableland lt and loess hill lh 41 7 and 48 8 of the basin respectively fig 1b in the semi arid area and the remainder is rocky mountain rm and loess covered mountain lm 4 3 and 5 2 of the basin respectively fig 1b in the semi humid area the rm and lm are often referred to as a wet island providing an important regional water source yu et al 2009 even though this occupies only a small portion of the overall basin the basin slope is 12 3 on average steeper in the higher rocky mountainous areas and the loess hills and gullies but flatter in the loess tableland and broad river valleys quaternary loess is the most widely distributed soil type covering more than 80 of the total basin where the deposits are very thick 50 80 m and famous for soil erosion the lt and lh areas are occupied by a higher percentage of sand and a lower percentage of clay accounting for about 50 and 14 21 of the basin respectively comparatively the rm areas have a lower percentage of sand and a higher percentage of clay resulting in the spatial heterogeneity of soils table 1 toward northwestern drier areas vegetation cover ratios reduce and dominant vegetation change from forest to shrub timber prairie and desert grass the land use of the basin is mostly farmland in the lt and broad valleys and forest and grass in the high elevation areas of rm and lh respectively in this study 22 sub basins with areas ranging 60 4640 km2 were available in terms of hydrological gauging stations in the jrb and used for analysis fig 1a and table 1 streamflow data used in this study are daily observation time series provided by the bureau of hydrology ministry of water resources p r china to minimize problems from varying record lengths or data resolution for capturing different levels of climatic variability hrachowitz et al 2009 16 gauging stations with the same streamflow record of 11 years during the period of 1977 1987 were used for mrt estimation an additional five stations with a record length of 4 8 years over the same period were also used table 1 the sub basin annual precipitation in the corresponding periods was calculated based on 61 rainfall stations fig 1c using the thiessen polygons method in that each study area is divided into polygons

algorithm chapman and maxwell 1996 and the eckhardt filter eckhardt 2005 in this study the one parameter rdf introduced by lyne and hollick 1979 was used for baseflow separation due to its simplicity 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered surface flow at time step t q t is the original streamflow and α is the filter parameter the filtered base flow is thus defined as q t q t the filter can be passed over the streamflow data three times forward backward and forward the filter parameter α affects the degree of attenuation and the number of passes determining the degree of smoothing the most acceptable range of α is 0 90 0 95 nathan and mcmahon 1990 since the filtered baseflow series may be nonstationary due to the markedly seasonal variability in the study region de seasonalization hipel and mcleod 1995 was achieved by subtracting the seasonal means and dividing the seasonal standard deviation of baseflow series let y y t t z be the daily baseflow series the mean and standard deviation for the mth season are calculated by μ m 1 n i 1 n y i m and σ m 1 n i 1 n y i m μ m 2 respectively in which y i m is the average baseflow in the mth month in the i year n is the length of years of the observations thus the daily de seasonalized baseflow series y i m d in the ith year mth month and dth day is 2 y i m d y i m d μ m σ m where y i m d is the daily baseflow obtained by lh filter the de seasonalized baseflow series y i m d denoted by y t and thereafter is regarded as a stationary time series 3 2 derivation of mrt from iuh for the de seasonalized baseflow series the de seasonalized baseflow as the output signal y t at time t comes from input signal x t τ at time t τ i e response of baseflow to recharge with a lag time τ mathematically y t can be estimated through the convolution integral of the transfer function g τ and x t τ over time 3 y t 0 g τ x t τ d τ where τ is the time lag between input and output the transfer function g τ represents the lumped response time distribution rtd when the input can be treated as a sequence of uniform and instantaneous i e daily signals the basin output can be simply modeled by a succession of routings through linear storage reservoirs dooge 1959 nash 1957 e g a cascade of n linear reservoirs each with storage constant k thus the transfer function g τ is exactly the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh as popularly expressed dooge 1959 nash 1957 4 g t 1 k n γ n e t k t n 1 where γ is the gamma function and t is the time of impulses instantaneous input since iuh or the transfer function interprets the probability distribution function of the time for the input signal effective rainfall pulse injected at a given time reaching the outlet rodríguez iturbe and valdes 1979 mrt can be estimated by the first moment of the transfer function eq 4 that equals to nk dooge 1959 nash 1957 3 3 iuh parameter estimation iuh parameters n and k are popularly calibrated in terms of the observed streamflow discharge and the estimated effective rainfall since mrt can be alternatively treated as the lag time between precipitation input and streamflow output signal under assumption of time invariant mrt can be estimated using correlation and or spectral analysis on input and output signatures adji and bahtiar 2016 zhang et al 2013 in this study n and k were calibrated based on the match test between autocorrelation function acfs estimated from the de seasonalized baseflow series and derived from the iuh parameters of n and k under the glue framework beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 given the de seasonalized time series y t its autocorrelation function acf can be directly estimated as follows 5 r τ t 1 n τ y t τ y y t y t 1 n y t y 2 where r τ is acf estimation by the de seasonalized time series y t at lag τ y is mean of the time series τ is lag time where τ 0 1 m m n for a stationary baseflow series as the output of a linear time invariant system its acf ρ τ depending on iuh parameters can be expressed as follows details can be referred to quimpo 1974 6 ρ τ k 2 π τ 2 τ k n γ n γ 2 n 1 b n 1 2 τ k where b n 1 2 τ k is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order n 1 2 n and k are the parameters of iuh expressed as eq 4 therefore after the observed streamflow series was filtered and de seasonalized given the filtered parameter of α the persistent characteristics of the baseflow response represented by the acf can be directly calculated by r τ in eq 5 and derived from ρ τ in eq 6 given the parameters of n and k then the three parameters of α n and k involved in acf can be calibrated by matching the persistence of r τ with ρ τ according to the likelihood measure calculation based on modeling residuals the acceptability of each matching can be evaluated here the comparable likelihood measure of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used for comparing the behaviors of different matching acfs 7 nse 1 τ 1 τ max r τ ρ τ 2 τ 1 τ max r τ r 2 where r τ and ρ τ are acfs at the τ lag from the estimation of eqs 5 and 6 respectively r is the mean value of r τ at all the considered lags τ 1 2 τ max in this study the maximum lag τ max was set to be the point once the value of r τ is smaller than its upper significance bound at the significance level of 0 05 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 was used for analyzing uncertainty and determining acceptability of the acfs matches given the feasible ranges of α along with n and k to ensure a sufficient sample of the matches was retained to form a meaningful cumulative distribution of predictions the threshold efficiency measure of 0 7 ritter and monoz carpena 2013 is chosen i e the goodness of fit of acfs is rejected when nse 0 7 prior information of the parameters of α n and k such as their expected distribution and feasible ranges plays a crucial role on the acfs matching test the parameter of the recursive filter α for baseflow separation may markedly affect estimation of iuh parameters of n and k however there is no objective way of assessing how well the filter predicts actual baseflow even though the most acceptable range of 0 9 0 95 and some suggested values such as 0 925 by arnold et al 1995 and nathan and mcmahon 1990 have previously been used there are not specific ranges for n and k as they vary with basin characteristics according to the parametric plots of the acf responses to white noise of linear system for different values of n using τ k as a dimensionless variable derived by quimpo 1974 the feasible ranges for n and k are set as 0 5 2 0 and 1 τ max the maximum lag for ρ τ defined in eq 6 respectively therefore using the most acceptable ranges of α 0 9 0 95 n 0 5 2 0 and k 1 τ max these three parameters were calibrated jointly using the trial and error method combined with the framework of glue as follows 1 separate the baseflow using the lh filter i e eq 1 given a specific value of parameter α i that alternatively changes within the range 0 90 0 95 with an incremental step of 0 002 i e i 1 n n 0 95 0 90 0 002 1 26 2 estimate acf of r i τ by eq 5 in terms of the de seasonalized baseflow series from the filtered series using α i the maximum lag τ max i for r i τ was set to be the point once the value of r i τ is smaller than its upper significance bound at the significance level of 0 05 3 calculate acf of ρ i j τ by eq 6 given a specific value for the pairs of n and k that alternatively change within the range of 0 5 2 0 for n and 1 τ max i for k with an incremental step at 0 1 and 1 respectively here n and k were sampled from a predefined uniform distribution with m 2 0 5 0 1 1 τ max i monte carlo realizations i e j 1 2 m 4 calculate the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse i j based on r i τ and ρ i j τ estimations from the procedures of 2 and 3 respectively 5 repeat 1 4 to obtain nse i j for all the specific α i and n k j given the acceptable matches that nse 0 7 the calibrated parameter sets of α io and n k jo were obtained therefore there will be a large number of retained parameter sets to derive the glue estimates of mrt typically the glue derived median prediction is generally a better predictor than the best prediction with the highest nse blasone et al 2008 beven and freer 2001 prediction uncertainty bounds were defined as percentiles of the derived prediction from the universe of behavioral parameter combinations blasone et al 2008 here the 90 confidence bounds were defined by using the 5th and 95th percentiles of the prediction derived from the retained parameter subsets and median values of nk in each sub basin were treated as mrt estimates and used in the following related analysis 3 4 mrt related storage and recharge the mean dynamic storage changes driving the baseflow variations as the saturated zone rises and falls can be estimated by product of the mrt and the mean baseflow 8 s 0 0864 mrt q b where s is the annual mean dynamic storage corresponding to the baseflow processes million cubic meter mcm mrt is the baseflow mean response time days and qb is the mean daily baseflow m3 s and equal to baseflow index bfi multiplying streamflow discharge q the mean dynamic storage captures the integrated nature of baseflow generation processes under the assumption that the input baseflow recharge is spatially uniform the basin scale recharge rate rr can be further evaluated as follows 9 rr s a 1000 where a is the basin area km2 and rr is the baseflow recharge rate mm year 3 5 regionalization of baseflow mrt 3 5 1 basin landscape descriptors for regionalization of mrt eighteen descriptors of the climate and landscape in the 22 sub basins were selected in table 1 the selected descriptors can be classified into indicators of climate topography geomorphology land use cover and soils in addition to sub basin area a km2 the climatic indicator is the areal mean of annual precipitation amount p during the study period the topographic descriptors include sub basin average elevation tel slope tsl and relative elevation tre the relative elevation tre is defined as the height above the nearest drainage channel and is the normalized topography according to the local relative heights along the drainage network refer to rennó et al 2008 in details these topographic descriptors are generated using a dem with a resolution of 90 m http srtm csi cgiar org geomorphologic indicators are represented by the areal percentage of loess tableland glt loess hill glh loess covering mountain glm and rocky mountain grm estimated according to the geomorphic map of the jrb based on slope sl and relative elevation re the geomorphology was further defined as low plain sl 10 and re 20 m high plain sl 10 and re greater than 20 m or hillslope sl greater than 10 indicated by the areal percentage of low plain glp high plain ghp and hillslope ghs in each sub basin the low plain is located in the flat valley near rivers while the high plain in the loess tableland and loess terrace land use cover indicators are classified by three categories of forest grassland and permanent crop represented by the areal percentage of forest lfr grassland lgr and permanent crop lcr respectively the land use cover information in the study area was extracted from the land use and cover change lucc data of china in 1980 soils are characterized by three orders of particle size sand sd with particle size in the range of 0 063 2 0 mm silt st with particle size in the range of 0 002 0 063 mm and clay cl with particle size 0 002 mm denoted by sub basin average content of sd st and cl as ssd sst and scl respectively data of both land use cover and soils come from data centre for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn 3 5 2 mrt regionalization by regression analysis identifying the relationship between the predictors and the descriptors e g mrts vs the above basin indicators is a popular method used for regionalization in this study the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework was applied to develop the relationship between the mrts and sub basin descriptors gamlss assumes that independent observations o i for i 1 2 n have distribution function f o o i θ i where θ i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ p i is a vector of p distribution parameters accounting for location scale and shape random variable characteristics rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 the distribution parameters are related to covariates by monotonic link functions g l for l 1 2 p which can be modeled as a function of selected explanatory variables in this study two parameters distributions using log normal distribution logno the gamma distribution ga and the weibull distribution wei were selected as candidates to capture the possible characteristic of skewness in the dependent variable of mrt table 2 the relationship between distribution parameters of μ mean value of mrts and the sub basin descriptors can be modeled as 10 g μ φ β where μ is the mean value of mrts given a specific distribution e g logno ga or wei g is the link function here it is log φ is a matrix of explanatory variables β is the vectors of coefficients of the models in this study linear terms were used to capture this dependence to identify the relative importance of various sub basin indicators for mrts the stepwise backward model was applied to select explanatory variables using akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 to ensure that the fitted models can adequately describe the systematic structure with the white noise residuals the first two statistical moments of the residuals and the probability plot correlation coefficient i e the filliben correlation coefficient filliben 1975 were examined the worm plot van buuren and fredriks 2001 was used as a visual analysis of the residuals all of the calculations were performed using the r based gamlss package http mirror bjtu edu cn cran both aic and nse were used to evaluate model goodness of fit to evaluate the performance of the fitted model in mrt predictions at ungauged sites the error statistics from leave one out cross validation stone 1974 efron and gong 1983 were used as the measure of the prediction errors the cross validation prediction error was estimated by 11 v cv 1 n i 1 n mrt i i mrt i 2 where mrti is the mrt estimate at sub basin i obtained in section 3 2 which represents the true value of the mrt mrt i i is the mrt prediction at sub basin i by the regression model thus the coefficient of determination based on cross validation is laaha and bloschl 2006 12 r cv 2 1 v cv v o where v o is the spatial variance of the observed mrt over all the tested sub basins estimated using the true value of the mrt to avoid the adverse influence of highly correlated descriptors the best fit model was examined for the multi collinearity using the variance inflation factor vif and the determinant of the correlation matrix det belsley 1991 when vif 10 and det greater than 0 001 it implies that no multicollinearity is present hrachowitz et al 2009 4 results 4 1 regional streamflow features the marked differences in streamflow variability at the 22 sites are evident in terms of flow duration curves from the daily observation data during the study period fig 2 for example for the hd sub basin with the largest percentage of the loess tableland glt in the driest north streamflow shows the sharpest rise and decline of the hydrograph the red thick line as climate shifts toward the wetter south and the geomorphologic conditions change to the loess hilly region e g yle in the yellow thick line the loess covering mountain region e g bld in the green thick line and the rocky mountain region e g sgk in the blue thick line streamflow variation is attenuated and the flow duration curves become relatively smooth 4 2 sub basin parameters and mrts as the lh filter parameter of α is set to lie within the range of 0 90 0 95 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the acceptable range of iuh parameters of n and k that meet the nse threshold of 0 7 for the acfs match test were calibrated in table 3 the numerous retained parameter sets from the monte carlo analysis can be used for estimation of the mrt and associated variables the highest nse for the acfs match test is mostly greater than 0 9 over the tested sub basins and more than half of the sub basins have nse larger than 0 8 indicating good fits of the acfs from the estimations by eqs 5 and 6 the scatter plots of combinations of α n and k within the acceptable ranges vs the corresponding nse values were illustrated in fig 3 taking the four representative sub basins selected the same as fig 2 an example a variety of combinations of α n and k values satisfy the nse 0 7 criteria indicating strong equifinality in determination of the best parameter sets generally n and k are more sensitive and identifiable than α as shown in fig 3 the posterior cumulative distribution of parameter α shows less deviation from the original uniform distribution in contrast the cumulative distributions of n and k show greater deviation from the original uniform distribution this means that the persistence characteristics of baseflow series represented by acfs are not sensitive to the filter parameter α but sensitive to the iuh parameters of n and k fig 4 shows the scatter plot of mrt and bfi simulation from combinations of the acceptable parameter ranges against nse values and the histogram plots for mrt estimates in the four typical sub basins it illustrates that numerous mrt and bfi correspond to the nse larger than 0 7 table 3 summaries results from the glue simulations of acfs for all sub basins number of behavioral sets nse 0 7 ranges 195 tlp 42 313 ljh although nse for the best match of acfs could be higher than 0 9 for the most sub basins its occurrence frequency is lower e g percentage of acceptable behaviors reduces as nse increases in table 3 to find the most feasible mrts in each of the sub basins statistical frequency for the various mrts occurrence in the behavioral sets are shown in fig 4 upper right the significant skewness indicates that high probability of the mrt estimates is close to that of the median the occurrence frequency of nse distribution conditioned on the median mrt in fig 4 lower left shows higher frequency for larger nse values as summarized in table 4 mean of the nse conditioned on the median mrt is larger than 0 8 in 73 16 out of 22 sub basins which indicates high stability and reliability in the mrt estimation and the associated variables thus the median mrt was adopted for estimating bfi and other associated variables such as subsurface water storage as shown in table 4 the median mrts range from 11 0 days hd in the northern loess tableland to 415 2 days bld in the southern loess covering mountain over the sub basins tested for the sub basins in the dry loess hills and tableland hd yle jq hjh and yxz in the north of fig 1 the estimated mrts are relatively short ranging from several days to 2 months in contrast for the sub basins in the wet rocky mountain rm qsg sgk tlp and pl and loess covering mountain ak and ht in the southwest of fig 1 the estimated mrts are longer varying by 3 9 months however the largest mrts ranging between 6 and 18 months occur in the sub basins with mixtures of the loess tableland and loess covering mountain region in the southern area of the jrb ljh nx zjg and zh in fig 1 this indicates that sub basins with composite conditions of geomorphology in the wet climate lengthen the mrts according to the median mrts for the 22 sub basins the filtered baseflow qb and estimated bfi annual average dynamic storage s and baseflow recharge rate rr were listed in table 4 the estimated s ranges 0 10 hjh 90 63 zjg mcm year or approximately 0 60 hd 62 27 bld of the annual mean streamflow amount pas in table 4 the estimated rr ranges 0 07 hd 61 62 qsg mm year about 0 02 9 90 of annual precipitation amount pap in table 4 spatially the sub basins in the north loess plateau have shorter mrts and thus smaller qb bfi s and rr in comparison with the sub basins in the south rocky mountain and loess covering mountain region the average mrts for the north sub basins no 13 22 in table 4 is 57 days corresponding to 0 54 m3 s for qb and 0 40 for bfi and producing 2 41 mcm yr for s and 1 66 mm yr for rr much smaller than the averages of 213 days for mrts 1 55 m3 s for qb 0 59 for bfi 27 5 mcm yr for s and 30 4 mm yr for rr in the south sub basins no 1 12 in table 4 4 3 regionalization of mrt the marked variations of mrts over the 22 sub basins are consistent with the dramatic variations of climate landscape features sub basin mrts and their climate landscape descriptors were statistically tested in terms of pearson s correlation coefficients r and the associated significance values p as shown in table 5 it indicates that mrts are significantly correlated with the descriptors of p glt glm lfr and ssd at the 0 05 significance level in which p glt glm and ssd are tested to be significant at the significance level of 0 01 due to the complex structure of interconnections among the descriptors the actual relationships between mrts and the descriptors are frequently masked in this study a stepwise backward selection method was applied to select the best fit models logno ga and wei that quantity relationship between mrts and independent predictors as summarized in table 6 all three candidate models give good fits with r2 ranging 0 89 0 91 and a good performance in ungauged site prediction according to the results of cross validation with r cv 2 ranging 0 79 0 83 additionally the three models select similar explanatory variables for mrts estimation according to the worm plots fig 5 for a good fit the data points should be clustered along the red solid line but within the two dashed black lines which correspond to the 95 confidence limits the three candidate models are acceptable at the 95 confidence level although the model with wei distribution best captures variation of mrts over the tested sub basins results of multicollinearity test indicate all vif 10 and det greater than 0 001 table 7 illustrating there is no multicollinearity between the explanatory variables of all the three candidate models comparatively the performance of the model with ga distribution is best with the highest goodness of fit r2 0 91 and cross validation r cv 2 0 83 in table 6 and graphically illustrated in fig 6 so ga distribution was selected for mrts estimation and the identified main controlling factors are climate p topography tre geomorphology glp ghs and glm and land use cover lcr tables 6 and 7 according to the developed models shown in tables 5 and 6 mrts are positively correlated with p tre glm and lcr and negatively with glp and ghs it indicates that the wetter sub basins accompanying with areas with larger relative elevation tre higher ratio of loess covered mountain glm and permanent crop lcr have longer mrts in contrast the sub basins occupied by a higher ratio of low plains glp and steeper hillslopes ghs have shorter mrts in comparison to the univariate correlation analysis in table 5 the multiply regression model derived from gamlss analysis provides insight into the interactive nature of climate landscape factors 5 discussion and conclusions mrt is a fundamentally important catchment metric for understanding hydrological processes which can reflect the integrated catchment response to precipitation variation in terms of flow and storage dynamics in this study taking the jrb as an example and using routine observations of streamflow we estimated mrts from iuh of the baseflow with parameters calibrated using a match test between acfs derived from the filtered base flow series and from the iuh parameters under a glue framework the most important landscape controls of mrt were identified through correlation analysis and regression models regionalization of mrts provides us a reliable path to evaluate hydraulic characteristics in ungauged catchments the uncertainty in baseflow mrt estimation induced by unmeasurable effective rainfall is unavoidable regardless of the statistical method used e g cross correlation and spectral analysis or conceptual model e g iuh model in this study focusing on the structural relationship between the stochastic model and iuh targeting the best match of baseflow acfs derived from parameters associated with baseflow separation and iuh we provide a reasonable approach to estimate hydrological response function and thus infer mrt using routine streamflow observations nevertheless there is high equifinality in the parameter sets used in the iuh and the filter approach for determination of mrt according to the glue analysis numerous combinations of α n and k values were adopted for baseflow mrt estimation the insensitive parameter of α controlling baseflow separation possibly varies from basin to basin tan et al 2009 li et al 2014 within the most acceptable range of α 0 90 0 95 nathan and mcmahon 1990 uncertainty of the sensitive parameters of n and k could lead to a large range of mrt estimation e g around 307 8 552 8 days at bld sub basin at the confidence level of 90 nevertheless the median mrt derived from acceptable parameter sets proved to be stable and reliable in the estimation of mrt for different catchments our mrt values in the study basin are similar to previous estimations using other hydrological dynamic storage approaches for example the groundwater resident time ranges from 34 to 342 days estimated by the baseflow recession analysis technique over sub basins in wuding river bain in the loess plateau zhu et al 2010 our s estimates based on mrts ranges 0 10 90 63 mcm year over the 22 sub basins or approximately 0 60 62 27 of the annual mean streamflow amount and rr estimates range from 0 07 to 61 62 mm year about 0 02 9 90 of annual precipitation amount this estimated range of rr covers the previous estimation of rr in a range of 9 18 mm year by using one dimensional soil moisture model and detail soil moisture observations at changwu agro ecological station in the gully regions of the loess plateau huang and gallichand 2006 however our estimated rr in the loess plateau sub basins for 12 22 in table 4 is less than the estimates of 33 and 55 mm derived from the tracer based methods e g a chloride mass balance at xifeng and guyuan in the loess plateau with similar climate huang and pang 2011 it can be inferred that the thick loess soils could store a large proportion of older water that is released over a longer period of time the mrts ranging from 11 to 415 days over the 22 sub basins reflects the highly heterogeneous climate landscape features controlling baseflow processes mrts generally decrease toward the north where precipitation becomes lower and hydrograph is more flashy i e less baseflow the shorter mrts in the range of 11 to 36 days are spread in the north loess platea areas such as hd jq yle and hjh with the sub basin areas ranging 528 4640 km2 the longer mrts are located in the south where baseflow accounts for a larger portion of streamflow more than 50 mrts regionalization indicates that the wetter sub basins accompanied with areas of larger relative elevation tre higher ratio of loess covered mountains glm and permanent crop lcr have longer mrts in contrast the sub basins occupied by a higher ratio of low plains glp and steeper hillslopes ghs have shorter mrts complex geomorphology increases the mrts e g the longest mrts within the range of 258 to 397 days are located in the loess covered mountainous sub basins the interplay between precipitation topography geomorphology and land use captures the mrt characteristics and thus the dynamic storage linkage with runoff response i e how the catchment hydraulic behavior is transmitted climate topography and geomorphology were identified as three first order controls on recharge baseflow response processes according to the significance level in the regression analysis climate indicated by mean annual precipitation volume was identified as the dominant control on baseflow hydraulic behaviors by both higher univariate correlation analysis and regression analysis that may closely relate with the controlling role of climate on the characteristics of the soil profile and thus the water content and storage capacity wang et al 2010 2011 meanwhile it also controls both timing and volume of recharge processes botter et al 2010 areas in the region with a higher ratio of low plains glp and steeper hillslopes ghs will normally show a flashy response to rainfall recharge and have a higher probability of floods and or landslides xu et al 2017 however rough terrain detected by larger relative elevation tre reveals strong correlation with longer response time of the subsurface hydrological processes that may be because steeper regions normally have more integrated drainage networks and higher storage capacities such as in the lm region pilgrim et al 1988 shi and shao 2000 these identified factors that showing controlling influences on recharge baseflow response in this study were coincidently with factors that controlling the temporal dynamics features of layer averaged soil moisture demonstrated by qiu et al 2001 and the topographic zonation of infiltration characteristics indicated by li et al 1995 in the study areas that are hydro geologically similar to the jrb in the study region current knowledge indicate that the predominant runoff mechanism is hortonian overland flow where the rate of rainfall exceeds the potential rate of infiltration kang et al 2001 the spatial differences in infiltration capacity cause areas producing runoff were mostly in the gully bottoms and along stream channels pilgrim et al 1988 fang et al 2008 precipitation topography and geomorphology features display significant effect on runoff generation in the loess region fang et al 2008 also on deep soil content wang et al 2012 and subsequently on baseflow recharge a key question is how human activities e g change of land use can affect catchment hydraulic behaviors such as baseflow mrt and dynamic storage in the semiarid loess plateau region land use can significantly affect aspects of the dried soil layer that can interfere in the cycle in soil plant atmosphere systems by preventing water interchange between upper soil layer and groundwater wang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 the cultivation of permanent crop increases the depth of the responsive soil and decreases the thickness of dry soil layer and hence maintains larger soil water content and higher more stable field capacity compared with grassland and forest wang et al 2011 that is consistent with the longer response time in regions with higher percentage of permanent crop area inferred in this study meanwhile irrigation may enhance recharge and induce an increase in the dynamic storage the estimation of mrt and dynamic storage that depends on climate landscape factors provides very important information for evaluation of spatial distribution of water resources and thus will be helpful for making measures for sustainable water resources utilization and ecological protection in
