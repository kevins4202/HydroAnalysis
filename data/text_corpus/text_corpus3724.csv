18620,groundwater is not only a vital resource but also one of the largest terrestrial aquatic ecosystems on earth however to date ecological criteria are often not considered in routine groundwater monitoring mainly because of the lack of suitable ecological assessment tools prokaryotic microorganisms are ubiquitous in groundwater ecosystems even under the harshest conditions making them ideal bioindicators for ecological monitoring we have developed a simple inexpensive approach that enables ecological groundwater monitoring based on three microbiological parameters that can be easily integrated into existing routine monitoring practices prokaryotic cell density d measured by flow cytometry activity a measured as prokaryotic intracellular atp concentrations using a simple cell lysis luminescence assay and as an optional parameter the bioavailable carbon c measured as the concentration of assimilable organic carbon in a simple batch growth assay we analyzed data for three case studies of different disturbances representing some of the main threats to groundwater ecosystems i e organic contamination with hydrocarbons surface water intrusion and agricultural land use for all three disturbances disturbed samples could be reliably distinguished from undisturbed samples based on a single index value obtained from multivariate outlier analyses of the microbial variables we could show that this multivariate approach allowed for a significantly more sensitive and reliable detection of disturbed samples compared to separate univariate outlier analyses of the measured variables furthermore a comparison of non contaminated aquifers from nine different regions across germany revealed distinct multivariate signatures along the three microbial variables which should be considered when applying our approach in practice in essence our approach offers a practical tool for the detection of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems based on microbial parameters which can be seamlessly extended in the future by additional parameters for higher sensitivity as well as flexibility graphical abstract image 1 keywords flow cytometry total prokaryotic cell counts intracellular atp assimilable organic carbon aoc robust estimates mahalanobis distance 1 introduction groundwater accounts for 95 of all liquid freshwater on earth making it the most important source of drinking and irrigation water worldwide throughout the globe an estimated 2 5 billion people depend solely on groundwater for their supply of freshwater while at the same time this vital resource is increasingly threatened by overexploitation and contamination caused for example by intensive agriculture industrial activities or untreated urban runoffs united nations world water assessment programme 2015 however groundwater aquifers not only serve as a storage of vital freshwater but just as important they support unique ecosystems that accommodate a large diversity of prokaryotic protozoan and metazoan life griebler and lueders 2009 the services that societies obtain from groundwater ecosystems like the provision of clean freshwater are intimately linked to the activities of these organisms as they are the driving force behind key biogeochemical processes the degradation of contaminants or the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses feichtmayer et al 2017 griebler and avramov 2015 over the past decades largely due to the collective effort of the scientific community policy makers have become increasingly aware of the strong link between groundwater quality and ecosystem health as a result legislative perceptions in parts of the world have started to shift from groundwater environments being first and foremost a commodity towards their recognition as unique ecosystems that merit protection danielopol et al 2007 griebler et al 2014 examples of legislations that already demand the consideration of ecological criteria in groundwater monitoring can be found in switzerland swpo 1998 and australia epa 2003 nsw sgdep 2002 and plans for similar frameworks furthermore exist in the european union eu gwd 2006 however the current lack of suitable universally applicable ecological assessment tools is frequently mentioned to prevent the implementation of these legislations in routine groundwater monitoring although much progress has recently been made in that direction e g korbel and hose 2011 2017 while ecological assessment criteria based on sets of indicator organisms have already been firmly integrated into routine monitoring for surface waters these tools are not compatible with groundwater ecosystems due to the characteristic environmental constrains e g lack of light and primary production low nutrient levels and repertoire of organisms e g lack of algae and macrophytes in these environments steube et al 2009 this calls for new monitoring tools specifically tailored to groundwater ecosystems to be integrated into routine monitoring protocols such tools should fulfill certain criteria 1 the targeted parameters need to be easy and inexpensive to measure 2 they need to be sensitive to a wide range of disturbances and globally applicable across different hydrogeological conditions 3 the data need to be simple to analyze and interpret 4 ideally samples for measuring ecological parameters should be obtainable along with samples for typical physicochemical analyses without the need for additional sampling efforts several studies have suggested the use of groundwater fauna as bioindicators for the detection of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems bork et al 2009 hahn 2006 malard et al 1996 marmonier et al 2013 2018 mösslacher 1998 schmidt et al 2007 stein et al 2012 however the notoriously sparse and locally often highly heterogeneous distribution of groundwater fauna as well as their absence in anoxic groundwater complicates data collection and interpretation for these types of indicators and restricts their applicability to oxic aquifers korbel and hose 2017 stein et al 2010 prokaryotic microorganisms on the other hand are ubiquitous in aquifers even under harsh conditions griebler and lueders 2009 making them ideal bioindicators for ecological monitoring under various environmental conditions the idea of using microorganisms in groundwater monitoring is not new brielmann et al 2009 foulquier et al 2011 griebler et al 2010 pronk et al 2009 stein et al 2010 steube et al 2009 van driezum et al 2018 but so far there are only a few examples of applicable frameworks that integrate microbial parameters into ecological assessment schemes however these approaches are either only applicable under certain conditions for example requiring non stagnant water in monitoring wells mermillod blondin et al 2013 or rely on dna based approaches and sophisticated bioinformatic analyses which probably exceed the current expertise of most local authorities and water suppliers to date and hence are currently still too advanced to be suitable for routine monitoring practices pearce et al 2011 to meet the demand for a universally applicable and at the same time user friendly method for the ecological monitoring of groundwater ecosystems we present here the d a c index d and a stand short for the two microbial i e prokaryotic variables that form the basis of this concept i e prokaryotic cell density d measured by flow cytometry and the activity displayed by these cells a measured as intracellular atp concentrations using a simple cell lysis luminescence assay the bioavailable carbon c that is available to the cells can additionally be included as an optional variable as the concentration of assimilable organic carbon aoc determined indirectly via a batch growth assay the usefulness of these variables has already been established for monitoring the stability of drinking water distribution systems fdha 2012 lautenschlager et al 2013 van nevel et al 2017 vang et al 2014 vital et al 2012 and have furthermore been shown to react readily to sudden disturbances in groundwater settings foulquier et al 2011 herzyk et al 2017 mermillod blondin et al 2013 strongly suggesting a great potential for their application in groundwater monitoring the d a c index integrates the signals of all these variables in a multivariate analysis and allows for a simple detection of disturbances based on a single value in this paper we will show how disturbances can be detected based on the d a c index illustrated by three case studies of different disturbances 1 organic contamination with hydrocarbons 2 surface water intrusion and 3 disturbances related to different types of land use we will demonstrate how a simultaneous multivariate analysis of the d a c variables can yield a higher sensitivity and at the same higher robustness compared to separate univariate analyses of the individual variables additionally we will highlight differences in d a c signatures of non contaminated groundwater aquifers from nine different regions across germany and discuss the implications of these differences for groundwater monitoring a map with the locations of all sampling sites considered in this study is given in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the case studies and groundwater sampling for the first disturbance case study we simulated a severe organic contamination event by combining data from a non contaminated site in the city of düsseldorf with data from a nearby former coal gasification site in düsseldorf flingern that has a long history of organic contamination with aromatic hydrocarbons btex and polyaromatics here samples were collected across the vertical profile of the contaminant plume using peristaltic pumps connected to the ports of multilevel wells out of a total pool of 65 contaminated samples that were collected during different sampling campaigns in 2005 2006 and 2007 see anneser et al 2008 2010 jobelius et al 2011 data from 30 randomly selected samples were combined with data from 81 non contaminated samples the data for these non contaminated samples were taken from a total pool of 108 samples that formed the basis for the second case study regarding the impact of surface water intrusion these samples were collected between january and october 2018 from an alluvial aquifer at the bank of the rhine river in düsseldorf at a site where drinking water is produced via river bank filtration at this site groundwater monitoring wells were located along a transect perpendicular to the river shore at different distances to the river sets of three wells each were situated close to the river at distances of about 2 and 20 m respectively this area of the aquifer receives river water under normal conditions due to river bank filtration another set of three wells and one single well were located approximately 60 and 75 m away from the river respectively in an area which usually does not come into contact with the river water but is recharged from landside groundwater however high water levels of the rhine river from january until march 2018 led to an increased intrusion of river water into the aquifer at wells close to the river as well as surface water intrusion in the more distant areas which was revealed by water stable isotope signatures fig s2 for the third case study regarding the impact of different types of land use we analyzed data collected in fuhrberg near the city of hannover where different types of land use can be found close to each other a total of 29 samples were collected between spring and summer 2018 comprising 9 samples from a forest and 10 samples from a grassland and an agricultural land respectively for assessing differences in d a c signatures between regions we analyzed data from non contaminated aquifers in nine different regions across germany fig 1 non contaminated groundwater in this context is defined here as shallow groundwater that although being exposed to a multitude of potential anthropogenic impacts e g waste water agriculture or urban run off did not display significantly elevated concentrations of concerning chemicals or metals at the time of sampling mainly based on thresholds set for drinking water samples were collected at each region at least during two sampling campaigns between the years 2007 and 2017 an in depth description of the individual regions would go beyond the scope of this article instead a summary of key information is given in table 1 except for the samples from the organically contaminated site as mentioned above groundwater was collected from fully screened monitoring wells using a mp1 submersible pump connected to an adjustable frequency converter to control the pumping rate eijkelkamp soil water giesbeek the netherlands the pump was lowered to half the depth of the water column inside the well the collection of groundwater was done according to national and international standard protocols din 38402 13 lubw 2013 epa 2017 with minor modifications to achieve an initial exchange of the borehole water and water in the direct surrounding of the well water was pumped at the highest possible rate accepting a maximum drawdown of the groundwater table of 30 cm as such wells were purged prior to sample collection pre pumping two to three borehole volumes and subsequently waiting until physicochemical parameters monitored by online measurements temperature ph electrical conductivity and concentration of dissolved oxygen were stable for the collection of groundwater samples the pumping rate was reduced to one third of the initial rate used for pre pumping to avoid possible shearing of biofilms due to strong pumping samples for cell density measurements 50 ml were fixed immediately after sampling with glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 0 5 v v in sterile falcon tubes samples for atp measurements were collected in autoclaved glass bottles glassware for the collection of aoc samples was baked at 450 c for 4 h prior to sampling and closed with plastic caps with teflon inlays that were treated with 10 w v sodium persulfate at 60 c for 1 h to remove traces of organic carbon samples were stored in the dark at 4 c for transport to the lab and until analysis within 48 h after sampling 2 2 determination of the d a c parameters 2 2 1 prokaryotic cell density d the number of prokaryotic cells was determined by flow cytometry fc500 cytomics beckman coulter brea ca usa to distinguish cells from abiotic particles and background noise cells in 500 μl sample aliquots were stained with sybr green i nucleic acid stain invitrogen darmstadt germany at a ratio of 1 10 000 v v followed by incubation at 37 c

e g hammes and egli 2005 and recommendations by government agencies kötzsch et al 2012 zunabovic pichler 2018 a representative example plot is shown in fig s1 excitation was achieved with a 488 nm argon ion laser instrument specific filter gain settings were as follows fl1 569 fl3 640 trigger threshold set on fl1 1 data acquisition and analysis was done using the cytomics fc500 cxp software version 2 2 beckman coulter samples were measured with flow rate set to medium for 60 s to determine the exact volume of measured sample a 100 μl suspension with a known number of fluorescent beads trucount tubes becton dickinson franklin lakes nj usa was added to each sample as internal standard duplicate measurements were performed on biological triplicates for each sample 2 2 2 activity a intracellular atp atp was measured using the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay kit promega madison wi usa based on the method by hammes et al 2010 with slight modifications the measurement is a luminescence assay based on the atp dependent oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by luciferase the kit offers a single step sample preparation protocol by combining the bacterial cell lysis buffer and the luciferase enzymes in a single reagent samples and the bactiter glo reagent prepared according to the manufacturer s instructions were pre warmed separately at 38 c for at least 2 min before mixing 1 ml sample with 50 μl reagent the mixture was incubated at 38 c for 1 min and the luminescence was measured on a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega concentrations were determined by comparison with external atp standards dissolved in atp free water both fisher scientific waltham ma usa using atp free water as blank to correct for the contribution of extracellular atp in the samples to the measured luminescence signal the measurements were performed on an unfiltered sample fraction representing the total atp concentration in the sample and additionally on a fraction of the same sample that was passed through a 0 1 μm polyvinylidene fluoride millex syringe filter merck kenilworth nj usa before sample preparation to remove cells thus containing only extracellular atp the concentration of intracellular atp was then calculated by subtracting the extracellular concentration from the total hammes et al 2010 all measurements were carried out in triplicate 2 2 3 carbon c assimilable organic carbon aoc aoc concentrations were determined indirectly with a batch growth assay based on the method by hammes and egli 2005 the assay quantifies prokaryotic cell growth of a natural microbial community in a water sample on the bioavailable carbon present in that sample during an incubation under in situ conditions until stationary phase in our case over a period of 30 days to this end a sample was diluted 10 1 with filter sterilized groundwater from the same site the filtered groundwater served as carbon source to initiate batch growth of the cells derived from the unfiltered sample samples for the determination of total prokaryotic cell numbers were taken immediately at the beginning of the incubation and at the end the cells that were produced during the incubation were used as a measure for the amount organic carbon that was assimilated into microbial biomass thus the aoc concentration was calculated from the average net growth determined from triplicate incubations converting the number of produced cells into carbon with a constant factor of 20 fg organic c cell 1 griebler et al 2002 for the incubation 80 ml diluted groundwater was incubated in 100 ml glass bottles at in situ groundwater temperature in the dark with shaking at 100 rpm cell numbers were measured as total prokaryotic cell counts by flow cytometry as described above all glassware used for the incubations were treated to remove traces of organic carbon as above 2 3 determination of hydrochemical parameters and isotope ratios groundwater temperature ph electrical conductivity and oxygen concentrations were measured on site using field sensors wtw weilheim germany concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured in samples passed through a 0 45 μm filter vwr radnor pa usa that was rinsed three times with ultra pure water prior to sample filtration to remove residual carbon samples were filtered on site and subsequently acidified with

japan nitrate concentrations were measured by ion chromatography at gba group laboratories gba group gesellschaft für bioanalytik mbh hamburg germany stable isotope ratios of oxygen 18o 16o were determined using a picarro l2130 i isotopic water analyzer picarro santa clara ca usa δ18o ratios were measured in samples via equilibration with co2 at 18 c for 5 h under constant shaking δ18o ratios were determined relative to internal standards that were calibrated against v smow v gesp and v slap standards international atomic energy agency vienna austria all measurements were performed at least in duplicate 2 4 data analysis in order to detect disturbances in the three case studies we combined the signals of the d a c variables in a multivariate analysis as schematically shown in fig 2 under normal undisturbed conditions samples are expected to display a certain distribution in a multivariate space along these variables for multivariate normally distributed data a cloud of samples arrange in an elliptical form which is defined by the mean values of the variables forming the center of the ellipse the variances of the individual variables and the covariance between them determining the shape and slope of the ellipse disturbances that cause severe changes in one or more of these variables increase the distance of affected samples to the center of the ellipse beyond the range of distances expected due to random variation in other words samples affected by a disturbance can be considered outliers the distance of a single sample to the center is calculated as the mahalanobis distance according to equation 1 1 m d i x i μ s 1 x i μ where x i is a vector with the values of the individual variables for a single sample and μ and s 1 are the vector with the variable means and the inverse of the covariance matrix respectively calculated from the full data this distance is unitless and indicates how far a given sample lies away from the center of a multivariate distribution hence it can be considered a multidimensional extension of univariate z scores manly 1994 the mahalanobis distance takes values of the square root of a chi squared distribution with as many degrees of freedom as there are variables in the analysis e g df 3 when all three d a c variables are considered in the analysis this information is used to set thresholds to distinguish significant outliers from random variation in the data for example 97 5 of the values of a chi squared distribution with three degrees of freedom are 9 35 thus a sample with a mahalanobis distance above the critical value of 9 35 would be declared an outlier at a 0 975 confidence level and consequently be interpreted as a sign of a disturbance a simple numerical example is given in the supplementary material along with fig s5 problems arise however if mahalanobis distances are calculated based on the raw data directly since the presence of already a small fraction of outliers in the dataset can severely distort the estimates of μ and s therefore we used the fast mcd algorithm which can provide reliable robust estimates of μ and s in datasets contaminated with outliers and calculated robust mahalanobis distances based on these estimates hubert and debruyne 2010 rousseeuw and van driessen 1999 briefly the algorithm searches for a subset of samples of size h eq 2 h n p 1 2 where n is the number of samples in the dataset and p the number of variables with the smallest determinant of s i e with the smallest dispersion in the multivariate space and subsequently calculates μ and s based on these h samples we will refer to the final robust mahalanobis distances as the d a or d a c index respectively depending on the variables included in the analysis a sample was declared an outlier at a 0 975 confidence level if its calculated index value exceeded the square root of the 0 975 quantile of a chi squared distribution with the according degrees of freedom as described above rousseeuw and van driessen 1999 the strength of this multivariate approach is that it not only takes into account the variance of each variable but also possible correlations in the form of covariance between these variables which are not taken into account in separate univariate analyses of the individual variables manly 1994 to illustrate this strength we compared the multivariate d a c approach to a univariate method for outlier detection for this univariate approach separate thresholds were set for each variable based on the median and the median absolute deviation mad this approach was chosen because the median and the mad provide more robust estimates of the center and the dispersion of data respectively even in the presence of outliers compared to the mean and standard deviation similar to what has been explained above using this approach a sample was considered an outlier if it fell outside the range of median 2 5 mad as recommended by leys et al 2013 to assess differences in d a c signatures between regions i e differences between the covariance matrices and variable means we again applied the fast mcd algorithm to the data from the non contaminated aquifers sampled at the different regions across germany fig 1 box s m test was used to test for differences in covariance matrices i e robust estimates of s between regions differences in means for each variable were assessed using welch s anova followed by the corresponding games howell post hoc test for pairwise comparisons to assess differences between individual regions outliers for a given region that were detected based on the robust mahalanobis distances were not considered for the analysis of differences in means all analyses were done in r version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 and were performed on logarithmically log10 transformed data to achieve normality normality was confirmed using the shapiro wilk test implemented in the stats package and its multivariate extension to test for multivariate normality implemented in the mvnormtest package jarek 2012 robust estimates of μ and s and robust mahalanobis distances with additional adjustment for sample size according to pison et al 2002 were obtained using the covmcd function of the robustbase package maechler et al 2018 confidence ellipses two dimensional and ellipsoids three dimensional were calculated at a 0 975 confidence level based on the robust estimates of μ and s using the ellipse function of the ellipse package murdoch and chow 2018 and the ellipse3d function of the rgl package adler and murdoch 2018 respectively box s m tests were performed using a modified version of the according function from the biotools package da silva et al 2017 with the modification that the robust estimates of s were used as input instead of the raw data welch s anova was carried out using the oneway test function stats package games howell tests were performed using the userfriendlyscience package peters et al 2018 an example of the d a c analysis workflow in r to detect disturbances is provided as supplementary material 3 results 3 1 using the d a c index to detect disturbances 3 1 1 case study 1 organic contamination for simplicity and for reasons that will be discussed below the analysis was based only on the variables cell density and activity to introduce how disturbances can be detected based on the identification of outliers all contaminated samples were correctly identified as outliers by the multivariate approach using the d a index which exceeded the critical value of the chi squared distribution for all contaminated samples fig 3 in general the contaminated samples showed higher activity levels as well as higher cell densities compared to the non contaminated samples however if both variables were considered separately in univariate analyses only 83 of the contaminated samples would have been correctly identified as outliers based on cell density based on activity the fraction would have been even lower with only 53 even if the outcomes of the two separate univariate analyses were to be considered together still 17 of the contaminated samples would not have been detected as outliers this is apparent from the bivariate plot where a group of contaminated samples clearly deviates from the distribution of non contaminated samples indicated by the confidence ellipse but still falls within the univariate thresholds for cell density and activity fig 3 in fact by looking at the bivariate plot it is becomes clear that in principle any sample that would lie to the top left or the bottom right of the confidence ellipse would not be detected as an outlier using the univariate approach if it still fell within the range defined by the univariate thresholds even though it would clearly deviate from the distribution of the rest of the data along the two variables this distribution is not only shaped by the variances of the variables but also their mutual covariance which is ignored with the univariate approach thus by making use of the additional information about covariance the multivariate approach fully exploits the information gained from the two variables thereby it is able to provide a more accurate picture about the available data and accordingly allows for a more accurate identification of outliers to assess the impact of the fraction of contaminated samples in the dataset on the ability of the two approaches to detect those contaminated samples as outliers we repeated the analysis from above with datasets containing different fractions of contaminated samples ranging from 10 to 60 for each fraction we constructed 100 datasets with a total of 70 samples that were randomly selected from the non contaminated site and the hydrocarbon contaminated site respectively for each dataset we calculated the average fraction of contaminated samples that were correctly identified as outliers using the univariate approach where a sample was declared an outlier if it fell outside the median 2 5 mad thresholds of either of the two variables and the multivariate approach respectively fig 4 at a fraction of 10 of contaminated samples in the dataset both approaches were equally reliable detecting 99 of the contaminated samples as outliers welch s t test t 99 1 42 p 0 16 however already at 20 contaminated samples the multivariate approach detected the contaminated samples significantly more reliably 98 5 compared to the univariate approach 93 7 welch s t test t 140 2 6 21 p 0 0001 and was able to correctly identify 96 of the contaminated samples as outliers up to a fraction of 30 contaminated samples in the dataset above which also the multivariate approach started to noticeably lose its reliability 3 1 2 case study 2 surface water intrusion as for the previous example the analysis was based only on the variables cell density and activity out of the total of 108 samples nine samples were identified as outliers using the multivariate approach as indicated by the d a index for these nine samples which exceeded the critical value of the chi squared distribution fig 5 the presence of these outliers coincided with the period of the increased surface water intrusion and seemed to reflect the spatiotemporal impact of this event in january at the early stage of the event the effect of the surface water intrusion was only apparent close to the river as indicated by the outlier from a well at a 2 m distance from the river however at the later stage in march when the surface water had reached the areas more distant from the river outliers were also detected 60 and 75 m away from the river after the surface water had receded the system appeared to have recovered from the disturbance the only exception was a single well 60 m away from the river that was still identified as an outlier in april june and october which however did not seem to be directly related to the surface water intrusion fig s2 similar to the results for the first disturbance case study the multivariate approach detected outliers more sensitively compared to the univariate approach only four samples that were identified as outliers in the multivariate analysis also fell outside the range defined by the median 2 5 mad for cell density as well as activity if both were considered separately if the information for both variables were to be combined still one outlier would not have been detected which was detected by the multivariate approach 3 1 3 case study 3 impact of different types of land use considering only cell density and activity in the multivariate analysis no significant outliers were detected for any of the three types of land use although the d a index value of a single sample from the agricultural land was close to the critical value of the chi squared distribution fig 6 however if the aoc concentration was additionally included in the analysis five outliers could be clearly identified based on the d a c index three of which derived from the agricultural land showing lower aoc concentrations than the majority of the samples and two from the grassland which showed higher aoc concentrations similar to the first two disturbance case studies these outliers would not have been detected based on separate univariate analyses except for one sample from the agricultural land which fell below the lower threshold for activity fig s3 the hydrochemical data revealed that the three outlier samples from the agricultural land displayed exceptionally high nitrate concentrations 100 mg l 1 as well as unusually high dissolved oxygen concentrations for the region and were among the samples with the lowest ph in the entire dataset fig s4 for the two outliers from the grassland the chemical data revealed unusually high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon corresponding to the high aoc concentrations for these samples as well as relatively low ph values fig s4 3 2 regional differences in d a c signatures for simplicity of display the signatures of the nine different regions are shown in fig 7 only based on the two variables cell density and activity the signature of each region is defined by the center i e mean values of each variable and the covariance matrix which both are graphically captured by the confidence ellipse already based on visual comparison of the confidence ellipses clear differences were apparent between each region and the full dataset as well as between the individual regions both in terms of variable means and covariances significant differences in covariance matrices between regions were confirmed using box s m test on the robust estimates of the covariance matrices χ 2 24 76 5 p 0 0001 for the comparisons of variable means only samples were considered that were not indicated to be outliers for a given region based on their robust mahalanobis distances at a confidence level of 0 975 as seen for the covariance matrices significant differences were also found for the means of cell density welch s anova f 8 75 5 44 3 p 0 0001 and activity welch s anova f 8 75 8 14 0 p 0 0001 unfortunately aoc concentrations were not available for all samples we repeated the analyses only considering regions for which at least 10 samples were available with data for all three d a c variables table 1 the results were in agreement with the previous analysis showing significant differences between covariance matrices box s m χ 2 36 133 8 p 0 0001 and average aoc levels welch s anova f 6 27 5 12 9 p 0 0001 additional pairwise comparisons of means for each variable revealed that although the overall differences were significant differences between pairs of regions were relatively small mainly occurring within one order of magnitude for each variable fig 8 summary statistics for each region are given in table s1 moreover even though there were significant correlations between the d a c variables considering the full dataset pearson s r cell density activity 0 463 p 0 0001 r activity carbon 0 285 p 0 008 not significant r cell density carbon 0 191 p 0 08 the pairwise comparisons further showed that these variables are not mutually redundant as significant differences between two regions in one variable did not necessarily coincide with significant differences in another variable for a given pair of regions 4 discussion despite the fact that policy makers in different parts of the world have started to acknowledge the ecosystem status of groundwater aquifers and therefore no longer consider them as lifeless storages of freshwater ecological aspects still receive little attention in groundwater monitoring to date however several advantages could be gained from the incorporation ecological parameters into routine groundwater monitoring not only would it allow for a better protection of unique groundwater ecosystems it would also enable a more sustainable and informed ecosystem management thereby helping maintain important ecosystem services such as the provision of clean freshwater griebler and avramov 2015 griebler et al 2014 moreover given that the indigenous organisms have adapted to the characteristically stable environmental conditions of groundwater aquifers they can be expected to react sensitively to various disturbances some of which might not be detected by conventional monitoring of physicochemical parameters alone therefore the sensitivity of routine groundwater monitoring could be increased by considering ecological parameters danielopol et al 2007 griebler and avramov 2015 griebler et al 2014 however one of the main reasons for the currently still lacking implementation of ecological criteria is certainly the lack of suitable tools that can be easily incorporated into already existing routine monitoring practices the integrated analysis using the d a c index presented here offers an easily implementable approach to meet this demand previous studies have analyzed responses of prokaryotic microorganisms to different disturbances for instance increased microbial activity and growth have been reported in response to increased concentrations and fluxes of carbon caused by groundwater recharge with surface water foulquier et al 2011 mermillod blondin et al 2013 van driezum et al 2018 or suddenly occurring contamination with aromatic hydrocarbons herzyk et al 2017 these general trends are in line with our observations for the first two disturbance case studies however in contrast to the monitoring of drinking water distribution systems fdha 2012 van nevel et al 2017 most of the studies that have investigated these parameters in relation to different disturbances of groundwater ecosystems so far have mainly been descriptive and did not provide a practical framework of how these parameters could be integrated into monitoring protocols our approach uses an integrated analysis of multiple microbiological variables to detect disturbances although it has been shown that for example microbial activity correlates positively with microbial cell numbers eydal and pedersen 2007 foulquier et al 2011 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 van nevel et al 2017 a pattern that was also reflected in our data these variables should not be regarded as mutually redundant our analyses showed that disturbances were not equally mirrored by these two variables and furthermore that significant differences between regions in one variable did not necessarily coincide with significant differences in another variable it is crucial to realize that total prokaryotic cell counts are a measure of the total number of cells in a sample while only the active fraction of these cells contributes to the activity measured as intracellular atp concentrations these two variables can be affected differently by different disturbances or over different time scales for instance it could be shown that microbial cell density can exhibit a delayed response to increased nutrient inputs foulquier et al 2011 while intracellular atp concentrations can react almost immediately hofmann and griebler 2018 moreover although such a pattern was not observed in our particular example of the surface water intrusion event it is easy to imagine how surface water intrusion could cause an increase in microbial cell numbers without changes in activity this would be the case if cells from the surface water were transported into the groundwater but were inactivated by the characteristically lower nutrient levels in the groundwater compared to surface water hence considering multiple variables can allow for a more nuanced approach to detect different types of disturbances we additionally demonstrated the advantages of a simultaneous multivariate analysis of the considered microbiological variables compared to separate univariate analyses of each variable the main advantage of the multivariate approach is that correlations between the variables are also taken into account thereby capturing the actual distribution of samples along the measured variables unlike univariate approaches where each variable is analyzed separately and thereby possible correlations are ignored manly 1994 our analyses showed that disturbances were not only detected more sensitively by the multivariate approach but also that it was more robust by being able to detect disturbances more reliably in datasets with higher fractions of contaminated samples compared to the univariate approach moreover using the d a c index i e robust mahalanobis distances as indicator of disturbances offers an easy interpretation of the data based on a single value which integrates the signals from multiple variables the power of this approach to detect anomalies i e outliers has already been successfully demonstrated in various contexts ranging from finance to astronomy and biotechnology as well as quality monitoring of industrial manufacturing processes cohen freue et al 2007 hubert et al 2017 rousseeuw and van driessen 1999 which allows for a seamless transfer of this approach into the context of ecological monitoring moreover the approach can be easily extended by additional variables that may be identified in the future as sensitive indicators of disturbances without compromising the simplicity of the analysis since the interpretation would still be based on a single index value regardless of the number of variables considered in the analysis for example additional information such as cell size distributions numbers of phototrophic cells ratios of live over dead cells or ratios of cells with high nucleic acid content over cells with low nucleic acid content can be directly derived from flow cytometry measurements used to determine cell densities hammes et al 2011 hammes and egli 2010 van nevel et al 2017 wang et al 2010 this enables a straightforward amendment of the analysis which may further increase the sensitivity of detecting disturbances we have illustrated how the analysis can be extended and its sensitivity can be increased by including additional variables based on the example of the third disturbance case study related to the impacts of different types of land use in this example disturbances related to agricultural land use that were not identified by only looking at cell density and activity could be identified by additionally including aoc concentrations in the analysis although a higher sensitivity was achieved in this particular example by amending the analysis with aoc there are certain pitfalls associated with this variable that need to be considered it is important to remember that the aoc concentration is derived indirectly from the increase in cell numbers in a sample over a certain amount of time during batch incubation under in situ groundwater conditions i e in the dark and the according temperature hammes and egli 2005 however from our own experience this measure is only applicable under certain conditions for instance we have frequently noticed that the cell density decreases over the course of the incubation resulting in calculated negative aoc concentrations this is mainly the case for surface water samples where phototrophic cells die and decay during the incubation in the dark or for groundwater samples that are strongly affected by surface water and may have contained phototrophic cells moreover we can think of cases where the presence of toxic compounds like heavy metals can lead to growth inhibition şengör et al 2009 in such a case the cell density in a sample would not increase or only increase slightly during the incubation which would be falsely interpreted as low aoc concentrations similar situations would arise in cases where carbon is not the limiting resource but the cell growth is constrained by the availability of other essential nutrients like nitrogen or phosphate hofmann and griebler 2018 or electron acceptors as is often the case for organically contaminated groundwater meckenstock et al 2015 in the light of these pitfalls we recommend the use of aoc as an additional variable only for groundwater samples in absence of strong surface water impacts furthermore protocols to measure aoc could be adjusted by amending samples with additional nitrogen and phosphate sources to overcome potential biases of aoc estimates caused by nutrient limitations trimbach et al in prep certain shortcomings may also be encountered if only cell density and activity are considered the disturbance case studies that we investigated to test our approach could all be roughly categorized as disturbances that affect organic carbon and nutrient levels in the groundwater even though we could clearly demonstrate that these disturbances can be detected by the multivariate analysis of prokaryotic cell density and activity there are other potential impacts which might not be detected using this approach one example could be groundwater contamination with micropollutants like pharmaceuticals or pesticides which has become a growing concern over the past years fenner et al 2013 lapworth et al 2012 since these compounds typically occur in groundwater only in concentrations of a few nanograms to micrograms per liter often much lower than ambient aoc concentrations they usually do not serve as substrate for microbial growth helbling 2015 and from a critical point of view might not be expected to have toxic effects on microorganisms that would cause noticeable changes in intracellular atp concentrations whether impacts caused by micropollutants can be detected at all based on microbiological parameters needs to be assessed in future research however in general certain other drawbacks of our approach could be alleviated by incorporating additional variables in the analysis as discussed above looking at the regional d a c signatures of non contaminated aquifers across germany we noticed significant differences in terms of average levels of prokaryotic cell density activity and aoc respectively as well as covariance matrices a detailed discussion of differences between individual regions would exceed the scope of this paper however the main implication of these findings for groundwater monitoring is that these differences between regions need to be taken into account for data collection and interpretation by analyzing data on a suitable regional scale furthermore our analysis revealed that disturbances can only be reliably detected up to a certain fraction of disturbed samples in the dataset therefore in practice a number of known reference monitoring wells should be routinely included in the analysis that are well protected against disturbances and provide a representative estimate of d a c signatures for a given region a step towards the biogeographical classification of groundwater ecosystems has been made by stein et al 2012 who showed that the distribution of metazoan groundwater fauna across germany does not agree with conventional classifications based on hydrogeology geochemistry or bioregions defined based on surface water fauna in the light of these findings we suggest that also the definition of suitable biogeographical boundaries for microbiological parameters should be guided by ecological criteria rather than being solely based on hydrogeology or geochemistry 5 conclusion we have shown that prokaryotic cell density and activity can be used as reliable and sensitive indicators of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems these parameters can be easily integrated into existing groundwater monitoring schemes as they are simple and inexpensive to measure and furthermore can be analyzed in samples that can be directly collected along with samples for the routine monitoring of conventional physicochemical parameters furthermore we have demonstrated that the multivariate analysis of these variables using the d a c index not only allows for a higher sensitivity but also increases the robustness of the analysis compared to separate univariate analyses of the individual variables an even higher sensitivity might be achieved by including additional parameters in the analysis such as aoc concentrations under certain conditions moreover the presented approach can be seamlessly adapted to detect various types of disturbances by including additional parameters in the future while still allowing for an easy data interpretation based on a single index value i e robust mahalanobis distances that integrates the signals of all variables included in the analysis significant differences in the multivariate d a c signatures of the microbial variables between regions stress the importance of analyzing data and selecting reference wells at a suitable regional scale the definition of which should not only be guided by hydrogeology or geochemistry but primarily by ecological criteria

18620,groundwater is not only a vital resource but also one of the largest terrestrial aquatic ecosystems on earth however to date ecological criteria are often not considered in routine groundwater monitoring mainly because of the lack of suitable ecological assessment tools prokaryotic microorganisms are ubiquitous in groundwater ecosystems even under the harshest conditions making them ideal bioindicators for ecological monitoring we have developed a simple inexpensive approach that enables ecological groundwater monitoring based on three microbiological parameters that can be easily integrated into existing routine monitoring practices prokaryotic cell density d measured by flow cytometry activity a measured as prokaryotic intracellular atp concentrations using a simple cell lysis luminescence assay and as an optional parameter the bioavailable carbon c measured as the concentration of assimilable organic carbon in a simple batch growth assay we analyzed data for three case studies of different disturbances representing some of the main threats to groundwater ecosystems i e organic contamination with hydrocarbons surface water intrusion and agricultural land use for all three disturbances disturbed samples could be reliably distinguished from undisturbed samples based on a single index value obtained from multivariate outlier analyses of the microbial variables we could show that this multivariate approach allowed for a significantly more sensitive and reliable detection of disturbed samples compared to separate univariate outlier analyses of the measured variables furthermore a comparison of non contaminated aquifers from nine different regions across germany revealed distinct multivariate signatures along the three microbial variables which should be considered when applying our approach in practice in essence our approach offers a practical tool for the detection of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems based on microbial parameters which can be seamlessly extended in the future by additional parameters for higher sensitivity as well as flexibility graphical abstract image 1 keywords flow cytometry total prokaryotic cell counts intracellular atp assimilable organic carbon aoc robust estimates mahalanobis distance 1 introduction groundwater accounts for 95 of all liquid freshwater on earth making it the most important source of drinking and irrigation water worldwide throughout the globe an estimated 2 5 billion people depend solely on groundwater for their supply of freshwater while at the same time this vital resource is increasingly threatened by overexploitation and contamination caused for example by intensive agriculture industrial activities or untreated urban runoffs united nations world water assessment programme 2015 however groundwater aquifers not only serve as a storage of vital freshwater but just as important they support unique ecosystems that accommodate a large diversity of prokaryotic protozoan and metazoan life griebler and lueders 2009 the services that societies obtain from groundwater ecosystems like the provision of clean freshwater are intimately linked to the activities of these organisms as they are the driving force behind key biogeochemical processes the degradation of contaminants or the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses feichtmayer et al 2017 griebler and avramov 2015 over the past decades largely due to the collective effort of the scientific community policy makers have become increasingly aware of the strong link between groundwater quality and ecosystem health as a result legislative perceptions in parts of the world have started to shift from groundwater environments being first and foremost a commodity towards their recognition as unique ecosystems that merit protection danielopol et al 2007 griebler et al 2014 examples of legislations that already demand the consideration of ecological criteria in groundwater monitoring can be found in switzerland swpo 1998 and australia epa 2003 nsw sgdep 2002 and plans for similar frameworks furthermore exist in the european union eu gwd 2006 however the current lack of suitable universally applicable ecological assessment tools is frequently mentioned to prevent the implementation of these legislations in routine groundwater monitoring although much progress has recently been made in that direction e g korbel and hose 2011 2017 while ecological assessment criteria based on sets of indicator organisms have already been firmly integrated into routine monitoring for surface waters these tools are not compatible with groundwater ecosystems due to the characteristic environmental constrains e g lack of light and primary production low nutrient levels and repertoire of organisms e g lack of algae and macrophytes in these environments steube et al 2009 this calls for new monitoring tools specifically tailored to groundwater ecosystems to be integrated into routine monitoring protocols such tools should fulfill certain criteria 1 the targeted parameters need to be easy and inexpensive to measure 2 they need to be sensitive to a wide range of disturbances and globally applicable across different hydrogeological conditions 3 the data need to be simple to analyze and interpret 4 ideally samples for measuring ecological parameters should be obtainable along with samples for typical physicochemical analyses without the need for additional sampling efforts several studies have suggested the use of groundwater fauna as bioindicators for the detection of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems bork et al 2009 hahn 2006 malard et al 1996 marmonier et al 2013 2018 mösslacher 1998 schmidt et al 2007 stein et al 2012 however the notoriously sparse and locally often highly heterogeneous distribution of groundwater fauna as well as their absence in anoxic groundwater complicates data collection and interpretation for these types of indicators and restricts their applicability to oxic aquifers korbel and hose 2017 stein et al 2010 prokaryotic microorganisms on the other hand are ubiquitous in aquifers even under harsh conditions griebler and lueders 2009 making them ideal bioindicators for ecological monitoring under various environmental conditions the idea of using microorganisms in groundwater monitoring is not new brielmann et al 2009 foulquier et al 2011 griebler et al 2010 pronk et al 2009 stein et al 2010 steube et al 2009 van driezum et al 2018 but so far there are only a few examples of applicable frameworks that integrate microbial parameters into ecological assessment schemes however these approaches are either only applicable under certain conditions for example requiring non stagnant water in monitoring wells mermillod blondin et al 2013 or rely on dna based approaches and sophisticated bioinformatic analyses which probably exceed the current expertise of most local authorities and water suppliers to date and hence are currently still too advanced to be suitable for routine monitoring practices pearce et al 2011 to meet the demand for a universally applicable and at the same time user friendly method for the ecological monitoring of groundwater ecosystems we present here the d a c index d and a stand short for the two microbial i e prokaryotic variables that form the basis of this concept i e prokaryotic cell density d measured by flow cytometry and the activity displayed by these cells a measured as intracellular atp concentrations using a simple cell lysis luminescence assay the bioavailable carbon c that is available to the cells can additionally be included as an optional variable as the concentration of assimilable organic carbon aoc determined indirectly via a batch growth assay the usefulness of these variables has already been established for monitoring the stability of drinking water distribution systems fdha 2012 lautenschlager et al 2013 van nevel et al 2017 vang et al 2014 vital et al 2012 and have furthermore been shown to react readily to sudden disturbances in groundwater settings foulquier et al 2011 herzyk et al 2017 mermillod blondin et al 2013 strongly suggesting a great potential for their application in groundwater monitoring the d a c index integrates the signals of all these variables in a multivariate analysis and allows for a simple detection of disturbances based on a single value in this paper we will show how disturbances can be detected based on the d a c index illustrated by three case studies of different disturbances 1 organic contamination with hydrocarbons 2 surface water intrusion and 3 disturbances related to different types of land use we will demonstrate how a simultaneous multivariate analysis of the d a c variables can yield a higher sensitivity and at the same higher robustness compared to separate univariate analyses of the individual variables additionally we will highlight differences in d a c signatures of non contaminated groundwater aquifers from nine different regions across germany and discuss the implications of these differences for groundwater monitoring a map with the locations of all sampling sites considered in this study is given in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the case studies and groundwater sampling for the first disturbance case study we simulated a severe organic contamination event by combining data from a non contaminated site in the city of düsseldorf with data from a nearby former coal gasification site in düsseldorf flingern that has a long history of organic contamination with aromatic hydrocarbons btex and polyaromatics here samples were collected across the vertical profile of the contaminant plume using peristaltic pumps connected to the ports of multilevel wells out of a total pool of 65 contaminated samples that were collected during different sampling campaigns in 2005 2006 and 2007 see anneser et al 2008 2010 jobelius et al 2011 data from 30 randomly selected samples were combined with data from 81 non contaminated samples the data for these non contaminated samples were taken from a total pool of 108 samples that formed the basis for the second case study regarding the impact of surface water intrusion these samples were collected between january and october 2018 from an alluvial aquifer at the bank of the rhine river in düsseldorf at a site where drinking water is produced via river bank filtration at this site groundwater monitoring wells were located along a transect perpendicular to the river shore at different distances to the river sets of three wells each were situated close to the river at distances of about 2 and 20 m respectively this area of the aquifer receives river water under normal conditions due to river bank filtration another set of three wells and one single well were located approximately 60 and 75 m away from the river respectively in an area which usually does not come into contact with the river water but is recharged from landside groundwater however high water levels of the rhine river from january until march 2018 led to an increased intrusion of river water into the aquifer at wells close to the river as well as surface water intrusion in the more distant areas which was revealed by water stable isotope signatures fig s2 for the third case study regarding the impact of different types of land use we analyzed data collected in fuhrberg near the city of hannover where different types of land use can be found close to each other a total of 29 samples were collected between spring and summer 2018 comprising 9 samples from a forest and 10 samples from a grassland and an agricultural land respectively for assessing differences in d a c signatures between regions we analyzed data from non contaminated aquifers in nine different regions across germany fig 1 non contaminated groundwater in this context is defined here as shallow groundwater that although being exposed to a multitude of potential anthropogenic impacts e g waste water agriculture or urban run off did not display significantly elevated concentrations of concerning chemicals or metals at the time of sampling mainly based on thresholds set for drinking water samples were collected at each region at least during two sampling campaigns between the years 2007 and 2017 an in depth description of the individual regions would go beyond the scope of this article instead a summary of key information is given in table 1 except for the samples from the organically contaminated site as mentioned above groundwater was collected from fully screened monitoring wells using a mp1 submersible pump connected to an adjustable frequency converter to control the pumping rate eijkelkamp soil water giesbeek the netherlands the pump was lowered to half the depth of the water column inside the well the collection of groundwater was done according to national and international standard protocols din 38402 13 lubw 2013 epa 2017 with minor modifications to achieve an initial exchange of the borehole water and water in the direct surrounding of the well water was pumped at the highest possible rate accepting a maximum drawdown of the groundwater table of 30 cm as such wells were purged prior to sample collection pre pumping two to three borehole volumes and subsequently waiting until physicochemical parameters monitored by online measurements temperature ph electrical conductivity and concentration of dissolved oxygen were stable for the collection of groundwater samples the pumping rate was reduced to one third of the initial rate used for pre pumping to avoid possible shearing of biofilms due to strong pumping samples for cell density measurements 50 ml were fixed immediately after sampling with glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 0 5 v v in sterile falcon tubes samples for atp measurements were collected in autoclaved glass bottles glassware for the collection of aoc samples was baked at 450 c for 4 h prior to sampling and closed with plastic caps with teflon inlays that were treated with 10 w v sodium persulfate at 60 c for 1 h to remove traces of organic carbon samples were stored in the dark at 4 c for transport to the lab and until analysis within 48 h after sampling 2 2 determination

argon ion laser instrument specific filter gain settings were as follows fl1 569 fl3 640 trigger threshold set on fl1 1 data acquisition and analysis was done using the cytomics fc500 cxp software version 2 2 beckman coulter samples were measured with flow rate set to medium for 60 s to determine the exact volume of measured sample a 100 μl suspension with a known number of fluorescent beads trucount tubes becton dickinson franklin lakes nj usa was added to each sample as internal standard duplicate measurements were performed on biological triplicates for each sample 2 2 2 activity a intracellular atp atp was measured using the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay kit promega madison wi usa based on the method by hammes et al 2010 with slight modifications the measurement is a luminescence assay based on the atp dependent oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by luciferase the kit offers a single step sample preparation protocol by combining the bacterial cell lysis buffer and the luciferase enzymes in a single reagent samples and the bactiter glo reagent prepared according to the manufacturer s instructions were pre warmed separately at 38 c for at least 2 min before mixing 1 ml sample with 50 μl reagent the mixture was incubated at 38 c for 1 min and the luminescence was measured on a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega concentrations were determined by comparison with external atp standards dissolved in atp free water both fisher scientific waltham ma usa using atp free water as blank to correct for the contribution of extracellular atp in the samples to the measured luminescence signal the measurements were performed on an unfiltered sample fraction representing the total atp concentration in the sample and additionally on a fraction of the same sample that was passed through a 0 1 μm polyvinylidene fluoride millex syringe filter merck kenilworth nj usa before sample preparation to remove cells thus containing only extracellular atp the concentration of intracellular atp was then calculated by subtracting the extracellular concentration from the total hammes et al 2010 all measurements were carried out in triplicate 2 2 3 carbon c assimilable organic carbon aoc aoc concentrations were determined indirectly with a batch growth assay based on the method by hammes and egli 2005 the assay quantifies prokaryotic cell growth of a natural microbial community in a water sample on the bioavailable carbon present in that sample during an incubation under in situ conditions until stationary phase in our case over a period of 30 days to this end a sample was diluted 10 1 with filter sterilized groundwater from the same site the filtered groundwater served as carbon source to initiate batch growth of the cells derived from the unfiltered sample samples for the determination of total prokaryotic cell numbers were taken immediately at the beginning of the incubation and at the end the cells that were produced during the incubation were used as a measure for the amount organic carbon that was assimilated into microbial biomass thus the aoc concentration was calculated from the average net growth determined from triplicate incubations converting the number of produced cells into carbon with a constant factor of 20 fg organic c cell 1 griebler et al 2002 for the incubation 80 ml diluted groundwater was incubated in 100 ml glass bottles at in situ groundwater temperature in the dark with shaking at 100 rpm cell numbers were measured as total prokaryotic cell counts by flow cytometry as described above all glassware used for the incubations were treated to remove traces of organic carbon as above 2 3 determination of hydrochemical parameters and isotope ratios groundwater temperature ph electrical conductivity and oxygen concentrations were measured on site using field sensors wtw weilheim germany concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured in samples passed through

least in duplicate 2 4 data analysis in order to detect disturbances in the three case studies we combined the signals of the d a c variables in a multivariate analysis as schematically shown in fig 2 under normal undisturbed conditions samples are expected to display a certain distribution in a multivariate space along these variables for multivariate normally distributed data a cloud of samples arrange in an elliptical form which is defined by the mean values of the variables forming the center of the ellipse the variances of the individual variables and the covariance between them determining the shape and slope of the ellipse disturbances that cause severe changes in one or more of these variables increase the distance of affected samples to the center of the ellipse beyond the range of distances expected due to random variation in other words samples affected by a disturbance can be considered outliers the distance of a single sample to the center is calculated as the mahalanobis distance according to equation 1 1 m d i x i μ s 1 x i μ where x i is a vector with the values of the individual variables for a single sample and μ and s 1 are the vector with the variable means and the inverse of the covariance matrix respectively calculated from the full data this distance is unitless and indicates how far a given sample lies away from the center of a multivariate distribution hence it can be considered a multidimensional extension of univariate z scores manly 1994 the mahalanobis distance takes values of the square root of a chi squared distribution with as many degrees of freedom as there are variables in the analysis e g df 3 when all three d a c variables are considered in the analysis this information is used to set thresholds to distinguish significant outliers from random variation in the data for example 97 5 of the values of a chi squared distribution with three degrees of freedom are 9 35 thus a sample with a mahalanobis distance above the critical value of 9 35 would be declared an outlier at a 0 975 confidence level and consequently be interpreted as a sign of a disturbance a simple numerical example is given in the supplementary material along with fig s5 problems arise however if mahalanobis distances are calculated based on the raw data directly since the presence of already a small fraction of outliers in the dataset can severely distort the estimates of μ and s therefore we used the fast mcd algorithm which can provide reliable robust estimates of μ and s in datasets contaminated with outliers and calculated robust mahalanobis distances based on these estimates hubert and debruyne 2010 rousseeuw and van driessen 1999 briefly the algorithm searches for a subset of samples of size h eq 2 h n p 1 2 where n is the number of samples in the dataset and p the number of variables with the smallest determinant of s i e with the smallest dispersion in the multivariate space and subsequently calculates μ and s based on these h samples we will refer to the final robust mahalanobis distances as the d a or d a c index respectively depending on the variables included in the analysis a sample was declared an outlier at a 0 975 confidence level if its calculated index value exceeded the square root of the 0 975 quantile of a chi squared distribution with the according degrees of freedom as described above rousseeuw and van driessen 1999 the strength of this multivariate approach is that it not only takes into account the variance of each variable but also possible correlations in the form of covariance between these variables which are not taken into account in separate univariate analyses of the individual variables manly 1994 to illustrate this strength we compared the multivariate d a c approach to a univariate method for outlier detection for this univariate approach separate thresholds were set for each variable based on the median and the median absolute deviation mad this approach was chosen because the median and the mad provide more robust estimates of the center and the dispersion of data respectively even in the presence of outliers compared to the mean and standard deviation similar to what has been explained above using this approach a sample was considered an outlier if it fell outside the range of median 2 5 mad as recommended by leys et al 2013 to assess differences in d a c signatures between regions i e differences between the covariance matrices and variable means we again applied the fast mcd algorithm to the data from the non contaminated aquifers sampled at the different regions across germany fig 1 box s m test was used to test for differences in covariance matrices i e robust estimates of s between regions differences in means for each variable were assessed using welch s anova followed by the corresponding games howell post hoc test for pairwise comparisons to assess differences between individual regions outliers for a given region that were detected based on the robust mahalanobis distances were not considered for the analysis of differences in means all analyses were done in r version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 and were performed on logarithmically log10 transformed data to achieve normality normality was confirmed using the shapiro wilk test implemented in the stats package and its multivariate extension to test for multivariate normality implemented in the mvnormtest package jarek 2012 robust estimates of μ and s and robust mahalanobis distances with additional adjustment for sample size according to pison et al 2002 were obtained using the covmcd function of the robustbase package maechler et al 2018 confidence ellipses two dimensional and ellipsoids three dimensional were calculated at a 0 975 confidence level based on the robust estimates of μ and s using the ellipse function of the ellipse package murdoch and chow 2018 and the ellipse3d function of the rgl package adler and murdoch 2018 respectively box s m tests were performed using a modified version of the according function from the biotools package da silva et al 2017 with the modification that the robust estimates of s were used as input instead of the raw data welch s anova was carried out using the oneway test function stats package games howell tests were performed using the userfriendlyscience package peters et al 2018 an example of the d a c analysis workflow in r to detect disturbances is provided as supplementary material 3 results 3 1 using the d a c index to detect disturbances 3 1 1 case study 1 organic contamination for simplicity and for reasons that will be discussed below the analysis was based only on the variables cell density and activity to introduce how disturbances can be detected based on the identification of outliers all contaminated samples were correctly identified as outliers by the multivariate approach using the d a index which exceeded the critical value of the chi squared distribution for all contaminated samples fig 3 in general the contaminated samples showed higher activity levels as well as higher cell densities compared to the non contaminated samples however if both variables were considered separately in univariate analyses only 83 of the contaminated samples would have been correctly identified as outliers based on cell density based on activity the fraction would have been even lower with only 53 even if the outcomes of the two separate univariate analyses were to be considered together still 17 of the contaminated samples would not have been detected as outliers this is apparent from the bivariate plot where a group of contaminated samples clearly deviates from the distribution of non contaminated samples indicated by the confidence ellipse but still falls within the univariate thresholds for cell density and activity fig 3 in fact by looking at the bivariate plot it is becomes clear that in principle any sample that would lie to the top left or the bottom right of the confidence ellipse would not be detected as an outlier using the univariate approach if it still fell within the range defined by the univariate thresholds even though it would clearly deviate from the distribution of the rest of the data along the two variables this distribution is not only shaped by the variances of the variables but also their mutual covariance which is ignored with the univariate approach thus by making use of the additional information about covariance the multivariate approach fully exploits the information gained from the two variables thereby it is able to provide a more accurate picture about the available data and accordingly allows for a more accurate identification of outliers to assess the impact of the fraction of contaminated samples in the dataset on the ability of the two approaches to detect those contaminated samples as outliers we repeated the analysis from above with datasets containing different fractions of contaminated samples ranging from 10 to 60 for each fraction we constructed 100 datasets with a total of 70 samples that were randomly selected from the non contaminated site and the hydrocarbon contaminated site respectively for each dataset we calculated the average fraction of contaminated samples that were correctly identified as outliers using the univariate approach where a sample was declared an outlier if it fell outside the median 2 5 mad thresholds of either of the two variables and the multivariate approach respectively fig 4 at a fraction of 10 of contaminated samples in the dataset both approaches were equally reliable detecting 99 of the contaminated samples as outliers welch s t test t 99 1 42 p 0 16 however already at 20 contaminated samples the multivariate approach detected the contaminated samples significantly more reliably 98 5 compared to the univariate approach 93 7 welch s t test t 140 2 6 21 p 0 0001 and was able to correctly identify 96 of the contaminated samples as outliers up to a fraction of 30 contaminated samples in the dataset above which also the multivariate approach started to noticeably lose its reliability 3 1 2 case study 2 surface water intrusion as for the previous example the analysis was based only on the variables cell density and activity out of the total of 108 samples nine samples were identified as outliers using the multivariate approach as indicated by the d a index for these nine samples which exceeded the critical value of the chi squared distribution fig 5 the presence of these outliers coincided with the period of the increased surface water intrusion and seemed to reflect the spatiotemporal impact of this event in january at the early stage of the event the effect of the surface water intrusion was only apparent close to the river as indicated by the outlier from a well at a 2 m distance from the river however at the later stage in march when the surface water had reached the areas more distant from the river outliers were also detected 60 and 75 m away from the river after the surface water had receded the system appeared to have recovered from the disturbance the only exception was a single well 60 m away from the river that was still identified as an outlier in april june and october which however did not seem to be directly related to the surface water intrusion fig s2 similar to the results for the first disturbance case study the multivariate approach detected outliers more sensitively compared to the univariate approach only four samples that were identified as outliers in the multivariate analysis also fell outside the range defined by the median 2 5 mad for cell density as well as activity if both were considered separately if the information for both variables were to be combined still one outlier would not have been detected which was detected by the multivariate approach 3 1 3 case study 3 impact of different types of land use considering only cell density and activity in the multivariate analysis no significant outliers were detected for any of the three types of land use although the d a index value of a single sample from the agricultural land was close to the critical value of the chi squared distribution fig 6 however if the aoc concentration was additionally included in the analysis five outliers could be clearly identified based on the d a c index three of which derived from the agricultural land showing lower aoc concentrations than the majority of the samples and two from the grassland which showed higher aoc concentrations similar to the first two disturbance case studies these outliers would not have been detected based on separate univariate analyses except for one sample from the agricultural land which fell below the lower threshold for activity fig s3 the hydrochemical data revealed that the three outlier samples from the agricultural land displayed exceptionally high nitrate concentrations 100 mg l 1 as well as unusually high dissolved oxygen concentrations for the region and were among the samples with the lowest ph in the entire dataset fig s4 for the two outliers from the grassland the chemical data revealed unusually high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon corresponding to the high aoc concentrations for these samples as well as relatively low ph values fig s4 3 2 regional differences in d a c signatures for simplicity of display the signatures of the nine different regions are shown in fig 7 only based on the two variables cell density and activity the signature of each region is defined by the center i e mean values of each variable and the covariance matrix which both are graphically captured by the confidence ellipse already based on visual comparison of the confidence ellipses clear differences were apparent between each region and the full dataset as well as between the individual regions both in terms of variable means and covariances significant differences in covariance matrices between regions were confirmed using box s m test on the robust estimates of the covariance matrices χ 2 24 76 5 p 0 0001 for the comparisons of variable means only samples were considered that were not indicated to be outliers for a given region based on their robust mahalanobis distances at a confidence level of 0 975 as seen for the covariance matrices significant differences were also found for the means of cell density welch s anova f 8 75 5 44 3 p 0 0001 and activity welch s anova f 8 75 8 14 0 p 0 0001 unfortunately aoc concentrations were not available for all samples we repeated the analyses only considering regions for which at least 10 samples were available with data for all three d a c variables table 1 the results were in agreement with the previous analysis showing significant differences between covariance matrices box s m χ 2 36 133 8 p 0 0001 and average aoc levels welch s anova f 6 27 5 12 9 p 0 0001 additional pairwise comparisons of means for each variable revealed that although the overall differences were significant differences between pairs of regions were relatively small mainly occurring within one order of magnitude for each variable fig 8 summary statistics for each region are given in table s1 moreover even though there were significant correlations between the d a c variables considering the full dataset pearson s r cell density activity 0 463 p 0 0001 r activity carbon 0 285 p 0 008 not significant r cell density carbon 0 191 p 0 08 the pairwise comparisons further showed that these variables are not mutually redundant as significant differences between two regions in one variable did not necessarily coincide with significant differences in another variable for a given pair of regions 4 discussion despite the fact that policy makers in different parts of the world have started to acknowledge the ecosystem status of groundwater aquifers and therefore no longer consider them as lifeless storages of freshwater ecological aspects still receive little attention in groundwater monitoring to date however several advantages could be gained from the incorporation ecological parameters into routine groundwater monitoring not only would it allow for a better protection of unique groundwater ecosystems it would also enable a more sustainable and informed ecosystem management thereby helping maintain important ecosystem services such as the provision of clean freshwater griebler and avramov 2015 griebler et al 2014 moreover given that the indigenous organisms have adapted to the characteristically stable environmental conditions of groundwater aquifers they can be expected to react sensitively to various disturbances some of which might not be detected by conventional monitoring of physicochemical parameters alone therefore the sensitivity of routine groundwater monitoring could be increased by considering ecological parameters danielopol et al 2007 griebler and avramov 2015 griebler et al 2014 however one of the main reasons for the currently still lacking implementation of ecological criteria is certainly the lack of suitable tools that can be easily incorporated into already existing routine monitoring practices the integrated analysis using the d a c index presented here offers an easily implementable approach to meet this demand previous studies have analyzed responses of prokaryotic microorganisms to different disturbances for instance increased microbial activity and growth have been reported in response to increased concentrations and fluxes of carbon caused by groundwater recharge with surface water foulquier et al 2011 mermillod blondin et al 2013 van driezum et al 2018 or suddenly occurring contamination with aromatic hydrocarbons herzyk et al 2017 these general trends are in line with our observations for the first two disturbance case studies however in contrast to the monitoring of drinking water distribution systems fdha 2012 van nevel et al 2017 most of the studies that have investigated these parameters in relation to different disturbances of groundwater ecosystems so far have mainly been descriptive and did not provide a practical framework of how these parameters could be integrated into monitoring protocols our approach uses an integrated analysis of multiple microbiological variables to detect disturbances although it has been shown that for example microbial activity correlates positively with microbial cell numbers eydal and pedersen 2007 foulquier et al 2011 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 van nevel et al 2017 a pattern that was also reflected in our data these variables should not be regarded as mutually redundant our analyses showed that disturbances were not equally mirrored by these two variables and furthermore that significant differences between regions in one variable did not necessarily coincide with significant differences in another variable it is crucial to realize that total prokaryotic cell counts are a measure of the total number of cells in a sample while only the active fraction of these cells contributes to the activity measured as intracellular atp concentrations these two variables can be affected differently by different disturbances or over different time scales for instance it could be shown that microbial cell density can exhibit a delayed response to increased nutrient inputs foulquier et al 2011 while intracellular atp concentrations can react almost immediately hofmann and griebler 2018 moreover although such a pattern was not observed in our particular example of the surface water intrusion event it is easy to imagine how surface water intrusion could cause an increase in microbial cell numbers without changes in activity this would be the case if cells from the surface water were transported into the groundwater but were inactivated by the characteristically lower nutrient levels in the groundwater compared to surface water hence considering multiple variables can allow for a more nuanced approach to detect different types of disturbances we additionally demonstrated the advantages of a simultaneous multivariate analysis of the considered microbiological variables compared to separate univariate analyses of each variable the main advantage of the multivariate approach is that correlations between the variables are also taken into account thereby capturing the actual distribution of samples along the measured variables unlike univariate approaches where each variable is analyzed separately and thereby possible correlations are ignored manly 1994 our analyses showed that disturbances were not only detected more sensitively by the multivariate approach but also that it was more robust by being able to detect disturbances more reliably in datasets with higher fractions of contaminated samples compared to the univariate approach moreover using the d a c index i e robust mahalanobis distances as indicator of disturbances offers an easy interpretation of the data based on a single value which integrates the signals from multiple variables the power of this approach to detect anomalies i e outliers has already been successfully demonstrated in various contexts ranging from finance to astronomy and biotechnology as well as quality monitoring of industrial manufacturing processes cohen freue et al 2007 hubert et al 2017 rousseeuw and van driessen 1999 which allows for a seamless transfer of this approach into the context of ecological monitoring moreover the approach can be easily extended by additional variables that may be identified in the future as sensitive indicators of disturbances without compromising the simplicity of the analysis since the interpretation would still be based on a single index value regardless of the number of variables considered in the analysis for example additional information such as cell size distributions numbers of phototrophic cells ratios of live over dead cells or ratios of cells with high nucleic acid content over cells with low nucleic acid content can be directly derived from flow cytometry measurements used to determine cell densities hammes et al 2011 hammes and egli 2010 van nevel et al 2017 wang et al 2010 this enables a straightforward amendment of the analysis which may further increase the sensitivity of detecting disturbances we have illustrated how the analysis can be extended and its sensitivity can be increased by including additional variables based on the example of the third disturbance case study related to the impacts of different types of land use in this example disturbances related to agricultural land use that were not identified by only looking at cell density and activity could be identified by additionally including aoc concentrations in the analysis although a higher sensitivity was achieved in this particular example by amending the analysis with aoc there are certain pitfalls associated with this variable that need to be considered it is important to remember that the aoc concentration is derived indirectly from the increase in cell numbers in a sample over a certain amount of time during batch incubation under in situ groundwater conditions i e in the dark and the according temperature hammes and egli 2005 however from our own experience this measure is only applicable under certain conditions for instance we have frequently noticed that the cell density decreases over the course of the incubation resulting in calculated negative aoc concentrations this is mainly the case for surface water samples where phototrophic cells die and decay during the incubation in the dark or for groundwater samples that are strongly affected by surface water and may have contained phototrophic cells moreover we can think of cases where the presence of toxic compounds like heavy metals can lead to growth inhibition şengör et al 2009 in such a case the cell density in a sample would not increase or only increase slightly during the incubation which would be falsely interpreted as low aoc concentrations similar situations would arise in cases where carbon is not the limiting resource but the cell growth is constrained by the availability of other essential nutrients like nitrogen or phosphate hofmann and griebler 2018 or electron acceptors as is often the case for organically contaminated groundwater meckenstock et al 2015 in the light of these pitfalls we recommend the use of aoc as an additional variable only for groundwater samples in absence of strong surface water impacts furthermore protocols to measure aoc could be adjusted by amending samples with additional nitrogen and phosphate sources to overcome potential biases of aoc estimates caused by nutrient limitations trimbach et al in prep certain shortcomings may also be encountered if only cell density and activity are considered the disturbance case studies that we investigated to test our approach could all be roughly categorized as disturbances that affect organic carbon and nutrient levels in the groundwater even though we could clearly demonstrate that these disturbances can be detected by the multivariate analysis of prokaryotic cell density and activity there are other potential impacts which might not be detected using this approach one example could be groundwater contamination with micropollutants like pharmaceuticals or pesticides which has become a growing concern over the past years fenner et al 2013 lapworth et al 2012 since these compounds typically occur in groundwater only in concentrations of a few nanograms to micrograms per liter often much lower than ambient aoc concentrations they usually do not serve as substrate for microbial growth helbling 2015 and from a critical point of view might not be expected to have toxic effects on microorganisms that would cause noticeable changes in intracellular atp concentrations whether impacts caused by micropollutants can be detected at all based on microbiological parameters needs to be assessed in future research however in general certain other drawbacks of our approach could be alleviated by incorporating additional variables in the analysis as discussed above looking at the regional d a c signatures of non contaminated aquifers across germany we noticed significant differences in terms of average levels of prokaryotic cell density activity and aoc respectively as well as covariance matrices a detailed discussion of differences between individual regions would exceed the scope of this paper however the main implication of these findings for groundwater monitoring is that these differences between regions need to be taken into account for data collection and interpretation by analyzing data on a suitable regional scale furthermore our analysis revealed that disturbances can only be reliably detected up to a certain fraction of disturbed samples in the dataset therefore in practice a number of known reference monitoring wells should be routinely included in the analysis that are well protected against disturbances and provide a representative estimate of d a c signatures for a given region a step towards the biogeographical classification of groundwater ecosystems has been made by stein et al 2012 who showed that the distribution of metazoan groundwater fauna across germany does not agree with conventional classifications based on hydrogeology geochemistry or bioregions defined based on surface water fauna in the light of these findings we suggest that also the definition of suitable biogeographical boundaries for microbiological parameters should be guided by ecological criteria rather than being solely based on hydrogeology or geochemistry 5 conclusion we have shown that prokaryotic cell density and activity can be used as reliable and sensitive indicators of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems these parameters can be easily integrated into existing groundwater monitoring schemes as they are simple and inexpensive to measure and furthermore can be analyzed in samples that can be directly collected along with samples for the routine monitoring of conventional physicochemical parameters furthermore we have demonstrated that the multivariate analysis of these variables using the d a c index not only allows for a higher sensitivity but also increases the robustness of the analysis compared to separate univariate analyses of the individual variables an even higher sensitivity might be achieved by including additional parameters in the analysis such as aoc concentrations under certain conditions moreover the presented approach can be seamlessly adapted to detect various types of disturbances by including additional parameters in the future while still allowing for an easy data interpretation based on a single index value i e robust mahalanobis distances that integrates the signals of all variables included in the analysis significant differences in the multivariate d a c signatures of the microbial variables between regions stress the importance of analyzing data and selecting reference wells at a suitable regional scale the definition of which should not only be guided by hydrogeology or geochemistry but primarily by ecological criteria

structure of algal and cyanobacterial flocs produced by five species green algae chlorella vulgaris and cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa strain cs 564 microcystis aeruginosa strain cs 555 01 dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii using aluminium sulphate alum at different doses and ph values the properties of spherical compact flocs were determined using a laser diffraction instrument and a new in situ image analysis technique was validated to analyse the structure of more complex flocs the incorporation of algal derived organic matter aom into the flocs was inferred by evaluating the dissolved organic matter concentration character before and after flocculation using liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd d circinale c raciborskii and m aeruginosa cs 564 produced large flocs 2 9 mm while m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris produced smaller flocs 2 mm while differences in physical floc properties were observed to result from changes in coagulation mechanism the cell morphology and the aom composition were the most influential factors examination of floc properties can give a rapid insight at the plant for trouble shooting particularly through the use of the in situ techniques and provide a mechanism by which floc properties can be tailored to downstream processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords biomass cyanobacteria coagulation flocculation separation water treatment 1 introduction algae and cyanobacteria can have very different morphology size cell surface properties and algal derived organic matter aom composition henderson et al 2008 villacorte et al 2015 lama et al 2016 this diversity makes coagulation and flocculation c f of these species challenging as coagulation conditions that may be effective for one species may be unsuccessful for another henderson et al 2010 lama et al 2016 while the impact of both cell and aom character has been well investigated in respect to coagulation bernhardt et al 1989 pivokonsky et al 2016 this is not the case for flocculation when assessing the flocculation behaviour of algae an examination of physical floc properties size strength and density is important to optimise separation for example sedimentation favours large dense flocs to improve sedimentation rate while flotation is more suited to low density pin point flocs that will maximise rise velocity and minimise floc rupture due to the turbulence created on bubble injection edzwald 1995 while algal floc properties have been studied for specific species henderson et al 2006 gonzalez torres et al 2014 limited studies have investigated the impact of aom composition and cell morphology on floc properties for example lama et al 2016 studied the flocculation behaviour of ten algal and cyanobacterial species using metal salts biopolymer and magnesium hydroxide precipitates finding that the separation was variable due to inefficient coagulation but only floc size was examined similarly henderson et al 2010 studied the coagulation conditions of four algal and cyanobacterial species that differed in morphology from a water treatment perspective it was determined that the cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa required a higher dose of coagulant than the green algal species chlorella vulgaris which was attributed to protein coagulant complexation however physical floc properties were not a focus of this work there is therefore a need for research that compares the impact of different algal and cyanobacterial morphology and aom composition on physical floc properties one issue hindering research into algal floc analysis is the lack of a standard method for the in situ analysis of algal and cyanobacterial flocs that deviate from an approximately spherical shape typical laser diffraction methods applied in the literature for nom flocs measure the size of an equivalent solid sphere however algal flocs are frequently highly irregular and porous and so cannot be measured using diffraction methods jarvis et al 2005 photography combined with image analysis has been utilized for ex situ measurement of complex flocs this technique requires floc extraction and measurement of the size manually via microscopy where it has been successfully used for floc sizes ranging between 100 and 2800 μm wu and wheatley 2010 vandamme et al 2014 lama et al 2016 to illustrate wu and wheatley 2010 used image analysis to determine activated sludge floc size finding that 50 images were required to obtain statistically significant results while lama et al 2016 used image analysis to analyse 100 500 separate algal and cyanobacterial flocs after extraction to provide reliable results however the floc extraction procedure can lead to floc breakage and is time consuming hence methods to determine floc size without floc extraction have been developed chakraborti et al 2000 flory et al 2004 for example flory et al 2004 were able to measure algal floc sizes 100 μm using an in situ particle backscattering technique more recently a device called the floccam has been commercialised that can determine floc size during the flocculation process without floc extraction lapointe and barbeau 2017 the floccam monitors floc particles during jar test by digital imaging although it has the limitation of only measuring flocs greater than 30 μm with smaller flocs providing a source of measurement interference image analysis using in situ techniques has the potential to be suitable for the measurement of relatively large algal flocs however validation of the technique would be required to enable a systematic comparison of the floc properties for a range of algal and cyanobacterial cells the aim of this research was therefore to investigate how cell morphology aom composition and cell charge density impact the physical floc properties of algal and cyanobacterial flocs five algal and cyanobacterial species all commonly found in water reservoirs but differing in size shape and aom composition were investigated the five species were treated by coagulation using alum followed by sedimentation two different doses of coagulant and two ph values were applied in order to determine the extent to which these impacted floc properties in comparison to the algal system properties for three of the five species under investigation floc properties were not able to be analysed via standard laser diffraction instruments as they deviated significantly from a spherical shape hence a method to analyse non spherical flocs using the commercial floccam device was validated and applied 2 materials and method 2 1 algal and cyanobacterial cultures the freshwater cyanobacteria cultures cylindrospermopsis raciborskii strain cs 508 filamentous species

cultures were grown in a temperature cycling chamber incubator pg50 labec australia programmed to give a 16 8 h light dark cycle and associated temperature control of 21 c 15 c cultures were grown in 100 ml batches in 250 ml conical flasks and shaken by hand daily cell growth cycle was monitored for all species by performing cell counts via light microscopy leica dm750 leica microsystems ltd australia and a neubauer haemocytometer or sedgewick rafter chamber depending on the cell concentration the cell counting for filamentous species cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and dolichospermum circinale was conducted following the world health organisation guidelines bartram and rees 2000 for each sample cell concentration was determined in cells ml 1 based on the average of three separate samples counting at least 100 cells in triplicate zeta potential zp of the cell system and the associated organic matter was measured using a zetasizer nano malvern australia and a dts1060 plastic folded capillary cell malvern australia all sample analysis was carried out in triplicate 2 2 jar testing procedure coagulation and flocculation experiments were carried out using cells and aom harvested between 10 and 12 days for c vulgaris and m aeruginosa strains cs 555 and strain cs 564 and 20 22 days for c raciborski and d circinale at the time point of the late exponential growth phase the cell and aom concentration averages determined at this growth phase are shown in table 1 aluminium sulphate as a solid al2 so4 3 16h2o alum sigma aldrich australia was used as a coagulant alum was prepared in distilled water to obtain concentrations of 10 g l 1 as al and used as a stock solution all coagulation flocculation experiments were carried out using a velp scientifica jar tester fc 4s and fc 6s italy with 76 25 mm flat paddle impellers using cylindrical jars containing 1 l samples of suspension initially the cell sample was rapidly mixed at 200 rpm g 167 s 1 as estimated using equation g 0 0538 rpm1 5174 provided by the manufacturer for 2 min while coagulant was first added followed by ph correction to the desired value followed by a slow stir phase at 30 rpm g 9 4 s 1 for 25 min to promote the collision of particles after 10 min of flocculation triplicate samples of the suspension were extracted for zp analysis as described in 2 1 after 25 min of flocculation a 30 min settling period was undertaken where no shear was applied the resultant supernatant upon sedimentation was sampled from the mid point in the 1l jar and the cells were counted using a neubauer haemocytometer or sedgewick rafter counting chamber and a dm500 light microscope leica dm750 microscope leica microsystems ltd australia 2 3 selection of coagulation conditions for physical floc property analysis for each species a series of 8 10 jar tests were undertaken using the jar test conditions described previously by gonzalez torres et al 2014 to determine appropriate alum coagulant doses to provide conditions to drive conditions dominated by either charge neutralisation cn or sweep flocculation sf mechanisms this required relatively low and high doses of coagulant respectively the ph values of 6 and 7 were selected for optimal coagulation based on solubility diagrams for al3 metal salts presented in duan and gregory 2003 as previously undertaken in gonzalez torres et al 2014 separation cell separation was estimated following equation 1 1 s e p a r a t i o n c i c f c i 100 where separation is the cell removal in percentage ci is the initial cell concentration cells ml 1 before the jar test and cf is the final cell concentration after the jar test cells ml 1 2 4 floc property analysis floc properties were determined for the four coagulation scenarios low and high coagulant doses at ph 6 and 7 in order to promote conditions dominated by either charge neutralisation or sweep flocculation coagulation mechanisms respectively following gonzalez torres et al 2014 for uniform flocs the initial steady state floc size before breakage d 1 the steady state floc size after breakage d 2 and the steady state floc size after re growth d 3 were estimated as described by gonzalez torres et al 2014 strength factor was thus determined following equation 2 where the higher the strength factor the stronger the flocs 2 strength factor d 2 d 1 100 a recovery number rn was also determined using d 1 and d 3 as shown in equation 3 the rn indicates the extent to which the flocs differed from the initial size after the recovery stage an rn higher than 1 indicates that flocs grew to a larger size than the initial steady size after the breakage period an rn of approximately 1 indicates that the floc size did not vary significantly from the initial size to re growth while an rn less than 1 indicates the flocs did not recover to the initial steady size 3 rn d 3 d 1 2 4 1 physical floc properties for approximately spherical flocs approximately spherical flocs were produced by c vulgaris and m aeruginosa cs 555 these flocs were therefore analysed using an experimental set up similar to that described in jarvis et al 2005 and applied in gonzalez torres et al 2014 briefly the velp scientifica jar tester was connected via a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0 9 l h 1 to laser diffraction sizing instruments the mastersizer 2000 and 3000 malvern australia were used during the course of the study to examine dynamic floc size floc property experiments were carried out using the conditions discussed in 2 3 however after the slow stirring phase rather than applying a period of sedimentation the impact of high shear on floc size was studied by varying the speed of the jar test paddles to 200 rpm 167 s 1 for 15 min after which the paddle speed was subsequently controlled to 30 rpm for a further 20 min to examine the potential for floc regeneration overall an experiment for one shear value took 62 min and all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 2 physical floc properties for non spherical flocs non spherical flocs were produced by filamentous species c raciborskii and d circinali and by spherical m aeruginosa cs 564 cells the floc growth profile for these non spherical flocs was therefore determined using floccam instrument durasens usa the camera monitors floc particle formation during the jar test providing real time measurements and a time exposure of 1 1000 s was applied the floccam was mounted to a modified 2l standard jar test vessel wagner 2 l square hach fig 1 and connected to a velp scientifica jar tester and a computer to graphically display real time floc character floccam jar tests were conducted using the same conditions as described by gonzalez torres et al 2014 however the speed was only varied to 200 rpm g 167 s 1 estimated using g 0 0538 rpm1 5174 according to the manufacturer during the breakage phase floccam software ver 1 45 durasens usa was used for data analysis floc size was estimated using lengthv equivalent to the commonly used particle sizing parameter the volume or mass moment mean also called the de brouckere mean diameter and denoted d 4 3 in which each floc size was associated with floc length and volume using equation 4 4 l e n g t h v i 1 n v i l i i 1 n v i where v i is the volume of floc i and l i is the length of the floc lengthv was used to generate floc growth profiles from the floc growth profiles it was possible to evaluate the initial steady state size size after exposure to increased shear and regrowth potential specifically steady state floc size was calculated by taking the average of all floc sizes after steady state was achieved but before the breakage period d 1 10 27 min the floc size after breakage was calculated as the average of the floc size reached after the flocs were exposed to an increase of shear d 2 43 min the floc size on regrowth was obtained by calculating the average of the d 50 values during the re growth phase of the flocs d 3 50 60 min a comparison of c vulgaris floc sizes measured using both the floccam and mastersizer 3000 was conducted to validate the method section s1 in supplementary data sd the average floc size obtained for both methods were not statistically different p 0 05 2 5 assessing algal organic matter composition pre and post flocculation aom composition was determined using size exclusion liquid chromatography with organic carbon uv254 and organic nitrogen detection lc ocd doc labor germany huber et al 2011 the lc ocd instrument was used to fractionate the organic compounds according to their approximate molecular weight a retention time of approximately 35 min indicated the presence of high molecular weight biopolymers with those at progressively longer retention times designated humic substances building blocks and finally low molecular weight lmw acids and then neutrals as operationally defined huber et al 2011 chekli et al 2017 huber et al 2011 demonstrated that the combination of the three detectors enables the determination of the chemical characteristics of various size fractions including the approximate proportions of carbohydrates and proteins in the biopolymer fraction the proportion of each organic compound was calculated using chromcalc doc labor software chromcalc doc labor 2013 software doc labor germany the removal of the various size fractions from the bulk suspension during coagulation and by inference their incorporation into the floc samples was evaluated by analysing the lc ocd chromatograms obtained before and after coagulation and flocculation see figures s2 1 3 sd for samples obtained after flocculation a dilute dissolved alum sample was analysed to account for any trace organic impurities that may have been introduced by the coagulant the resultant proportion of the aom incorporated into the floc was thus calculated using equation 5 slavik et al 2012 5 x x start x end x coagulant x start 100 where x represents the percentage of the particular doc fraction removed during coagulation e g biopolymers building blocks etc xstart denotes the fraction of x before the coagulation and xend denotes the x fraction after coagulation and xcoagulant represents the x fraction contributed by the coagulant it is of note that this therefore also enables identification of the release of aom during coagulation which may occur as a result of chemical or shear stress and would be apparent from a negative value 2 6 statistical analysis all sample analysis was carried out in measurement triplicates all jar tests for floc property analysis were taken in biological triplicates i e three jar tests each using a different algal or cyanobacterial culture the results of these are expressed as the mean of three independent replicates with error indicating one standard deviation for each set of conditions the error bars in figs 2 4 and 6 therefore represent the standard deviation of the zeta potential and cell removal initial steady floc size and recovery number for different species and conditions studied respectively floc properties obtained for the different coagulation conditions were statistically compared using a one way analysis of variance anova with a level of significance set at 0 05 using graphpad prism version 7 02 for window graphpad software the normality of the data was determined with the shapiro wilk normality test graphpad prism 7 02 graphpad software correlations between floc size strength factor recovery number and aom compounds were identified by means of univariate linear correlation regression analysis was performed to assess the statistical significance or different relationships between these parameters and was considered statistically significant with a 95 confidence interval when a linear correlation was observed r2 0 8 and p 0 05 the slope of the equation was analysed to determine if the correlation was positive or negative 3 results and discussion 3 1 cell and aom characterisation the aom concentration determined for the five species in this study was in the range 2 9 13 7 10 10 mg as c cell 1 table 1 the aom extracted from c raciborskii had the lowest doc concentration 2 9 3 8 10 10 mg as c cell 1 while d circinale aom had the highest values 10 6 13 7 10 10 mg as c cell 1 the aom of m aeruginosa cs 564 had approximately 1 8 times the doc concentration than m aeruginosa cs 555 despite being the same species 8 5 9 1 and 3 9 5 7 10 10 mg as c cell 1 respectively the aom analysis using lc ocd showed that similar organic fractions were present in all species although the concentration varied table 1 aom from m aeruginosa cs 564 and c raciborskii had the lowest biopolymer contents 5 10 and 2 17 respectively while c vulgaris aom had the highest 7 5 61 3 c vulgaris also had the highest concentration of carbohydrates at 0 08 0 6 mg of carbohydrate as doc per mg of aom as doc aom extracted from m aeruginosa cs 555 had the highest protein aom ratio but the lowest carbohydrate aom ratio some molecules present in m aeruginosa cs 564 aom eluted from the size exclusion sec column at the same time as the peak conventionally described as humic substances huber et al 2011 however the associated uv254 signal was very low indicating the presence of aliphatic rather than aromatic components in this fraction this fraction therefore more likely comprised aliphatic building blocks of biopolymers that are in the same size range as the humic substances identified by huber et al 2011 however for ease of reference these will continue to be referred to as humic like substances in this study as has previously been done in other studies e g villacorte et al 2015 the charge of algae and cyanobacteria in both the cell system cells and associated aom and aom alone was evaluated through the measurement of zp and charge density the zp values for the cell system ranged from 8 2 to 27 mv depending on the species where c vulgaris had the most negative values and c raciborskii the least negative table 1 the zp values for aom samples ranged from 6 4 to 28 3 mv where m aeruginosa cs 564 had the most negative value and again c raciborskii had the least negative value table 1 all zp values were comparable with those previously determined for cyanobacterial and algal species henderson et al 2008 2010 charge equivalents normalised to cell number were in the range 0 6 to 2 5 10 7 meq cell 1 where c raciborskii had the least negative charge density and c vulgaris the most negative the charge density values were approximately 10 times less than values previously reported rao et al 2018 the discrepancy in the results is attributed to the variance in culture replicates the charge density contributed by aom was estimated by comparing the charge density of the whole cell system to aom only samples it was determined that aom contributed between 67 and 100 of the total charge density depending on the species where c raciborskii and d circinale aom gave the lowest and highest proportions respectively the majority of negative charge in cells and aom was likely contributed by acidic polysaccharides for example uronic acids present at the cell wall and in the dissolved aom coimbra et al 1998 pivokonsky et al 2016 overall the lc ocd and charge analysis suggested that the major differences in aom between species can be attributed to biopolymer composition and charge density likely the concentration of charged polysaccharides which are hypothesised to contribute to unique coagulation behaviour and floc properties 3 2 analysis of the effectiveness of the cell separation the optimal doses for effective separation are presented in table 2 a low coagulant dose corresponded with a zp value that was close to neutral for c vulgaris c raciborskii and m aeruginosa cs 564 and achieved at least 85 cell removal under these conditions charge neutralisation coagulation mechanisms were expected to dominate gonzalez torres et al 2014 the high doses were selected based firstly on the literature where it has been shown that for values greater than 30 mg l 1 as al2so4 sweep flocculation dominates duan and gregory 2003 and secondly based on that required to achieve maximum cell removal c f using alum was successful for all the species with cell separation ranging from 85 to 98 1 at low and high coagulant alum doses for ph 6 and 7 fig 2 a region of instability was observed for m aeruginosa cs 555 when coagulating at ph 6 for doses between 32 47 10 10 mg al cell 1 fig 2e which was attributed to slight restabilisation and aom coagulant complexation peptides and proteins al as previously determined by henderson et al 2010 and pivokonsky et al 2012 no other conditions examined dose ph or species strains exhibited a restabilisation zone attributed to the content and the composition of aom biopolymers are hypothesised to act as a flocculant aid overcoming the electrostatic repulsion as previously determined by henderson et al 2010 3 3 examination of the net change in dissolved organic carbon fractions on coagulation flocculation the detailed composition of the organic compounds before and after flocculation was analysed using lc ocd with the objective of evaluating the incorporation of organic compounds into the flocs figures s2 1 5 in sd it was observed that more than 80 of the initial biopolymers were incorporated into the flocs for most coagulation conditions fig 3a the exceptions were m aeruginosa cs 564 samples coagulated under low coagulant doses and d circinale samples for all coagulation conditions fig 3a where an overall increase in biopolymer concentration was observed after coagulation this may have been caused by additional aom release as a result of cell stress a consequence of chemical interactions with the coagulant the high proportion of biopolymer incorporated into the flocs was attributed to interactions between biopolymers and coagulants high biopolymer removal during coagulation of cyanobacteria has been previously reported by pivokonsky et al 2012 and safarikova et al 2013 due to these interactions building blocks were not incorporated into the flocs as indicated by no net change in content in the solution after coagulation fig 3b a minor increase in building blocks after coagulation was observed for some species again attributed to aom release due to cell stress it had been previously reported that building blocks with low specific uv absorbance suva and low aromaticity are poorly removed by c f huber et al 2011 similarly negligible incorporation of low mw acids or neutrals into the flocs was observed fig 3c and d for the filamentous species c raciborskii and d circinale this could have been masked by the significant increase in lmw neutral molecules that was observed post coagulation for the filamentous species again attributed to cell stress fig 3d previous research suggests that removal of these molecules during coagulation is not likely pivokonsky et al 2014 note that the removal of humic like substances was not analysed as these compounds were only observed in one species overall biopolymers were typically observed to be well incorporated into the flocs while building blocks and lmw compounds were not however the use of this technique for examining biomolecular composition of the flocs was hindered by net increases in some fractions under certain conditions overall the presence of biopolymers in the flocs even at low concentration can enhance the coagulation process by acting as polymer aids forming larger flocs chekli et al 2017 this is analysed in more detail by examining the floc properties 3 4 comparison of the impact of cell morphology and aom composition on physical floc properties 3 4 1 impact on floc size the median average equivalent diameter floc size d 1 was determined for the various coagulation scenarios for each of the five species studied fig s3 and fig 4 m aeruginosa cs 564 produced the largest flocs ranging from 7000 μm to 12000 μm while m aeruginosa cs 555 produced the smallest flocs ranging from 500 to 650 μm fig 4 it is important to note that these disparities were observed despite the fact that these were both m aeruginosa species that were visually similar being unicellular and of spherical cell shape d circinale and c raciborskii which are filamentous species with filaments reaching up to 1 mm long formed larger flocs than the smaller spherical species except for m aeruginosa cs 564 each of these species also produced flocs that significantly deviated from a spherical floc structure fig 5 previously a linear relationship between cell size and floc size was reported by lama et al 2016 who examined a variety of species and the fact that this linearity was not observed in the current study is attributed to the widely variable aom the difference in floc size between the unicellular spherical microalgae and cyanobacteria strains was examined in relation to the aom composition in particular the biopolymers which were demonstrated to be well incorporated into the flocs fig 3a m aeruginosa cs 564 aom had a lower biopolymer concentration overall with a similar and lower carbohydrate concentration when compared to m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris respectively m aeruginosa cs 564 aom also had a lower protein concentration than both of the other two spherical species m aeruginosa cs 564 and c vulgaris aom had a similar zp and had higher zp and charge density than m aeruginosa cs 555 aom c vulgaris aom had the highest charge density overall the charge is relevant as negatively charged biopolymers have been reported to have behaviour similar to that of anionic flocculants which can increase floc size this was previously reported for a ph of 6 8 due to a dissociation constant of carboxyl coo groups pivokonsky et al 2006 henderson et al 2008 gonzalez torres et al 2017 and it was previously reported in the literature that certain species of green algae and diatoms contain biopolymers that enable large aggregate formation bernhardt et al 1986 1989 chekli et al 2017 however in the current study it was interesting that while both m aeruginosa cs 564 and c vulgaris flocs were increased in size relative to those of m aeruginosa cs 555 m aeruginosa cs 564 flocs were far greater in size than those of c vulgaris m aeruginosa aom was present at increased concentrations relative to the other species which may also be important clearly the relationship between biopolymer concentration and character and floc formation is highly complex and assessing only total concentrations of biopolymers proteins and carbohydrates gives insufficient information to explain the exact mechanism that drives the floc size it is proposed that future work should investigate the specific protein and carbohydrate composition a key observation in this study was that the floc size differences between different coagulation conditions were relatively small in comparison with changes in respect to morphology and species fig 4 see table s4 this strongly suggests that the algal species will drive the prevailing floc characteristics irrespective of the coagulation conditions applied for a particular coagulant when using standard optimised metal salt coagulation the impact of changing coagulant type remains a knowledge gap 3 4 2 impact of aom composition and morphology on floc strength the capacity of flocs to resist breakage under high shear force was assessed using the strength factor which varied between 11 and 100 depending on the species fig 4 the floc strength factors were higher for filaments 79 100 than spherical cells 11 38 indicating that flocs formed from filamentous cells were more resistant to breakage as the flocs did not change significantly in size after exposure to high shear an exception was that of m aeruginosa cs 564 flocs which had strength values of 51 98 indicating that aom composition within the floc was also an important factor cell morphology aom composition and coagulation conditions were all observed to influence the strength factor examination of the flocs formed by filamentous species using a light microscope fig 5 showed that the filaments formed by the cells provided a backbone structure that improved the floc integrity as observed by burger et al 2017 for filamentous bacteria in extracellular polymeric substance eps flocs the filamentous backbone provides tensile strength within the floc and therefore an improvement in floc strength termed the filamentous backbone theory lau et al 1984 the backbone theory can therefore explain the high strength factor observed for filamentous bacteria and cyanobacteria flocs obtained in burger et al 2017 and this current study coagulation conditions did not significantly impact the strength of flocs produced by c raciborskii d circinale and m aeruginosa cs 564 p 0 05 table s4 but did have an impact on m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris flocs p 0 05 table s4 the strength factors obtained for flocs produced using a high dose of alum were statistically different than the values of low doses for m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris flocs p 0 05 table s4 previous studies determined that sf high coagulant dose produced stronger flocs than cn low coagulant dose and this may be attributed to an increase in strength gained through the chemical bonding within the cells and the aluminium hydroxides determined by gregory and duan 2001 and yukselen and gregory 2004 note that d circinale did not reach a neutral zeta potential at low dose therefore the doses used for d circinale were selected as the minimum coagulant dose required to achieve more than 85 of cell removal this demonstrates that complete charge neutralisation may not be required for successful coagulation if there are sufficient regions of neutralised or positively charged cells within the filamentous d circinale floc matrix 3 4 3 impact of aom composition and morphology on floc recovery floc regrowth capacity after breakage was examined using the rn fig 6 which indicates whether flocs are able to recover or maintain their size after being exposed to a period of increased shear eq 3 the flocs formed using the five species had rn values ranging from 0 22 to 1 14 the low rn values that were observed for c vulgaris flocs indicate that these flocs were not able to regrow to their original size under any coagulation conditions the rn for the remaining species were similar with average rn of 0 93 for the filamentous species c raciborskii and d circinale and 0 8 and 0 90 on average for m aeruginosa cs 555 and m aeruginosa cs 564 respectively these rn results were dependent to an extent on the cell morphology and coagulation conditions from which the flocs were formed fig 6 filamentous species have previously been observed to have little change in floc size under increased shear rates previously attributed to the fact that protruding filaments can reduce floc erosion as they dissipate some of the eddy forces interacting with the floc surface and increase floc resistance to shear burger et al 2017 the low rn values obtained for c vulgaris flocs wer attributed to large scale fragmentation being the main breakage mechanism as determined by gonzalez torres et al 2017 it is suggested that fragmentation might occur due to reduced binding between protein and coagulant gonzalez torres et al 2017 coagulation conditions had a significant impact on floc recovery with the exception of d circinale which had quite stable rn values the flocs produced at ph 6 tended to have better recovery than ph 7 particularly under low dose and therefore charge neutralisation conditions charge neutralisation conditions have previously been shown to favour higher rn values due to electrostatic interactions being able to be restored after breakage gonzalez torres et al 2014 3 5 statistical analysis of the impact of aom on physical floc properties the correlation between biopolymer content biopolymers aom protein protein aom carbohydrates carbohydrates aom and the protein to carbohydrates ratio in aom and floc size strength factor and recovery number was assessed for each coagulation scenario table 3 these parameters were selected as they were previously shown to play an important role in floc stability for algal and eps flocs bernhardt and clasen 1991 henderson et al 2010 cheng et al 2011 vandamme et al 2012 burger et al 2017 and moreover have been implicated in this research as important parameters figs 4 and 5 for all coagulation scenarios a statistically significant positive correlation between increased protein content protein aom and decreased floc size was observed table 3 this was also observed for strength and recovery number under certain coagulation conditions it is proposed that the high protein content may lead to greater interaction with coagulant thus decreasing the coagulant availability this is supported by data presented in fig 2 which showed that m aeruginosa cs 564 had a much higher coagulant demand than the other m aeruginosa strain examined previously it was determined that the presence of proteins in aom can negatively impact the net flocculation efficiency gregor et al 1996 pivokonsky et al 2012 safarikova et al 2013 for example pivokonsky et al 2012 reported that m aeruginosa aom proteins inhibited ferric sulphate coagulation due to the formation of fe protein surface complexes these complexes attached to the surface of metal coagulant hydroxide particles resulting in negatively charged areas on the surface of ferric coagulant colloidal particles leading to particle aggregation under low alum dose at ph 7 a positive statistically significant correlation between aom charge density and recovery number was observed while this was the only correlation that was statically significant for some other coagulation conditions the correlation coefficients were much higher and p values were only marginally outside the significant range p values of 0 07 and 0 08 suggesting that this could be examined in further detail with higher sample numbers this relationship suggests that the presence of negatively charged aom compounds can have a positive effect on the capacity of flocs to regrow after breakage this scenario is similar to that described in gonzalez torres et al 2014 whereby flocs formed under charge neutralisation low coagulant dose were able to reform due to the electrostatic interactions being restored after breakage no significant statistical difference between floc size and carbohydrates were observed in this study it could be attributed to the small sample set used or insignificant difference between carbohydrate aom ratio among species p 0 10 previously it has been reported that there was a relationship between floc strength and protein and carbohydrate ratio for activated sludge flocs sheng et al 2008 this correlation was not observed to be important for floc properties for the algal species samples considered in this study by statistical analysis table 3 the discrepancy between studies can be associated with the difference in the nature of the samples charge properties of algal cell surfaces and their biochemical compositions that may vary between different species and strains as observed by vandamme et al 2013 4 conclusions the impact of cell morphology and aom composition on physical floc properties was investigated the key findings are as follows image analysis using the floccam device was an effective technique to measure non spherical floc sizes without the need for floc extraction this method in addition to laser diffraction enabled determination of the physical floc properties obtained for a range of algal and cyanobacterial species under different coagulation conditions the physical floc properties were driven by cell morphology and aom characteristics two strains m aeruginosa cs 555 and m aeruginosa cs 564 exhibited completely different floc properties despite being the same species with similar morphology attributed to the different aom characteristics biopolymers were effectively removed during coagulation for c raciborskii m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris indicating that these were the dominant aom fraction within the flocs filamentous species produced flocs that were less affected by increasing shear with very high floc strength factor values attributed to filamentous backbone theory protein content was negatively correlated with floc size larger flocs were observed when there was a lower protein aom ratio negatively charged aom carbohydrates potentially behave as an anionic flocculant enhancing the formation of large flocs as observed for m aeruginosa cs 564 however there was no statistically significant relationship in this study between floc properties and carbohydrate content this might be a consequence of either the small sample set used or insignificant variation of carbohydrate concentration between samples further work is required in this area declaration of competing

structure of algal and cyanobacterial flocs produced by five species green algae chlorella vulgaris and cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa strain cs 564 microcystis aeruginosa strain cs 555 01 dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii using aluminium sulphate alum at different doses and ph values the properties of spherical compact flocs were determined using a laser diffraction instrument and a new in situ image analysis technique was validated to analyse the structure of more complex flocs the incorporation of algal derived organic matter aom into the flocs was inferred by evaluating the dissolved organic matter concentration character before and after flocculation using liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd d circinale c raciborskii and m aeruginosa cs 564 produced large flocs 2 9 mm while m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris produced smaller flocs 2 mm while differences in physical floc properties were observed to result from changes in coagulation mechanism the cell morphology and the aom composition were the most influential factors examination of floc properties can give a rapid insight at the plant for trouble shooting particularly through the use of the in situ techniques and provide a mechanism by which floc properties can be tailored to downstream processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords biomass cyanobacteria coagulation flocculation separation water treatment 1 introduction algae and cyanobacteria can have very different morphology size cell surface properties and algal derived organic matter aom composition henderson et al 2008 villacorte et al 2015 lama et al 2016 this diversity makes coagulation and flocculation c f of these species challenging as coagulation conditions that may be effective for one species may be unsuccessful for another henderson et al 2010 lama et al 2016 while the impact of both cell and aom character has been well investigated in respect to coagulation bernhardt et al 1989 pivokonsky et al 2016 this is not the case for flocculation when assessing the flocculation behaviour of algae an examination of physical floc properties size strength and density is important to optimise separation for example sedimentation favours large dense flocs to improve sedimentation rate while flotation is more suited to low density pin point flocs that will maximise rise velocity and minimise floc rupture due to the turbulence created on bubble injection edzwald 1995 while algal floc properties have been studied for specific species henderson et al 2006 gonzalez torres et al 2014 limited studies have investigated the impact of aom composition and cell morphology on floc properties for example lama et al 2016 studied the flocculation behaviour of ten algal and cyanobacterial species using metal salts biopolymer and magnesium hydroxide precipitates finding that the separation was variable due to inefficient coagulation but only floc size was examined similarly henderson et al 2010 studied the coagulation conditions of four algal and cyanobacterial species that differed in morphology from a water treatment perspective it was determined that the cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa required a higher dose of coagulant than the green algal species chlorella vulgaris which was attributed to protein coagulant complexation however physical floc properties were not a focus of this work there is therefore a need for research that compares the impact of different algal and cyanobacterial morphology and aom composition on physical floc properties one issue hindering research into algal floc analysis is the lack of a standard method for the in situ analysis of algal and cyanobacterial flocs that deviate from an approximately spherical shape typical laser diffraction methods applied in the literature for nom flocs measure the size of an equivalent solid sphere however algal flocs are frequently highly irregular and porous and so cannot be measured using diffraction methods jarvis et al 2005 photography combined with image analysis has been utilized for ex situ measurement of complex flocs this technique requires floc extraction and measurement of the size manually via microscopy where it has been successfully used for floc sizes ranging between 100 and 2800 μm wu and wheatley 2010 vandamme et al 2014 lama et al 2016 to illustrate wu and wheatley 2010 used image analysis to determine activated sludge floc size finding that 50 images were required to obtain statistically significant results while lama et al 2016 used image analysis to analyse 100 500 separate algal and cyanobacterial flocs after extraction to provide reliable results however the floc extraction procedure can lead to floc breakage and is time consuming hence methods to determine floc size without floc extraction have been developed chakraborti et al 2000 flory et al 2004 for example flory et al 2004 were able to measure algal floc sizes 100 μm using an in situ particle backscattering technique more recently a device called the floccam has been commercialised that can determine floc size during the flocculation process without floc extraction lapointe and barbeau 2017 the floccam monitors floc particles during jar test by digital imaging although it has the limitation of only measuring flocs greater than 30 μm with smaller flocs providing a source of measurement interference image analysis using in situ techniques has the potential to be suitable for the measurement of relatively large algal flocs however validation of the technique would be required to enable a systematic comparison of the floc properties for a range of algal and cyanobacterial cells the aim of this research was therefore to investigate how cell morphology aom composition and cell charge density impact the physical floc properties of algal and cyanobacterial flocs five algal and cyanobacterial species all commonly found in water reservoirs but differing in size shape and aom composition were investigated the five species were treated by coagulation using alum followed by sedimentation two different doses of coagulant and two ph values were applied in order to determine the extent to which these impacted floc properties in comparison to the algal system properties for three of the five species under investigation floc properties were not able to be analysed via standard laser diffraction instruments as they deviated significantly from a spherical shape hence a method to analyse non spherical flocs using the commercial floccam device was validated and applied 2 materials and method 2 1 algal and cyanobacterial cultures the freshwater cyanobacteria cultures cylindrospermopsis raciborskii strain cs 508 filamentous species dolichospermum circinale strain accr 02 filamentous species formerly anabaena circinale microcystis aeruginosa strain cs 555 01 and strain cs 564 spherical species and the green algae culture chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 spherical species were obtained from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro australian national algae culture collection anacc hobart australia as either non toxic strains or non toxic under the conditions of this study the cyanobacterial species were cultured in mla and the green algae in jaworski media bolch and blackburn 1996 the cultures were grown in a temperature cycling chamber incubator pg50 labec australia programmed to give a 16 8 h light dark cycle and associated temperature control of 21 c 15 c cultures were grown in 100 ml batches in 250 ml conical flasks and shaken by hand daily cell growth cycle was monitored for all species by performing cell counts via light microscopy leica dm750 leica microsystems ltd australia and a neubauer haemocytometer or sedgewick rafter chamber depending on the cell concentration the cell counting for filamentous species cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and dolichospermum circinale was conducted following the world health organisation guidelines bartram and rees 2000 for each sample cell concentration was determined in cells ml 1 based on the average of three separate samples counting at least 100 cells in triplicate zeta potential zp of the cell system and the associated organic matter was measured using a zetasizer nano malvern australia and a dts1060 plastic folded capillary cell malvern australia all sample analysis was carried out in triplicate 2 2 jar testing procedure coagulation and flocculation experiments were carried out using cells and aom harvested between 10 and 12 days for c vulgaris and m aeruginosa strains cs 555 and strain cs 564 and 20 22 days for c raciborski and d circinale at the time point of the late exponential growth phase the cell and aom concentration averages determined at this growth phase are shown in table 1 aluminium sulphate as a solid al2 so4 3 16h2o alum sigma aldrich australia was used as a coagulant alum was prepared in distilled water to obtain concentrations of 10 g l 1 as al and used as a stock solution all coagulation flocculation experiments were carried out using a velp scientifica jar tester fc 4s and fc 6s italy with 76 25 mm flat paddle impellers using cylindrical jars containing 1 l samples of suspension initially the cell sample was rapidly mixed at 200 rpm g 167 s 1 as estimated using equation g 0 0538 rpm1 5174 provided by the manufacturer for 2 min while coagulant was first added followed by ph correction to the desired value followed by a slow stir phase at 30 rpm g 9 4 s 1 for 25 min to promote the collision of particles after 10 min of flocculation triplicate samples of the suspension were extracted for zp analysis as described in 2 1 after 25 min of flocculation a 30 min settling period was undertaken where no shear was applied the resultant supernatant upon sedimentation was sampled from the mid point in the 1l jar and the cells were counted using a neubauer haemocytometer or sedgewick rafter counting chamber and a dm500 light microscope leica dm750 microscope leica microsystems ltd australia 2 3 selection of coagulation conditions for physical floc property analysis for each species a series of 8 10 jar tests were undertaken using the jar test conditions described previously by gonzalez torres et al 2014 to determine appropriate alum coagulant doses to provide conditions to drive conditions dominated by either charge neutralisation cn or sweep flocculation sf mechanisms this required relatively low and high doses of coagulant respectively the ph values of 6 and 7 were selected for optimal coagulation based on solubility diagrams for al3 metal salts presented in duan and gregory 2003 as previously undertaken in gonzalez torres et al 2014 separation cell separation was estimated following equation 1 1 s e p a r a t i o n c i c f c i 100 where separation is the cell removal in percentage ci is the initial cell concentration cells ml 1 before the jar test and cf is the final cell concentration after the jar test cells ml 1 2 4 floc property analysis floc properties were determined for the four coagulation scenarios low and high coagulant doses at ph 6 and 7 in order to promote conditions dominated by either charge neutralisation or sweep flocculation coagulation mechanisms respectively following gonzalez torres et al 2014 for uniform flocs the initial steady state floc size before breakage d 1 the steady state floc size after breakage d 2 and the steady state floc size after re growth d 3 were estimated as described by gonzalez torres et al 2014 strength factor was thus determined following equation 2 where the higher the strength factor the stronger the flocs 2 strength factor d 2 d 1 100 a recovery number rn was also determined using d 1 and d 3 as shown in equation 3 the rn indicates the extent to which the flocs differed from the initial size after the recovery stage an rn higher than 1 indicates that flocs grew to a larger size than the initial steady size after the breakage period an rn of approximately 1 indicates that the floc size did not vary significantly from the initial size to re growth while an rn less than 1 indicates the flocs did not recover to the initial steady size 3 rn d 3 d 1 2 4 1 physical floc properties for approximately spherical flocs approximately spherical flocs were produced by c vulgaris and m aeruginosa cs 555 these flocs were therefore analysed using an experimental set up similar to that described in jarvis et al 2005 and applied in gonzalez torres et al 2014 briefly the velp scientifica jar tester was connected via a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0 9 l h 1 to laser diffraction sizing instruments the mastersizer 2000 and 3000 malvern australia were used during the course of the study to examine dynamic floc size floc property experiments were carried out using the conditions discussed in 2 3 however after the slow stirring phase rather than applying a period of sedimentation the impact of high shear on floc size was studied by varying the speed of the jar test paddles to 200 rpm 167 s 1 for 15 min after which the paddle speed was subsequently controlled to 30 rpm for a further 20 min to examine the potential for floc regeneration overall an experiment for one shear value took 62 min and all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 2 physical floc properties for non spherical flocs non spherical flocs were produced by filamentous species c raciborskii and d circinali and by spherical m aeruginosa cs 564 cells the floc growth profile for these non spherical flocs was therefore determined using floccam instrument durasens usa the camera monitors floc particle formation during the jar test providing real time measurements and a time exposure of 1 1000 s was applied the floccam was mounted to a modified 2l standard jar test vessel wagner 2 l square hach fig 1 and connected to a velp scientifica jar tester and a computer to graphically display real time floc character floccam jar tests were conducted using the same conditions as described by gonzalez torres et al 2014 however the speed was only varied to 200 rpm g 167 s 1 estimated using g 0 0538 rpm1 5174 according to the manufacturer during the breakage phase floccam software ver 1 45 durasens usa was used for data analysis floc size was estimated using lengthv equivalent to the commonly used particle sizing parameter the volume or mass moment mean also called the de brouckere mean diameter and denoted d 4 3 in which each floc size was associated with floc length and volume using equation 4 4 l e n g t h v i 1 n v i l i i 1 n v i where v i is the volume of floc i and l i is the length of the floc lengthv was used to generate floc growth profiles from the floc growth profiles it was possible to evaluate the initial steady state size size after exposure to increased shear and regrowth potential specifically steady state floc size was calculated by taking the average of all floc sizes after steady state was achieved but before the breakage period d 1 10 27 min the floc size after breakage was calculated as the average of the floc size reached after the flocs were exposed to an increase of shear d 2 43 min the floc size on regrowth was obtained by calculating the average of the d 50 values during the re growth phase of the flocs d 3 50 60 min a comparison of c vulgaris floc sizes measured using both the floccam and mastersizer 3000 was conducted to validate the method section s1 in supplementary data sd the average floc size obtained for both methods were not statistically different p 0 05 2 5 assessing algal organic matter composition pre and post flocculation aom composition was determined using size exclusion liquid chromatography with organic carbon uv254 and organic nitrogen detection lc ocd doc labor germany huber et al 2011 the lc ocd instrument was used to fractionate the organic compounds according to their approximate molecular weight a retention time of approximately 35 min indicated the presence of high molecular weight biopolymers with those at progressively longer retention times designated humic substances building blocks and finally low molecular weight lmw acids and then neutrals as operationally defined huber et al 2011 chekli et al 2017 huber et al 2011 demonstrated that the combination of the three detectors enables the determination of the chemical characteristics of various size fractions including the approximate proportions of carbohydrates and proteins in the biopolymer fraction the proportion of each organic compound was calculated using chromcalc doc labor software chromcalc doc labor 2013 software doc labor germany the removal of the various size fractions from the bulk suspension during coagulation and by inference their incorporation into the floc samples was evaluated by analysing the lc ocd chromatograms obtained before and after coagulation and flocculation see figures s2 1 3 sd for samples obtained after flocculation a dilute dissolved alum sample was analysed to account for any trace organic impurities that may have been introduced by the coagulant the resultant proportion of the aom incorporated into the floc was thus calculated using equation 5 slavik et al 2012 5 x x start x end x coagulant x start 100 where x represents the percentage of the particular doc fraction removed during coagulation e g biopolymers building blocks etc xstart denotes the fraction of x before the coagulation and xend denotes the x fraction after coagulation and xcoagulant represents the x fraction contributed by the coagulant it is of note that this therefore also enables identification of the release of aom during coagulation which may occur as a result of chemical or shear stress and would be apparent from a negative value 2 6 statistical analysis all sample analysis was carried out in measurement triplicates all jar tests for floc property analysis were taken in biological triplicates i e three jar tests each using a different algal or cyanobacterial culture the results of these are expressed as the mean of three independent replicates with error indicating one standard deviation for each set of conditions the error bars in figs 2 4 and 6 therefore represent the standard deviation of the zeta potential and cell removal initial steady floc size and recovery number for different species and conditions studied respectively floc properties obtained for the different coagulation conditions were statistically compared using a one way analysis of variance anova with a level of significance set at 0 05 using graphpad prism version 7 02 for window graphpad software the normality of the data was determined with the shapiro wilk normality test graphpad prism 7 02 graphpad software correlations between floc size strength factor recovery number and aom compounds were identified by means of univariate linear correlation regression analysis was performed to assess the statistical significance or different relationships between these parameters and was considered statistically significant with a 95 confidence interval when a linear correlation was observed r2 0 8 and p 0 05 the slope of the equation was analysed to determine if the correlation was positive or negative 3 results and discussion 3 1 cell and aom characterisation the aom concentration determined for the five species in this study was in the range 2 9 13 7 10 10 mg as c cell 1 table 1 the aom extracted from c raciborskii had the lowest doc concentration 2 9 3 8 10 10 mg as c cell 1 while d circinale aom had the highest values 10 6 13 7 10 10 mg as c cell 1 the aom of m aeruginosa cs 564 had approximately 1 8 times the doc concentration than m aeruginosa cs 555 despite being the same species 8 5 9 1 and 3 9 5 7 10 10 mg as c cell 1 respectively the aom analysis using lc ocd showed that similar organic fractions were present in all species although the concentration varied table 1 aom from m aeruginosa cs 564 and c raciborskii had the lowest biopolymer contents 5 10 and 2 17 respectively while c vulgaris aom had the highest 7 5 61 3 c vulgaris also had the highest concentration of carbohydrates at 0 08 0 6 mg of carbohydrate as doc per mg of aom as doc aom extracted from m aeruginosa cs 555 had the highest protein aom ratio but the lowest carbohydrate aom ratio some molecules present in m aeruginosa cs 564 aom eluted from the size exclusion sec column at the same time as the peak conventionally described as humic substances huber et al 2011 however the associated uv254 signal was very low indicating the presence of aliphatic rather than aromatic components in this fraction this fraction therefore more likely comprised aliphatic building blocks of biopolymers that are in the same size range as the humic substances identified by huber et al 2011 however for ease of reference these will continue to be referred to as humic like substances in this study as has previously been done in other studies e g villacorte et al 2015 the charge of algae and cyanobacteria in both the cell system cells and associated aom and aom alone was evaluated through the measurement of zp and charge density the zp values for the cell system ranged from 8 2 to 27 mv depending on the species where c vulgaris had the most negative values and c raciborskii the least negative table 1 the zp values for aom samples ranged from 6 4 to 28 3 mv where m aeruginosa cs 564 had the most negative value and again c raciborskii had the least negative value table 1 all zp values were comparable with those previously determined for cyanobacterial and algal species henderson et al 2008 2010 charge equivalents normalised to cell number were in the range 0 6 to 2 5 10 7 meq cell 1 where c raciborskii had the least negative charge density and c vulgaris the most negative the charge density values were approximately 10 times less than values previously reported rao et al 2018 the discrepancy in the results is attributed to the variance in culture replicates the charge density contributed by aom was estimated by comparing the charge density of the whole cell system to aom only samples it was determined that aom contributed between 67 and 100 of the total charge density depending on the species where c raciborskii and d circinale aom gave the lowest and highest proportions respectively the majority of negative charge in cells and aom was likely contributed by acidic polysaccharides for example uronic acids present at the cell wall and in the dissolved aom coimbra et al 1998 pivokonsky et al 2016 overall the lc ocd and charge analysis suggested that the major differences in aom between species can be attributed to biopolymer composition and charge density likely the concentration of charged polysaccharides which are hypothesised to contribute to unique coagulation behaviour and floc properties 3 2 analysis of the effectiveness of the cell separation the optimal doses for effective separation are presented in table 2 a low coagulant dose corresponded with a zp value that was close to neutral for c vulgaris c raciborskii and m aeruginosa cs 564 and achieved at least 85 cell removal under these conditions charge neutralisation coagulation mechanisms were expected to dominate gonzalez torres et al 2014 the high doses were selected based firstly on the literature where it has been shown that for values greater than 30 mg l 1 as al2so4 sweep flocculation dominates duan and gregory 2003 and secondly based on that required to achieve maximum cell removal c f using alum was successful for all the species with cell separation ranging from 85 to 98 1 at low and high coagulant alum doses for ph 6 and 7 fig 2 a region of instability was observed for m aeruginosa cs 555 when coagulating at ph 6 for doses between 32 47 10 10 mg al cell 1 fig 2e which was attributed to slight restabilisation and aom coagulant complexation peptides and proteins al as previously determined by henderson et al 2010 and pivokonsky et al 2012 no other conditions examined dose ph or species strains exhibited a restabilisation zone attributed to the content and the composition of aom biopolymers are hypothesised to act as a flocculant aid overcoming the electrostatic repulsion as previously determined by henderson et al 2010 3 3 examination of the net change in dissolved organic carbon fractions on coagulation flocculation the detailed composition of the organic compounds before and after flocculation was analysed using lc ocd with the objective of evaluating the incorporation of organic compounds into the flocs figures s2 1 5 in sd it was observed that more than 80 of the initial biopolymers were incorporated into the flocs for most coagulation conditions fig 3a the exceptions were m aeruginosa cs 564 samples coagulated under low coagulant doses and d circinale samples for all coagulation conditions fig 3a where an overall increase in biopolymer concentration was observed after coagulation this may have been caused by additional aom release as a result of cell stress a consequence of chemical interactions with the coagulant the high proportion of biopolymer incorporated into the flocs was attributed to interactions between biopolymers and coagulants high biopolymer removal during coagulation of cyanobacteria has been previously reported by pivokonsky et al 2012 and safarikova et al 2013 due to these interactions building blocks were not incorporated into the flocs as indicated by no net change in content in the solution after coagulation fig 3b a minor increase in building blocks after coagulation was observed for some species again attributed to aom release due to cell stress it had been previously reported that building blocks with low specific uv absorbance suva and low aromaticity are poorly removed by c f huber et al 2011 similarly negligible incorporation of low mw acids or neutrals into the flocs was observed fig 3c and d for the filamentous species c raciborskii and d circinale this could have been masked by the significant increase in lmw neutral molecules that was observed post coagulation for the filamentous species again attributed to cell stress fig 3d previous research suggests that removal of these molecules during coagulation is not likely pivokonsky et al 2014 note that the removal of humic like substances was not analysed as these compounds were only observed in one species overall biopolymers were typically observed to be well incorporated into the flocs while building blocks and lmw compounds were not however the use of this technique for examining biomolecular composition of the flocs was hindered by net increases in some fractions under certain conditions overall the presence of biopolymers in the flocs even at low concentration can enhance the coagulation process by acting as polymer aids forming larger flocs chekli et al 2017 this is analysed in more detail by examining the floc properties 3 4 comparison of the impact of cell morphology and aom composition on physical floc properties 3 4 1 impact on floc size the median average equivalent diameter floc size d 1 was determined for the various coagulation scenarios for each of the five species studied fig s3 and fig 4 m aeruginosa cs 564 produced the largest flocs ranging from 7000 μm to 12000 μm while m aeruginosa cs 555 produced the smallest flocs ranging from 500 to 650 μm fig 4 it is important to note that these disparities were observed despite the fact that these were both m aeruginosa species that were visually similar being unicellular and of spherical cell shape d circinale and c raciborskii which are filamentous species with filaments reaching up to 1 mm long formed larger flocs than the smaller spherical species except for m aeruginosa cs 564 each of these species also produced flocs that significantly deviated from a spherical floc structure fig 5 previously a linear relationship between cell size and floc size was reported by lama et al 2016 who examined a variety of species and the fact that this linearity was not observed in the current study is attributed to the widely variable aom the difference in floc size between the unicellular spherical microalgae and cyanobacteria strains was examined in relation to the aom composition in particular the biopolymers which were demonstrated to be well incorporated into the flocs fig 3a m aeruginosa cs 564 aom had a lower biopolymer concentration overall with a similar and lower carbohydrate concentration when compared to m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris respectively m aeruginosa cs 564 aom also had a lower protein concentration than both of the other two spherical species m aeruginosa cs 564 and c vulgaris aom had a similar zp and had higher zp and charge density than m aeruginosa cs 555 aom c vulgaris aom had the highest charge density overall the charge is relevant as negatively charged biopolymers have been reported to have behaviour similar to that of anionic flocculants which can increase floc size this was previously reported for a ph of 6 8 due to a dissociation constant of carboxyl coo groups pivokonsky et al 2006 henderson et al 2008 gonzalez torres et al 2017 and it was previously reported in the literature that certain species of green algae and diatoms contain biopolymers that enable large aggregate formation bernhardt et al 1986 1989 chekli et al 2017 however in the current study it was interesting that while both m aeruginosa cs 564 and c vulgaris flocs were increased in size relative to those of m aeruginosa cs 555 m aeruginosa cs 564 flocs were far greater in size than those of c vulgaris m aeruginosa aom was present at increased concentrations relative to the other species which may also be important clearly the relationship between biopolymer concentration and character and floc formation is highly complex and assessing only total concentrations of biopolymers proteins and carbohydrates gives insufficient information to explain the exact mechanism that drives the floc size it is proposed that future work should investigate the specific protein and carbohydrate composition a key observation in this study was that the floc size differences between different coagulation conditions were relatively small in comparison with changes in respect to morphology and species fig 4 see table s4 this strongly suggests that the algal species will drive the prevailing floc characteristics irrespective of the coagulation conditions applied for a particular coagulant when using standard optimised metal salt coagulation the impact of changing coagulant type remains a knowledge gap 3 4 2 impact of aom composition and morphology on floc strength the capacity of flocs to resist breakage under high shear force was assessed using the strength factor which varied between 11 and 100 depending on the species fig 4 the floc strength factors were higher for filaments 79 100 than spherical cells 11 38 indicating that flocs formed from filamentous cells were more resistant to breakage as the flocs did not change significantly in size after exposure to high shear an exception was that of m aeruginosa cs 564 flocs which had strength values of 51 98 indicating that aom composition within the floc was also an important factor cell morphology aom composition and coagulation conditions were all observed to influence the strength factor examination of the flocs formed by filamentous species using a light microscope fig 5 showed that the filaments formed by the cells provided a backbone structure that improved the floc integrity as observed by burger et al 2017 for filamentous bacteria in extracellular polymeric substance eps flocs the filamentous backbone provides tensile strength within the floc and therefore an improvement in floc strength termed the filamentous backbone theory lau et al 1984 the backbone theory can therefore explain the high strength factor observed for filamentous bacteria and cyanobacteria flocs obtained in burger et al 2017 and this current study coagulation conditions did not significantly impact the strength of flocs produced by c raciborskii d circinale and m aeruginosa cs 564 p 0 05 table s4 but did have an impact on m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris flocs p 0 05 table s4 the strength factors obtained for flocs produced using a high dose of alum were statistically different than the values of low doses for m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris flocs p 0 05 table s4 previous studies determined that sf high coagulant dose produced stronger flocs than cn low coagulant dose and this may be attributed to an increase in strength gained through the chemical bonding within the cells and the aluminium hydroxides determined by gregory and duan 2001 and yukselen and gregory 2004 note that d circinale did not reach a neutral zeta potential at low dose therefore the doses used for d circinale were selected as the minimum coagulant dose required to achieve more than 85 of cell removal this demonstrates that complete charge neutralisation may not be required for successful coagulation if there are sufficient regions of neutralised or positively charged cells within the filamentous d circinale floc matrix 3 4 3 impact of aom composition and morphology on floc recovery floc regrowth capacity after breakage was examined using the rn fig 6 which indicates whether flocs are able to recover or maintain their size after being exposed to a period of increased shear eq 3 the flocs formed using the five species had rn values ranging from 0 22 to 1 14 the low rn values that were observed for c vulgaris flocs indicate that these flocs were not able to regrow to their original size under any coagulation conditions the rn for the remaining species were similar with average rn of 0 93 for the filamentous species c raciborskii and d circinale and 0 8 and 0 90 on average for m aeruginosa cs 555 and m aeruginosa cs 564 respectively these rn results were dependent to an extent on the cell morphology and coagulation conditions from which the flocs were formed fig 6 filamentous species have previously been observed to have little change in floc size under increased shear rates previously attributed to the fact that protruding filaments can reduce floc erosion as they dissipate some of the eddy forces interacting with the floc surface and increase floc resistance to shear burger et al 2017 the low rn values obtained for c vulgaris flocs wer attributed to large scale fragmentation being the main breakage mechanism as determined by gonzalez torres et al 2017 it is suggested that fragmentation might occur due to reduced binding between protein and coagulant gonzalez torres et al 2017 coagulation conditions had a significant impact on floc recovery with the exception of d circinale which had quite stable rn values the flocs produced at ph 6 tended to have better recovery than ph 7 particularly under low dose and therefore charge neutralisation conditions charge neutralisation conditions have previously been shown to favour higher rn values due to electrostatic interactions being able to be restored after breakage gonzalez torres et al 2014 3 5 statistical analysis of the impact of aom on physical floc properties the correlation between biopolymer content biopolymers aom protein protein aom carbohydrates carbohydrates aom and the protein to carbohydrates ratio in aom and floc size strength factor and recovery number was assessed for each coagulation scenario table 3 these parameters were selected as they were previously shown to play an important role in floc stability for algal and eps flocs bernhardt and clasen 1991 henderson et al 2010 cheng et al 2011 vandamme et al 2012 burger et al 2017 and moreover have been implicated in this research as important parameters figs 4 and 5 for all coagulation scenarios a statistically significant positive correlation between increased protein content protein aom and decreased floc size was observed table 3 this was also observed for strength and recovery number under certain coagulation conditions it is proposed that the high protein content may lead to greater interaction with coagulant thus decreasing the coagulant availability this is supported by data presented in fig 2 which showed that m aeruginosa cs 564 had a much higher coagulant demand than the other m aeruginosa strain examined previously it was determined that the presence of proteins in aom can negatively impact the net flocculation efficiency gregor et al 1996 pivokonsky et al 2012 safarikova et al 2013 for example pivokonsky et al 2012 reported that m aeruginosa aom proteins inhibited ferric sulphate coagulation due to the formation of fe protein surface complexes these complexes attached to the surface of metal coagulant hydroxide particles resulting in negatively charged areas on the surface of ferric coagulant colloidal particles leading to particle aggregation under low alum dose at ph 7 a positive statistically significant correlation between aom charge density and recovery number was observed while this was the only correlation that was statically significant for some other coagulation conditions the correlation coefficients were much higher and p values were only marginally outside the significant range p values of 0 07 and 0 08 suggesting that this could be examined in further detail with higher sample numbers this relationship suggests that the presence of negatively charged aom compounds can have a positive effect on the capacity of flocs to regrow after breakage this scenario is similar to that described in gonzalez torres et al 2014 whereby flocs formed under charge neutralisation low coagulant dose were able to reform due to the electrostatic interactions being restored after breakage no significant statistical difference between floc size and carbohydrates were observed in this study it could be attributed to the small sample set used or insignificant difference between carbohydrate aom ratio among species p 0 10 previously it has been reported that there was a relationship between floc strength and protein and carbohydrate ratio for activated sludge flocs sheng et al 2008 this correlation was not observed to be important for floc properties for the algal species samples considered in this study by statistical analysis table 3 the discrepancy between studies can be associated with the difference in the nature of the samples charge properties of algal cell surfaces and their biochemical compositions that may vary between different species and strains as observed by vandamme et al 2013 4 conclusions the impact of cell morphology and aom composition on physical floc properties was investigated the key findings are as follows image analysis using the floccam device was an effective technique to measure non spherical floc sizes without the need for floc extraction this method in addition to laser diffraction enabled determination of the physical floc properties obtained for a range of algal and cyanobacterial species under different coagulation conditions the physical floc properties were driven by cell morphology and aom characteristics two strains m aeruginosa cs 555 and m aeruginosa cs 564 exhibited completely different floc properties despite being the same species with similar morphology attributed to the different aom characteristics biopolymers were effectively removed during coagulation for c raciborskii m aeruginosa cs 555 and c vulgaris indicating that these were the dominant aom fraction within the flocs filamentous species produced flocs that were less affected by increasing shear with very high floc strength factor values attributed to filamentous backbone theory protein content was negatively correlated with floc size larger flocs were observed when there was a lower protein aom ratio negatively charged aom carbohydrates potentially behave as an anionic flocculant enhancing the formation of large flocs as observed for m aeruginosa cs 564 however there was no statistically significant relationship in this study between floc properties and carbohydrate content this might be a consequence of either the small sample set used or insignificant variation of carbohydrate concentration between samples further work is required in this area declaration of competing

18622,chrome mist suppressants are key chemicals used in the chrome plating industry to reduce exposure of workers by inhalation to airborne chromic acid pollution perfluoroalkyl sulfonated compounds are excellent mist suppressants thanks to their chemical stability and surface activity therefore despite mounting evidence for their persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity it is likely that such chemicals will continue to be used for the foreseeable future because of their importance and lack of alternatives the present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of advanced reduction as an effective technology to treat chrome plating industry wastewater in particular wastewater containing a chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate i e f 53b an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos used to prepare chrome mist suppressant in china was treated by uv activated sulfite results demonstrates that in ultrapure water f 53b can be easily degraded within 1 min much faster than pfos stoichiometric fluoride recovery was also achieved confirming significant defluorination of the pollutant such superior reducibility was due to the presence of chlorine atoms as corroborated by quantum chemical calculations f 53b degradation was also achieved in chrome plating industrial wastewater which yielded results were slower than those achieved in the laboratory nonetheless obtained complete abatement within 60 min these results suggest that the proposed advanced reduction process is one of the safest options to control pfas discharge in the environment and reduce the related risks to ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv sulfite chrome mist suppressant f 53b pfass wastewater treatment 1 introduction chrome plating is an electroplating technique that is utilized to create a thin layer of chromium onto a metal object it is used for decoration augment surface hardness endow corrosion resistance and other applications the process is based on hexavalent or trivalent chromium reduction to metallic form by cathode reduction due to low cathode efficiency and high solution viscosity oxygen and hydrogen bubbles are generated during the plating process thus producing a mist of chromium containing solution given the well known carcinogenicity of hexavalent chromium shahid et al 2017 it is fundamental for worker safety to prevent formation of mist chrome mist suppressants cms are used to this aim they are chemically stable surfactants that reduce surface tension of chrome bath solution in this way gas bubble size decreases thus reducing the buoyancy force and consequently the energy which resulting droplets are ejected into the air the most effective chemicals that are currently used in chrome plating industry are perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in particular perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos has long been the most utilized as cms key component owing to its excellent capability of lower water surface tension and chemical stability necessary because of the aggressive chemical and electrochemical environment however this compound and its salts have been found to be persistent bioaccumulative and biomagnifying houde et al 2006 olsen et al 2007 vethaak 2008 wen et al 2016 and capable of causing many toxic effects e g developmental and reproductive toxicity as well as endocrine disruption apelberg et al 2007 di nisio et al 2018 okada et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 for these reasons pfos was listed as a persistent organic pollutant by the stockholm convention in 2009 consequently its employment should be ceased in all countries that have ratified the convention including china nonetheless among its applications the convention recognizes a special exemption for the preparation of cms yet this exemption will expire in 2019 laurent 2018 in china the majority of pfos is employed in the preparation of cms where it supplies more than 6000 chrome plating plants currently in operation throughout the country in 2008 the annual consumption of pfos as cms was estimated to be 30 40 t yr lin and li 2008 and this high level of demand has led to the development of alternative chemicals among them perfluorinated ether potassium sulfonate f 53 c8f17o4s k first synthesized in 1975 by the shanghai institute of organic chemistry chinese academy of sciences performs excellently as cms but is costly to synthesize and impractical for industrial application subsequently a second generation was created by substituting one fluorine at the chain end with a chlorine atom the manufacturing process of this monochlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate named f 53b clc8f16o4s k is much simpler and thus its synthesis is cheaper than that of f 53 group of perfluoro sulfonic acids 1979 wang et al 2013 accordingly f 53b has been used for almost 40 years in cms formulations and it was estimated that 10 14 t yr might have been emitted into the environment during 2006 2015 ti et al 2018 indeed in recent years an increased concentration of f 53b has been detected in atmospheric particles wei et al 2017 arctic wildlife gebbink et al 2016 marine organisms liu et al 2017 municipal sewage sludge ruan et al 2015 and maternal cord and placenta chen et al 2017 as well as in the surface waters of many countries at levels of ng l pan et al 2018 these facts alongside mounting evidence for its adverse effects highlight the existence of a serious risk to human health and the environment posed by f 53b in terms of the risks embryo toxicity shi et al 2017 developmental neural toxicity yin et al 2018 thyroid hormone disruption deng et al 2018 and subchronic reproductive effects to adult male mice zhou et al 2018 have been correlated to f 53b exposure besides evidence of its bioaccumulation in living beings cui et al 2018 including humans f 53b could account for a substantial fraction of previously unidentified organic fluorine in the chinese population as well as its biopersistence shi et al 2016 has been found additionally all pfass including f 53b might inhibit the enzyme activity of microflora in soil as well as destroy the cellular structure and gene expression of bacteria qiao et al 2018 therefore although soil is not the ultimate sink for f 53b its temporary contamination through leaching from improper solid waste disposal or stockpiling might threaten soil ecosystem despite the above mentioned negative effects considering the importance of the need for an effective cms in the plating industry and pending the development of non fluorinated cms it is likely that the production of f 53b will continue to increase after the phasing out of pfos in china zhang et al 2015 in this context the adoption of effective wastewater treatment technologies to clean industrial effluents is probably the most feasible way to maintain use of a fluorine based cms whilst at the same time preventing further releases of f 53b or any other fluorinated alternative into the environment to date only adsorption technology has been reported as a feasible approach to the removal of f 53b from water gao et al 2016 however the spent adsorbent needs to be disposed appropriately to prevent secondary contamination among the options for disposal landfilling should be avoided as pfass have been found in the leachate of several landfill sites gellrich and knepper 2012 huset et al 2011 incineration of spent adsorbent remains the sole viable option but it needs to be conducted at very high temperatures 1000 c watanabe et al 2016 to ensure the complete destruction of pfas and avert unintentional dioxin generation advanced oxidation processes aops have been found to be effective with respect to several pfass dombrowski et al 2018 and yet f 53b is not oxidizable by heat activated persulfate chen et al 2018 which is summarized as the best oxidation method for pfass degradation such remarkable resistance to oxidation poses a great challenge for pfas remediation suggesting the need for different approaches to be investigated in recent years the reductive approach has been found to be an effective alternative to oxidation hydrated electron is a potent reducing species that can be easily generated in water by uv activated sulfite such methodology was proved to being capable to entirely remove pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid in water more importantly significant generation of fluorides was verified thus proving the efficacious defluorination of the target pollutant gu et al 2016 2017a 2017b song et al 2013 in particular in our previous study we ascertained that pfas that are resistant to aops can be straightforwardly degraded by advanced reduction with hydrated electrons bao et al 2018 uv sulfite system is ideal for treating chrome plating wastewater in fact sulfite is already utilized in many plants to reduce hexavalent chromium to cr iii the employment of a uv irradiating reactor to the sulfite addition section would be the most practicable and economic method to remove also cms however the feasibility of such treatment was never assessed the objective of the present paper is investigating the effectiveness of the uv sulfite system to treat a real effluent containing f 53b from a chrome plating facility kinetic study treatment parameter optimization and considerations on pfas chemical structure by quantum chemical calculations are also done to corroborate the feasibility of the proposed treatment as viable method to remove cms from chrome plating wastewater in particular the study is focused on f 53b the use of which is expected to increase in china in the coming years 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the electroplating wastewater containing f 53b was taken from the effluent collection tank of a chrome plating facility in jiangsu province china the sampling position is shown in fig s1 f 53b clc6f12ocf2cf2so3k cas no 73606 19 6 96 and f 53 c6f13ocf2cf2so3k cas no 68136 88 9 96 were provided by the shanghai institute of

standards 1000 ppm in h2o were bought from the national nonferrous metal and electronic materials analysis and testing center and used to quantify the ions produced during the degradation process sodium sulfite na2so3 97 and potassium persulfate k2s2o8 99 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 2 2 experimental methods the experimental devices used in this study have been reported in detail previously bao et al 2018 however briefly photochemical reactions were conducted by placing quartz tubes 45 ml solution on a turnplate with 10 rpm rotation speed in the center of the reactor surrounded by 16 lamps with wavelength of 253 7 nm fig s2 each lamp had an emission intensity of 8 0 mw cm2 thus ensuring a photon intensity of 3 8 μe l s in the reactor all the tubes were capped except during sampling the photochemical reactor was operated 5 min in advance of placing the quartz tubes the initial ph values of the solutions used in the uv sulfite system na2so3 1 2 3 and 20 mm were adjusted to 10 by using 0 25 m naoh or 0 1 m h2so4 solution while that of the uv persulfate system k2s2o8 20 mm was modified to 6 pfos f 53 and f 53b were dissolved in ultrapure water to an initial concentration of 0 16 mm all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 3 analysis methods pfos f 53 and f 53b were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20at shimadzu

solving differential equation systems using the software mathematica 8 0 wolfram research uk density functional theory calculations on pfos f 53 f 53b as well as other hypothetical molecules i e molecular fragments were conducted using the software gaussian 09 revision b 01 2010 conformation optimization and frequency calculations were performed using the b3lyp hybrid functional with the 6 311 g d p basis set torres et al 2009 to understand the reaction initiation for pfos f 53 and f 53b via eaq attack the contour surfaces of molecules were visualized using gaussview and molecular orbital composition analysis was accomplished using multiwfn lu and chen 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation feasibility of f 53b f 53 and pfos by uv sulfite system preliminary experiments to ascertain the viability of cms removal by uv sulfite system were carried out in ultrapure water f 53b and pfos were tested as most used cms component in china f 53 was also subjected to treatment to obtain useful information on f 53b degradability by hydrated electrons fig 1 a b and c results demonstrate f 53b was easily decomposed with the assistance of eaq 99 was decomposed in 1 min and more than 99 of cl was recovered once f 53b was undetectable pfos disappeared in 2 h while 10 of residual f 53 was still detected at the same time requiring one further hour for its complete degradation hence the observed order of degradation rate by uv activated sulfite was f 53b pfos f 53 this suggests that the presence of o atoms in the perfluoroalkyl chain decreases the interaction of f 53 with hydrated electrons thus slowing down molecular decomposition on the contrary the fast degradation kinetics of f 53b indicates that the cl atom accelerates the dismantling of the molecule in terms of defluorination 90 of fluorine was recovered in mineral form i e fluorides for all investigated compounds but this required 8 h of reaction notably pfos defluorination reached 85 when it was undetectable 2 h while less fluorine 70 was recovered for f 53b and f 53 at the same reaction time this could be attributed to the ether group in both molecules which markedly changed their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo table s3 as elucidated later finally it is essential to remark the substantial refractoriness of the investigated compounds to advanced oxidation it was confirmed by experiments with uv activated persulfate fig s3 where no degradation of each chemical was obtained over 300 min treatment such result evidently proves that the oxidation approach is impracticable for wastewater treatment while reduction is a realistic way 3 2 f 53b degradation by uv sulfite in real chrome plating wastewater chrome electroplating wastewater effluent in a conditioning tank fig s1 with 65 7 μg l 0 115 μμ f 53b was employed in a bench scale experiment fig 1d more than 90 of f 53b was removed from the water after 30 min and it was undetectable instrumental detection limit was 0 2 μg l table s2 in 60 min unfortunately because of low initial concentration of f 53b in the wastewater fluoride and chloride concentration was much lower than instrument detection limit so f and cl could not be quantified in reliable manner but the f and cl concentration was extrapolated according to the experimental data fig 1d comparing this result with f 53b degradation in ultrapure water fig 1a a dramatic decrease in reaction rate was evident this was conceivably caused by the presence of other components in the wastewater which scavenged or interfered with the hydrated electron attack despite these limited kinetics since sulfite is one of the most common reagents used to reduce cr vi to cr iii in electroplating wastewater xie et al 2008 the uv sulfite method is still the most viable technology for removing f 53b from such effluent both from the technical and economical points of view specifically it is feasible to integrate uv sulfite technology into current wastewater treatment processes simply by adjusting the sulfite dosage without addition of any other chemicals or plant apparatus 3 3 reaction mechanism the first step of the reaction is the activation of sulfite to generate hydrated electrons li et al 2014 song et al 2013 there is large literature on this step so in the present study it is not further investigated hydrated electrons then reacts with pfas molecules in water resulting in their degradation intermediates were identified and quantified to ascertain the reaction pathway of the investigated chemicals in the uv sulfite system with regard to f 53 and pfos useful to provide information on f 53b degradation mechanism by comparison pfpra pfba and pfpea were detected as main quantifiable intermediates for the degradation of f 53 pfpra pfba pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa for pfos in the uv sulfite system all these compounds reached their maximum concentration in 30 min figs s4 and s5 which then declined to zero notably pfhxa was not identified during the degradation of f 53 possibly because c5 c6 bond see atom label in fig 3 c next to ether bond is preferable for rupture for pfos intermediates indicated that eaq attack can occur at all carbon atoms simultaneously through comparison of the f 53 and f 53b degradation kinetics it could at first sight be inferred that the presence of cl just boosted the reaction rate and had no relevant influence on defluorination concerning f 53b several intermediates were identified in a set of experiments with reduced na2so3 concentration in order to reduce reaction kinetics and facilitate intermediate identification fig s6 dechlorination occurred simultaneously with disappearance of f 53b at varied na2so3 dosage again verified that this is the dominant process to initiate the degradation a chromatogram peak was attributed to a hydrogen substituted f 53b hc6f12oc2f4so3 m z 496 9 its peak area was sensibly large with a magnitude similar to that of f 53b m z 530 9 fig s7 therefore dechlorination was confirmed as one of the foremost reactions leading to f 53b decomposition as corroborated by the existence of the hydrogenated intermediate other intermediates were identified as chloro fluoro carboxyl acids i e c6o2f10clˉ m z 328 9 and hydro fluoro ones i e c6ho2f10ˉ m z 294 9 c5ho2f8ˉ m z 244 9 another intermediate with m z 328 9 was actually ascribable to clc5f10cooˉ if correct the presence of this chlorinated intermediate suggests that f 53b was also split at the ether bond thus promoting the destruction of the molecular backbone on the basis of the experimental evidence we propose a possible pathway for f 53b degradation fig 2 the pathway certainly starts with the attack of a hydrated electron on the f 53b molecule the identified intermediates which can be divided into chloro fluoro compounds and hydro fluoro ones suggest the existence of two possible reaction pathways that may occur during the electron attack hydrogenation i e substitution of cl with h named route i in fig 2 and molecular cleavage called route ii for the initiation reaction of route i cl is replaced by h thus resulting in generation of hc6f12oc2f4so3 it is proposed that protons can be reduced to hydrogen radical e 2 3 v by direct reaction h eaq h buxton et al 1988 h has a relatively low reduction potential compared with eaq e 2 9 v but it may also be able to reduce f 53b to hc6f12oc2f4so3 obviously h would be the dominant reductant only with acidic ph which is not the case initial ph was set to be 10 so eaq likely the most abundant species xiao et al 2017 conceivably hc6f12oc2f4so3 is then cleaved at the oxygen bridge forming oc2f4so3 and hc6f12 alternatively route ii f 53b is directly split at the ether bond by eaq attack to produce products similar to those of route i apart from the presence of cl instead of h from there on the two pathways of the perfluorinated fragment substituted with cl or h are similar a continuous defluorination of the terminal carbon atom with unpaired electrons by f flake off to generate the corresponding carboxyl acid lee et al 2009 yang et al 2015 the coo group then detaches from the molecular fragment and coo is likely transformed into co2 bentel et al 2019 albeit it may also encounter other radicals e g h derived by h eaq h buxton et al 1988 to produce formic acid qu et al 2010 indeed no formic acid was detected in our system perhaps because of its low concentration it should be noted that the chloro polyfluoro acid could undergo cl substitution to generate the corresponding hydrogenated intermediate yet the rapid buildup of cl in solution fig 1a implies that route ii is marginal and or such latter reaction likely occurs soon i e when the chain length of the perfluorinated moiety is still long that is n 6 the oc2f4so3 fragment generated through both routes routes i and route ii fig 2 very likely follows a fluorine flake off process to its final defluorination namely h f exchange which results in stepwise defluorination bentel et al 2019 the described defluorination process is assumed to repeat itself until finally complete dehalogenation of the f 53b molecule is attained 3 4 kinetic study on the basis of the above mentioned reaction mechanism a kinetic model was developed to extrapolate experimental data the model for f 53b degradation is a simplified version of the route i fig 2 this is hypothesized to be the main degradation pathway the model consists of the following reactions 1 sulfite activation s o 3 2 k a e a q 2 dechlorination hydrogenation c l c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 e a q h k d h h c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 c l 3 cleavage h c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 e a q k c h c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 4 hc 6 f 12 defluorination h c n f 2 n 2 e a q k d a n h c n 1 f 2 n 1 2 f c n 6 1 5 o c 2 f 4 so 3 defluorination o c m f 2 m s o 3 2 e a q k d b m c m 1 f 2 m 1 s o 3 2 f c m 2 1 all the reactions are considered of the global second order first order respect to each reagent apart from sulfite activation which is taken of the first order the interpolation of experimental data is done with the three investigated pfas but using an appropriate reaction models specifically for f 53 dechlorination hydrogenation reaction is excluded and the molecule is directly cleaved according to reaction 3 to be then defluorinated in agreement with reactions 4 and 5 regarding pfos cleavage reaction splits the polar group i e so3 and the perfluorinated chain later the perfluorinated moiety is defluorinated stepwise following reactions 4 when executing the best fitting of the data kinetic constants values for the same reaction were kept the same when possible for example hydrated electron generation from sulfite was supposed to have the same value being the reaction conditions unchanged for all experiments molecular cleavage and defluorination kinetic constants were also maintained constant for f 53b and f 53 because of their evident molecular structure similarity despite such additional constraints experimental data were fitted by the model in satisfactory manner fig 1 with regard to f 53b kinetic constant values table 1 indicate a rapid production of hydrated electrons followed by an as fast dechlorination and hydrogenation of the compound this explains the rapid abatement of f 53b in solution molecular cleavage at the etheric bridge is the rate limiting step of decomposition once f 53b carbon backbone is split perfluorinated radical fragments are quickly degraded to fluoride and conceivably to co2 in truth mineralization rate of the sulfonated fragment is extremely slow such fact elucidates why 100 recovery of fluorides was not obtained in experiments two facts are notable firstly the same kinetic constant values can predict f 53 degradation rate excluded the cl substitution indeed f 53 slow degradation is due to the sluggish cleavage rate secondly the defluorination rate constants decrease along with carbon chain length of perfluorinated intermediates thus suggesting a diminution in reactivity during defluorination of such fragments an analogous trend is observed for pfos defluorination constants fig s8 but with different values in sum the kinetic study corroborates the strong dependence of pfas reactivity in uv sulfite system on their molecular structure bentel et al 2019 concerning the f 53b degradation in chrome plating wastewater the sole difference in the model outcome is related to the dechlorination hydrogenation rate constant which is roughly a one hundredth of that in ultrapure water this result is likely owed to presence of hydrated electron scavenger e g chromium ions organic matter etc specifically it is reasonable that hydrated electron production rate i e sulfite activation does not sensibly change in wastewater being irradiation conditions and the other reaction parameters kept constant but hydrated electrons are captured by scavengers so that their concentration in water is substantially reduced and resulting in an apparent diminution of dechlorination hydrogenation constant this fact must be taken in due account when implementing the technology at full scale 3 5 molecular structure influence on f 53b degradability kinetic modeling clearly demonstrates a relevant dependence of f 53b reducibility on its molecular structure firstly the presence of cl atom remarkably boosts its degradation rate respect to f 53 and pfos on contrary comparing f 53 and pfos degradation kinetics it seems that the etheric bridge provides augmented resistance toward reduction by hydrated electrons finally in agreement with recent findings bentel et al 2019 the defluorination rate is considerably determined by perfluorinated chain length therefore structural influence on molecular reactivity and consequently on dehalogenation kinetics deserves further deepening because this latter in turn affects many practical aspects of the technology e g energy consumption equipment dimension etc to this aim quantum chemical calculations were performed to ascertain the contribution of oxygen and chlorine to f 53b degradability the presence of cl and o atoms together radically changes composition of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo compared to that of pfos table s3 however they have different influences on the molecular reducibility in fact when one o atom was inserted into the perfluorinated chain i e in the pfos chain the compound i e f 53 was less prone to hydrated electron attack on the contrary when a cl atom was further introduced in the alkyl chain to replace an f atom on the terminal c i e labeled c 1 in fig 3 the reducibility of f 53b was significantly promoted notwithstanding the presence of o in the chain to better understand such a disparity of influence of both heteroatoms the vertical electron affinity vea defined as the difference between the total energies of a neutral molecular system and the anion in the same equilibrium geometry of the neutral system gutsev and boldyrev 1985 was firstly calculated the vea of pfos was 109 1 kj mol which was higher than that of f 53 85 3 kj mol but lower than that of f 53b 132 2 kj mol table 1 suggesting an analogous trend in susceptibility to electron addition indeed the vea fitted well with the degradation rate order found in the experiments with the uv sulfite system that is f 53b pfos f 53 this means that eaq is more reactive towards f 53b rather than pfos and f 53 under the same conditions calculation on a hypothetical br substituted f 53b instead of the cl atom estimated a higher vea 191 9 kj mol implying the even higher electron affinity further details are provided in si thus strengthening the fundamental contribution of cl to enhance f 53b degradability by uv sulfite concerning molecular orbitals the highest occupied molecular orbital homo contour surfaces of the investigated molecules fig 3a c e indicate that theoretically the sulfonic acid group is composed of the most reactive sites for electrophilic attack yet f 53b f 53 and pfos were not degradable by so4 or oh generated by the uv ps system fig s3 in contrast the lumo contour surfaces fig 3b d f of f 53 and f 53b were considerably changed by the insertion of o or replacement of cl comparing f 53 with pfos the total contribution of α carbon c 8 in pfos c 9 in f 53 and β carbon c 7 in pfos c 8 in f 53 to lumo decreased from 16 55 to 5 25 respectively due to the introduction of an o atom this was more marked for the chlorinated congener the value decreased to 1 47 for f 53b table s3 the shift of lumo distribution to non ionic end is not beneficial to nucleophilic attacked by eaqˉ at all carbon atoms thus decrease defluorination for f 53 and f 53b more importantly the contribution of f atoms on c 1 to the lumo of pfos and f 53 was null while cl contributed 21 58 to the lumo of f 53b as a result of cl substitution the contribution of c 1 to lumo in f 53b is 30 61 which is much higher than that in f 53 10 57 and pfos 5 41 table s3 in addition the lower dissociation energy of c cl bond 305 9 kj mol than c f bond 482 7 kj mol is another change that benefit to decomposition of f 53b details discussed in si hence it is the introduction of a cl atom that determines the significant enhancement of f 53b reducibility 4 conclusions generally in many developing countries like china most industrial wastewater containing pfass is not treated properly before its discharge into municipal wastewater treatment facilities due to both a lack of appropriate regulation and the high treatment cost besides it has been widely verified that conventional water treatment processes are ineffective for removing pfass rahman et al 2014 and therefore their concentrations sometimes increase in wastewater treatment plants due to the transformation of precursors loos et al 2013 consequently pfass accumulate in municipal water treatment plants and even in natural waters posing a serious risk to human health moreover chlorine substituted pfass account for a high proportion among the newly detected per and polyfluoroalkyl surfactants in fluorochemical industrial wastewater liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 these compounds like f 53b are probably unoxidizable and hence aops are somewhat useless when seeking to reduce the environmental and health risks delivered by these pollutants nevertheless according to the results obtained in the present study such compounds can be effectively degraded by the uv sulfite system discussed in this study we validated the high reducibility of oxidation resistant f 53b a widely detected sulfonic acid and important potential alternative to pfos in china especially as cms specifically a chrome plating wastewater containing f 53b was effectively treated by uv sulfite achieving its entire degradation within 1 h comparison with experiments in controlled conditions suggested that the degradation of f 53b is obtainable moreover the kinetic study indicated a substantial dependence of reaction kinetics on the molecular structure this was also confirmed and studied more in depth by quantum chemical calculations these results imply that strong reduction by the uv sulfite system might be the most practical and economical way to reduce the environmental risks stemming from these widely used chemicals at the

18622,chrome mist suppressants are key chemicals used in the chrome plating industry to reduce exposure of workers by inhalation to airborne chromic acid pollution perfluoroalkyl sulfonated compounds are excellent mist suppressants thanks to their chemical stability and surface activity therefore despite mounting evidence for their persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity it is likely that such chemicals will continue to be used for the foreseeable future because of their importance and lack of alternatives the present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of advanced reduction as an effective technology to treat chrome plating industry wastewater in particular wastewater containing a chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate i e f 53b an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos used to prepare chrome mist suppressant in china was treated by uv activated sulfite results demonstrates that in ultrapure water f 53b can be easily degraded within 1 min much faster than pfos stoichiometric fluoride recovery was also achieved confirming significant defluorination of the pollutant such superior reducibility was due to the presence of chlorine atoms as corroborated by quantum chemical calculations f 53b degradation was also achieved in chrome plating industrial wastewater which yielded results were slower than those achieved in the laboratory nonetheless obtained complete abatement within 60 min these results suggest that the proposed advanced reduction process is one of the safest options to control pfas discharge in the environment and reduce the related risks to ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv sulfite chrome mist suppressant f 53b pfass wastewater treatment 1 introduction chrome plating is an electroplating technique that is utilized to create a thin layer of chromium onto a metal object it is used for decoration augment surface hardness endow corrosion resistance and other applications the process is based on hexavalent or trivalent chromium reduction to metallic form by cathode reduction due to low cathode efficiency and high solution viscosity oxygen and hydrogen bubbles are generated during the plating process thus producing a mist of chromium containing solution given the well known carcinogenicity of hexavalent chromium shahid et al 2017 it is fundamental for worker safety to prevent formation of mist chrome mist suppressants cms are used to this aim they are chemically stable surfactants that reduce surface tension of chrome bath solution in this way gas bubble size decreases thus reducing the buoyancy force and consequently the energy which resulting droplets are ejected into the air the most effective chemicals that are currently used in chrome plating industry are perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in particular perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos has long been the most utilized as cms key component owing to its excellent capability of lower water surface tension and chemical stability necessary because of the aggressive chemical and electrochemical environment however this compound and its salts have been found to be persistent bioaccumulative and biomagnifying houde et al 2006 olsen et al 2007 vethaak 2008 wen et al 2016 and capable of causing many toxic effects e g developmental and reproductive toxicity as well as endocrine disruption apelberg et al 2007 di nisio et al 2018 okada et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 for these reasons pfos was listed as a persistent organic pollutant by the stockholm convention in 2009 consequently its employment should be ceased in all countries that have ratified the convention including china nonetheless among its applications the convention recognizes a special exemption for the preparation of cms yet this exemption will expire in 2019 laurent 2018 in china the majority of pfos is employed in the preparation of cms where it supplies more than 6000 chrome plating plants currently in operation throughout the country in 2008 the annual consumption of pfos as cms was estimated to be 30 40 t yr lin and li 2008 and this high level of demand has led to the development of alternative chemicals among them perfluorinated ether potassium sulfonate f 53 c8f17o4s k first synthesized in 1975 by the shanghai institute of organic chemistry chinese academy of sciences performs excellently as cms but is costly to synthesize and impractical for industrial application subsequently a second generation was created by substituting one fluorine at the chain end with a chlorine atom the manufacturing process of this monochlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate named f 53b clc8f16o4s k is much simpler and thus its synthesis is cheaper than that of f 53 group of perfluoro sulfonic acids 1979 wang et al 2013 accordingly f 53b has been used for almost 40 years in cms formulations and it was estimated that 10 14 t yr might have been emitted into the environment during 2006 2015 ti et al 2018 indeed in recent years an increased concentration of f 53b has been detected in atmospheric particles wei et al 2017 arctic wildlife gebbink et al 2016 marine organisms liu et al 2017 municipal sewage sludge ruan et al 2015 and maternal cord and placenta chen et al 2017 as well as in the surface waters of many countries at levels of ng l pan et al 2018 these facts alongside mounting evidence for its adverse effects highlight the existence of a serious risk to human health and the environment posed by f 53b in terms of the risks embryo toxicity shi et al 2017 developmental neural toxicity yin et al 2018 thyroid hormone disruption deng et al 2018 and subchronic reproductive effects to adult male mice zhou et al 2018 have been correlated to f 53b exposure besides evidence of its bioaccumulation in living beings cui et al 2018 including humans f 53b could account for a substantial fraction of previously unidentified organic fluorine in the chinese population as well as its biopersistence shi et al 2016 has been found additionally all pfass including f 53b might inhibit the enzyme activity of microflora in soil as well as destroy the cellular structure and gene expression of bacteria qiao et al 2018 therefore although soil is not the ultimate sink for f 53b its temporary contamination through leaching from improper solid waste disposal or stockpiling might threaten soil ecosystem despite the above mentioned negative effects considering the importance of the need for an effective cms in the plating industry and pending the development of non fluorinated cms it is likely that the production of f 53b will continue to increase after the phasing out of pfos in china zhang et al 2015 in this context the adoption of effective wastewater treatment technologies to clean industrial effluents is probably the most feasible way to maintain use of a fluorine based cms whilst at the same time preventing further releases of f 53b or any other fluorinated alternative into the environment to date only adsorption technology has been reported as a feasible approach to the removal of f 53b from water gao et al 2016 however the spent adsorbent needs to be disposed appropriately to prevent secondary contamination among the options for disposal landfilling should be avoided as pfass have been found in the leachate of several landfill sites gellrich and knepper 2012 huset et al 2011 incineration of spent adsorbent remains the sole viable option but it needs to be conducted at very high temperatures 1000 c watanabe et al 2016 to ensure the complete destruction of pfas and avert unintentional dioxin generation advanced oxidation processes aops have been found to be effective with respect to several pfass dombrowski et al 2018 and yet f 53b is not oxidizable by heat activated persulfate chen et al 2018 which is summarized as the best oxidation method for pfass degradation such remarkable resistance to oxidation poses a great challenge for pfas remediation suggesting the need for different approaches to be investigated in recent years the reductive approach has been found to be an effective alternative to oxidation hydrated electron is a potent reducing species that can be easily generated in water by uv activated sulfite such methodology was proved to being capable to entirely remove pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid in water more importantly significant generation of fluorides was verified thus proving the efficacious defluorination of the target pollutant gu et al 2016 2017a 2017b song et al 2013 in particular in our previous study we ascertained that pfas that are resistant to aops can be straightforwardly degraded by advanced reduction with hydrated electrons bao et al 2018 uv sulfite system is ideal for treating chrome plating wastewater in fact sulfite is already utilized in many plants to reduce hexavalent chromium to cr iii the employment of a uv irradiating reactor to the sulfite addition section would be the most practicable and economic method to remove also cms however the feasibility of such treatment was never assessed the objective of the present paper is investigating the effectiveness of the uv sulfite system to treat a real effluent containing f 53b from a chrome plating facility kinetic study treatment parameter optimization and considerations on pfas chemical structure by quantum chemical calculations are also done to corroborate the feasibility of the proposed treatment as viable method to remove cms from chrome plating wastewater in particular the study is focused on f 53b the use of which is expected to increase in china in the coming years 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the electroplating wastewater containing f 53b was taken from the effluent collection tank of a chrome plating facility in

in detail previously bao et al 2018 however briefly photochemical reactions were conducted by placing quartz tubes 45 ml solution on a turnplate with 10 rpm rotation speed in the center of the reactor surrounded by 16 lamps with wavelength of 253 7 nm fig s2 each lamp had an emission intensity of 8 0 mw cm2 thus ensuring a photon intensity of 3 8 μe l s in the reactor all the tubes were capped except during sampling the photochemical reactor was operated 5 min in advance of placing the quartz tubes the initial ph values of the solutions used in the uv sulfite system na2so3 1 2 3 and 20 mm were adjusted to 10 by using 0 25 m naoh or 0 1 m h2so4 solution while that of the uv persulfate system k2s2o8 20 mm was modified to 6 pfos f 53 and f 53b were dissolved in ultrapure water to an initial concentration of 0 16 mm all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 3 analysis methods pfos f 53 and f 53b were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20at shimadzu

solving differential equation systems using the software mathematica 8 0 wolfram research uk density functional theory calculations on pfos f 53 f 53b as well as other hypothetical molecules i e molecular fragments were conducted using the software gaussian 09 revision b 01 2010 conformation optimization and frequency calculations were performed using the b3lyp hybrid functional with the 6 311 g d p basis set torres et al 2009 to understand the reaction initiation for pfos f 53 and f 53b via eaq attack the contour surfaces of molecules were visualized using gaussview and molecular orbital composition analysis was accomplished using multiwfn lu and chen 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation feasibility of f 53b f 53 and pfos by uv sulfite system preliminary experiments to ascertain the viability of cms removal by uv sulfite system were carried out in ultrapure water f 53b and pfos were tested as most used cms component in china f 53 was also subjected to treatment to obtain useful information on f 53b degradability by hydrated electrons fig 1 a b and c results demonstrate f 53b was easily decomposed with the assistance of eaq 99 was decomposed in 1 min and more than 99 of cl was recovered once f 53b was undetectable pfos disappeared in 2 h while 10 of residual f 53 was still detected at the same time requiring one further hour for its complete degradation hence the observed order of degradation rate by uv activated sulfite was f 53b pfos f 53 this suggests that the presence of o atoms in the perfluoroalkyl chain decreases the interaction of f 53 with hydrated electrons thus slowing down molecular decomposition on the contrary the fast degradation kinetics of f 53b indicates that the cl atom accelerates the dismantling of the molecule in terms of defluorination 90 of fluorine was recovered in mineral form i e fluorides for all investigated compounds but this required 8 h of reaction notably pfos defluorination reached 85 when it was undetectable 2 h while less fluorine 70 was recovered for f 53b and f 53 at the same reaction time this could be attributed to the ether group in both molecules which markedly changed their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo table s3 as elucidated later finally it is essential to remark the substantial refractoriness of the investigated compounds to advanced oxidation it was confirmed by experiments with uv activated persulfate fig s3 where no degradation of each chemical was obtained over 300 min treatment such result evidently proves that the oxidation approach is impracticable for wastewater treatment while reduction is a realistic way 3 2 f 53b degradation by uv sulfite in real chrome plating wastewater chrome electroplating wastewater effluent in a conditioning tank fig s1 with 65 7 μg l 0 115 μμ f 53b was employed in a bench scale experiment fig 1d more than 90 of f 53b was removed from the water after 30 min and it was undetectable instrumental detection limit was 0 2 μg l table s2 in 60 min unfortunately because of low initial concentration of f 53b in the wastewater fluoride and chloride concentration was much lower than instrument detection limit so f and cl could not be quantified in reliable manner but the f and cl concentration was extrapolated according to the experimental data fig 1d comparing this result with f 53b degradation in ultrapure water fig 1a a dramatic decrease in reaction rate was evident this was conceivably caused by the presence of other components in the wastewater which scavenged or interfered with the hydrated electron attack despite these limited kinetics since sulfite is one of the most common reagents used to reduce cr vi to cr iii in electroplating wastewater xie et al 2008 the uv sulfite method is still the most viable technology for removing f 53b from such effluent both from the technical and economical points of view specifically it is feasible to integrate uv sulfite technology into current wastewater treatment processes simply by adjusting the sulfite dosage without addition of any other chemicals or plant apparatus 3 3 reaction mechanism the first step of the reaction is the activation of sulfite to generate hydrated electrons li et al 2014 song et al 2013 there is large literature on this step so in the present study it is not further investigated hydrated electrons then reacts with pfas molecules in water resulting in their degradation intermediates were identified and quantified to ascertain the reaction pathway of the investigated chemicals in the uv sulfite system with regard to f 53 and pfos useful to provide information on f 53b degradation mechanism by comparison pfpra pfba and pfpea were detected as main quantifiable intermediates for the degradation of f 53 pfpra pfba pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa for pfos in the uv sulfite system all these compounds reached their maximum concentration in 30 min figs s4 and s5 which then declined to zero notably pfhxa was not identified during the degradation of f 53 possibly because c5 c6 bond see atom label in fig 3 c next to ether bond is preferable for rupture for pfos intermediates indicated that eaq attack can occur at all carbon atoms simultaneously through comparison of the f 53 and f 53b degradation kinetics it could at first sight be inferred that the presence of cl just boosted the reaction rate and had no relevant influence on defluorination concerning f 53b several intermediates were identified in a set of experiments with reduced na2so3 concentration in order to reduce reaction kinetics and facilitate intermediate identification fig s6 dechlorination occurred simultaneously with disappearance of f 53b at varied na2so3 dosage again verified that this is the dominant process to initiate the degradation a chromatogram peak was attributed to a hydrogen substituted f 53b hc6f12oc2f4so3 m z 496 9 its peak area was sensibly large with a magnitude similar to that of f 53b m z 530 9 fig s7 therefore dechlorination was confirmed as one of the foremost reactions leading to f 53b decomposition as corroborated by the existence of the hydrogenated intermediate other intermediates were identified as chloro fluoro carboxyl acids i e c6o2f10clˉ m z 328 9 and hydro fluoro ones i e c6ho2f10ˉ m z 294 9 c5ho2f8ˉ m z 244 9 another intermediate with m z 328 9 was actually ascribable to clc5f10cooˉ if correct the presence of this chlorinated intermediate suggests that f 53b was also split at the ether bond thus promoting the destruction of the molecular backbone on the basis of the experimental evidence we propose a possible pathway for f 53b degradation fig 2 the pathway certainly starts with the attack of a hydrated electron on the f 53b molecule the identified intermediates which can be divided into chloro fluoro compounds and hydro fluoro ones suggest the existence of two possible reaction pathways that may occur during the electron attack hydrogenation i e substitution of cl with h named route i in fig 2 and molecular cleavage called route ii for the initiation reaction of route i cl is replaced by h thus resulting in generation of hc6f12oc2f4so3 it is proposed that protons can be reduced to hydrogen radical e 2 3 v by direct reaction h eaq h buxton et al 1988 h has a relatively low reduction potential compared with eaq e 2 9 v but it may also be able to reduce f 53b to hc6f12oc2f4so3 obviously h would be the dominant reductant only with acidic ph which is not the case initial ph was set to be 10 so eaq likely the most abundant species xiao et al 2017 conceivably hc6f12oc2f4so3 is then cleaved at the oxygen bridge forming oc2f4so3 and hc6f12 alternatively route ii f 53b is directly split at the ether bond by eaq attack to produce products similar to those of route i apart from the presence of cl instead of h from there on the two pathways of the perfluorinated fragment substituted with cl or h are similar a continuous defluorination of the terminal carbon atom with unpaired electrons by f flake off to generate the corresponding carboxyl acid lee et al 2009 yang et al 2015 the coo group then detaches from the molecular fragment and coo is likely transformed into co2 bentel et al 2019 albeit it may also encounter other radicals e g h derived by h eaq h buxton et al 1988 to produce formic acid qu et al 2010 indeed no formic acid was detected in our system perhaps because of its low concentration it should be noted that the chloro polyfluoro acid could undergo cl substitution to generate the corresponding hydrogenated intermediate yet the rapid buildup of cl in solution fig 1a implies that route ii is marginal and or such latter reaction likely occurs soon i e when the chain length of the perfluorinated moiety is still long that is n 6 the oc2f4so3 fragment generated through both routes routes i and route ii fig 2 very likely follows a fluorine flake off process to its final defluorination namely h f exchange which results in stepwise defluorination bentel et al 2019 the described defluorination process is assumed to repeat itself until finally complete dehalogenation of the f 53b molecule is attained 3 4 kinetic study on the basis of the above mentioned reaction mechanism a kinetic model was developed to extrapolate experimental data the model for f 53b degradation is a simplified version of the route i fig 2 this is hypothesized to be the main degradation pathway the model consists of the following reactions 1 sulfite activation s o 3 2 k a e a q 2 dechlorination hydrogenation c l c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 e a q h k d h h c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 c l 3 cleavage h c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 e a q k c h c 6 f 12 o c 2 f 4 s o 3 4 hc 6 f 12 defluorination h c n f 2 n 2 e a q k d a n h c n 1 f 2 n 1 2 f c n 6 1 5 o c 2 f 4 so 3 defluorination o c m f 2 m s o 3 2 e a q k d b m c m 1 f 2 m 1 s o 3 2 f c m 2 1 all the reactions are considered of the global second order first order respect to each reagent apart from sulfite activation which is taken of the first order the interpolation of experimental data is done with the three investigated pfas but using an appropriate reaction models specifically for f 53 dechlorination hydrogenation reaction is excluded and the molecule is directly cleaved according to reaction 3 to be then defluorinated in agreement with reactions 4 and 5 regarding pfos cleavage reaction splits the polar group i e so3 and the perfluorinated chain later the perfluorinated moiety is defluorinated stepwise following reactions 4 when executing the best fitting of the data kinetic constants values for the same reaction were kept the same when possible for example hydrated electron generation from sulfite was supposed to have the same value being the reaction conditions unchanged for all experiments molecular cleavage and defluorination kinetic constants were also maintained constant for f 53b and f 53 because of their evident molecular structure similarity despite such additional constraints experimental data were fitted by the model in satisfactory manner fig 1 with regard to f 53b kinetic constant values table 1 indicate a rapid production of hydrated electrons followed by an as fast dechlorination and hydrogenation of the compound this explains the rapid abatement of f 53b in solution molecular cleavage at the etheric bridge is the rate limiting step of decomposition once f 53b carbon backbone is split perfluorinated radical fragments are quickly degraded to fluoride and conceivably to co2 in truth mineralization rate of the sulfonated fragment is extremely slow such fact elucidates why 100 recovery of fluorides was not obtained in experiments two facts are notable firstly the same kinetic constant values can predict f 53 degradation rate excluded the cl substitution indeed f 53 slow degradation is due to the sluggish cleavage rate secondly the defluorination rate constants decrease along with carbon chain length of perfluorinated intermediates thus suggesting a diminution in reactivity during defluorination of such fragments an analogous trend is observed for pfos defluorination constants fig s8 but with different values in sum the kinetic study corroborates the strong dependence of pfas reactivity in uv sulfite system on their molecular structure bentel et al 2019 concerning the f 53b degradation in chrome plating wastewater the sole difference in the model outcome is related to the dechlorination hydrogenation rate constant which is roughly a one hundredth of that in ultrapure water this result is likely owed to presence of hydrated electron scavenger e g chromium ions organic matter etc specifically it is reasonable that hydrated electron production rate i e sulfite activation does not sensibly change in wastewater being irradiation conditions and the other reaction parameters kept constant but hydrated electrons are captured by scavengers so that their concentration in water is substantially reduced and resulting in an apparent diminution of dechlorination hydrogenation constant this fact must be taken in due account when implementing the technology at full scale 3 5 molecular structure influence on f 53b degradability kinetic modeling clearly demonstrates a relevant dependence of f 53b reducibility on its molecular structure firstly the presence of cl atom remarkably boosts its degradation rate respect to f 53 and pfos on contrary comparing f 53 and pfos degradation kinetics it seems that the etheric bridge provides augmented resistance toward reduction by hydrated electrons finally in agreement with recent findings bentel et al 2019 the defluorination rate is considerably determined by perfluorinated chain length therefore structural influence on molecular reactivity and consequently on dehalogenation kinetics deserves further deepening because this latter in turn affects many practical aspects of the technology e g energy consumption equipment dimension etc to this aim quantum chemical calculations were performed to ascertain the contribution of oxygen and chlorine to f 53b degradability the presence of cl and o atoms together radically changes composition of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo compared to that of pfos table s3 however they have different influences on the molecular reducibility in fact when one o atom was inserted into the perfluorinated chain i e in the pfos chain the compound i e f 53 was less prone to hydrated electron attack on the contrary when a cl atom was further introduced in the alkyl chain to replace an f atom on the terminal c i e labeled c 1 in fig 3 the reducibility of f 53b was significantly promoted notwithstanding the presence of o in the chain to better understand such a disparity of influence of both heteroatoms the vertical electron affinity vea defined as the difference between the total energies of a neutral molecular system and the anion in the same equilibrium geometry of the neutral system gutsev and boldyrev 1985 was firstly calculated the vea of pfos was 109 1 kj mol which was higher than that of f 53 85 3 kj mol but lower than that of f 53b 132 2 kj mol table 1 suggesting an analogous trend in susceptibility to electron addition indeed the vea fitted well with the degradation rate order found in the experiments with the uv sulfite system that is f 53b pfos f 53 this means that eaq is more reactive towards f 53b rather than pfos and f 53 under the same conditions calculation on a hypothetical br substituted f 53b instead of the cl atom estimated a higher vea 191 9 kj mol implying the even higher electron affinity further details are provided in si thus strengthening the fundamental contribution of cl to enhance f 53b degradability by uv sulfite concerning molecular orbitals the highest occupied molecular orbital homo contour surfaces of the investigated molecules fig 3a c e indicate that theoretically the sulfonic acid group is composed of the most reactive sites for electrophilic attack yet f 53b f 53 and pfos were not degradable by so4 or oh generated by the uv ps system fig s3 in contrast the lumo contour surfaces fig 3b d f of f 53 and f 53b were considerably changed by the insertion of o or replacement of cl comparing f 53 with pfos the total contribution of α carbon c 8 in pfos c 9 in f 53 and β carbon c 7 in pfos c 8 in f 53 to lumo decreased from 16 55 to 5 25 respectively due to the introduction of an o atom this was more marked for the chlorinated congener the value decreased to 1 47 for f 53b table s3 the shift of lumo distribution to non ionic end is not beneficial to nucleophilic attacked by eaqˉ at all carbon atoms thus decrease defluorination for f 53 and f 53b more importantly the contribution of f atoms on c 1 to the lumo of pfos and f 53 was null while cl contributed 21 58 to the lumo of f 53b as a result of cl substitution the contribution of c 1 to lumo in f 53b is 30 61 which is much higher than that in f 53 10 57 and pfos 5 41 table s3 in addition the lower dissociation energy of c cl bond 305 9 kj mol than c f bond 482 7 kj mol is another change that benefit to decomposition of f 53b details discussed in si hence it is the introduction of a cl atom that determines the significant enhancement of f 53b reducibility 4 conclusions generally in many developing countries like china most industrial wastewater containing pfass is not treated properly before its discharge into municipal wastewater treatment facilities due to both a lack of appropriate regulation and the high treatment cost besides it has been widely verified that conventional water treatment processes are ineffective for removing pfass rahman et al 2014 and therefore their concentrations sometimes increase in wastewater treatment plants due to the transformation of precursors loos et al 2013 consequently pfass accumulate in municipal water treatment plants and even in natural waters posing a serious risk to human health moreover chlorine substituted pfass account for a high proportion among the newly detected per and polyfluoroalkyl surfactants in fluorochemical industrial wastewater liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 these compounds like f 53b are probably unoxidizable and hence aops are somewhat useless when seeking to reduce the environmental and health risks delivered by these pollutants nevertheless according to the results obtained in the present study such compounds can be effectively degraded by the uv sulfite system discussed in this study we validated the high reducibility of oxidation resistant f 53b a widely detected sulfonic acid and important potential alternative to pfos in china especially as cms specifically a chrome plating wastewater containing f 53b was effectively treated by uv sulfite achieving its entire degradation within 1 h comparison with experiments in controlled conditions suggested that the degradation of f 53b is obtainable moreover the kinetic study indicated a substantial dependence of reaction kinetics on the molecular structure this was also confirmed and studied more in depth by quantum chemical calculations these results imply that strong reduction by the uv sulfite system might be the most practical and economical way to reduce the environmental risks stemming from these widely used chemicals at the

18623,a novel unsteady flow numerical model for the simulation of the transport of non uniform non cohesive sediment mixtures sm during flushing operation in sewers is presented in this paper the model was applied to the case of a flush experimental test that was recently carried out in a combined sewer channel of the sewer system of paris city that exhibits depositional problems due to relatively coarse sediments the model output was compared to the results of the field experiments as well as to those obtained with a model for the transport of uniform sediments us the model for sm provided a reliable interpretation of the selective transport of the sediments deposited in the channel bed as induced by the flush the comparison showed the model for sm to provide an enhanced description of the erosional effects of the flush on the deposits including improved evaluation of the volume of sediments flushed out of the experimental channel in the field keywords sewer flushing sewer sediment sediment mixture deposits non uniform sediment transport modelling 1 introduction flushing is considered a cost effective technique to remove sediments from sewer systems in the recent decades this technique has been amply reconsidered both as preventive and reactive measure to tackle the build up of sediment deposits on the invert of sewer channels chebbo et al 1996 ashley et al 2004 bertrand krajewski et al 2005 bong et al 2015 sewer flushing consists of generating artificial flow waves to remove the sediments deposited in the channels typically flushed sediments are transported to downstream sewer sections where sewer self cleaning conditions are adequate or alternatively intercepted by apposite sediment trap facilities in the last three decades the cleaning efficiency of sewer flushing operations has been investigated in a plethora of studies including both stormwater and combined sewer systems on the one hand full scale field experiments or laboratory tests with scaled models have been carried out lorenzen et al 1996 ristenpart 1998 guo et al 2004 bertrand krajewski et al 2005 bong et al 2015 using flushing devices of various type e g flushing gates gate valves vacuum systems etc the cleaning efficiency demonstrated by experiments has been related mostly to hydraulic parameters of the flush e g initial energy or water level velocity and shear stress induced by the flow in the channel to the geometrical characteristics of the channel e g shape size longitudinal slope hydraulic roughness and to the main properties of the sediment e g median size and density of the particles deposited in the sewer dettmar 2005 staufer et al 2007 schaffner 2008 other experiments have concerned the impact of the sediment thickness campisano et al 2004 guo et al 2004 and cohesion campisano et al 2008 on the flush efficiency on the other hand sewer flushing has been studied by means of modelling approaches early works have been focused on the analysis of the hydraulic propagation of flushing waves in sewer channels with emphasis on the evaluation of the shear stress generated by various flushing devices e g campisano and modica 2003 shirazi et al 2014 specifically these works have analysed flow and sediment related processes by use of uncoupled modelling approaches with the basic objective of identifying the length of the channel that can be potentially cleaned i e the channel segment in which the shear stress is larger than the minimum threshold value to erode the sediment other studies have been carried out that use more complex 1d e g todeschini et al 2008 or 2d e g caviedes voullième et al 2017 approaches based on the coupled solution of flow and sediment transport equations for modelling the erosional impact of the flush results of these studies allowed mainly to obtain design indications concerning the type of flushing device as well as the optimization of the scheduling for the flushing operation in sewers e g campisano et al 2007 creaco and bertrand krajewski 2009 very often used approaches have been derived by the contiguous field of river sediment transport and neglected processes that under certain circumstances could be of relevance in combined sewers such as those associated to the potential cohesive nature of the sediments banasiak et al 2005 banasiak and verhoeven 2008 in any case mainly due to difficulties to obtain reliable and accurate data on the sediments forming the deposits in the sewer the available studies including those dealing with the simulation of real field cases have so far proceeded by modelling the flushing of sewers through the use of simplified approaches that assume sediment of uniform size both in space and in time among the other existing models a transport model for uniform sediments has been implemented in the past also by some of the authors of the present paper campisano et al 2004 and used to evaluate sediment removal efficiency of sewer flushing although the review of the scientific literature highlights that much work has been carried out in the past sediment transport mechanisms modalities associated with the rapidly varied flow conditions occurring during sewer flushing are still far from being fully understood recently the paris municipality has launched a large project to explore the potential of implementation of the flushing technique and to evaluate the performance of such a technique to mitigate problems originated from sedimentation alzabadi 2010 in the combined sewer network of the city a trunk of the sewer system with sediment deposition problems was chosen to perform a field scale experimental flush test using an in line mobile gate as flushing device the flush test was monitored through a set of measurement devices that allowed investigating the development of flow and sediment related processes that occurred during the experiment among the various results of the analysis see shahsavari et al 2017 for details the experiment has highlighted an important role played by the grain size composition of the sediments constituting the channel deposits on the erosional depositional impact that is on the cleaning performance of the flush operation in particular the availability of experimental observations concerning the modifications induced by the flush on the grain size composition of the sediment bed has opened new possibilities for improving modelling and evaluation of sewer flushing efficiency by taking into account the selective effects of the flow on the transport of non uniform sediments in this perspective this paper presents a novel approach based on the adoption of an unsteady flow numerical model to simulate the transport of mixtures of non uniform sediment induced by flushing in sewers the model was applied to the case of the flush test carried out in paris shahsavari et al 2017 the outputs of the simulations were compared to the results of the field experiments in order to evaluate the model predictive potential furthermore the simulation results were compared to those obtained by using the model for transport of uniform sediments developed by campisano et al 2004 in order to point out advantages and limitations of the new approach in the description of the impact of the flush on the deposits 2 materials and methods 2 1 site of study the field flushing test was carried out in collecteur des coteaux a large combined collector of the sewer system of paris city see top right map of fig 1 the trunk of the collector which was considered for the test is 1 1 km long and is characterized by a compound cross section maximum height 3 15 m maximum width 2 40 m with a central cunette and side walkways see down right fig 1 and conveys an average dry weather flow of about 0 35 m3 s fig 1 also shows the elevation profile of the channel trunk characterized by an average longitudinal slope of the invert of about 0 09 due to the small slope the trunk is subject to sedimentation problems that determine the accumulation of relevant amounts of solids on the channel bottom some tens centimeters the upstream portion of the trunk is characterized by the presence of several irregularities of the fixed bottom of the channel resulting in some counter slope segments an electrically driven sector gate with sharp crested weir is located at section s0 that is 50 m downstream of the trunk entrance section s 50 the gate is commonly used by the sewer manager to divert combined overflows to the seine river during storm events thanks to its potential to store large water volumes in line in the upstream channel stretch several thousand cubic meters the gate was used to carry out the flushing test in the channel the channel receives flows and related sediments also from minor tributary combined sewers located at sections s 170 s 650 s 850 and s 920 respectively however in order to exclude the impact of tributaries on the sediment transport of the main channel discharges from such secondary branches were temporarily diverted for the whole duration of the experiment at the downstream end of the channel a free end fall is present with a diversion structure that allows conveying flows to a chamber for sediment trapping specific equipment consisting of doppler velocimeters and ultrasound probes was used to monitor the hydraulic characteristics of the flush during the test see fig 1 such equipment was installed both upstream at sections s 50 s 5 and downstream at sections s 5 s 50 s 100 of the flushing gate shahsavari et al 2017 sediment transport during the flush was observed directly by means of video cameras installed under the water level inside the bank of the channel at sections s 50 and s 100 the height and the volume of the deposits before the flush bf and after the flush af were measured all along the channel using a radar sonar scanning technique in addition a campaign of sediment sampling was carried out in the channel in the days before and after the flush test in order to allow analysing the evolution of the grain size distribution of the deposit as determined by the flush in total 20 and 17 samples were collected throughout the channel bf and af respectively see fig 1 the offline analysis of the samples at the laboratory allowed determining the type of sediment e g density porosity as well as the distribution of the grain sizes for the deposit at each sampled section the analysis revealed the presence of non uniform sediments with a large variety of grain sizes thus indicating potential for sediment transport selectivity by the flush shahsavari et al 2017 the average value of the sediment median size d 50 in the deposits of the whole channel was 2 176 mm however significant differences in size were found between the sediments deposited bf in the channel upstream and downstream segments respectively in particular sediments of the upstream segment were found to be smaller than the downstream segment excluding very fine particles smaller than d 1 grain sizes upstream of section s 500 ranged between 0 08 and 8 5 mm d 50 0 90 mm d 90 4 15 mm about 73 of the sediment deposited in this channel segment was made of sandy particles 63 μm 2 mm while nearby 26 fraction was made by gravel particles 2 64 mm differently sediments downstream of s 500 ranged between 0 17 and 34 9 mm d 50 6 78 mm d 90 22 51 mm in this downstream segment about 25 of the sediments was made of sandy particles while about 74 was composed by gravel the fine fraction 63 μm was smaller than 1 all over the deposits of the channel laboratory tests on various sediment samples provided the density of the sediment to range between 2220 and 2532 kg m3 with average weighted value of 2317 kg m3 besides the porosity was observed to slightly vary between 0 40 and 0 42 the analysis of the samples also concerned the organic content in the sediment such a content resulted always smaller than 7 in weight the average content for all the samples was 2 9 thus in principle indicating a potentially low impact of cohesion in sediment erosion and transport processes in the channel shahsavari et al 2017 the flush experimental test consisted of two phases first the gate was closed to store flow upstream then when the maximum storage level was achieved 2 15 m behind the gate the flush was released with the sudden opening of the gate the flush duration was about 3 5 h and the total volume released by the flush was estimated to be close to 8000 m3 further details concerning the experimental setup the used monitoring methodology as well as the obtained accuracy of the results can be found in shahsavari et al 2017 2 2 simulation model 2 2 1 model equations much of the available numerical approaches for the simulation of sewer flushing are based on the use of the one dimensional de saint venant dsv equations to describe the unsteady flow generated by the flush and of the sediment continuity equation exner to evaluate the flush impact on the sewer sediment bed e g see el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 creaco and bertrand krajewski 2009 these approaches are typically developed for non cohesive sediments and also imply simplification of the description of the sediment transport processes by assuming sediment constituted by particles of the same size in particular the d 50 is typically assumed to fully represent the grain size distribution of the sediment mixture a relatively recent example of this type of approach is provided by campisano et al 2004 a more appropriate description of the sediment transport processes can be obtained with more complex models that take into account the non uniformity of the size of the sediments deposited on the bottom of the sewers based on the experience already available in the contiguous field of the river engineering e g di silvio 1992 juez et al 2016 a two layer approach was used to develop a novel model for non uniform non cohesive sediment mixtures in sewer systems hereafter indicated as model for sm the bed of sediments on the bottom of the sewer is described using a two layer scheme that includes a pavement layer the active transport layer at the top of the deposit having thickness δ p and containing sediment particles that are liable to frequent vertical movements entrainment to and settlement from the upper flow current and a sub pavement layer with thickness δ s that contains particles liable to occasional vertical movements to and from the pavement layer the sub pavement layer lays over the rigid bottom of the channel concrete therefore the sum δ p δ s represents the total height of the deposits thus determining the slope of the mobile bed in addition to dsv and exner equations the model for non uniform sediments introduces a set of n equations to describe the continuity of the mass in the pavement layer one for each sediment size class k k 1 n that is used to describe the sediment mixture therefore the developed model can be synthetically described by the following vector equation 1 u t f u x d u being u f u and d u written as follows 2 u a q a s a s p β k p a s p a s β k k 1 n a s s β k s a s p a s β k k 1 n dependent variable vector 3 f u q v q f h ρ 1 1 n q s 1 1 n q s k k 1 n 0 flux vector 4 d u q g a s b s f 1 1 n q s 1 1 n q s k k 1 n 0 source term vector where x m and t s are the spatial and temporal independent variables respectively a m2 is the cross section of the wetted area q m3 s and v m s are the flow discharge and the average flow velocity respectively f h n is the hydrostatic force over the cross section q m3 s m is the net lateral inflow outflow discharge per unit length ρ kg m3 is the water density g m s2 is the gravity acceleration s b m m is the slope of the mobile bed s f m m is the energy friction slope n is the porosity of the sediment a s m2 is the cross sectional area of the sediment deposit a s p m2 and a s s m2 are the cross sectional areas of pavement and sub pavement layers respectively β k p and β k s for k 1 n are the fractions concentrations of sediments of the class k of the mixture in pavement and sub pavement layers respectively β k for k 1 n is the fraction of sediments determining the temporal variation of the pavement cross sectional area for the class k q s m3 s is the total sediment discharge in the cross section q s m3 s m is the net sediment lateral inflow outflow discharge per unit length q s k m3 s for k 1 n is the total sediment discharge of the class k in the pavement and q s k m3 s m for k 1 n is the net sediment lateral inflow outflow discharge per unit length of the class k in the pavement the friction slope in the proposed model is evaluated by using the strickler equation 5 s f q 2 k e q 2 a 2 r 4 3 where r m is the hydraulic radius and k e q m1 3 s is the composite roughness coefficient which is determined based on the einstein equation einstein and banks 1950 thus assuming different roughness values on the wetted perimeter p m 6 k e q p p w k w 3 2 p b k b 3 2 2 3 being subscripts w and b relative to the channel walls i e concrete and bed respectively the strickler roughness coefficient for the bed k b is calculated as a function of the median sediment size d 50 for those sections with deposits using the well known formula strickler 1923 7 k b 21 1 d 50 1 6 conversely k b is equal to k w for sections free of sediments furthermore the shear stress τ b n m2 exerted by the flow over the sediment bed is evaluated as a function of the average shear stress τ 0 ρ g r s f and of the ratio k e q k b as 8 τ b τ 0 k e q k b 3 2 the term a s p β k p w m i x p k for k 1 n in eq 2 is called the mixing volume of the pavement i e the volume of sediments of class k in the pavement per unit channel length instead the term a s p a s β k for k 1 n relates to the exchange of sediment of class k between pavement and sub pavement similarly the mixing volume for the sediments belonging to class k in the sub pavement layer is represented by the term w m i x s k a s s β k s for k 1 n moreover the fraction β k s of each class k in the sub pavement is calculated based on the following relationship 9 β k s w m i x s k k 1 n w m i x s k finally the model assumes the value of β k to be process dependent in particular β k β k s if erosion degradation occurs while β k β k p in the case of deposition aggradation differently from models for uniform sediment transport this means that in the same channel section some grain size particles may be subject to erosion while others to deposition thus enabling the selectivity of the sediment transport due to the flow the solution of eq 1 requires introducing a sediment transport formula to estimate the sediment discharge q s k for each class k of the sediment mixture forming the deposits in particular at each spatial and temporal step particles belonging to each class k can be transported by the flow as bed load or suspended load the criterion based on the rouse parameter r p w s κ u rouse 1937 is implemented in the model to discriminate which of the two conditions occurs for the sediment of size class k being w s the settling velocity of the sediment of size d k belonging to class k u τ 0 ρ the flow shear stress velocity and κ 0 4 the von karman coefficient based on whipple 2004 the particles of size d k are assumed to be transported as bed load for r p 1 2 for the evaluation of parameter r p the formula proposed by she et al 2005 is used to estimate w s 10 w s d k ν 1 05 d 1 5 1 e x p 0 315 d 0 765 where d d k s 1 g ν 1 3 s is the relative density of the sediment and ν m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of the water bonnefille 1963 the meyer peter and müller 1948 formula is adopted to estimate the sediment transport discharge as bed load q s k b e d of class k as a function of flow and sediment characteristics 11 q s k b e d s 1 g d k 3 8 b s θ ξ k θ c r 3 2 where b s is the sediment bed width at the water bed interface θ τ b ρ s ρ g d k is the shields mobility parameter shields 1936 ρ s kg m3 is the density of the sediment and θ c r 0 047 is the critical value of θ according to meyer peter and müller 1948 parameter ξ k is the hiding factor of sediments of class k that allows considering the reduced mobility of smaller sediment sizes due to the exposure effect of larger surrounding particles in sediment mixtures einstein 1950 parker et al 1982 bathurst et al 1987 the power law function proposed by parker and klingeman 1982 is implemented in the model to evaluate ξ k 12 ξ k d 50 d k b with exponent b ranging between 0 6 and 1 0 according to andrews 1983 the velikanov approach 1954 is used to evaluate the amount of sediments transported by the flow as suspended load for the generic class k based on the findings of the experiments in the de coteaux collector the sediment suspended by the flush was transported out of the channel without the occurrence of significant phenomena of re deposition shahsavari et al 2017 the following formula was used to determine the suspended load transport q s k s u s p of class k 13 q s k s u s p c m i n q ρ s with 14 c m i n η m i n ρ s ρ m ρ s ρ v w s s f where c m i n kg m3 is the limit sediment concentration according to velikanov s approach i e eroded sediments are suspended if the flow concentration is lower than c m i n schlütter 1999 ρ m kg m3 is the density of the water sediment mixture typically assumed equal to ρ for low concentrated flows and η m i n is an efficiency coefficient between 0 0005 and 0 002 combes 1982 bed and suspended sediment transport discharges are assumed equal to transport capacities calculated by eqs 11 and 13 as long as sufficient sediment is present on the bed deposits in the opposite case q s k b e d and q s k s u s p are evaluated based on the bed sediment that remains available for transport use of this procedure allows assuring the mass conservation of the channel sediment irrespectively of the time step used for the simulations with continuity errors in the order of 0 1 of the total sediment mass according to the adopted approach eroded sediment particles belonging to each class k are transported as suspended load or alternatively as bed load assuming that grains behave separately as uniform sediments each class size k within the mixture is characterized by its own sediment discharge as in the uniform sediment transport approach wu 2008 therefore the total sediment discharge q s in the section is obtained as k 1 n q s k b e d q s k s u s p as already anticipated early in the paper the described model is an extension of a simpler model developed in the past by some of the same authors campisano et al 2004 to describe the impact of sewer flushing under the assumption of uniform sediment transport hereafter indicated as model for us evidently under this assumption the solution of vector eq 1 is obtained by the simple combination of the dsv and exner equations without including the evaluation of the mass balance of sediments in the pavement and sub pavement layers for the different classes of the sediment mixture it is worth stressing that preliminary simulations carried out while forcing the model for non uniform sediments to run as a model for uniform sediments i e assuming mixtures made of one single grain size revealed a perfect match with the model for us by campisano et al 2004 the solution of vector eq 1 allows evaluating flow e g water level flow discharge etc and sediment transport e g sediment discharges and fractions for each section of the channel at any time of the flush propagation process the root mean square deviation rmsd was used to evaluate the model performance as shown by the literature hyndman and koehler 2006 compared to other metrics the use of this metric allows consistent comparison of the results of the two models with the same set of experimental observations providing also a dimensional measure of the deviation 2 2 2 numerical scheme the hyperbolic system represented by vector eq 1 is solved by using the predictor corrector numerical scheme of mac cormack mac cormack 1969 the scheme is explicit with a second order accuracy both in space and time and is shock capturing i e it is able to interpret discontinuities in flow and water level generated by rapidly varied flow conditions in open channels in the prediction step the predicted value of vector u is calculated based on the vectors of flux f u and source term d u evaluated on the basis of the values of the flow variables at the previous time step as follows 15 u i p r e d u i j δ t f i p r e d f i 1 j δ x d i j where δx and δt are spatial and temporal steps respectively i and j represent the grid node in space and time respectively and superscript pred refers to the predicted values of the variables the flux derivatives are calculated backwards in the correction step f u and d u are evaluated based on the predicted values and flux derivatives are calculated forwards as follows 16 u i c o r r u i j δ t f i 1 p r e d f i p r e d δ x d i p r e d where superscript corr indicates the corrected values of the variables finally the average of predicted and corrected values is used to estimate to new value of vector u at time j 1 as 17 u i j 1 u i p r e d u i c o r r 2 a complementary third step based on the dissipation theory of the total variation diminishing tvd is incorporated in the solution garcia navarro et al 1992 garcia navarro and saviron 1992 campisano et al 2014 to reduce solution oscillations generated in correspondence of high discontinuities of the flow variables the tvd step is applied to flow variables by adding the term δ t δ x s i 1 2 j s i 1 2 j to the term at the second member of eq 17 being vector s evaluated based on the eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix j u f u u as well as on the values of the flow variables at nodes i 1 2 and i 1 2 for complete details see garcia navarro et al 1992 although the model is not fully coupled i e dsv and exner equations are not solved simultaneously the adopted predictor corrector scheme enables a semi coupled solution of the vector eq 1 thus assuring very accurate results for relatively small values of the spatial step campisano et al 2004 the model requires initial conditions at t 0 of flow and sediment parameters to be provided as input boundary conditions for flow and sediment parameters at the upstream and downstream ends of the numerical domain i e at the channel inlet and outlet can be prescribed in the form of functions q t or a t for the flow as well as q s t or a s t for the sediment similar functions e g q h are defined as internal conditions at specific nodes of the domain to simulate the hydraulic of devices such as the flushing gate moreover the method of characteristics is used in the model to determine the values of eventual unknown variables not prescribed at the boundaries garcia navarro and saviron 1992 finally the courant friedrichs lewy condition is used to assure the stability of the scheme this means assuming values of the courant number smaller than the unity bhallamudi and chaudhry 1991 2 3 model implementation the application of the models for sm and us to the flush experiment carried out in paris sewer requested the preliminary setting of input parameters for the simulations most of the parameters used e g the geometrical characteristics of the channel were directly available from measurements obtained during the experimental campaign geometrical data provided as model input included the channel cross section dimensions and the trunk longitudinal slope through the measured elevation of the invert with a spatial step δx 1 m the selected spatial step was shown to provide a compromise between high accuracy of the results and limited computational burden of the simulations use of such δx for simulations with both models led to discretize the channel with a computational mesh of 1101 numerical sections first upstream section of the mesh corresponding to s 50 last downstream section corresponding to s 1050 all the simulations were run by adopting a courant number value of 0 8 other parameters were obtained indirectly by the available measurements for example eq 6 was used to estimate the strickler roughness coefficient of the channel walls k w based on measurements of undisturbed flow and water level recorded at the five monitoring sections in the days before the flush the results of the analysis provided an average value of k w 50 m1 3 s information obtained from the experiments was also used to prescribe initial and boundary conditions for simulations with the two models for sm and us in particular the hydraulic condition in the channel immediately before the flush release was considered as the initial condition for all the simulations the experimental measurements at the five monitoring sections immediately bf i e maximum stored water level behind the flushing gate equal to 2 15 m average water level value downstream of the gate close to 0 5 m were used to reconstruct the initial condition concerning water level profiles and flow discharges upstream and downstream of the gate on the basis of preliminary simulations under stationary conditions definition of the initial condition also included use of data related to the sediments in the channel average values of the measured sediment density 2317 kg m3 and porosity 0 41 were used as input for all the simulations with both models for sm and us moreover the total height of the deposits estimated on every δx on the basis of the measurements bf was prescribed as initial condition for the simulations carried out with the two models for the simulations with the model for sm the data input concerning the deposits was integrated with the information on the grain size composition of the sediment mixture at each section of the mesh in particular the grain size distributions of sediment samples collected during sampling bf were provided as input to the model for sm in order to describe the initial grain size distribution of both pavement and sub pavement layers to this aim the experimental sediment distributions were discretized into n 20 classes of increasing size in the range of diameters d k from 0 075 to 50 mm since the experimental information on the mixture grain size composition was available for only 20 sections throughout the whole channel length the data were linearly interpolated to estimate the initial bed grain size distribution for sections unprovided of measurements a consistency check between the estimated granulometric composition of the initial bed and the measured deposit heights was finally carried out at each channel section this check allowed avoiding for example inconsistent initial conditions characterized by deposit depths smaller than the d 90 of the local sediment mixture differently the model for uniform sediments was run sim 0 assuming the bed to be made of uniform sediments with size equal to the median diameter d 50 2 176 mm input data for the two models also included the flushing gate geometry as well as parameters describing the gate opening modalities at the initial stage of the flush release process e g opening speed v g weir crest elevation w c etc the gate was schematized numerically as an internal condition at section s0 i e 50 m downstream of the channel entrance s 50 the gate behavior during the flush release phase was simulated by implementing in the model a specific routine that combines use of the gate experimental outflow relationship q h w c as obtained from simultaneous measurements of water level h and flow discharge q at s 5 and s 5 respectively and of the experimental function w c t recorded by the gate limit switch sensors during the gate opening process the same boundary conditions were used for the two models the inflow hydrograph q t recorded during the experiment at the channel entrance s 50 was used to define the boundary condition at the upstream end of the computational domain moreover the uniform flow condition was prescribed at the downstream end section s 1050 end fall in case of supercritical flow oppositely the free outfall curve q h under critical flow was prescribed besides upstream boundary conditions for the sediment included prescribing the use of the sediment transport formulas eqs 11 and 13 to determine q s t as a function of local flow conditions determined by the inflow hydrograph instead the mass continuity equation was used to determine the value of the sediment height h s t at the downstream channel end finally average values estimated from the literature were adopted in the simulations with the model for sm for those parameters for which measurements were not available from the experiments i e the thickness of the pavement layer δ p the coefficient η m i n the exponent b of the hiding formula in particular the basic simulation sim 1 with the model for non uniform sediments sm was carried out assuming δ p 3 d 90 as suggested by armanini 1995 b 0 905 parker et al 1982 and η m i n 0 00125 as the average value of the range suggested by combes 1982 and reported in the previous section for the sake of completeness additional simulations were carried out to explore the impact of the variation of these parameters on the results of the model 3 results of the simulations 3 1 validation of the model hydrodynamics the values of flow discharge q and water level h as obtained by the simulations with the model for sm were compared with the experimental values recorded during the flush test at the five monitored sections fig 2 shows as an example the results sim 1 of the comparison for sections s 5 upstream the gate and s 5 and s 50 downstream the gate the figure shows the results concerning the first part of the flush duration 1 5 h from the beginning of the test for which experimental measurements are available the figure points out a very good agreement between the simulation results and the experiments with a relatively high model performance in reproducing the peak of the flow discharge at the beginning of the flush operation percent error equal to 2 7 and 3 9 for s 5 and s 5 respectively the experimental value of the peak flow at s 50 was not available also the flow recession phase is well captured by the model a slightly worse performance of the model is obtained for the water levels at the early beginning of the flush although the model demonstrates to correctly interpret both the abrupt decrease in h at s 5 from 2 15 m to about 1 5 m associated to the formation of the negative emptying wave and the corresponding rapid increase in h from about 0 5 m to about 1 5 m at s 5 and at s 50 as determined by the flush wave propagation downstream very similar model performance although not shown here was obtained at the other sections s 50 and s 100 a global outlook into model results is reported in table 1 the table shows the value of the rmsd between simulated and observed water level h for all the five experimental monitored sections the table also reports the analogous results sim 0 as obtained by using the model for us campisano et al 2004 interestingly the table points out relatively small differences between experiments and simulations slightly improved prediction performance of the model for sm with a maximum deviation of 0 042 m and 0 044 m at s 100 for the two models respectively further simulation results obtained with the two models and concerning the hydraulics of the process are shown in fig 3 in terms of values of the bed shear stress developed by the flush propagation along the channel fig 3a and b concern results obtained by the model for sm and the model for us respectively the results are presented as an example for channel sections s 5 upstream s 100 and s 500 downstream of the flushing gate as expected shear stress peaks are achieved at different times for the three sections depending on the distance from the gate device as well as on the geometry e g on the local longitudinal slope of the channel fig 3a shows that the model for sm provides a shear stress peak close to 13 n m2 to develop at s 100 after about 56 s from the flush start sim 1 the simulated shear stress is also observed to drop down to the initial local value of dry weather flow throughout the channel interestingly the model for us fig 3b provided significantly different values of the shear stress sim 0 as compared to the model for sm larger up to about 25 higher values of the peak shear stress were obtained for sections close to the gate s 5 and s 100 while smaller values down to about 12 less were obtained at downstream section s 500 this result would reveal an important impact of the way the transport processes at the water bed interface are modeled on the development of the shear stress 3 2 evolution of the sediment deposits at the end of the flush although the results of the simulations pointed out the transport models for sm and for us to have a relatively similar performance in the prediction of flow discharges and water levels large differences where observed between the two models in their ability to reproduce the evolution of the deposits af figs 4 and 5 show the results of the simulations concerning the sediment bed at the end of the flush as obtained with the two models respectively the comparison of the two figures shows that the model for sm sim 1 performs better than the model for us sim 0 in describing modifications induced by the flush on the mobile bed in particular the model for sm is observed to reproduce in a relatively good way the depths of the deposit both in the channel segments subject to deposition e g in the upstream portion of the channel up to section s 450 and to erosion e g segments s 500 s 650 s 750 s 850 and s 1000 s 1050 minor agreement between simulated and experimental sediment depths was obtained in the sub section immediately downstream of the gate between s0 and s 50 between s 150 and s 200 and between s 960 and s 975 where experimental peaks of sediment were not predicted properly conversely the model for us provides a worse prediction of the deposit profile af with general underestimation of deposit depths at the downstream channel end as well as overestimation of the sediment accumulated in the upstream segment see for example between s 30 s 100 analytical evaluation of the deviation of the two models from the experiments provided values of the rmsd equal to 0 031 m and 0 041 m for the models for sm sim 1 and for us sim 0 respectively table 2 the model for sm yielded reliable results also in terms of prediction potential of the flush cleaning efficiency in particular the results of the simulation sim 1 show see table 2 that the total amount of sediment removed by the flush from the channel segment downstream of the gate between s0 and s 1050 sums up to 4 32 m3 as difference between initial deposit v s bf 27 09 m3 and final deposit v s af 22 77 m3 the obtained value is relatively smaller relative error 18 3 than the value 5 29 m3 obtained by the field experiment shahsavari et al 2017 based on the simulation results about 2 35 m3 of the total removed sediment was transported as suspended load while the remaining 1 97 m3 as bed load comparatively table 2 shows that simulation sim 0 with the model for us returned a value of 3 52 m3 for the total volume of sediments removed by the flush thus highlighting a significant underestimation of the volume relative error 33 5 as compared to the experimental findings however the most interesting result of the simulation with the model for us is that the flush did not determine suspended sediment transport so that differently by the model for sm the whole amount of sediment was transported out of the channel only as bed load the model also reproduces in a relatively good way the volume of sediments that was removed for the different fractions of the mixture fig 6 shows for example the cumulative volume of sediments deposited in the channel af for the fractions of the mixture with d 0 9 mm 0 9 mm d 2 0 mm and 2 0 mm d 4 15 mm sim 1 for the sake of completeness the figure also reports the volume of sediments deposited bf consistently with previous results the figure shows the model to underestimate the volume of the deposits removed for the three sediment fractions about 6 19 7 and 0 1 for the three fractions respectively as compared with the experimental observations the black line is always over the grey line the flush had a significant impact also on the composition of the sediment mixture in terms of modification of the initial grain size distributions as highlighted by shahsavari et al 2017 based on the experiments the flush was observed to have a relatively modest scouring effect on the large size particles while determining a significant reduction in the finest fractions present in the mixture the results of the simulations with the model for sm allowed prediction of the evolution of the granulometric composition of the bed mixture throughout the whole channel in this regard fig 7 shows the value of the characteristic grain sizes d 16 d 50 and d 90 of the mixture af for all the sampling sections in the channel sim 1 the comparison between simulated continuous line and experimental dashed line results shows that the model is able to reproduce the effect of coarsening of the bed as determined by the flush the value of d 16 d 50 and d 90 af is generally larger than bf the figure shows that the model better predicts the effect of bed coarsening in the downstream part of the channel downstream of section s 550 moreover in general the model predicted better the final values of sizes d 50 and d 90 in the downstream part of the channel conversely larger discrepancies between simulated and observed values were obtained in the upstream part of the channel upstream of s 550 mainly for the larger fractional size d 90 3 3 impact of unmeasured parameters on the simulation results as already introduced in previous sections measurements acquired during the experimental campaign did not allow estimation of all the parameters needed for the simulations therefore the impact of the variation of the unknown parameters on the results of the model for sm was explored with additional simulations simulations mainly concerned the impact of different values of the velikanov coefficient η m i n as well as of the thickness of the pavement layer δ p on the erosional effect induced by the flush further simulations were also run to explore the effect on the results of the variation of the exponent b of the hiding formula eq 12 the output of the analysis for simulations of major interest is summarized in table 2 the table shows the results of the simulations obtained for the extreme values of the range of η m i n according to combes 1982 i e sim 2 for η m i n 0 0005 and sim 3 for η m i n 0 002 as expected the increase in the value of η m i n determines a corresponding increase in the volume removed as suspended transport and also as total removed sediment from 2 67 m3 for η m i n 0 0005 to 4 37 m3 for η m i n 0 002 moreover sensitivity of the model is shown for the thickness of the pavement layer sim 4 as expected the comparison with sim 1 shows that a thinner pavement layer δ p d 90 reduces the rate of sediment available for erosion and transport thus ending to decrease the total volume removed from the channel to about 4 08 m3 finally simulations were run to explore the impact of the hiding process table 2 summarizes the results of the simulation sim 5 run assuming b 0 that is neglecting the hiding effect in the model for sm the results show that the hiding effect during the flush is relatively modest although it modifies the relative proportion of channel bed load versus suspended load in particular comparison with results of sim 1 shows a decrease in the value of the bed load transport with a consequent increase in the suspended load transport thus determining a relatively limited impact on the total volume of sediment removed from the channel 4 34 m3 table 2 also reports the value of the rmsd for the depths of the sediment deposits as obtained for the different simulations globally the results summarized in the table show sim 3 and sim 5 to provide results that are comparable to the base run sim 1 in fact the two simulations provided a slight improvement in the estimation of the removed volume of sediments relative errors equal to 17 4 and 18 respectively on one hand but a bit larger value of the rmsd 0 033 and 0 032 respectively on the other hand in any case the analysis was aimed at evaluating the potential impact of the identified parameters on the results of the model while the selection of their values for detailed model calibration is out of the scope of this paper and is postponed to future research work 4 discussion the results of the simulations have shown advantages and limitations of using the model for sm in reproducing both the hydrodynamics and the sediment transport processes occurring during sewer flushes the comparison of the model for sm and the model for us has shown only modest differences between the two models for what concerns their capability to describe the hydraulics of the flush in terms of evolution of both flow discharge and water levels on time this would confirm findings by creaco and bertrand krajewski 2009 who already found a rather good representation of the hydrodynamics of the sewer flush with an approach based on the use of a model for uniform sediment transport conversely the different results provided by the models for sm and us in terms of bed shear stress reveal the impact of the different ability of the two models in describing the sediment transport processes occurring during the flush in agreement with the experimental observations the results of the simulations with the model for the transport of sm show that since the early stage of the flush release phase finer sediment fractions typically fractions smaller than the initial d 50 are eroded and transported in the channel as suspended load instead larger particles are mainly transported as bed load conversely the model for us is not structurally capable of simulating the selectivity of the sediment transport being the modelling approach limited to the use of the single sediment size d 50 as a result of this limitation in fact sim 0 did not provide occurrence of suspended load transport the ability of the model for sm in describing the selectivity of the sediment transport during the flush also has the further advantage of improving the description of the evolution of the bed roughness during the flush and as a result the spatial and temporal evolution of the shear stress in fact the model for sediment mixtures allows the step by step updating of the value of d 50 at each channel section based on the occurred variation of the grain size distribution of the local sediment mixture of the deposit the model simulations would confirm finer particles to be removed by the flush easier than the larger ones thus leading to the increase in the characteristic diameters of the mixture in the bed and as a result in the bed roughness k b conversely this effect cannot be reproduced by the model for us for which k b is independent on the sediment transport processes occurring at the water bed interface the evolution dynamics of the grain size composition of the deposit clearly explains the different values of shear stress provided by the two models during the flush in fact use of d 50 as obtained with the model for us determines larger initial values of k b in the channel thus providing as output generally higher initial bed shear stress peaks in comparison with the model for sm future developments could also include adding a model routine for the evaluation of the impact of bed forms in the deposits as these are expected to increase the bed roughness thus modifying flow shear stresses and consequent erosion although the results of the simulations point out the model for sm to perform significantly better than the model for us in describing the final bed deposits figs 4 and 5 show both models to provide some discrepancies in the results concerning the comparison between simulated and experimental sediment depths one reason of these differences for sections between s 150 and s 200 and between s 960 and s 975 may be due to the presence as observed during the experiments in that segments of rags mixed in the loose sediments that could have increased the sediment resistance to erosion shahsavari et al 2017 moreover although cohesion as well as other biological and age related sediment processes has been neglected in the simulations the presence of cohesive sediment fractions in the mixture despite the relatively low content may have potentially played a role in increasing the bed resistance to erosion this effect may have been of major relevance in the segment downstream of the gate where the maximum value of the organic content close to 7 was observed thus providing partial explanation of why the experimental deposit in this segment is backward with respect to the simulated one see figs 4 and 5 as shown in fig 7 the model for sm was not able to reproduce at the same way the coarsening of the bed for all the channel segments indeed although the bed coarsening effect is generally captured by the model in some sections the simulated results remain more close to the initial condition bf than to the final experimental condition af evidently this implies that the developed model may explain only partially the complex modalities of sediment erosion and transport occurred during the flush potential improvement may come from further modelling developments to take into account sediments of different density in addition use of different sediment transport formulas specifically developed for storm sewers for both bed load and suspended load transport may further enhance the predicting performance of the model moreover the relatively simplistic description of the channel geometry neglecting the presence of local singularities along the sewer may have played a role on this especially in correspondence of the channel segment close to s 250 as well as at the downstream end of the channel in this context the relatively small number of sediment sampling sections may also have represented one additional reason for not accurate description of the spatial distribution of the sediments along the channel in this context methods to include uncertainty of the sediment parameters may represent a step forward for model development the results of the simulation summarized in table 2 show the relatively high sensitivity of the model for sm to the used value of η m i n with a clear increase in the volume of sediment removed from the channel as the value of η m i n increases remarkably η m i n seems to play a role in the balance of suspended load bed load fractions of the sediments specifically for the smaller values of the parameter however simulations also reveal that most of the sediment available in the initial deposits bf and able to contribute to suspended load transport is already entrained into suspension with the smallest value of η m i n 0 0005 while the rest of the sediment is susceptible of bed load transport only this would mean only small marginal increase of suspended load transport with the adoption of increasing values of η m i n for the simulations in addition the relevant amount of sediment subtracted by the deposit and transported as suspended load provides a reduction of the grain size range of the bed sediment thus ending to reduce the effects of hiding irrespectively of the value of exponent b of the hiding formula comparison between sim 1 and sim 5 in table 2 in this regard a general limitation of the current model for sm is the lack of an appropriate routine to describe re deposition of suspended sediments although this process was observed to play a marginal role during the flush test in the analysed channel shahsavari et al 2017 however the authors think that a more detailed model for re deposition including suitable formulas for the evaluation of the velocity at limit of deposition e g novak and nalluri 1975 najafzadeh and bonakdari 2016 could be a key to improve the prediction of the peaks of the sediment deposits in the downstream part of the channel at the end of the flush conversely the role played by the thickness of the pavement layer seems to be significant in the results provided by the model the relatively relevant differences obtained for different values of δ p show an important limitation of model simulations in the absence of experimental information concerning this parameter thus potentially considering this parameter as a calibration parameter for the model 5 conclusions a novel model for the simulation of the transport of non cohesive mixtures of non uniform sediments sm induced by flushing in sewers was presented in this paper the model results were compared with the experimental observations of a field flush test carried out in a combined sewer channel of paris municipality sewer system main conclusions drawn from the analysis of the results of the simulations include the following points the model for sm is able to describe accurately the hydrodynamics of the flush propagation in the channel in terms of time evolution of both flow discharges and water levels the results are consistent also with those obtained by a previous model for the simulation of the transport of uniform sediments us the proposed model for sm provides a suitable description of the selective transport of non cohesive sandy gravel sediments deposited on the bottom of the experimental sewer channel with fine and large sediments being transported as suspended and bed load transport respectively compared to the model for us the model for sm allows describing the modification of the bed roughness thus the shear stress exerted on the bed due to the spatial and temporal evolution of the distribution of the sediment sizes in the deposits the comparison between the two models shows the model for sm to reproduce in a more accurate way the erosional effects of the flush in terms of both the deposit profile at the end of the flush experiment as well as the total volume of sediments flushed out of the channel the model for sm also allows evaluating the volume of sediment removed for each size fraction of the sediment mixture therefore the model may be usefully applied for the design and planning of sediment flushing operation in the analysed sewer channel the analysis of the results reveals a sensitiveness of the model for sm to the thickness of the sediment pavement initial layer as well as to the velikanov efficiency coefficient thus requiring a sensitivity analysis to be carried out in those cases of unfeasible estimation of these parameters from the field the obtained results pave the road to future prospects of model development including use of different formulas for sediment transport for evaluation of both bed and suspended load also other potential ways for model improvement may concern modelling of sediment cohesion and sediment density

18623,a novel unsteady flow numerical model for the simulation of the transport of non uniform non cohesive sediment mixtures sm during flushing operation in sewers is presented in this paper the model was applied to the case of a flush experimental test that was recently carried out in a combined sewer channel of the sewer system of paris city that exhibits depositional problems due to relatively coarse sediments the model output was compared to the results of the field experiments as well as to those obtained with a model for the transport of uniform sediments us the model for sm provided a reliable interpretation of the selective transport of the sediments deposited in the channel bed as induced by the flush the comparison showed the model for sm to provide an enhanced description of the erosional effects of the flush on the deposits including improved evaluation of the volume of sediments flushed out of the experimental channel in the field keywords sewer flushing sewer sediment sediment mixture deposits non uniform sediment transport modelling 1 introduction flushing is considered a cost effective technique to remove sediments from sewer systems in the recent decades this technique has been amply reconsidered both as preventive and reactive measure to tackle the build up of sediment deposits on the invert of sewer channels chebbo et al 1996 ashley et al 2004 bertrand krajewski et al 2005 bong et al 2015 sewer flushing consists of generating artificial flow waves to remove the sediments deposited in the channels typically flushed sediments are transported to downstream sewer sections where sewer self cleaning conditions are adequate or alternatively intercepted by apposite sediment trap facilities in the last three decades the cleaning efficiency of sewer flushing operations has been investigated in a plethora of studies including both stormwater and combined sewer systems on the one hand full scale field experiments or laboratory tests with scaled models have been carried out lorenzen et al 1996 ristenpart 1998 guo et al 2004 bertrand krajewski et al 2005 bong et al 2015 using flushing devices of various type e g flushing gates gate valves vacuum systems etc the cleaning efficiency demonstrated by experiments has been related mostly to hydraulic parameters of the flush e g initial energy or water level velocity and shear stress induced by the flow in the channel to the geometrical characteristics of the channel e g shape size longitudinal slope hydraulic roughness and to the main properties of the sediment e g median size and density of the particles deposited in the sewer dettmar 2005 staufer et al 2007 schaffner 2008 other experiments have concerned the impact of the sediment thickness campisano et al 2004 guo et al 2004 and cohesion campisano et al 2008 on the flush efficiency on the other hand sewer flushing has been studied by means of modelling approaches early works have been focused on the analysis of the hydraulic propagation of flushing waves in sewer channels with emphasis on the evaluation of the shear stress generated by various flushing devices e g campisano and modica 2003 shirazi et al 2014 specifically these works have analysed flow and sediment related processes by use of uncoupled modelling approaches with the basic objective of identifying the length of the channel that can be potentially cleaned i e the channel segment in which the shear stress is larger than the minimum threshold value to erode the sediment other studies have been carried out that use more complex 1d e g todeschini et al 2008 or 2d e g caviedes voullième et al 2017 approaches based on the coupled solution of flow and sediment transport equations for modelling the erosional impact of the flush results of these studies allowed mainly to obtain design indications concerning the type of flushing device as well as the optimization of the scheduling for the flushing operation in sewers e g campisano et al 2007 creaco and bertrand krajewski 2009 very often used approaches have been derived by the contiguous field of river sediment transport and neglected processes that under certain circumstances could be of relevance in combined sewers such as those associated to the potential cohesive nature of the sediments banasiak et al 2005 banasiak and verhoeven 2008 in any case mainly due to difficulties to obtain reliable and accurate data on the sediments forming the deposits in the sewer the available studies including those dealing with the simulation of real field cases have so far proceeded by modelling the flushing of sewers through the use of simplified approaches that assume sediment of uniform size both in space and in time among the other existing models a transport model for uniform sediments has been implemented in the past also by some of the authors of the present paper campisano et al 2004 and used to evaluate sediment removal efficiency of sewer flushing although the review of the scientific literature highlights that much work has been carried out in the past sediment transport mechanisms modalities associated with the rapidly varied flow conditions occurring during sewer flushing are still far from being fully understood recently the paris municipality has launched a large project to explore the potential of implementation of the flushing technique and to evaluate the performance of such a technique to mitigate problems originated from sedimentation alzabadi 2010 in the combined sewer network of the city a trunk of the sewer system with sediment deposition problems was chosen to perform a field scale experimental flush test using an in line mobile gate as flushing device the flush test was monitored through a set of measurement devices that allowed investigating the development of flow and sediment related processes that occurred during the experiment among the various results of the analysis see shahsavari et al 2017 for details the experiment has highlighted an important role played by the grain size composition of the sediments constituting the channel deposits on the erosional depositional impact that is on the cleaning performance of the flush operation in particular the availability of experimental observations concerning the modifications induced by the flush on the grain size composition of the sediment bed has opened new possibilities for improving modelling and evaluation of sewer flushing efficiency by taking into account the selective effects of the flow on the transport of non uniform sediments in this perspective this paper presents a novel approach based on the adoption of an unsteady flow numerical model to simulate the transport of mixtures of non uniform sediment induced by flushing in sewers the model was applied to the case of the flush test carried out in paris shahsavari et al 2017 the outputs of the simulations were compared to the results of the field experiments in order to evaluate the model predictive potential furthermore the simulation results were compared to those obtained by using the model for transport of uniform sediments developed by campisano et al 2004 in order to point out advantages and limitations of the new approach in the description of the impact of the flush on the deposits 2 materials and methods 2 1 site of study the field flushing test was carried out in collecteur des coteaux a large combined collector of the sewer system of paris city see top right map of fig 1 the trunk of the collector which was considered for the test is 1 1 km long and is characterized by a compound cross section maximum height 3 15 m maximum width 2 40 m with a central cunette and side walkways see down right fig 1 and conveys an average dry weather flow of about 0 35 m3 s fig 1 also shows the elevation profile of the channel trunk characterized by an average longitudinal slope of the invert of about 0 09 due to the small slope the trunk is subject to sedimentation problems that determine the accumulation of relevant amounts of solids on the channel bottom some tens centimeters the upstream portion of the trunk is characterized by the presence of several irregularities of the fixed bottom of the channel resulting in some counter slope segments an electrically driven sector gate with sharp crested weir is located at section s0 that is 50 m downstream of the trunk entrance section s 50 the gate is commonly used by the sewer manager to divert combined overflows to the seine river during storm events thanks to its potential to store large water volumes in line in the upstream channel stretch several thousand cubic meters the gate was used to carry out the flushing test in the channel the channel receives flows and related sediments also from minor tributary combined sewers located at sections s 170 s 650 s 850 and s 920 respectively however in order to exclude the impact of tributaries on the sediment transport of the main channel discharges from such secondary branches were temporarily diverted for the whole duration of the experiment at the downstream end of the channel a free end fall is present with a diversion structure that allows conveying flows to a chamber for sediment trapping specific equipment consisting of doppler velocimeters and ultrasound probes was used to monitor the hydraulic characteristics of the flush during the test see fig 1 such equipment was installed both upstream at sections s 50 s 5 and downstream at sections s 5 s 50 s 100 of the flushing gate shahsavari et al 2017 sediment transport during the flush was observed directly by means of video cameras installed under the water level inside the bank of the channel at sections s 50 and s 100 the height and the volume of the deposits before the flush bf and after the flush af were measured all along the channel using a radar sonar scanning technique in addition a campaign of sediment sampling was carried out in the channel in the days before and after the flush test in order to allow analysing the evolution of the grain size distribution of the deposit as determined by the flush in total 20 and 17 samples were collected throughout the channel bf and af respectively see fig 1 the offline analysis of the samples at the laboratory allowed determining the type of sediment e g density porosity as well as the distribution of the grain sizes for the deposit at each sampled section the analysis revealed the presence of non uniform sediments with a large variety of grain sizes thus indicating potential for sediment transport selectivity by the flush shahsavari et al 2017 the average value of the sediment median size d 50 in the deposits of the whole channel was 2 176 mm however significant differences in size were found between the sediments deposited bf in the channel upstream and downstream segments respectively in particular sediments of the upstream segment were found to be smaller than the downstream segment excluding very fine particles smaller than d 1 grain sizes upstream of section s 500 ranged between 0 08 and 8 5 mm d 50 0 90 mm d 90 4 15 mm about 73 of the sediment deposited in this channel segment was made of sandy particles 63 μm 2 mm while nearby 26 fraction was made by gravel particles 2 64 mm differently sediments downstream of s 500 ranged between 0 17 and 34 9 mm d 50 6 78 mm d 90 22 51 mm in this downstream segment about 25 of the sediments was made of sandy particles while about 74 was composed by gravel the fine fraction 63 μm was smaller than 1 all over the deposits of the channel laboratory tests on various sediment samples provided the density of the sediment to range between 2220 and 2532 kg m3 with average weighted value of 2317 kg m3 besides the porosity was observed to slightly vary between 0 40 and 0 42 the analysis of the samples also concerned the organic content in the sediment such a content resulted always smaller than 7 in weight the average content for all the samples was 2 9 thus in principle indicating a potentially low impact of cohesion in sediment erosion and transport processes in the channel shahsavari et al 2017 the flush experimental test consisted of two phases first the gate was closed to store flow upstream then when the maximum storage level was achieved 2 15 m behind the gate the flush was released with the sudden opening of the gate the flush duration was about 3 5 h and the total volume released by the flush was estimated to be close to 8000 m3 further details concerning the experimental setup the used monitoring methodology as well as the obtained accuracy of the results can be found in shahsavari et al 2017 2 2 simulation model 2 2 1 model equations much of the available numerical approaches for the simulation of sewer flushing are based on the use of the one dimensional de saint venant dsv equations to describe the unsteady flow generated by the flush and of the sediment continuity equation exner to evaluate the flush impact on the sewer sediment bed e g see el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 creaco and bertrand krajewski 2009 these approaches are typically developed for non cohesive sediments and also imply simplification of the description of the sediment transport processes by assuming sediment constituted by particles of the same size in particular the d 50 is typically assumed to fully represent the grain size distribution of the sediment mixture a relatively recent example of this type of approach is provided by campisano et al 2004 a more appropriate description of the sediment transport processes can be obtained with more complex models that take into account the non uniformity of the size of the sediments deposited on the bottom of the sewers based on the experience already available in the contiguous field of the river engineering e g di silvio 1992 juez et al 2016 a two layer approach was used to develop a novel model for non uniform non cohesive sediment mixtures in sewer systems hereafter indicated as model for sm the bed of sediments on the bottom of the sewer is described using a two layer scheme that includes a pavement layer the active transport layer at the top of the deposit having thickness δ p and containing sediment particles that are liable to frequent vertical movements entrainment to and settlement from the upper flow current and a sub pavement layer with thickness δ s that contains particles liable to occasional vertical movements to and from the pavement layer the sub pavement layer lays over the rigid bottom of the channel concrete therefore the sum δ p δ s represents the total height of the deposits thus determining the slope of the mobile bed in addition to dsv and exner equations the model for non uniform sediments introduces a set of n equations to describe the continuity of the mass in the pavement layer one for each sediment size class k k 1 n that is used to describe the sediment mixture therefore the developed model can be synthetically described by the following vector equation 1 u t f u x d u being u f u and d u written as follows 2 u a q a s a s p β k p a s p a s β k k 1 n a s s β k s a s p a s β k k 1 n dependent variable vector 3 f u q v q f h ρ 1 1 n q s 1 1 n q s k k 1 n 0 flux vector 4 d u q g a s b s f 1 1 n q s 1 1 n q s k k 1 n 0 source term vector where x m and t s are the spatial and temporal independent variables respectively a m2 is the cross section of the wetted area q m3 s and v m s are the flow discharge and the average flow velocity respectively f h n is the hydrostatic force over the cross section q m3 s m is the net lateral inflow outflow discharge per unit length ρ kg m3 is the water density g m s2 is the gravity acceleration s b m m is the slope of the mobile bed s f m m is the energy friction slope n is the porosity of the sediment a s m2 is the cross sectional area of the sediment deposit a s p m2 and a s s m2 are the cross sectional areas of pavement and sub pavement layers respectively β k p and β k s for k 1 n are the fractions concentrations of sediments of the class k of the mixture in pavement and sub pavement layers respectively β k for k 1 n is the fraction of sediments determining the temporal variation of the pavement cross sectional area for the class k q s m3 s is the total sediment discharge in the cross section q s m3 s m is the net sediment lateral inflow outflow discharge per unit length q s k m3 s for k 1 n is the total sediment discharge of the class k in the pavement and q s k m3 s m for k 1 n is the net sediment lateral inflow outflow discharge per unit length of the class k in the pavement the friction slope in the proposed model is evaluated by using the strickler equation 5 s f q 2 k e q 2 a 2 r 4 3 where r m is the hydraulic radius and k e q m1 3 s is the composite roughness coefficient which is determined based on the einstein equation einstein and banks 1950 thus assuming different roughness values on the wetted perimeter p m 6 k e q p p w k w 3 2 p b k b 3 2 2 3 being subscripts w and b relative to the channel walls i e concrete and bed respectively the strickler roughness coefficient for the bed k b is calculated as a function of the median sediment size d 50 for those sections with deposits using the well known formula strickler 1923 7 k b 21 1 d 50 1 6 conversely k b is equal to k w for sections free of sediments furthermore the shear stress τ b n m2 exerted by the flow over the sediment bed is evaluated as a function of the average shear stress τ 0 ρ g r s f and of the ratio k e q k b as 8 τ b τ 0 k e q k b 3 2 the term a s p β k p w m i x p k for k 1 n in eq 2 is called the mixing volume of the pavement i e the volume of sediments of class k in the pavement per unit channel length instead the term a s p a s β k for k 1 n relates to the exchange of sediment of class k between pavement and sub pavement similarly the mixing volume for the sediments belonging to class k in the sub pavement layer is represented by the term w m i x s k a s s β k s for k 1 n moreover the fraction β k s of each class k in the sub pavement is calculated based on the following relationship 9 β k s w m i x s k k 1 n w m i x s k finally the model assumes the value of β k to be process dependent in particular β k β k s if erosion degradation occurs while β k β k p in the case of deposition aggradation differently from models for uniform sediment transport this means that in the same channel section some grain size particles may be subject to erosion while others to deposition thus enabling the selectivity of the sediment transport due to the flow the solution of eq 1 requires introducing a sediment transport formula to estimate the sediment discharge q s k for each class k of the sediment mixture forming the deposits in particular at each spatial and temporal step particles belonging to each class k can be transported by the flow as bed load or suspended load the criterion based on the rouse parameter r p w s κ u rouse 1937 is implemented in the model to discriminate which of the two conditions occurs for the sediment of size class k being w s the settling velocity of the sediment of size d k belonging to class k u τ 0 ρ the flow shear stress velocity and κ 0 4 the von karman coefficient based on whipple 2004 the particles of size d k are assumed to be transported as bed load for r p 1 2 for the evaluation of parameter r p the formula proposed by she et al 2005 is used to estimate w s 10 w s d k ν 1 05 d 1 5 1 e x p 0 315 d 0 765 where d d k s 1 g ν 1 3 s is the relative density of the sediment and ν m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of the water bonnefille 1963 the meyer peter and müller 1948 formula is adopted to estimate the sediment transport discharge as bed load q s k b e d of class k as a function of flow and sediment characteristics 11 q s k b e d s 1 g d k 3 8 b s θ ξ k θ c r 3 2 where b s is the sediment bed width at the water bed interface θ τ b ρ s ρ g d k is the shields mobility parameter shields 1936 ρ s kg m3 is the density of the sediment and θ c r 0 047 is the critical value of θ according to meyer peter and müller 1948 parameter ξ k is the hiding factor of sediments of class k that allows considering the reduced mobility of smaller sediment sizes due to the exposure effect of larger surrounding particles in sediment mixtures einstein 1950 parker et al 1982 bathurst et al 1987 the power law function proposed by parker and klingeman 1982 is implemented in the model to evaluate ξ k 12 ξ k d 50 d k b with exponent b ranging between 0 6 and 1 0 according to andrews 1983 the velikanov approach 1954 is used to evaluate the amount of sediments transported by the flow as suspended load for the generic class k based on the findings of the experiments in the de coteaux collector the sediment suspended by the flush was transported out of the channel without the occurrence of significant phenomena of re deposition shahsavari et al 2017 the following formula was used to determine the suspended load transport q s k s u s p of class k 13 q s k s u s p c m i n q ρ s with 14 c m i n η m i n ρ s ρ m ρ s ρ v w s s f where c m i n kg m3 is the limit sediment concentration according to velikanov s approach i e eroded sediments are suspended if the flow concentration is lower than c m i n schlütter 1999 ρ m kg m3 is the density of the water sediment mixture typically assumed equal to ρ for low concentrated flows and η m i n is an efficiency coefficient between 0 0005 and 0 002 combes 1982 bed and suspended sediment transport discharges are assumed equal to transport capacities calculated by eqs 11 and 13 as long as sufficient sediment is present on the bed deposits in the opposite case q s k b e d and q s k s u s p are evaluated based on the bed sediment that remains available for transport use of this procedure allows assuring the mass conservation of the channel sediment irrespectively of the time step used for the simulations with continuity errors in the order of 0 1 of the total sediment mass according to the adopted approach eroded sediment particles belonging to each class k are transported as suspended load or alternatively as bed load assuming that grains behave separately as uniform sediments each class size k within the mixture is characterized by its own sediment discharge as in the uniform sediment transport approach wu 2008 therefore the total sediment discharge q s in the section is obtained as k 1 n q s k b e d q s k s u s p as already anticipated early in the paper the described model is an extension of a simpler model developed in the past by some of the same authors campisano et al 2004 to describe the impact of sewer flushing under the assumption of uniform sediment transport hereafter indicated as model for us evidently under this assumption the solution of vector eq 1 is obtained by the simple combination of the dsv and exner equations without including the evaluation of the mass balance of sediments in the pavement and sub pavement layers for the different classes of the sediment mixture it is worth stressing that preliminary simulations carried out while forcing the model for non uniform sediments to run as a model for uniform sediments i e assuming mixtures made of one single grain size revealed a perfect match with the model for us by campisano et al 2004 the solution of vector eq 1 allows evaluating flow e g water level flow discharge etc and sediment transport e g sediment discharges and fractions for each section of the channel at any time of the flush propagation process the root mean square deviation rmsd was used to evaluate the model performance as shown by the literature hyndman and koehler 2006 compared to other metrics the use of this metric allows consistent comparison of the results of the two models with the same set of experimental observations providing also a dimensional measure of the deviation 2 2 2 numerical scheme the hyperbolic system represented by vector eq 1 is solved by using the predictor corrector numerical scheme of mac cormack mac cormack 1969 the scheme is explicit with a second order accuracy both in space and time and is shock capturing i e it is able to interpret discontinuities in flow and water level generated by rapidly varied flow conditions in open channels in the prediction step the predicted value of vector u is calculated based on the vectors of flux f u and source term d u evaluated on the basis of the values of the flow variables at the previous time step as follows 15 u i p r e d u i j δ t f i p r e d f i 1 j δ x d i j where δx and δt are spatial and temporal steps respectively i and j represent the grid node in space and time respectively and superscript pred refers to the predicted values of the variables the flux derivatives are calculated backwards in the correction step f u and d u are evaluated based on the predicted values and flux derivatives are calculated forwards as follows 16 u i c o r r u i j δ t f i 1 p r e d f i p r e d δ x d i p r e d where superscript corr indicates the corrected values of the variables finally the average of predicted and corrected values is used to estimate to new value of vector u at time j 1 as 17 u i j 1 u i p r e d u i c o r r 2 a complementary third step based on the dissipation theory of the total variation diminishing tvd is incorporated in the solution garcia navarro et al 1992 garcia navarro and saviron 1992 campisano et al 2014 to reduce solution oscillations generated in correspondence of high discontinuities of the flow variables the tvd step is applied to flow variables by adding the term δ t δ x s i 1 2 j s i 1 2 j to the term at the second member of eq 17 being vector s evaluated based on the eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix j u f u u as well as on the values of the flow variables at nodes i 1 2 and i 1 2 for complete details see garcia navarro et al 1992 although the model is not fully coupled i e dsv and exner equations are not solved simultaneously the adopted predictor corrector scheme enables a semi coupled solution of the vector eq 1 thus assuring very accurate results for relatively small values of the spatial step campisano et al 2004 the model requires initial conditions at t 0 of flow and sediment parameters to be provided as input boundary conditions for flow and sediment parameters at the upstream and downstream ends of the numerical domain i e at the channel inlet and outlet can be prescribed in the form of functions q t or a t for the flow as well as q s t or a s t for the sediment similar functions e g q h are defined as internal conditions at specific nodes of the domain to simulate the hydraulic of devices such as the flushing gate moreover the method of characteristics is used in the model to determine the values of eventual unknown variables not prescribed at the boundaries garcia navarro and saviron 1992 finally the courant friedrichs lewy condition is used to assure the stability of the scheme this means assuming values of the courant number smaller than the unity bhallamudi and chaudhry 1991 2 3 model implementation the application of the models for sm and us to the flush experiment carried out in paris sewer requested the preliminary setting of input parameters for the simulations most of the parameters used e g the geometrical characteristics of the channel were directly available from measurements obtained during the experimental campaign geometrical data provided as model input included the channel cross section dimensions and the trunk longitudinal slope through the measured elevation of the invert with a spatial step δx 1 m the selected spatial step was shown to provide a compromise between high accuracy of the results and limited computational burden of the simulations use of such δx for simulations with both models led to discretize the channel with a computational mesh of 1101 numerical sections first upstream section of the mesh corresponding to s 50 last downstream section corresponding to s 1050 all the simulations were run by adopting a courant number value of 0 8 other parameters were obtained indirectly by the available measurements for example eq 6 was used to estimate the strickler roughness coefficient of the channel walls k w based on measurements of undisturbed flow and water level recorded at the five monitoring sections in the days before the flush the results of the analysis provided an average value of k w 50 m1 3 s information obtained from the experiments was also used to prescribe initial and boundary conditions for simulations with the two models for sm and us in particular the hydraulic condition in the channel immediately before the flush release was considered as the initial condition for all the simulations the experimental measurements at the five monitoring sections immediately bf i e maximum stored water level behind the flushing gate equal to 2 15 m average water level value downstream of the gate close to 0 5 m were used to reconstruct the initial condition concerning water level profiles and flow discharges upstream and downstream of the gate on the basis of preliminary simulations under stationary conditions definition of the initial condition also included use of data related to the sediments in the channel average values of the measured sediment density 2317 kg m3 and porosity 0 41 were used as input for all the simulations with both models for sm and us moreover the total height of the deposits estimated on every δx on the basis of the measurements bf was prescribed as initial condition for the simulations carried out with the two models for the simulations with the model for sm the data input concerning the deposits was integrated with the information on the grain size composition of the sediment mixture at each section of the mesh in particular the grain size distributions of sediment samples collected during sampling bf were provided as input to the model for sm in order to describe the initial grain size distribution of both pavement and sub pavement layers to this aim the experimental sediment distributions were discretized into n 20 classes of increasing size in the range of diameters d k from 0 075 to 50 mm since the experimental information on the mixture grain size composition was available for only 20 sections throughout the whole channel length the data were linearly interpolated to estimate the initial bed grain size distribution for sections unprovided of measurements a consistency check between the estimated granulometric composition of the initial bed and the measured deposit heights was finally carried out at each channel section this check allowed avoiding for example inconsistent initial conditions characterized by deposit depths smaller than the d 90 of the local sediment mixture differently the model for uniform sediments was run sim 0 assuming the bed to be made of uniform sediments with size equal to the median diameter d 50 2 176 mm input data for the two models also included the flushing gate geometry as well as parameters describing the gate opening modalities at the initial stage of the flush release process e g opening speed v g weir crest elevation w c etc the gate was schematized numerically as an internal condition at section s0 i e 50 m downstream of the channel entrance s 50 the gate behavior during the flush release phase was simulated by implementing in the model a specific routine that combines use of the gate experimental outflow relationship q h w c as obtained from simultaneous measurements of water level h and flow discharge q at s 5 and s 5 respectively and of the experimental function w c t recorded by the gate limit switch sensors during the gate opening process the same boundary conditions were used for the two models the inflow hydrograph q t recorded during the experiment at the channel entrance s 50 was used to define the boundary condition at the upstream end of the computational domain moreover the uniform flow condition was prescribed at the downstream end section s 1050 end fall in case of supercritical flow oppositely the free outfall curve q h under critical flow was prescribed besides upstream boundary conditions for the sediment included prescribing the use of the sediment transport formulas eqs 11 and 13 to determine q s t as a function of local flow conditions determined by the inflow hydrograph instead the mass continuity equation was used to determine the value of the sediment height h s t at the downstream channel end finally average values estimated from the literature were adopted in the simulations with the model for sm for those parameters for which measurements were not available from the experiments i e the thickness of the pavement layer δ p the coefficient η m i n the exponent b of the hiding formula in particular the basic simulation sim 1 with the model for non uniform sediments sm was carried out assuming δ p 3 d 90 as suggested by armanini 1995 b 0 905 parker et al 1982 and η m i n 0 00125 as the average value of the range suggested by combes 1982 and reported in the previous section for the sake of completeness additional simulations were carried out to explore the impact of the variation of these parameters on the results of the model 3 results of the simulations 3 1 validation of the model hydrodynamics the values of flow discharge q and water level h as obtained by the simulations with the model for sm were compared with the experimental values recorded during the flush test at the five monitored sections fig 2 shows as an example the results sim 1 of the comparison for sections s 5 upstream the gate and s 5 and s 50 downstream the gate the figure shows the results concerning the first part of the flush duration 1 5 h from the beginning of the test for which experimental measurements are available the figure points out a very good agreement between the simulation results and the experiments with a relatively high model performance in reproducing the peak of the flow discharge at the beginning of the flush operation percent error equal to 2 7 and 3 9 for s 5 and s 5 respectively the experimental value of the peak flow at s 50 was not available also the flow recession phase is well captured by the model a slightly worse performance of the model is obtained for the water levels at the early beginning of the flush although the model demonstrates to correctly interpret both the abrupt decrease in h at s 5 from 2 15 m to about 1 5 m associated to the formation of the negative emptying wave and the corresponding rapid increase in h from about 0 5 m to about 1 5 m at s 5 and at s 50 as determined by the flush wave propagation downstream very similar model performance although not shown here was obtained at the other sections s 50 and s 100 a global outlook into model results is reported in table 1 the table shows the value of the rmsd between simulated and observed water level h for all the five experimental monitored sections the table also reports the analogous results sim 0 as obtained by using the model for us campisano et al 2004 interestingly the table points out relatively small differences between experiments and simulations slightly improved prediction performance of the model for sm with a maximum deviation of 0 042 m and 0 044 m at s 100 for the two models respectively further simulation results obtained with the two models and concerning the hydraulics of the process are shown in fig 3 in terms of values of the bed shear stress developed by the flush propagation along the channel fig 3a and b concern results obtained by the model for sm and the model for us respectively the results are presented as an example for channel sections s 5 upstream s 100 and s 500 downstream of the flushing gate as expected shear stress peaks are achieved at different times for the three sections depending on the distance from the gate device as well as on the geometry e g on the local longitudinal slope of the channel fig 3a shows that the model for sm provides a shear stress peak close to 13 n m2 to develop at s 100 after about 56 s from the flush start sim 1 the simulated shear stress is also observed to drop down to the initial local value of dry weather flow throughout the channel interestingly the model for us fig 3b provided significantly different values of the shear stress sim 0 as compared to the model for sm larger up to about 25 higher values of the peak shear stress were obtained for sections close to the gate s 5 and s 100 while smaller values down to about 12 less were obtained at downstream section s 500 this result would reveal an important impact of the way the transport processes at the water bed interface are modeled on the development of the shear stress 3 2 evolution of the sediment deposits at the end of the flush although the results of the simulations pointed out the transport models for sm and for us to have a relatively similar performance in the prediction of flow discharges and water levels large differences where observed between the two models in their ability to reproduce the evolution of the deposits af figs 4 and 5 show the results of the simulations concerning the sediment bed at the end of the flush as obtained with the two models respectively the comparison of the two figures shows that the model for sm sim 1 performs better than the model for us sim 0 in describing modifications induced by the flush on the mobile bed in particular the model for sm is observed to reproduce in a relatively good way the depths of the deposit both in the channel segments subject to deposition e g in the upstream portion of the channel up to section s 450 and to erosion e g segments s 500 s 650 s 750 s 850 and s 1000 s 1050 minor agreement between simulated and experimental sediment depths was obtained in the sub section immediately downstream of the gate between s0 and s 50 between s 150 and s 200 and between s 960 and s 975 where experimental peaks of sediment were not predicted properly conversely the model for us provides a worse prediction of the deposit profile af with general underestimation of deposit depths at the downstream channel end as well as overestimation of the sediment accumulated in the upstream segment see for example between s 30 s 100 analytical evaluation of the deviation of the two models from the experiments provided values of the rmsd equal to 0 031 m and 0 041 m for the models for sm sim 1 and for us sim 0 respectively table 2 the model for sm yielded reliable results also in terms of prediction potential of the flush cleaning efficiency in particular the results of the simulation sim 1 show see table 2 that the total amount of sediment removed by the flush from the channel segment downstream of the gate between s0 and s 1050 sums up to 4 32 m3 as difference between initial deposit v s bf 27 09 m3 and final deposit v s af 22 77 m3 the obtained value is relatively smaller relative error 18 3 than the value 5 29 m3 obtained by the field experiment shahsavari et al 2017 based on the simulation results about 2 35 m3 of the total removed sediment was transported as suspended load while the remaining 1 97 m3 as bed load comparatively table 2 shows that simulation sim 0 with the model for us returned a value of 3 52 m3 for the total volume of sediments removed by the flush thus highlighting a significant underestimation of the volume relative error 33 5 as compared to the experimental findings however the most interesting result of the simulation with the model for us is that the flush did not determine suspended sediment transport so that differently by the model for sm the whole amount of sediment was transported out of the channel only as bed load the model also reproduces in a relatively good way the volume of sediments that was removed for the different fractions of the mixture fig 6 shows for example the cumulative volume of sediments deposited in the channel af for the fractions of the mixture with d 0 9 mm 0 9 mm d 2 0 mm and 2 0 mm d 4 15 mm sim 1 for the sake of completeness the figure also reports the volume of sediments deposited bf consistently with previous results the figure shows the model to underestimate the volume of the deposits removed for the three sediment fractions about 6 19 7 and 0 1 for the three fractions respectively as compared with the experimental observations the black line is always over the grey line the flush had a significant impact also on the composition of the sediment mixture in terms of modification of the initial grain size distributions as highlighted by shahsavari et al 2017 based on the experiments the flush was observed to have a relatively modest scouring effect on the large size particles while determining a significant reduction in the finest fractions present in the mixture the results of the simulations with the model for sm allowed prediction of the evolution of the granulometric composition of the bed mixture throughout the whole channel in this regard fig 7 shows the value of the characteristic grain sizes d 16 d 50 and d 90 of the mixture af for all the sampling sections in the channel sim 1 the comparison between simulated continuous line and experimental dashed line results shows that the model is able to reproduce the effect of coarsening of the bed as determined by the flush the value of d 16 d 50 and d 90 af is generally larger than bf the figure shows that the model better predicts the effect of bed coarsening in the downstream part of the channel downstream of section s 550 moreover in general the model predicted better the final values of sizes d 50 and d 90 in the downstream part of the channel conversely larger discrepancies between simulated and observed values were obtained in the upstream part of the channel upstream of s 550 mainly for the larger fractional size d 90 3 3 impact of unmeasured parameters on the simulation results as already introduced in previous sections measurements acquired during the experimental campaign did not allow estimation of all the parameters needed for the simulations therefore the impact of the variation of the unknown parameters on the results of the model for sm was explored with additional simulations simulations mainly concerned the impact of different values of the velikanov coefficient η m i n as well as of the thickness of the pavement layer δ p on the erosional effect induced by the flush further simulations were also run to explore the effect on the results of the variation of the exponent b of the hiding formula eq 12 the output of the analysis for simulations of major interest is summarized in table 2 the table shows the results of the simulations obtained for the extreme values of the range of η m i n according to combes 1982 i e sim 2 for η m i n 0 0005 and sim 3 for η m i n 0 002 as expected the increase in the value of η m i n determines a corresponding increase in the volume removed as suspended transport and also as total removed sediment from 2 67 m3 for η m i n 0 0005 to 4 37 m3 for η m i n 0 002 moreover sensitivity of the model is shown for the thickness of the pavement layer sim 4 as expected the comparison with sim 1 shows that a thinner pavement layer δ p d 90 reduces the rate of sediment available for erosion and transport thus ending to decrease the total volume removed from the channel to about 4 08 m3 finally simulations were run to explore the impact of the hiding process table 2 summarizes the results of the simulation sim 5 run assuming b 0 that is neglecting the hiding effect in the model for sm the results show that the hiding effect during the flush is relatively modest although it modifies the relative proportion of channel bed load versus suspended load in particular comparison with results of sim 1 shows a decrease in the value of the bed load transport with a consequent increase in the suspended load transport thus determining a relatively limited impact on the total volume of sediment removed from the channel 4 34 m3 table 2 also reports the value of the rmsd for the depths of the sediment deposits as obtained for the different simulations globally the results summarized in the table show sim 3 and sim 5 to provide results that are comparable to the base run sim 1 in fact the two simulations provided a slight improvement in the estimation of the removed volume of sediments relative errors equal to 17 4 and 18 respectively on one hand but a bit larger value of the rmsd 0 033 and 0 032 respectively on the other hand in any case the analysis was aimed at evaluating the potential impact of the identified parameters on the results of the model while the selection of their values for detailed model calibration is out of the scope of this paper and is postponed to future research work 4 discussion the results of the simulations have shown advantages and limitations of using the model for sm in reproducing both the hydrodynamics and the sediment transport processes occurring during sewer flushes the comparison of the model for sm and the model for us has shown only modest differences between the two models for what concerns their capability to describe the hydraulics of the flush in terms of evolution of both flow discharge and water levels on time this would confirm findings by creaco and bertrand krajewski 2009 who already found a rather good representation of the hydrodynamics of the sewer flush with an approach based on the use of a model for uniform sediment transport conversely the different results provided by the models for sm and us in terms of bed shear stress reveal the impact of the different ability of the two models in describing the sediment transport processes occurring during the flush in agreement with the experimental observations the results of the simulations with the model for the transport of sm show that since the early stage of the flush release phase finer sediment fractions typically fractions smaller than the initial d 50 are eroded and transported in the channel as suspended load instead larger particles are mainly transported as bed load conversely the model for us is not structurally capable of simulating the selectivity of the sediment transport being the modelling approach limited to the use of the single sediment size d 50 as a result of this limitation in fact sim 0 did not provide occurrence of suspended load transport the ability of the model for sm in describing the selectivity of the sediment transport during the flush also has the further advantage of improving the description of the evolution of the bed roughness during the flush and as a result the spatial and temporal evolution of the shear stress in fact the model for sediment mixtures allows the step by step updating of the value of d 50 at each channel section based on the occurred variation of the grain size distribution of the local sediment mixture of the deposit the model simulations would confirm finer particles to be removed by the flush easier than the larger ones thus leading to the increase in the characteristic diameters of the mixture in the bed and as a result in the bed roughness k b conversely this effect cannot be reproduced by the model for us for which k b is independent on the sediment transport processes occurring at the water bed interface the evolution dynamics of the grain size composition of the deposit clearly explains the different values of shear stress provided by the two models during the flush in fact use of d 50 as obtained with the model for us determines larger initial values of k b in the channel thus providing as output generally higher initial bed shear stress peaks in comparison with the model for sm future developments could also include adding a model routine for the evaluation of the impact of bed forms in the deposits as these are expected to increase the bed roughness thus modifying flow shear stresses and consequent erosion although the results of the simulations point out the model for sm to perform significantly better than the model for us in describing the final bed deposits figs 4 and 5 show both models to provide some discrepancies in the results concerning the comparison between simulated and experimental sediment depths one reason of these differences for sections between s 150 and s 200 and between s 960 and s 975 may be due to the presence as observed during the experiments in that segments of rags mixed in the loose sediments that could have increased the sediment resistance to erosion shahsavari et al 2017 moreover although cohesion as well as other biological and age related sediment processes has been neglected in the simulations the presence of cohesive sediment fractions in the mixture despite the relatively low content may have potentially played a role in increasing the bed resistance to erosion this effect may have been of major relevance in the segment downstream of the gate where the maximum value of the organic content close to 7 was observed thus providing partial explanation of why the experimental deposit in this segment is backward with respect to the simulated one see figs 4 and 5 as shown in fig 7 the model for sm was not able to reproduce at the same way the coarsening of the bed for all the channel segments indeed although the bed coarsening effect is generally captured by the model in some sections the simulated results remain more close to the initial condition bf than to the final experimental condition af evidently this implies that the developed model may explain only partially the complex modalities of sediment erosion and transport occurred during the flush potential improvement may come from further modelling developments to take into account sediments of different density in addition use of different sediment transport formulas specifically developed for storm sewers for both bed load and suspended load transport may further enhance the predicting performance of the model moreover the relatively simplistic description of the channel geometry neglecting the presence of local singularities along the sewer may have played a role on this especially in correspondence of the channel segment close to s 250 as well as at the downstream end of the channel in this context the relatively small number of sediment sampling sections may also have represented one additional reason for not accurate description of the spatial distribution of the sediments along the channel in this context methods to include uncertainty of the sediment parameters may represent a step forward for model development the results of the simulation summarized in table 2 show the relatively high sensitivity of the model for sm to the used value of η m i n with a clear increase in the volume of sediment removed from the channel as the value of η m i n increases remarkably η m i n seems to play a role in the balance of suspended load bed load fractions of the sediments specifically for the smaller values of the parameter however simulations also reveal that most of the sediment available in the initial deposits bf and able to contribute to suspended load transport is already entrained into suspension with the smallest value of η m i n 0 0005 while the rest of the sediment is susceptible of bed load transport only this would mean only small marginal increase of suspended load transport with the adoption of increasing values of η m i n for the simulations in addition the relevant amount of sediment subtracted by the deposit and transported as suspended load provides a reduction of the grain size range of the bed sediment thus ending to reduce the effects of hiding irrespectively of the value of exponent b of the hiding formula comparison between sim 1 and sim 5 in table 2 in this regard a general limitation of the current model for sm is the lack of an appropriate routine to describe re deposition of suspended sediments although this process was observed to play a marginal role during the flush test in the analysed channel shahsavari et al 2017 however the authors think that a more detailed model for re deposition including suitable formulas for the evaluation of the velocity at limit of deposition e g novak and nalluri 1975 najafzadeh and bonakdari 2016 could be a key to improve the prediction of the peaks of the sediment deposits in the downstream part of the channel at the end of the flush conversely the role played by the thickness of the pavement layer seems to be significant in the results provided by the model the relatively relevant differences obtained for different values of δ p show an important limitation of model simulations in the absence of experimental information concerning this parameter thus potentially considering this parameter as a calibration parameter for the model 5 conclusions a novel model for the simulation of the transport of non cohesive mixtures of non uniform sediments sm induced by flushing in sewers was presented in this paper the model results were compared with the experimental observations of a field flush test carried out in a combined sewer channel of paris municipality sewer system main conclusions drawn from the analysis of the results of the simulations include the following points the model for sm is able to describe accurately the hydrodynamics of the flush propagation in the channel in terms of time evolution of both flow discharges and water levels the results are consistent also with those obtained by a previous model for the simulation of the transport of uniform sediments us the proposed model for sm provides a suitable description of the selective transport of non cohesive sandy gravel sediments deposited on the bottom of the experimental sewer channel with fine and large sediments being transported as suspended and bed load transport respectively compared to the model for us the model for sm allows describing the modification of the bed roughness thus the shear stress exerted on the bed due to the spatial and temporal evolution of the distribution of the sediment sizes in the deposits the comparison between the two models shows the model for sm to reproduce in a more accurate way the erosional effects of the flush in terms of both the deposit profile at the end of the flush experiment as well as the total volume of sediments flushed out of the channel the model for sm also allows evaluating the volume of sediment removed for each size fraction of the sediment mixture therefore the model may be usefully applied for the design and planning of sediment flushing operation in the analysed sewer channel the analysis of the results reveals a sensitiveness of the model for sm to the thickness of the sediment pavement initial layer as well as to the velikanov efficiency coefficient thus requiring a sensitivity analysis to be carried out in those cases of unfeasible estimation of these parameters from the field the obtained results pave the road to future prospects of model development including use of different formulas for sediment transport for evaluation of both bed and suspended load also other potential ways for model improvement may concern modelling of sediment cohesion and sediment density

18624,membrane distillation md has a great potential in treating high salinity industrial wastewater due to its unique characteristics nevertheless the implementation of md for industrial wastewater reclamation must be conducted with precaution because low surface tension contaminates in feed solutions may easily wet the membranes in recent years omniphobic membranes that exhibit strong repellence towards liquids with a wide range of surface tensions have been proposed as a promising solution to deal with the wetting problem in this paper we aim to provide a comprehensive review of omniphobic interfaces and illustrate their fundamental working principles innovative design approaches and novel applications on membrane distillation the review may provide insights in designing stable solid liquid vapor interfaces and serve as a guidance for the development of robust anti wetting membranes for industrial wastewater reclamation via membrane distillation graphical abstract

technology to reclaim various wastewater from a wide range of industries an et al 2016 calabro et al 1991 el abbassi et al 2013 hussain et al 2015 khaing et al 2010 mokhtar et al 2015 sivakumar et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 comparing to the traditional distillation processes md is modular and more space saving lawson and lloyd 1997 thanks to its special separation mechanism md has theoretically 100 rejections to non volatile compounds and produces extremely pure water that can meet the high quality standards of industries such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals drioli et al 2015 hilal et al 2011 lu et al 2016 it is also less affected by feed concentration and has a lower tendency to be fouled than conventional pressure driven membrane processes making it especially suitable for reclamation of high salinity wastewater such as concentrated reverse osmosis ro brine camacho et al 2013 deshmukh et al 2018 in addition it typically operates at mild temperatures of less than 90 c and pressures of atmospheric pressure or below which makes it possible to be powered by low grade energy sources such as solar energy or industrial waste heat this will significantly lower its energy cost and carbon footprint henderyckx 1967 in spite of various advantages the implementation of md for industrial wastewater reclamation must be conducted with precaution because contaminates in feed solutions may cause membrane wetting rezaei et al 2018 wetting occurs when liquid penetrates into membrane pores it could lead to a reduction of flux a drop of energy efficiency and a loss of rejection thus wetting should be avoided in md applications at all times the wetting phenomenon is closely related to the feed composition which varies significantly in different industries gryta 2005 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 for example when reclaiming high salinity brines inorganic salt crystals precipitated from concentrated brines may grow on membrane surface reduce its surface hydrophobicity and eventually cause membrane wetting surfactant adsorption is a major origin of wetting in treating shale gas wastewater trace amounts of oil and grease in wastewater from petrochemical plants may attach to the hydrophobic membrane and cause pore wetting and blockage wastewater from pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries contains solvents and acids that lower the surface tensions of feed solutions and lead to membrane wetting gryta 2005 israelachvili 2011 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 on the other hand in many cases various types of foulants may co exist and act synergistically to accelerate the membrane wetting designing an omniphobic membrane that remains unwetted when dealing with complex feed solutions is a potential solution to improve the antiwetting properties of md membranes salimi 2019 siyal et al 2019 omni means all thus the omniphobic md membrane should repel both high and low surface tension liquids the omniphobic surface has been found in nature species springtail is able to breathe through its cuticle surface even when it is immersed in water oil and other liquids boban et al 2018 hensel et al 2016 2014 2013 kota et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 when they are immersed under liquids a protective air layer called plastron will be formed and serve as a gas reservoir to enable regular gas exchange studies show that the omniphobic nature of the springtail s cuticle surface is attributed to its hierarchical re entrant structure and the layer of low surface energy lipids hensel et al 2016 2014 inspired by springtails several successful designs of omniphobic surfaces have recently been reported by hensel et al domingues et al tsujii et al tuteja et al and zhu et al domingues et al 2018 hensel et al 2014 tsujii et al 1997 tuteja et al 2007 2008a 2008b zhu et al 2017 the concept of omniphobicity has also attracted increasing attention from membrane researchers and several pioneering attempts have been done to

et al 2018b woo et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2018 in this paper we would like to present a comprehensive review of omniphobic membranes for membrane distillation to begin with fundamental knowledge of wetting on a textured surface and important design parameters for omniphobic surfaces will be discussed subsequently cutting edge and inspiring technologies to fabricate omniphobic surfaces will be elaborated the review will then focus on innovative designs of omniphobic membranes and their successful applications in membrane distillation we hope this review can provide guidance and inspirations to those interested readers who are keen to develop robust md membranes with exceptional wetting resistance 2 design an omniphobic surface 2 1 fundamentals of wetting on a textured surface the wettability of a textured surface is often quantified in terms of the apparent or measured contact angle θ fig 1 of a liquid droplet on the surface different from the equilibrium contact angle θ fig 2 that is an intrinsic property of a solid vapor liquid interface θ is significantly influenced by the texture of the solid surface two distinct models developed by wenzel 1936 and cassie and baxter 1944 are commonly applied to predict the effects of roughness r i e the ratio of the actual solid surface area to the projected area on the measured contact angle the wenzel state shown in fig 1a corresponds to a complete wetting state it is widely adopted to describe the liquid membrane interface in applications such as ro where a liquid transports through membrane pores in a wenzel model roughness increases the area of the composite interface thus it amplifies the effects of the intrinsic hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity 1 c o s θ r c o s θ in a cassie baxter state as shown in fig 1b a liquid droplet is retained on top of a solid vapor liquid interface the non wetting nature of the rough surface is caused by microscopic air pockets trapped below the liquid phase the apparent contact angle in a cassie baxter mode is calculated by the following equations 2 c o s θ f s c o s θ f g c o s θ g where f s and f g are the areas of solid liquid and gas liquid interfaces on a projected area of unity respectively for a surface with a morphology as shown fig 1b f s f g 1 θ and θ g are equilibrium contact angles of the liquid droplet on solid and gas respectively due to the low adhesion between gas and liquid molecules θ g is often approximated as 180 thus equation 2 can be simplified to the following form 3 c o s θ 1 f s 1 c o s θ the transition between wenzel and cassie states is possible and the threshold equilibrium contact angle θ c for this transition can be obtained by equating equations 1 and 3 4 c o s θ c f s 1 r f s since f s 1 r θ c should be greater than 90 for the transition from the wenzel state to the cassie baxter state to occur this highlights the difficulty to form a stable cassie baxter state especially for liquids with low surface tensions such as alcohols and alkanes because it is nearly impossible for such liquids to achieve equilibrium contact angles over 90 on almost all the solids however studies on superhydrophobic leaves in nature suggest that unexpectedly high non wetting states can still be achieved even when the leaves are slightly hydrophilic cheng and rodak 2010 previous studies reveal that such phenomena origin from the re entrant surface texture which facilitates the formation of a composite interface a re entrant structure refers to a concave topography in which the cross sectional solid area decreases from the top to the bottom wang et al 2018 fig 2a and b illustrate possible liquid vapor solid interfaces on pointed and re entrant structures respectively despite the same equilibrium contact angles θ in both cases the net tractions on the interfaces point in different directions the net traction is resulted from surface tension the direction of the surface tension is tangential to the liquid vapor l v interface marchand et al 2012 and pointing towards the convex phase to minimize the l v contact surface area sophocleous 2010 therefore once the contact angle is plotted the direction of the net traction can be easily derived as shown in fig 2a if the equilibrium contact angle is smaller than the local texture angle φ the net traction on the composite interface is pointing downwards exerting a pressure on the trapped air pocket and promoting imbibition of the liquid by contrast the net traction points away from the solid for a re entrant textured surface with φ θ which can effectively prevent wetting chen et al 2018a chhatre et al 2010 tuteja et al 2008a besides creating re entrant textures one can also improve the anti wetting property by lowering the solid surface energy a lower solid surface energy can reduce the attraction between liquid and solid surfaces and increase the equilibrium contact angle lu et al 2018b tuteja et al 2008a 2 2 important design parameters two design parameters are important in engineering omniphobic surfaces namely the apparent contact angle θ and the robustness factor a the former is the most straightforward and widely applied parameter to measure the surface wettability a small θ 90 corresponds to a hydrophilic surface with high wettability while a large θ 90 indicates a hydrophobic surface with a good anti wetting property a surface with an exceptionally high θ 150 is called a superhydrophobic surface which is desirable in membrane distillation a is a dimensionless factor to assess the stability of a solid liquid vapor interface as mentioned in the preceding discussions the value of θ depends highly on the surface geometrical factors and surface chemistry as shown in equation 2 for surfaces with different textures equation 2 can be rewritten as different forms for example equation 3 is a simplified cassie baxter model for flat topped pillars as shown in fig 1b however it is not applicable to re entrant structures where the sum of f s and f g does not equal to one fig 3 a shows a diagram of a composite interface on cylindrical fibers such texture is a typical re entrant structure found on woven nonwoven mesh and electrospun membranes for an area a with a unit axial length f s and f g can be calculated as follows 5 a 2 r 2 d 6 f s r 2 π 2 θ a 7 f g a 2 r s i n θ a where r is the radius of the fiber and 2 d is the distance between the two fibers let us define the dimensionless space ratio d r d r then the cassie baxter equation can be rewritten as chhatre et al 2010 8 c o s θ 1 1 d π θ c o s θ s i n θ the effects of dimensionless space ratio d radius of the surface texture r distance between surface texture 2 d and equilibrium contact angle θ on the value of apparent contact angle θ have been studied both mathematically and experimentally by chhatre et al 2010 in their study contact angle measurements of a series of liquids were performed on a set of wire mesh surfaces which could provide systematically quantifiable cylindrical textures θ was manipulated by dip coating the meshes using materials with different surface energies the experimental results show that θ is indeed determined by θ and d as predicted by equation 8 a larger θ and or a greater d lead to a larger apparent contact angle and vice versa individual structure parameters namely r and d affect θ synergistically in other words the apparent contact angles are unaffected by the changes in r or d as long as the resultant d remains constant though equation 8 can accurately predict the apparent contact angle on a cylindrically textured surface it can be only used when a cassie baxter state is assured unfortunately a cassie baxter state is thermodynamically metastable tuteja et al 2007 2008a as illustrated in fig 3b a transition to the wenzel state is possible when the sagging height h 1 reaches the maximum height h 2 under the laplace pressure or an externally applied pressure tuteja et al 2008a to quantify the tendency to resist the sagging of the composite interface chhatre et al proposed a dimensionless robustness factor a for the cylindrical texture chhatre et al 2010 9 a l c a p r d 1 1 c o s θ d 1 2 s i n θ where l c a p is the capillary length defined as l c a p γ l v ρ g where γ l v and ρ g are the surface tension and specific weight of the liquid respectively a 1 is preferred in order to obtain a robust solid liquid vapor interface as reported by chhatre et al the robustness factor is inversely proportional to the radius of the surface texture r even at a constant space ratio d a larger a is obtained on a fine mesh compared to that on a coarse mesh similarly the composite interface becomes less stable when the space ratio factor d increases in addition to the scales of the texture the robustness of the composite interface also depends on the equilibrium contact angle θ the value of a increases monotonically with an increase in θ in reality most of the surfaces such as nonwoven or electrospun nanofiber surfaces are not perfect cylindrically textured surfaces thus the quantitative analysis may not be suitable unless the effects of varying topographical and surface properties are considered nevertheless the preceding equations and discussions still provide valuable insights to the design of omniphobic surfaces the importance of the re entrant structure and the low surface energy has been echoed in novel fabrication technologies to be presented in the subsequent sections 2 3 novel fabrication methods of omniphobic surfaces ever since the mechanism of the omniphobic surface was revealed scientists have tried various types of methods to engineer similar surfaces with remarkable repellences towards low surface tension liquids these different fabrication approaches are summarized in table 1 the most typical strategy is the simultaneous incorporation of low surface energy chemistry and topographic features as illustrated in the preceding discussions instructed by this strategy several omniphobic surfaces have been successfully developed tuteja et al synthesized a series of omniphobic electrospun surfaces by incorporating fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane fluoroposs into polymethyl methacrylate pmma solutions the addition of fluoroposs not only reduced the surface energy but also facilitated the formation of a re entrant beads on string structure as shown in fig 4 a tuteja et al 2008a 2008b in addition to this method they also obtained omniphobic micro hoodoo structure fig 4b on flat silicon si wafers by a silicon dioxide sio2 deposition followed by a reactive ion etching of sio2 and a subsequent isotropic etching of si via vapor phase xenon difluoride xef2 kota et al 2014 tuteja et al 2007 a surface with a special texture that shows great similarity to the micro hoodoo structure was developed by tan et al via metal organic framework mof self assembly tan et al 2013 they referred the texture as micromushrooms fig 5 they first grew an array of nh2 mil 53 al microneedles to an anodic aluminum oxide membrane next the hydrophobicity of the microneedles was improved by reacting it with perfluorooctanoyl chloride pfo cl the modified membrane was then gently placed into an aqueous precursor solution due to the superhydrophobic nature of the membrane it remained afloat on the solution surface and the precursor solution would not contact with the microneedles except at their tips as a result mushroom like caps were formed on the needle stems through epitaxial mof growth after the surface energy of the mushroom caps was lowered with pfo cl the resultant surface showed omniphobicity as reflected by a remarkable contact angle of 100 with n hexadecane hensel et al adapted a nanoimprint lithography scheme to design delicate re entrant morphologies with a high resolution of a few tens of nanometers they first applied precursor solutions to the springtails followed by uv irradiation the cured elastomeric mold was then gently peeled off and used as a pre patterned mold for a subsequent casting with the aid of this technology the skin structure of tetrodontophora bielanensis a european giant springtail was translated into polymer replicas the surface energy of the textured polymer was then lowered by teflon af coating hensel et al 2013 hensel et al have also successfully fabricated an omniphobic membrane via a multi step reverse imprint lithography hensel et al 2014 as depicted in fig 6 a two tier silicon master mold was fabricated first as a template for feature replication subsequently a perfluoropolyether dimethacrylate pfpedma template was cast from the silicon mater using a reverse imprint lithography approach finally a poly ethylene glycol dimethacrylate pegdma polymer membrane was cast from the pfpedma template by the doctor blade technique the resultant membrane exhibited overhang structures that resembled the textures of the springtail cuticle surface in a recent study zhu et al developed well defined porous omniphobic membranes via microfluidic emulsion templating zhu et al 2017 a highly uniform emulsion of silicone oil droplets in a polyvinyl alcohol pva aqueous solution was prepared using a capillary microfluidic device and then deposited onto a glass substrate due to the different physicochemical natures of the oil and the aqueous solution the oil droplets floated to the air water interface and created a close packed hexagonal monolayer array as water evaporated pva solidified into dense packed honeycomb structures and the spherical oil droplets gradually deformed into re entrant monolayer structures when the oil droplets were removed a pva membrane with a layer of well defined re entrant microstructures were formed their study presents an innovative and scalable method that can precisely control the structural topographies however the resultant pore sizes of the membranes are of tens of micrometers further investigation on how to control the pore size is important in order to adopt the technology for md membrane fabrication atomic layer deposition ald is another emerging technology to fabricate omniphobic or amphiphobic nanocoatings it allows the precise control of atomic layer deposition by applying sequential surface reactions feng et al applied ald to coat a uniform layer of zno nanoparticles onto a porous polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe matrix to enhance the roughness and subsequently grafted 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyl acrylate pfdae on zno via plasma treatment feng et al 2016 the resultant membrane exhibited excellent water and oil contact angle of 150 and 125 and showed exceptional fouling resistance to organic aerosol deposition very recently sorvali et al reported a stepwise fabrication process of a multilayered superomniphobic coating via the combination of liquid flame spray ald and fluorosilane sorvali et al 2018 a tio2 nanoparticle bottom layer an interstitial al2o3 nanofilm and a top fluorosilane layer were applied in sequence the resultant composite surface had an ultrathin layer of about 70 nm and it exhibited remarkable contact angles 150 and extremely low sliding angles 10 for water diiodomethane and ethylene glycol eg sorvali et al 2018 srinivasarao et al proposed a facile method to engineer interconnected re entrant structures based on breath figures srinivasarao et al 2001 the breath figure refers to the fog created by exhaling onto a cold surface and it is able to create micro and nanoscale periodic structures bunz 2006 to form ordered air bubbles at a membrane surface a diluent of polystyrene in a volatile solvent was cast on a glass slide in the presence of moist air flowing across the membrane surface evaporative cooling led to the formation of water droplets on the liquid surface the condensed droplets arranged into an ordered array and sunk to the polymer solution after the removal of the solvent and water droplet a porous membrane with re entrant interconnected nanostructures was formed although the omniphobicity of the membrane has not been reported the method is worthy to be included in this section as a facile and potential technology to create mechanically robust omniphobic surfaces other than the above mentioned technologies to fabricate omniphobic surfaces by creating re entrant textures followed by lowering the surface energy another strategy that involves designing a smooth liquid infused porous surfaces slips which are liquid like has also been reported the advantage of this strategy is that re entrant topographic features which are usually fragile and challenging to fabricate are no longer required in addition slips do not involve pressure dependent metastable states instead a dynamic liquid liquid vapor contact line is formed by immobilizing perfluorinated fluid lubricants on micro patterned or nano textured substrates which leads to superior self cleaning anti icing and self healing properties ma et al 2013 wong et al 2011 however the requirement of a mobile liquid which is immiscible to the contact liquid makes it unsuitable in the md applications some researchers also proposed to coat a layer of covalently attached liquids by grafting flexible materials on to the substrates unfortunately the feasibility of adopting this strategy in membrane distillation has not been explored yet due to the complexity and low permeability of the coating layer cheng et al 2012 wang and mccarthy 2016 3 omniphobic modifications for membrane distillation omniphobic membranes which have been developed for robust membrane distillation will be summarized in this section depending on the types of supporting materials they can be divided into three major categories namely inorganic membranes phase inversed polymeric membranes and electrospun nanofiber membranes tables 2 4 list and compare the works according to these three categories respectively the tables contain short summaries of modification methods assessments of omniphobicity md configurations feed compositions operating temperatures fluxes of pristine flux c and coated membranes flux o as well as test durations 3 1 inorganic membranes lin et al developed the first omniphobic membrane for membrane distillation by modifying glass fiber membranes with silica nanoparticles sinps followed by surface fluorination and polymer coating lin et al 2014 a five step modification procedure was employed to grow sinps firmly on the glass fibers and to lower the surface energy using fluorinated alkyl silane fas fig 7 compares their morphology before and after the modification the modified membrane exhibited larger contact angles towards not only water but also low surface tension organic solvents than a commercial ptfe membrane both the omniphobic and ptfe membranes were tested in the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd experiments using feed solutions containing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and the former exhibited a much more stable performance than the latter cheng et al developed omniphobic membranes for md by depositing zinc oxide zno on glass fiber membranes using a chemical deposition method followed by surface fluorination and a polymer coating to lower the surface energy chen et al 2018b the resultant membrane showed remarkable contact angles of 152 8 1 1 and 110 3 1 9 towards water and ethanol respectively the dcmd tests using feeds containing 0 3 mm sds also proved the enhanced stability after the omniphobic coating cheng et al also fabricated omniphobic alumina hollow fiber membranes by depositing zno nanorods and nanoparticles on the membranes followed by surface fluorination using 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilan fas 17 chen et al 2018a they found that both nanostructures enhanced the membrane omniphobicity due to the higher roughness but the membrane coated with nanoparticles was more anti wetting than that coated with nanorods unlike nanoparticles nanorods do not have re entrant structures a concave composite interface is formed and the surface tension force is pointing downwards as illustrated in fig 8 as a result the composite interface formed on nanorod strucutres is less stable compared to that on nanoparticles where the upturned net traction can effectively prevent the wetting to occur 3 2 phase inversed polymeric membranes polymeric membranes that are fabricated via phase inversion method are commonly used in md applications surface modifications of such membranes in order to improve their wetting resistance remain a hot topic polymeric membranes can be formed into different configurations such flat sheet and hollow fiber generally speaking decorating flat sheet membranes is relatively easier comparing to modifying hollow fibers because the former possess a smaller curvature than the latter thus quite a few studies have reported successful omniphobic modifications on flat sheet md membranes boo et al have performed an omniphobic coating on a commercial pvdf flat sheet membrane by sinp deposition followed by perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane fdts coating via vapor phase silanization boo et al 2016a for readers information the pristine pvdf membrane was firstly modified by electropositive 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes so that negatively charged sinps could attach onto the membrane surface via electrostatic interaction as illustrated in the upper right of fig 9 the mechanical and chemical durability of the sinp and fdts coating were assessed by subjecting the omniphobic membranes to harsh physical i e bath sonication for 20 min and chemical i e ph 2 ph 12 or 1 0 m nacl conditions surface micrographs and contact angle data taken after the durability tests showed no obvious difference compared with the original omniphobic membrane the wetting resistances of the pristine and omniphobic membranes were examined in dcmd tests using 1 sds 2 mineral oil added feed solutions and 3 pre filtered real shale gas produced water in all cases the omniphobic membranes showed significantly more stable performance than the unmodified ones indicating their great potential in treating low surface tension industrial wastewater recently li et al proposed another approach where trimesoyl chloride tmc was employed as a bridge for binding sinps onto the pvdf surface via chemical interaction li et al 2019 fig 9 also elucidates this approach li et al claimed that sinps deposition via chemical bounding was more robust than that via electrostatic interaction and membranes prepared using the former method showed more stable performances in both impact abrasive tests and long term dcmd tests of 120 h besides the preceding methods woo et al recently reported a six step layer by layer lbl assembly method to fabricate omniphobic membranes negatively charged silica aerogel and 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane were attached on a pvdf flat sheet membrane successively using positively charged poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride as a interconnecting material woo et al 2018 the modified membrane showed a remarkable water contact angle of 177 0 0 4 and a sliding angle of 1 1 0 3 indicating its superhydrophobic and low hysteresis nature the resultant membrane also exhibited extremely high contact angles towards low surface tension liquids including eg mineral oil and methanol air gap membrane distillation agmd performances of the pristine and modified membranes were tested using 1 real ro brine from the produced water of coal seam gas csg and 2 csg ro brine with a gradual addition of sds or humid acid as feed solutions even though the omniphobic membrane obtained a relatively lower flux it gained a more stable performance and a better rejection than the unmodified one the superior omniphobicity is attributed to the low surface tension coating and the formation of the hierarchical rough surface in addition to the improvement in omniphobicity the mechanical and thermal stability of the membrane have also been enhanced after the lbl assembly due to the strong adhesion between the assembled layers and the host polymer support rather than employing monosized nanoparticles to create re entrant structures zheng et al reported an omniphobic membrane with multi level re entrant structures zheng et al 2018 multiscale microspheres were fabricated based on electrostatic interaction between electronegative sinps and electropositive polystyrene ps microspheres then they were deposited onto a commercial pvdf porous substrate via spray coating a chemical binding agent was utilized to enhance the adhesion between the microspheres and the pvdf support finally the surface was fluorinated using fas17 to reduce the surface energy the resultant membrane exhibited outstanding water hexadecane contact angles of 176 138 4 and a water sliding angle of 7 in the dcmd tests using a sds stabilized hexadecane emulsion as the challenging feed solution the omniphobic membrane showed an extremely stable flux and an outstanding rejection in contrast to other benchmark membranes apart from the above mentioned omniphobic md membranes developed on flat sheet polymeric substrates lu et al have successfully developed omniphobic hollow fiber membranes via silica nanoparticle deposition followed by teflon af 2400 coating lu et al 2018b interestingly the surface energy of the resultant fibers became much lower by dipping the original fibers in a very dilute teflon af 2400 coating solution 0 025 wt for a short coating time of 30 s lu et al 2018b lu et al 2016 by applying such coating conditions the surface energy was altered but the surface morphology had minimal changes as shown in fig 10 therefore the effects of low surface energy and re entrant structure could be investigated separately contact angle results showed that both teflon af 2400 coating and omniphobic coating i e sinps deposition followed by teflon af 2400 coating can improve the repellence of membranes towards various types of liquids but the effects of the latter is much more obvious this observation highlights the significance of the re entrant structure to enhance surface omniphobicity in addition they also investigated the effects of nanoparticle size on surface omniphobicity by depositing sinps with different sizes as shown in fig 10 vacuum membrane distillation vmd tests demonstrated the exceptional wetting resistance of the membrane coated by 60 nm sinps as compared to membranes coated with larger sinps indicating that small nanoparticles are preferred in order to form a robust cassie baxter state 3 3 electrospun nanofiber membranes electrospinning has been demonstrated as an effective method in fabricating omniphobic surfaces ma et al 2005 lee et al 2016b tuteja et al 2008a 2007 a well designed electrospun fibrous structure provides an ideal substrate for developing omniphobic membranes as the bottom half of the electrospun fibrous network itself constitutes a re entrant structure tuteja et al 2008a wang et al 2016 however the re entrant structure alone is a necessary but not sufficient condition for surface omniphobicity in most cases post modification methods including lowering surface energy and increasing level of the re entrant structure are needed to impart omniphobic characteristics onto the electrospun fibrous substrates a cf4 plasma treatment has been demonstrated as an effective method to improve surface hydrophobicity without sacrificing water flux of md membranes yang et al 2015 2014 the increase in hydrophobicity arises from 1 suitable etching that enhances surface roughness and 2 introduction of fluorine functional groups that reduces surface energy of membrane materials wei et al 2012 woo et al have developed an omniphobic membrane via the combination of electrospinning and cf4 plasma treatment woo et al 2017 in this study they treated the hot pressed nanofiber membranes by cf4 plasma and successfully reduced the surface energy by forming new cf2 cf2 and cf3 bonds at the optimal condition of 15 min cf4 plasma treatment the water contact angle increased from 133 6 to 160 6 indicating a great improvement in hydrophobicity the resultant membrane displayed omniphobic property with a wide range of low surface tension liquids including methanol mineral oil and eg due to such excellent repellency the cf4 plasma treated md membrane demonstrated a high potential in treating feed solutions containing low surface tension substances besides the hydrophobic plasma treatment the addition of fluoroposs in the electrospinning dope solution has also been reported as a facile method to fabricate omniphobic nanofibrous membranes lu et al 2018a the addition of fluoroposs in electrospinning dopes did not change the morphology of nanofibers with regard to roughness or diameter but only increased the f c ratio from 1 17 to 1 40 which indicated an increase in hydrophobicity the obtained fluoroposs based omniphobic membrane successfully resisted surfactant induced wetting in md operations constructing a hierarchical re entrant structure typically refers a finer length scale re entrant texture on an underlying coarser one is an alternative method to impart the omniphobic property onto membrane surfaces by trapping air in multi level textures a hierarchical re entrant structure decreases the solid liquid contact area therefore enhancing wetting resistance toward low surface tension substances kota et al 2013 2012 decorating the primary nanofibrous structure with spherical nanoparticles can effectively alter surface roughness and increase level of the re entrant structure silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles are commonly used to create hierarchical structures lin et al 2014 razmjou et al 2012 lee et al successfully attached negatively charged sinps on a positively charged nanofiber membrane via a simple dip coating lee et al 2016b cationic surfactant benzyltriethylammonium chloride bteac was added into the dope solution to render positive charged nanofibers which facilitated the attachment of sinps the first level of re entrant structure was endowed by the nanofibrous network and the deposition of sinps introduced the secondary re entrant structure hydroxyl groups on sinps provided a platform for subsequent fluoroalkylsilanization to further reduce the surface energy of the membrane the resultant membrane not only displayed high water contact angles with low surface tension liquids in air but also delivered stable md performance with hypersaline feed solutions containing surfactants more recently a simpler method that combines the construction of hierarchical structure and fluorination into one step has been reported deng et al 2018 after electrospinning the electrospun pvdf nanofiber membranes were immediately immersed in fluorododecyltrichlorosilane ftcs solutions of different concentrations 0 5 wt 2 wt and 3 5 wt in order to obtain omniphobicity compared to other coating conditions the membrane treated with a 2 wt ftcs solution not only displayed high repellency to low surface tension liquids without an expense of membrane porosity but also stable dcmd performance when treating a surfactant contained feed solution the omniphobicity was contributed by three factors 1 the hierarchical re entrant structure provided by pvdf nanofibers 2 the polymerized fluorododecyltrichlorosilane pftcs buds on nanofiber surface fig 11 and 3 the extremely low surface energy of pftcs 4 anti wetting and anti fouling properties of omniphobic membranes improving anti wetting properties is one of the ultimate incentives of developing omniphobic membranes for membrane distillation previous discussions demonstrate that wetting resistance towards a wide range of liquids can be effectively enhanced by omniphobic modifications as evidenced by the increased liquid contact angles and stable md performances using surfactant contained feed solutions boo et al 2016a 2016b chen et al 2018a 2018b deng et al 2018 huang et al 2017 kadi et al 2019 lee et al 2016a b li et al 2019 lin et al 2014 lu et al 2018b woo et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2018 in addition to membrane wetting membrane fouling is another issue that largely impedes the industrialization of md based on foulant types membrane fouling in md systems can be classified into three categories 1 inorganic fouling 2 organic fouling and 3 biological fouling tijing et al 2015 during md operations various foulants in feed solutions accumulate on membrane surfaces and inside membrane pores resulting in blockage of membrane pores and degradation of vapor flux although omniphobic membranes have been proposed as a fouling mitigation strategy for md studies on anti fouling performance of omniphobic membranes up today mainly focus on organic foulants such as humic acid woo et al 2018 and oils boo et al 2016a wang and lin 2017 zheng et al 2018 a less progress has been made on fouling resistance towards inorganic and biological fouling an omniphobic membrane with a hierarchical re entrant structure has been developed through a layer by layer lbl assembly technique as described in section 3 2 woo et al 2018 to test the fouling resistance this omniphobic composite membrane was utilized to treat a feed solution containing 20 mg l humic acid it remained uncontaminated even after a 72 h operation under agmd which could not be achieved by the neat pvdf membrane since the omniphobic membrane had a higher zeta potential compared to the neat pvdf the strong electric repulsion was considered as the origin of its anti fouling property it was expected that omniphobic membranes could resist oil fouling in md applications due to their in air oleophobicity which has been reported in many literature kota et al 2013 tuteja et al 2008a however the situation is much more complicated in practical md operations zheng et al found that the omniphoibic membrane with a hierarchical re entrant structure displayed a better fouling resistance than pristine pvdf fas17 coated pvdf and single level re entrant structured pvdf membranes zheng et al 2018 their omniphobic membrane showed an extremely low sliding angle with a water hexadecane emulsion indicating high resistance towards low surface tension foulants owing to this super repellency neither apparent flux decline nor permeate conductivity increase was observed when it was challenged with a hexadecane emulsion feed solution stabilized with sds after the dcmd test the omniphobic membrane still showed a high water contact angle of 168 3 which meant it remained uncontaminated during the md operation a similar result was reported by elimelech and his group boo et al 2016a whose omniphobic membrane was able to treat shale gas waste water containing both mineral oil and surfactant without the occurrence of wetting or fouling phenomenon in the above two studies omniphobic membranes have demonstrated superior anti oil fouling properties against water oil emulsions that were stabilized with surfactants a similar observation was reported by wang and lin 2017 their omniphobic membrane also exhibited no fouling or wetting when a water oil emulsion was stabilized by 100 mm triton x 100 they found that the presence of surfactants played a critical role since amphiphilic surfactants consisted of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups the hydrophobic groups of surfactants in the presence of oil would attach on the oil water interface thus the hydrophilic groups would be exposed and the oil droplets wrapped with surfactant molecules became hydrophilic this reduces the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between oil and membrane surface however when treating a feed solution containing only crude oil without being stabilized by surfactants omniphobic membranes were found to be fouled even though they displayed non zero contact angles for oil both in air and underwater this could be ascribed to the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between oil droplets and the low surface energy coating of the omniphobic membrane fig 12 this hypothesis was further proven by the reduced adhesion force between oil and composite membranes consisting of hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic top layer in other words omniphobic membranes made from low surface energy materials were in fact underwater oleophilic the re entrant morphology on membrane surface could only prevent the penetration of oil droplets into membrane pores but not oil fouling on membrane surface to control oil fouling on membrane surface hydrophilic surface modification is regarded as a widely used strategy it is well known that in contact with water hydrophilic functional groups on membrane surface would form hydrogen bonds with water molecules creating a hydration layer on membrane surface chen et al 2010 wang et al 2018 li et al 2014 for oil droplets to attach on and spread over a hydrophilic surface energy is required to destroy the hydration layer on the surface therefore the formed hydration layer serves as an energy barrier that is unfavorable for the oil attachment devi et al 2005 howarter and youngblood 2009 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 inspired by this principle huang et al developed a janus membrane comprising of an omniphobic substrate and a hydrophilic top layer which exhibited both anti wetting and anti fouling properties huang et al 2017 the omniphobic substrate was fabricated by electrospinning of a blend of poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and followed deposition of fluorinated sinps then a hydrophilic layer was developed by spraying a mixture of perfluorooctanoate chitosan and sinps on the omniphobic substrate when treating an oil in water emulsion as the feed solution the resultant janus membrane exhibited underwater oleophobicity and provided a stable dcmd performance for 10 h without a loss of permeate flux or salt rejection 5 future studies omniphobic membranes have demonstrated great potential in reclaiming water from feed solutions containing low surface tension materials despite of the above mentioned recent advances significant improvements on existing synthesis and characterization methods should be made to expedite the commercialization of omniphobic md membranes to apply omniphobic membranes on a large industrial scale facile and cost effective fabrication strategies that produce mechanically stable omniphobic coatings should be developed unfortunately many of existing methods involve complex and time consuming modification steps especially in modifying inorganic and phase inversed polymeric membranes for example some approaches take hours or ever days to complete the omniphobic coating some strategies require harsh reaction conditions and hazardous reagents such as concentrated alkaline solutions at high temperatures more facile and greener strategies must be invented in order to fabricate omniphobic membranes on a larger scale in addition most of the reported strategies deposit multilevel micro nanoparticles on the membrane surfaces to enhance the stability of the solid liquid vapor composite interface however these nanostructures are often discretely distributed and might be mechanically vulnerable under a large shear stress alternative strategies that feature mechanically robust interconnected re entrant structures should be developed in the future hensel et al 2014 srinivasarao et al 2001 zhu et al 2017 characterization methods for omniphobic surfaces should also be tailored for md applications for example anti wetting properties of omniphobic membranes are often evidenced by liquid contact angles measured in air even though it is a simple and straightforward method to assess the surface omniphobicity it may not be able to describe the feed membrane interface in real md tests measuring underwater contact angle is a common practice when the feed solution contains water immiscible liquids like oil unfortunately very few studies on omniphobic surfaces reported this value huang et al 2017 and such characterization is still missing in most of studies as shown in tables 1 4 furthermore contact angles measured at elevated temperatures are highly recommended because the liquid surface tension is closely correlated to the temperature in addition in most of the current studies omniphobic membranes exhibit lower fluxes compared to those of the pristine membranes due to the reduction in pore size on the other hand it is well known that a higher flux i e a higher evaporation and condensation rate will result in a more severe concentration polarization and a higher possibility of wetting therefore it is difficult to conclude whether the improved stability is due to the omniphobic coating or simply owing to the reduced flux to demonstrate the superiority of omniphobic membranes one should either adjust the operating parameters such as feed temperatures to achieve the same fluxes for both omniphobic and pristine membranes and then compare the wetting rates or ensure a constant recovery volume boo et al 2016a or conduct long term performance tests to show the exceptional wetting resistance of omniphobic membranes 6 conclusions a comprehensive review of the state of the art omniphobic membranes for industrial wastewater treatment by membrane distillation has been conducted by forming a stable solid liquid vapor interface omniphobic membranes exhibit strong wetting resistances towards liquids with both high and low surface tensions the most widely adopted strategy to design omniphobic surfaces is through the combination of a re entrant surface texture and a low surface energy coating in addition omniphobic membranes specifically developed for membrane distillation applications have been examined all the omniphobic md membranes show superior wetting resistance in treating feed solutions containing salts and surfactants some also exhibit anti fouling properties towards humid acid and surfactant stabilized oil water emulsions these studies demonstrate the great potential of

18624,membrane distillation md has a great potential in treating high salinity industrial wastewater due to its unique characteristics nevertheless the implementation of md for industrial wastewater reclamation must be conducted with precaution because low surface tension contaminates in feed solutions may easily wet the membranes in recent years omniphobic membranes that exhibit strong repellence towards liquids with a wide range of surface tensions have been proposed as a promising solution to deal with the wetting problem in this paper we aim to provide a comprehensive review of omniphobic interfaces and illustrate their fundamental working principles innovative design approaches and novel applications on membrane distillation the review may provide insights in designing stable solid liquid vapor interfaces and serve as a guidance for the development of robust anti wetting membranes for industrial wastewater reclamation via membrane distillation graphical abstract image 1 keywords omniphobic interfaces membrane distillation industrial wastewater treatment anti wetting re entrant structure low surface energy 1 introduction membrane distillation md is a promising technology to reclaim various wastewater from a wide range of industries an et al 2016 calabro et al 1991 el abbassi et al 2013 hussain et al 2015 khaing et al 2010 mokhtar et al 2015 sivakumar et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 comparing to the traditional distillation processes md is modular and more space saving lawson and lloyd 1997 thanks to its special separation mechanism md has theoretically 100 rejections to non volatile compounds and produces extremely pure water that can meet the high quality standards of industries such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals drioli et al 2015 hilal et al 2011 lu et al 2016 it is also less affected by feed concentration and has a lower tendency to be fouled than conventional pressure driven membrane processes making it especially suitable for reclamation of high salinity wastewater such as concentrated reverse osmosis ro brine camacho et al 2013 deshmukh et al 2018 in addition it typically operates at mild temperatures of less than 90 c and pressures of atmospheric pressure or below which makes it possible to be powered by low grade energy sources such as solar energy or industrial waste heat this will significantly lower its energy cost and carbon footprint henderyckx 1967 in spite of various advantages the implementation of md for industrial wastewater reclamation must be conducted with precaution because contaminates in feed solutions may cause membrane wetting rezaei et al 2018 wetting occurs when liquid penetrates into membrane pores it could lead to a reduction of flux a drop of energy efficiency and a loss of rejection thus wetting should be avoided in md applications at all times the wetting phenomenon is closely related to the feed composition which varies significantly in different industries gryta 2005 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 for example when reclaiming high salinity brines inorganic salt crystals precipitated from concentrated brines may grow on membrane surface reduce its surface hydrophobicity and eventually cause membrane wetting surfactant adsorption is a major origin of wetting in treating shale gas wastewater trace amounts of oil and grease in wastewater from petrochemical plants may attach to the hydrophobic membrane and cause pore wetting and blockage wastewater from pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries contains solvents and acids that lower the surface tensions of feed solutions and lead to membrane wetting gryta 2005 israelachvili 2011 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 on the other hand in many cases various types of foulants may co exist and act synergistically to accelerate the membrane wetting designing an omniphobic membrane that remains unwetted when dealing with complex feed solutions is a potential solution to improve the antiwetting properties of md membranes salimi 2019 siyal et al 2019 omni means all thus the omniphobic md membrane should repel both high and low surface tension liquids the omniphobic surface has been found in nature species springtail is able to breathe through its cuticle surface even when it is immersed in water oil and other liquids boban et al 2018 hensel et al 2016 2014 2013 kota et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 when they are immersed under liquids a protective air layer called plastron will be formed and serve as a gas reservoir to enable regular gas exchange studies show that the omniphobic nature of the springtail s cuticle surface is attributed to its hierarchical re entrant structure and the layer of low surface energy lipids hensel et al 2016 2014 inspired by springtails several successful designs of omniphobic surfaces have recently been reported by hensel et al domingues et al tsujii et al tuteja et al and zhu et al domingues et al 2018 hensel et al 2014 tsujii et al 1997 tuteja et al 2007 2008a 2008b zhu et al 2017 the concept of omniphobicity has also attracted increasing attention from membrane researchers and several pioneering attempts have been done to fabricate omniphobic membranes for membrane distillation boo et al 2016a 2016b chen et al 2018a 2018b deng et al 2018 huang et al 2017 kadi et al 2019 lee et al 2016a b li et al 2019 lin et al 2014 lu et al 2018b woo et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2018 in this paper we would like to present a comprehensive review of omniphobic membranes for membrane distillation to begin with fundamental knowledge of wetting on a textured surface and important design parameters for omniphobic surfaces will be discussed subsequently cutting edge and inspiring technologies to fabricate omniphobic surfaces will be elaborated the review will then focus on innovative designs of omniphobic membranes and their successful applications in membrane distillation we hope this review can provide guidance and inspirations to those interested readers who are keen to develop robust md membranes with exceptional wetting resistance 2 design an omniphobic surface 2 1 fundamentals of wetting on a textured surface the wettability of a textured surface is often quantified in terms of the apparent or measured contact angle θ fig 1 of a liquid droplet on the surface different from the equilibrium contact angle θ fig 2 that is an intrinsic property of a solid vapor liquid interface θ is significantly influenced by the texture of the solid surface two distinct models developed by wenzel 1936 and cassie and baxter 1944 are commonly applied to predict the effects of roughness r i e the ratio of the actual solid surface area to the projected area on the measured contact angle the wenzel state shown in fig 1a corresponds to a complete wetting state it is widely adopted to describe the liquid membrane interface in applications such as ro where a liquid transports through membrane pores in a wenzel model roughness increases the area of the composite interface thus it amplifies the effects of the intrinsic hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity 1 c o s θ r c o s θ in a cassie baxter state as shown in fig 1b a liquid droplet is retained on top of a solid vapor liquid interface the non wetting nature of the rough surface is caused by microscopic air pockets trapped below the liquid phase the apparent contact angle in a cassie baxter mode is calculated by the following equations 2 c o s θ f s c o s θ f g c o s θ g where f s and f g are the areas of solid liquid and gas liquid interfaces on a projected area of unity respectively for a surface with a morphology as shown fig 1b f s f g 1 θ and θ g are equilibrium contact angles of the liquid droplet on solid and gas respectively due to the low adhesion between gas and liquid molecules θ g is often approximated as 180 thus equation 2 can be simplified to the following form 3 c o s θ 1 f s 1 c o s θ the transition between wenzel and cassie states is possible and the threshold equilibrium contact angle θ c for this transition can be obtained by equating equations 1 and 3 4 c o s θ c f s 1 r f s since f s 1 r θ c should be greater than 90 for the transition from the wenzel state to the cassie baxter state to occur this highlights the difficulty to form a stable cassie baxter state especially for liquids with low surface tensions such as alcohols and alkanes because it is nearly impossible for such liquids to achieve equilibrium contact angles over 90 on almost all the solids however studies on superhydrophobic leaves in nature suggest that unexpectedly high non wetting states can still be achieved even when the leaves are slightly hydrophilic cheng and rodak 2010 previous studies reveal that such phenomena origin from the re entrant surface texture which facilitates the formation of a composite interface a re entrant structure refers to a concave topography in which the cross sectional solid area decreases from the top to the bottom wang et al 2018 fig 2a and b illustrate possible liquid vapor solid interfaces on pointed and re entrant structures respectively despite the same equilibrium contact angles θ in both cases the net tractions on the interfaces point in different directions the net traction is resulted from surface tension the direction of the surface tension is tangential to the liquid vapor l v interface marchand et al 2012 and pointing towards the convex phase to minimize the l v contact surface area sophocleous 2010 therefore once the contact angle is plotted the direction of the net traction can be easily derived as shown in fig 2a if the equilibrium contact angle is smaller than the local texture angle φ the net traction on the composite interface is pointing downwards exerting a pressure on the trapped air pocket and promoting imbibition of the liquid by contrast the net traction points away from the solid for a re entrant textured surface with φ θ which can effectively prevent wetting chen et al 2018a chhatre et al 2010 tuteja et al 2008a besides creating re entrant textures one can also improve the anti wetting property by lowering the solid surface energy a lower solid surface energy can reduce the attraction between liquid and solid surfaces and increase the equilibrium contact angle lu et al 2018b tuteja et al 2008a 2 2 important design parameters two design parameters are important in engineering omniphobic surfaces namely the apparent contact angle θ and the robustness factor a the former is the most straightforward and widely applied parameter to measure the surface wettability a small θ 90 corresponds to a hydrophilic surface with high wettability while a large θ 90 indicates a hydrophobic surface with a good anti wetting property a surface with an exceptionally high θ 150 is called a superhydrophobic surface which is desirable in membrane distillation a is a dimensionless factor to assess the stability of a solid liquid vapor interface as mentioned in the preceding discussions the value of θ depends highly on the surface geometrical factors and surface chemistry as shown in equation 2 for surfaces with different textures equation 2 can be rewritten as different forms for example equation 3 is a simplified cassie baxter model for flat topped pillars as shown in fig 1b however it is not applicable to re entrant structures where the sum of f s and f g does not equal to one fig 3 a shows a diagram of a composite interface on cylindrical fibers such texture is a typical re entrant structure found on woven nonwoven mesh and electrospun membranes for an area a with a unit axial length f s and f g can be calculated as follows 5 a 2 r 2 d 6 f s r 2 π 2 θ a 7 f g a 2 r s i n θ a where r is the radius of the fiber and 2 d is the distance between the two fibers let us define the dimensionless space ratio d r d r then the cassie baxter equation can be rewritten as chhatre et al 2010 8 c o s θ 1 1 d π θ c o s θ s i n θ the effects of dimensionless space ratio d radius of the surface texture r distance between surface texture 2 d and equilibrium contact angle θ on the value of apparent contact angle θ have been studied both mathematically and experimentally by chhatre et al 2010 in their study contact angle measurements of a series of liquids were performed on a set of wire mesh surfaces which could provide systematically quantifiable cylindrical textures θ was manipulated by dip coating the meshes using materials with different surface energies the experimental results show that θ is indeed determined by θ and d as predicted by equation 8 a larger θ and or a greater d lead to a larger apparent contact angle and vice versa individual structure parameters namely r and d affect θ synergistically in other words the apparent contact angles are unaffected by the changes in r or d as long as the resultant d remains constant though equation 8 can accurately predict the apparent contact angle on a cylindrically textured surface it can be only used when a cassie baxter state is assured unfortunately a cassie baxter state is thermodynamically metastable tuteja et al 2007 2008a as illustrated in fig 3b a transition to the wenzel state is possible when the sagging height h 1 reaches the maximum height h 2 under the laplace pressure or an externally applied pressure tuteja et al 2008a to quantify the tendency to resist the sagging of the composite interface chhatre et al proposed a dimensionless robustness factor a for the cylindrical texture chhatre et al 2010 9 a l c a p r d 1 1 c o s θ d 1 2 s i n θ where l c a p is the capillary length defined as l c a p γ l v ρ g where γ l v and ρ g are the surface tension and specific weight of the liquid respectively a 1 is preferred in order to obtain a robust solid liquid vapor interface as reported by chhatre et al the robustness factor is inversely proportional to the radius of the surface texture r even at a constant space ratio d a larger a is obtained on a fine mesh compared to that on a coarse mesh similarly the composite interface becomes less stable when the space ratio factor d increases in addition to the scales of the texture the robustness of the composite interface also depends on the equilibrium contact angle θ the value of a increases monotonically with an increase in θ in reality most of the surfaces such as nonwoven or electrospun nanofiber surfaces are not perfect cylindrically textured surfaces thus the quantitative analysis may not be suitable unless the effects of varying topographical and surface properties are considered nevertheless the preceding equations and discussions still provide valuable insights to the design of omniphobic surfaces the importance of the re entrant structure and the low surface energy has been echoed in novel fabrication technologies to be presented in the subsequent sections 2 3 novel fabrication methods of omniphobic surfaces ever since the mechanism of the omniphobic surface was revealed scientists have tried various types of methods to engineer similar surfaces with remarkable repellences towards low surface tension liquids these different fabrication approaches are summarized in table 1 the most typical strategy is the simultaneous incorporation of low surface energy chemistry and topographic features as illustrated in the preceding discussions instructed by this strategy several omniphobic surfaces have been successfully developed tuteja et al synthesized a series of omniphobic electrospun surfaces by incorporating fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane fluoroposs into polymethyl methacrylate pmma solutions the addition of fluoroposs not only reduced the surface energy but also facilitated the formation of a re entrant beads on string structure as shown in fig 4 a tuteja et al 2008a 2008b in addition to this method they also obtained omniphobic micro hoodoo structure fig 4b on flat silicon si wafers by a silicon dioxide sio2 deposition followed by a reactive ion etching of sio2 and a subsequent isotropic etching of si via vapor phase xenon difluoride xef2 kota et al 2014 tuteja et al 2007 a surface with a special texture that shows great similarity to the micro hoodoo structure was developed by tan et al via metal organic framework mof self assembly tan et al 2013 they referred the texture as micromushrooms fig 5 they first grew an array of nh2 mil 53 al microneedles to an anodic aluminum oxide membrane next the hydrophobicity of the microneedles was improved by reacting it with perfluorooctanoyl chloride pfo cl the modified membrane was then gently placed into an aqueous precursor solution due to the superhydrophobic nature of the membrane it remained afloat on the solution surface and the precursor solution would not contact with the microneedles except at their tips as a result mushroom like caps were formed on the needle stems through epitaxial mof growth after the surface energy of the mushroom caps was lowered with pfo cl the resultant surface showed omniphobicity as reflected by a remarkable contact angle of 100 with n hexadecane hensel et al adapted a nanoimprint lithography scheme to design delicate re entrant morphologies with a high resolution of a few tens of nanometers they first applied precursor solutions to the springtails followed by uv irradiation the cured elastomeric mold was then gently peeled off and used as a pre patterned mold for a subsequent casting with the aid of this technology the skin structure of tetrodontophora bielanensis a european giant springtail was translated into polymer replicas the surface energy of the textured polymer was then lowered by teflon af coating hensel et al 2013 hensel et al have also successfully fabricated an omniphobic membrane via a multi step reverse imprint lithography hensel et al 2014 as depicted in fig 6 a two tier silicon master mold was fabricated first as a template for feature replication subsequently a perfluoropolyether dimethacrylate pfpedma template was cast from the silicon mater using a reverse imprint lithography approach finally a poly ethylene glycol dimethacrylate pegdma polymer membrane was cast from the pfpedma template by the doctor blade technique the resultant membrane exhibited overhang structures that resembled the textures of the springtail cuticle surface in a recent study zhu et al developed well defined porous omniphobic membranes via microfluidic emulsion templating zhu et al 2017 a highly uniform emulsion of silicone oil droplets in a polyvinyl alcohol pva aqueous solution was prepared using a capillary microfluidic device and then deposited onto a glass substrate due to the different physicochemical natures of the oil and the aqueous solution the oil droplets floated to the air water interface and created a close packed hexagonal monolayer array as water evaporated pva solidified into dense packed honeycomb structures and the spherical oil droplets gradually deformed into re entrant monolayer structures when the oil droplets were removed a pva membrane with a layer of well defined re entrant microstructures were formed their study presents an innovative and scalable method that can precisely control the structural topographies however the resultant pore sizes of the membranes are of tens of micrometers further investigation on how to control the pore size is important in order to adopt the technology for md membrane fabrication atomic layer deposition ald is another emerging technology to fabricate omniphobic or amphiphobic nanocoatings it allows the precise control of atomic layer deposition by applying sequential surface reactions feng et al applied ald to coat a uniform layer of zno nanoparticles onto a porous polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe matrix to enhance the roughness and subsequently grafted 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyl acrylate pfdae on zno via plasma treatment feng et al 2016 the resultant membrane exhibited excellent water and oil contact angle of 150 and 125 and showed exceptional fouling resistance to organic aerosol deposition very recently sorvali et al reported a stepwise fabrication process of a multilayered superomniphobic coating via the combination of liquid flame spray ald and fluorosilane sorvali et al 2018 a tio2 nanoparticle bottom layer an interstitial al2o3 nanofilm and a top fluorosilane layer were applied in sequence the resultant composite surface had an ultrathin layer of about 70 nm and it exhibited remarkable contact angles 150 and extremely low sliding angles 10 for water diiodomethane and ethylene glycol eg sorvali et al 2018 srinivasarao et al proposed a facile method to engineer interconnected re entrant structures based on breath figures srinivasarao et al 2001 the breath figure refers to the fog created by exhaling onto a cold surface and it is able to create micro and nanoscale periodic structures bunz 2006 to form ordered air bubbles at a membrane surface a diluent of polystyrene in a volatile solvent was cast on a glass slide in the presence of moist air flowing across the membrane surface evaporative cooling led to the formation of water droplets on the liquid surface the condensed droplets arranged into an ordered array and sunk to the polymer solution after the removal of the solvent and water droplet a porous membrane with re entrant interconnected nanostructures was formed although the omniphobicity of the membrane has not been reported the method is worthy to be included in this section as a facile and potential technology to create mechanically robust omniphobic surfaces other than the above mentioned technologies to fabricate omniphobic surfaces by creating re entrant textures followed by lowering the surface energy another strategy that involves designing a smooth liquid infused porous surfaces slips which are liquid like has also been reported the advantage of this strategy is that re entrant topographic features which are usually fragile and challenging to fabricate are no longer required in addition slips do not involve pressure dependent metastable states instead a dynamic liquid liquid vapor contact line is formed by immobilizing perfluorinated fluid lubricants on micro patterned or nano textured substrates which leads to superior self cleaning anti icing and self healing properties ma et al 2013 wong et al 2011 however the requirement of a mobile liquid which is immiscible to the contact liquid makes it unsuitable in the md applications some researchers also proposed to coat a layer of covalently attached liquids by grafting flexible materials on to the substrates unfortunately the feasibility of adopting this strategy in membrane distillation has not been explored yet due to the complexity and low permeability of the coating layer cheng et al 2012 wang and mccarthy 2016 3 omniphobic modifications for membrane distillation omniphobic membranes which have been developed for robust membrane distillation will be summarized in this section depending on the types of supporting materials they can be divided into three major categories namely inorganic membranes phase inversed polymeric membranes and electrospun nanofiber membranes tables 2 4 list and compare the works according to these three categories respectively the tables contain short summaries of modification methods assessments of omniphobicity md configurations feed compositions operating temperatures fluxes of pristine flux c and coated membranes flux o as well as test durations 3 1 inorganic membranes lin et al developed the first omniphobic membrane for membrane distillation by modifying glass fiber membranes with silica nanoparticles sinps followed by surface fluorination and polymer coating lin et al 2014 a five step modification procedure was employed to grow sinps firmly on the glass fibers and to lower the surface energy using fluorinated alkyl silane fas fig 7 compares their morphology before and after the modification the modified membrane exhibited larger contact angles towards not only water but also low surface tension organic solvents than a commercial ptfe membrane both the omniphobic and ptfe membranes were tested in the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd experiments using feed solutions containing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and the former exhibited a much more stable performance than the latter cheng et al developed omniphobic membranes for md by depositing zinc oxide zno on glass fiber membranes using a chemical deposition method followed by surface fluorination and a polymer coating to lower the surface energy chen et al 2018b the resultant membrane showed remarkable contact angles of 152 8 1 1 and 110 3 1 9 towards water and ethanol respectively the dcmd tests using feeds containing 0 3 mm sds also proved the enhanced stability after the omniphobic coating cheng et al also fabricated omniphobic alumina hollow fiber membranes by depositing zno nanorods and nanoparticles on the membranes followed by surface fluorination using 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilan fas 17 chen et al 2018a they found that both nanostructures enhanced the membrane omniphobicity due to the higher roughness but the membrane coated with nanoparticles was more anti wetting than that coated with nanorods unlike nanoparticles nanorods do not have re entrant structures a concave composite interface is formed and the surface tension force is pointing downwards as illustrated in fig 8 as a result the composite interface formed on nanorod strucutres is less stable compared to that on nanoparticles where the upturned net traction can effectively prevent the wetting to occur 3 2 phase inversed polymeric membranes polymeric membranes that are fabricated via phase inversion method are commonly used in md applications surface modifications of such membranes in order to improve their wetting resistance remain a hot topic polymeric membranes can be formed into different configurations such flat sheet and hollow fiber generally speaking decorating flat sheet membranes is relatively easier comparing to modifying hollow fibers because the former possess a smaller curvature than the latter thus quite a few studies have reported successful omniphobic modifications on flat sheet md membranes boo et al have performed an omniphobic coating on a commercial pvdf flat sheet membrane by sinp deposition followed by perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane fdts coating via vapor phase silanization boo et al 2016a for readers information the pristine pvdf membrane was firstly modified by electropositive 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes so that negatively charged sinps could attach onto the membrane surface via electrostatic interaction as illustrated in the upper right of fig 9 the mechanical and chemical durability of the sinp and fdts coating were assessed by subjecting the omniphobic membranes to harsh physical i e bath sonication for 20 min and chemical i e ph 2 ph 12 or 1 0 m nacl conditions surface micrographs and contact angle data taken after the durability tests showed no obvious difference compared with the original omniphobic membrane the wetting resistances of the pristine and omniphobic membranes were examined in dcmd tests using 1 sds 2 mineral oil added feed solutions and 3 pre filtered real shale gas produced water in all cases the omniphobic membranes showed significantly more stable performance than the unmodified ones indicating their great potential in treating low surface tension industrial wastewater recently li et al proposed another approach where trimesoyl chloride tmc was employed as a bridge for binding sinps onto the pvdf surface via chemical interaction li et al 2019 fig 9 also elucidates this approach li et al claimed that sinps deposition via chemical bounding was more robust than that via electrostatic interaction and membranes prepared using the former method showed more stable performances in both impact abrasive tests and long term dcmd tests of 120 h besides the preceding methods woo et al recently reported a six step layer by layer lbl assembly method to fabricate omniphobic membranes negatively charged silica aerogel and 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane were attached on a pvdf flat sheet membrane successively using positively charged poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride as a interconnecting material woo et al 2018 the modified membrane showed a remarkable water contact angle of 177 0 0 4 and a sliding angle of 1 1 0 3 indicating its superhydrophobic and low hysteresis nature the resultant membrane also exhibited extremely high contact angles towards low surface tension liquids including eg mineral oil and methanol air gap membrane distillation agmd performances of the pristine and modified membranes were tested using 1 real ro brine from the produced water of coal seam gas csg and 2 csg ro brine with a gradual addition of sds or humid acid as feed solutions even though the omniphobic membrane obtained a relatively lower flux it gained a more stable performance and a better rejection than the unmodified one the superior omniphobicity is attributed to the low surface tension coating and the formation of the hierarchical rough surface in addition to the improvement in omniphobicity the mechanical and thermal stability of the membrane have also been enhanced after the lbl assembly due to the strong adhesion between the assembled layers and the host polymer support rather than employing monosized nanoparticles to create re entrant structures zheng et al reported an omniphobic membrane with multi level re entrant structures zheng et al 2018 multiscale microspheres were fabricated based on electrostatic interaction between electronegative sinps and electropositive polystyrene ps microspheres then they were deposited onto a commercial pvdf porous substrate via spray coating a chemical binding agent was utilized to enhance the adhesion between the microspheres and the pvdf support finally the surface was fluorinated using fas17 to reduce the surface energy the resultant membrane exhibited outstanding water hexadecane contact angles of 176 138 4 and a water sliding angle of 7 in the dcmd tests using a sds stabilized hexadecane emulsion as the challenging feed solution the omniphobic membrane showed an extremely stable flux and an outstanding rejection in contrast to other benchmark membranes apart from the above mentioned omniphobic md membranes developed on flat sheet polymeric substrates lu et al have successfully developed omniphobic hollow fiber membranes via silica nanoparticle deposition followed by teflon af 2400 coating lu et al 2018b interestingly the surface energy of the resultant fibers became much lower by dipping the original fibers in a very dilute teflon af 2400 coating solution 0 025 wt for a short coating time of 30 s lu et al 2018b lu et al 2016 by applying such coating conditions the surface energy was altered but the surface morphology had minimal changes as shown in fig 10 therefore the effects of low surface energy and re entrant structure could be investigated separately contact angle results showed that both teflon af 2400 coating and omniphobic coating i e sinps deposition followed by teflon af 2400 coating can improve the repellence of membranes towards various types of liquids but the effects of the latter is much more obvious this observation highlights the significance of the re entrant structure to enhance surface omniphobicity in addition they also investigated the effects of nanoparticle size on surface omniphobicity by depositing sinps with different sizes as shown in fig 10 vacuum membrane distillation vmd tests demonstrated the exceptional wetting resistance of the membrane coated by 60 nm sinps as compared to membranes coated with larger sinps indicating that small nanoparticles are preferred in order to form a robust cassie baxter state 3 3 electrospun nanofiber membranes electrospinning has been demonstrated as an effective method in fabricating omniphobic surfaces ma et al 2005 lee et al 2016b tuteja et al 2008a 2007 a well designed electrospun fibrous structure provides an ideal substrate for developing omniphobic membranes as the bottom half of the electrospun fibrous network itself constitutes a re entrant structure tuteja et al 2008a wang et al 2016 however the re entrant structure alone is a necessary but not sufficient condition for surface omniphobicity in most cases post modification methods including lowering surface energy and increasing level of the re entrant structure are needed to impart omniphobic characteristics onto the electrospun fibrous substrates a cf4 plasma treatment has been demonstrated as an effective method to improve surface hydrophobicity without sacrificing water flux of md membranes yang et al 2015 2014 the increase in hydrophobicity arises from 1 suitable etching that enhances surface roughness and 2 introduction of fluorine functional groups that reduces surface energy of membrane materials wei et al 2012 woo et al have developed an omniphobic membrane via the combination of electrospinning and cf4 plasma treatment woo et al 2017 in this study they treated the hot pressed nanofiber membranes by cf4 plasma and successfully reduced the surface energy by forming new cf2 cf2 and cf3 bonds at the optimal condition of 15 min cf4 plasma treatment the water contact angle increased from 133 6 to 160 6 indicating a great improvement in hydrophobicity the resultant membrane displayed omniphobic property with a wide range of low surface tension liquids including methanol mineral oil and eg due to such excellent repellency the cf4 plasma treated md membrane demonstrated a high potential in treating feed solutions containing low surface tension substances besides the hydrophobic plasma treatment the addition of fluoroposs in the electrospinning dope solution has also been reported as a facile method to fabricate omniphobic nanofibrous membranes lu et al 2018a the addition of fluoroposs in electrospinning dopes did not change the morphology of nanofibers with regard to roughness or diameter but only increased the f c ratio from 1 17 to 1 40 which indicated an increase in hydrophobicity the obtained fluoroposs based omniphobic membrane successfully resisted surfactant induced wetting in md operations constructing a hierarchical re entrant structure typically refers a finer length scale re entrant texture on an underlying coarser one is an alternative method to impart the omniphobic property onto membrane surfaces by trapping air in multi level textures a hierarchical re entrant structure decreases the solid liquid contact area therefore enhancing wetting resistance toward low surface tension substances kota et al 2013 2012 decorating the primary nanofibrous structure with spherical nanoparticles can effectively alter surface roughness and increase level of the re entrant structure silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles are commonly used to create hierarchical structures lin et al 2014 razmjou et al 2012 lee et al successfully attached negatively charged sinps on a positively charged nanofiber membrane via a simple dip coating lee et al 2016b cationic surfactant benzyltriethylammonium chloride bteac was added into the dope solution to render positive charged nanofibers which facilitated the attachment of sinps the first level of re entrant structure was endowed by the nanofibrous network and the deposition of sinps introduced the secondary re entrant structure hydroxyl groups on sinps provided a platform for subsequent fluoroalkylsilanization to further reduce the surface energy of the membrane the resultant membrane not only displayed high water contact angles with low surface tension liquids in air but also delivered stable md performance with hypersaline feed solutions containing surfactants more recently a simpler method that combines the construction of hierarchical structure and fluorination into one step has been reported deng et al 2018 after electrospinning the electrospun pvdf nanofiber membranes were immediately immersed in fluorododecyltrichlorosilane ftcs solutions of different concentrations 0 5 wt 2 wt and 3 5 wt in order to obtain omniphobicity compared to other coating conditions the membrane treated with a 2 wt ftcs solution not only displayed high repellency to low surface tension liquids without an expense of membrane porosity but also stable dcmd performance when treating a surfactant contained feed solution the omniphobicity was contributed by three factors 1 the hierarchical re entrant structure provided by pvdf nanofibers 2 the polymerized fluorododecyltrichlorosilane pftcs buds on nanofiber surface fig 11 and 3 the extremely low surface energy of pftcs 4 anti wetting and anti fouling properties of omniphobic membranes improving anti wetting properties is one of the ultimate incentives of developing omniphobic membranes for membrane distillation previous discussions demonstrate that wetting resistance towards a wide range of liquids can be effectively enhanced by omniphobic modifications as evidenced by the increased liquid contact angles and stable md performances using surfactant contained feed solutions boo et al 2016a 2016b chen et al 2018a 2018b deng et al 2018 huang et al 2017 kadi et al 2019 lee et al 2016a b li et al 2019 lin et al 2014 lu et al 2018b woo et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2018 in addition to membrane wetting membrane fouling is another issue that largely impedes the industrialization of md based on foulant types membrane fouling in md systems can be classified into three categories 1 inorganic fouling 2 organic fouling and 3 biological fouling tijing et al 2015 during md operations various foulants in feed solutions accumulate on membrane surfaces and inside membrane pores resulting in blockage of membrane pores and degradation of vapor flux although omniphobic membranes have been proposed as a fouling mitigation strategy for md studies on anti fouling performance of omniphobic membranes up today mainly focus on organic foulants such as humic acid woo et al 2018 and oils boo et al 2016a wang and lin 2017 zheng et al 2018 a less progress has been made on fouling resistance towards inorganic and biological fouling an omniphobic membrane with a hierarchical re entrant structure has been developed through a layer by layer lbl assembly technique as described in section 3 2 woo et al 2018 to test the fouling resistance this omniphobic composite membrane was utilized to treat a feed solution containing 20 mg l humic acid it remained uncontaminated even after a 72 h operation under agmd which could not be achieved by the neat pvdf membrane since the omniphobic membrane had a higher zeta potential compared to the neat pvdf the strong electric repulsion was considered as the origin of its anti fouling property it was expected that omniphobic membranes could resist oil fouling in md applications due to their in air oleophobicity which has been reported in many literature kota et al 2013 tuteja et al 2008a however the situation is much more complicated in practical md operations zheng et al found that the omniphoibic membrane with a hierarchical re entrant structure displayed a better fouling resistance than pristine pvdf fas17 coated pvdf and single level re entrant structured pvdf membranes zheng et al 2018 their omniphobic membrane showed an extremely low sliding angle with a water hexadecane emulsion indicating high resistance towards low surface tension foulants owing to this super repellency neither apparent flux decline nor permeate conductivity increase was observed when it was challenged with a hexadecane emulsion feed solution stabilized with sds after the dcmd test the omniphobic membrane still showed a high water contact angle of 168 3 which meant it remained uncontaminated during the md operation a similar result was reported by elimelech and his group boo et al 2016a whose omniphobic membrane was able to treat shale gas waste water containing both mineral oil and surfactant without the occurrence of wetting or fouling phenomenon in the above two studies omniphobic membranes have demonstrated superior anti oil fouling properties against water oil emulsions that were stabilized with surfactants a similar observation was reported by wang and lin 2017 their omniphobic membrane also exhibited no fouling or wetting when a water oil emulsion was stabilized by 100 mm triton x 100 they found that the presence of surfactants played a critical role since amphiphilic surfactants consisted of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups the hydrophobic groups of surfactants in the presence of oil would attach on the oil water interface thus the hydrophilic groups would be exposed and the oil droplets wrapped with surfactant molecules became hydrophilic this reduces the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between oil and membrane surface however when treating a feed solution containing only crude oil without being stabilized by surfactants omniphobic membranes were found to be fouled even though they displayed non zero contact angles for oil both in air and underwater this could be ascribed to the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between oil droplets and the low surface energy coating of the omniphobic membrane fig 12 this hypothesis was further proven by the reduced adhesion force between oil and composite membranes consisting of hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic top layer in other words omniphobic membranes made from low surface energy materials were in fact underwater oleophilic the re entrant morphology on membrane surface could only prevent the penetration of oil droplets into membrane pores but not oil fouling on membrane surface to control oil fouling on membrane surface hydrophilic surface modification is regarded as a widely used strategy it is well known that in contact with water hydrophilic functional groups on membrane surface would form hydrogen bonds with water molecules creating a hydration layer on membrane surface chen et al 2010 wang et al 2018 li et al 2014 for oil droplets to attach on and spread over a hydrophilic surface energy is required to destroy the hydration layer on the surface therefore the formed hydration layer serves as an energy barrier that is unfavorable for the oil attachment devi et al 2005 howarter and youngblood 2009 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 inspired by this principle huang et al developed a janus membrane comprising of an omniphobic substrate and a hydrophilic top layer which exhibited both anti wetting and anti fouling properties huang et al 2017 the omniphobic substrate was fabricated by electrospinning of a blend of poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and followed deposition of fluorinated sinps then a hydrophilic layer was developed by spraying a mixture of perfluorooctanoate chitosan and sinps on the omniphobic substrate when treating an oil in water emulsion as the feed solution the resultant janus membrane exhibited underwater oleophobicity and provided a stable dcmd performance for 10 h without a loss of permeate flux or salt rejection 5 future studies omniphobic membranes have demonstrated great potential in reclaiming water from feed solutions containing low surface tension materials despite of the above mentioned recent advances significant improvements on existing synthesis and characterization methods should be made to expedite the commercialization of omniphobic md membranes to apply omniphobic membranes on a large industrial scale facile and cost effective fabrication strategies that produce mechanically stable omniphobic coatings should be developed unfortunately many of existing methods involve complex and time consuming modification steps especially in modifying inorganic and phase inversed polymeric membranes for example some approaches take hours or ever days to complete the omniphobic coating some strategies require harsh reaction conditions and hazardous reagents such as concentrated alkaline solutions at high temperatures more facile and greener strategies must be invented in order to fabricate omniphobic membranes on a larger scale in addition most of the reported strategies deposit multilevel micro nanoparticles on the membrane surfaces to enhance the stability of the solid liquid vapor composite interface however these nanostructures are often discretely distributed and might be mechanically vulnerable under a large shear stress alternative strategies that feature mechanically robust interconnected re entrant structures should be developed in the future hensel et al 2014 srinivasarao et al 2001 zhu et al 2017 characterization methods for omniphobic surfaces should also be tailored for md applications for example anti wetting properties of omniphobic membranes are often evidenced by liquid contact angles measured in air even though it is a simple and straightforward method to assess the surface omniphobicity it may not be able to describe the feed membrane interface in real md tests measuring underwater contact angle is a common practice when the feed solution contains water immiscible liquids like oil unfortunately very few studies on omniphobic surfaces reported this value huang et al 2017 and such characterization is still missing in most of studies as shown in tables 1 4 furthermore contact angles measured at elevated temperatures are highly recommended because the liquid surface tension is closely correlated to the temperature in addition in most of the current studies omniphobic membranes exhibit lower fluxes compared to those of the pristine membranes due to the reduction in pore size on the other hand it is well known that a higher flux i e a higher evaporation and condensation rate will result in a more severe concentration polarization and a higher possibility of wetting therefore it is difficult to conclude whether the improved stability is due to the omniphobic coating or simply owing to the reduced flux to demonstrate the superiority of omniphobic membranes one should either adjust the operating parameters such as feed temperatures to achieve the same fluxes for both omniphobic and pristine membranes and then compare the wetting rates or ensure a constant recovery volume boo et al 2016a or conduct long term performance tests to show the exceptional wetting resistance of omniphobic membranes 6 conclusions a comprehensive review of the state of the art omniphobic membranes for industrial wastewater treatment by membrane distillation has been conducted by forming a stable solid liquid vapor interface omniphobic membranes exhibit strong wetting resistances towards liquids with both high and low surface tensions the most widely adopted strategy to design omniphobic surfaces is through the combination of a re entrant surface texture and a low surface energy coating in addition omniphobic membranes specifically developed for membrane distillation applications have been examined all the omniphobic md membranes show superior wetting resistance in treating feed solutions containing salts and surfactants some also exhibit anti fouling properties towards humid acid and surfactant stabilized oil water emulsions these studies demonstrate the great potential of omniphobic membranes in reclaiming water from low surface tension industrial wastewaters declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
