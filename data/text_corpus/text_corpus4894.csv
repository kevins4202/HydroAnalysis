24470,water scarcity is a serious problem across many nations in recent years water scarcity has increased due to land use and climate change particularly in areas that are arid or semi arid like for instance iran while land use changes influence hydrological processes at the basin scale the impacts caused by climate change are reflected by dynamics of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration et at the regional to global scale however the respective impacts of land use change and climate change acting in concert on water yield water supply and water consumption are still poorly understood the present study aims at shedding further light into these effects by taking as example the halil river basin in iran to this end the integrated valuation of ecosystem service and tradeoffs invest modelling tool is applied to simulate water yield water supply and water consumption in the study area by adopting a range of scenarios of land use and climate change until 2040 specifically this study applies the hadgem2 es earth system model under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 to assess the effects of future climate change on water scarcity and the land change modeller lcm in terrset geospatial monitoring and modeling software to estimate land use maps in the next two decades our results indicate that water yield and water supply in the study area are more strongly influenced by climate change than by land use change by contrast change in land use provides the more significant impact on water consumption however while water scarcity in halil river basin is controlled mainly by climate change and precipitation the scenarios that combine land use and climate changes yield the most significant impact on water yield and water supply our findings provide thus insights for improving strategies of sustainable development in arid to semi arid regions threatened by land use and climate change driven water scarcity keywords water scarcity climate change invest land use

yield wy water supply ws and water consumption wc the present manuscript provides new data and insights based on modelling which will help to elucidate the controls of both land use change luc and climate change cc on regional and local water resources climate and land use constitute significant drivers of ecosystem services i e the various benefits provided by healthy ecosystems and by the natural environment to humans liu et al 2017 li et al 2017b which include supply regulation support and culture wei et al 2021 land use changes can have marked effects on ecosystem properties processes and components bonan 2015 gao et al 2017 li et al 2020 by influencing the types patterns and ecological processes of the underlying ecosystem chen et al 2018 such changes consist in the modification of natural landscapes into anthropogenic landscapes and have in combination with rapid population growth potentially significant impacts on ecosystem health and hydrological processes including base flow soil water content groundwater recharge surface evapotranspiration as well as annual mean discharge joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 daneshi et al 2021 changes in land use influence the provision and value of ecosystem services especially on wy li et al 2018 furthermore climate change has significant impacts on the hydrologic balance at the regional basin scale thereby affecting runoff tu et al 2009 intensity of floods and drought frequency joorabisn shooshtari et al 2017 climate induced temperature increase is expected to considerably enhance water demand in the years ahead thereby leading to a reduction of water availability shirmohammadi et al 2020 water related ecosystem services such as water supply ws and regulation will be thus directly and indirectly affected by climate change chen et al 2018 wy is mainly controlled by precipitation and et yin et al 2020 and provides a key ecosystem function index of major relevance in agriculture industry fisheries domestic activities and life quality wei et al 2021 a broad range of studies on the quantification of water resources have focused on the impacts of land use changes on wy tadesse et al 2015 gao et al 2017 li et al 2018 furthermore considerable effort has been made to shed light on the standalone potential impacts of climate change on water resources ficklin et al 2009 mcfarlane et al 2012 zahabiyoun et al 2013 molina navarro et al 2016 however only a few studies have considered the combined effects of land use change and climate change on hydrological components for instance lópez moreno et al 2014 applied a hydro ecologic model for the upper aragón river basin in the central spanish pyrenees to evaluate the combined effect of land cover and climate changes on streamflow the authors found an association of this combined effect with a decrease of 29 6 in annual streamflow however wei et al 2021 showed that wy in the upstream regions of shule river basin increased significantly due to climate and land use changes furthermore joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 studied the influence of land cover and climate change on the evolution of water discharge in the neka river basin while clerici et al 2019 investigated the evolution of wy in the colombian andes the observations made by both teams suggested a stronger response of hydrological systems to climate evolution than to changes in the land use patterns joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 clerici et al 2019 further investigation is thus required to develop a better understanding of the response of hydrological systems and processes to climate and land use changes given the dynamics of land use and the broad range of climate change scenarios projected for the coming years ecosystem services have been quantified by shirmohammadi et al 2020 in a case study that considered a semiarid basin in iran by considering six combined climate land use change scenarios this study projected a decrease of wy under business as usual land use scenario in association with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios until 2030 iran is in a semi arid climatic zone daneshi et al 2021 that faces high inter annual spatio temporal patterns of precipitation variability and scarcity of fresh water molina navarro et al 2016 therefore quantitative information about the impacts of land cover and climate changes on hydrological responses is essential pre requisite for conservation planning and for developing sustainable water resource management strategies in the present manuscript we present a case study of wy response to projected climate and land cover change scenarios in halil river basin iran to this end we apply the integrated valuation of environmental service and tradeoffs invest model which proved superior to other spatially explicit ecosystem service modelling tools such as the soil and water assessment tool swat and the artificial intelligence for ecosystem services aries tools with respect to applications considering land use change scenarios vigerstol and aukema 2011 indeed invest has been successfully applied for different purposes such as modeling wy yang et al 2020 sediment retention hamel et al 2015 carbon storage and sequestration zhao et al 2019 nutrient exports and retention redhead et al 2018 and habitat quality gong et al 2019 however there are few applications of invest for wy modelling under future climate and land use changes particularly in iran daneshi et al 2021 therefore this manuscript presents a model to predict the combined effects of climate and land use change on water security as well as the costs associated with the concatenated water scarcity overall the specific objectives of this study consist in 1 assessing the dynamics of historical and future land cover changes thereby covering a time span of 39 years 2002 2040 2 projecting climatic change scenarios using lars wg long ashton research stochastic weather generator under specific greenhouse gas emission scenarios 3 applying the invest model to compute future wy ws and wc under future climate and land cover change scenarios in the halil river basin 4 estimating costs of ws associated with the various climate and land use change scenarios considered 5 discussing the contribution of the model results to the understanding of how future land use and climate change may impact hydrological resources and management in arid to semi arid regions based on the case study of halil river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area halil river basin is located in the south eastern of iran in the kerman province within 28 05 n to 29 15 n and 56 55 e to 58 15 e fig 1 the basin comprises an area of 9204 13 km2 is a tributary to the jazmourian wetland and yields surface water for the local agricultural activities local elevation ranges from 498 m to 3 868 m above sea level with altitude decreasing from north to south the upper and the middle parts of the basin include mountainous areas while the downstream parts form a flat plain sarhadi et al 2012 the mean annual precipitation in the study area ranges from 155 1 mm to 425 8 mm while the mean annual temperature varies from 16 7 to 25 8 c and the climate is arid and semi arid furthermore the study area hosts a broad range of vegetation species including irrigated orchards annual irrigated cultivated crops and natural vegetation irrigation of cultivated crops wheat barley corn watermelon cucumber potato onion and tomato constitute the most water intensive type of land use orchards are mostly covered by citruses while natural vegetation which colonizes a large part of the area under investigation is applied for livestock grazing type of land use halil river basin has a total population of 399 043 individuals living in 24 local communities statistical center for iran 2016 the basin is one of the major pillars of agricultural crops production in iran and the local economy depends much on it however more than 60 of agricultural lands have been negatively influenced by climate change cc and decreased precipitation in recent years thereby leading to socio economic problems and triggering emigration from the villages jiroft agriculture organization 2009 2 2 methodology this section briefly describes the main ingredients of invest model which is adopted to compute wy following this description a discussion on data requirements as well as on model calibration and validation is presented subsequently the climate and land use change scenarios adopted in this study as well as the procedure for the computation of wy supply and consumption are specified we note that a list of the abbreviations used in the present manuscript is provided to the reader at the beginning of this manuscript furthermore a flowchart of the research methodology is displayed in fig 2 2 2 1 the invest model in the present study the invest model from the natural capital project tallis et al 2011 is applied to estimate the wy i e the amount of runoff from the watershed this wy is modelled based on the budyko curve budyko 1974 which describes theoretically the water and energy limits from the catchment water balance the annual wy y j x at position x within a watershed can be estimated under consideration of local land use or land cover type j using the equation sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 1 y j x 1 ae t j x p x p x where ae t j x is the associated annual actual et while p x denotes the annual precipitation at position i e at pixel x sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 furthermore the ratio ae t j x p x is computed following the model of zhang et al 2001 2 ae t j x p x 1 ω x r j x 1 ω x r j x 1 r j x where r j x is the budyko drying index ratio of actual et to precipitation at pixel x when the land use or cover type is j sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 while ω x is given by zhang et al 2001 sharp et al 2018 3 ω x z awc x p x 1 25 in eq 3 awc x denotes the volumetric plant available water capacity mm which encodes information on soil texture and effective rooting depth zhou et al 2005 and gives the water amount that can be held in the soil and made available to plants furthermore z zhang coefficient is a seasonal rainfall factor that depends on monthly precipitation distribution and precipitation depth sharp et al 2018 this parameter is related to the number of rainfall events n higher than 1 mm yr 1 during the given period of time through the equation 4 z 0 2 n we use the following equation to compute the budyko dryness index sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 5 r j x k j x eto x p x where eto x is the reference et mm and k j x is the vegetation et coefficient at position x eto x encodes information on local climatic conditions while k j x is determined by the vegetation properties of land use at pixel x allen wardell et al 1998 allen et al 1998 values of r j x larger than 1 indicate arid climate conditions budyko 1974 2 2 2 data requirements and preparation this section specifies the input data required by invest model and the sources of the data used in the present study 2 2 2 1 watershed extraction sub watershed maps were created based on digital elevation model dem and arc hydro tools in arcgis 10 7 pascual et al 2015 the study area was divided into five sub watersheds 2 2 2 2 precipitation the invest model requires maps of precipitation and maps of et in the present study four meteorological stations were selected in and around the study area the location of each station is shown in fig 1 the datasets containing the information of minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation and radiation were obtained from the iran meteorological organization thirty years of data 1989 2017 from 4 weather stations in the area were applied for interpolation the stations of baft kahnoj bam and jiroft are at altitude 2280 469 7 1066 9 and 601 m asl above the average sea level respectively moreover jiroft station is located within the watershed while the distance from the stations of baft kahnoj and bam to the watershed is 26 19 6 and 40 73 km respectively we have tested different interpolation methods available within the geostatistical analyst package of arcgis 10 7 however the inverse distance weighting idw method displayed the lowest rmse compared to other methods such as kriging and cokriging therefore we have decided for idw as interpolating method of the climatic parameters in the study area 2 2 2 3 land use maps landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images for the years of 2002 and 2019 were used to evaluate land use change trends in this period after preprocessing the images supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood ml method was used in envi 5 3 to provide the land use maps ml was chosen here as its performance and accuracy in classification of remotely sensed data proved satisfactory in previous studies sun et al 2013 daneshi et al 2021 the 116 training polygons for the classification were designated through field studies and google earth images then land use maps were classified into seven classes bare land rangeland orchards rock agricultural land urban and open water in this study the kappa coefficient cohen 1960 and overall accuracy congalton 1991 were applied using an error matrix to evaluate the accuracy of the classified maps these indicators evaluate the simulation accuracy and the agreement between reference and simulated maps overall accuracy ranges from 0 to 100 and shows the possibility that a pixel classified into a specified class actually indicates that class on the ground kappa index is a measure of agreement between observed and predicted maps it usually falls between 0 and 1 where 1 represents a perfect agreement and 0 indicates that there is no agreement between two datasets kappa statistic represents the expected agreement between two datasets when the given category is allocated coincidentally over the map van vliet et al 2011 2 2 2 4 reference et there are various methods for estimating the reference et eto x such as penman monteith and hargreaves samani and thornthwaite mather monteith 1965 penman 1948 thornthwaite mather 1951 hargreaves samani 1982 the penman monteith approach is one of the most widely used methods silva et al 2013 but one main drawback of the penman monteith equation is that this equation requires weather data that are not available in most of the stations trajkovic 2007 as it is the case of the study area considered in the present work the results of sheikh et al 2013 indicated that the hargreaves samani model droogers and allen 2002 generated the highest degree of accuracy compared to blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1950 allen pruitt 1986 priestley taylor priestley taylor 1972 pereira 2004 turc turc 1961 trajkovic kolakovic 2009 thornthwaite mather thornthwaite mather 1957 and makkink makkink 1957 de bruin lablans 1998 models in arid and semi arid regions moreover the results of raziei and pereira 2013 for a wide range of climates in iran showed that the estimation of eto by hargreaves samani method has higher accuracy compared to the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 when applied to the arid and semi arid climate of iran therefore we model of hargeaves samani was also applied in the present study to estimate eto specifically the reference evapotranspiration eto x is modelled using the equation 6 eto x 0 0023 0 408 r a t mean x 17 8 t max x t min x where r a is the extraterrestrial solar radiation in mj m 2 d 1 which is estimated from a table that gives the approximate monthly value of r a for the northern hemisphere hargreaves samani 1982 furthermore t mean x is the local daily mean temperature c while t max x and t min x denote the daily maximum and minimum temperatures c respectively droogers and allen 2002 temperature data recorded from 4 synoptic stations were used to estimate the values of t mean x t max x and t min x based on the monthly average of eto x and precipitation the average annual precipitation and the mean annual potential et were calculated subsequently the spatial maps of the average annual precipitation and et were acquired using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation over the entire watershed in arcgis 10 7 2 2 2 5 vegetation et coefficient in eq 5 the et coefficient k j x at position x due to land use type j is computed using the equation 7 k j x m 1 12 k j m x eto x m m 1 12 eto x m where eto x m means the average of eto x at month m i e the mathematical operator denotes the time average of the embraced argument while the index m denotes the specific month for which this average has been computed m 1 for january m 2 for february m 12 for december this coefficient adopts values ranging from 0 to 1 5 depending on the land use type as specified in the invest user s guide sharp et al 2018 2 2 2 6 root restricting layer depth the soil depth of the study area was acquired from the harmonized world soil database hwsd with 1 1000 000 scale fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 fischer et al 2008 moreover the maximum root depth for the various land use types in the study area was obtained based on canadell et al 1996 and tallis et al 2011 2 2 2 7 paw plant available water capacity in the present study plant available water capacity was estimated using the model presented by de ridder and van keulen 1995 the stratified random soil sampling method was used for soil sampling hengl 2003 for this purpose land use map was firstly prepared then soil samples were randomly collected based on the area of each land use from 0 to 30 cm depth therefore 75 soil samples were collected in this method the number of soil samples is higher in land uses with higher area then soil texture and bulk density of soil were measured in soil laboratory finally the plant available water capacity was calculated using the following equation de ridder and van keulen 1995 8 paw fc pwp where fc cm3 cm 3 and pwp cm3 cm 3 denote values of water content at field capacity and wilting point respectively and are obtained using de ridder and van keulen 1995 9 fc 0 37 0 0035 s bd 100 10 pwp 0 007 0 0039 cl bd 100 with s and cl standing for the sand percentage 50 2 000 μ m and clay percentage 2 μ m respectively while bd is the bulk density of the soil g cm 3 table 1 lists the values of the parameters applied for invest in the present work we note that other pedotransfer functions take into account different soil properties i e organic matter gravel salinity and result in a better estimation of soil hydraulic parameters however for the purpose of the present study the collected soil parameters i e sand percentage clay percentage and soil bulk density constitute the parameters that we need to estimate plant available water capacity pawc mm therefore other soil parameters such as organic matter gravel and salinity were not collected although they are important for further characterization of soil hydraulic properties 2 2 2 8 model sensitivity analysis and calibration in this study a sensitivity analysis sa was conducted to quantify the effect of changes of input parameters which are the zhang coefficient z the et coefficients k j x j r for rangeland and j ia for irrigated agriculture as prevailing land use types and the climatic factors i e precipitation and et on the model output which is the annual wy sánchez canales et al 2012 shirmohammadi et al 2020 in the present study the method used in the sensitivity analysis was the one at a time oat method in this method variations in the output variables are induced by varying one input factor at a time while keeping all other factors fixed pianosi et al 2016 in the sensitivity analysis performed here z is calculated based on the number of rainfall events n higher than 1 mm yr 1 during the given period donohue et al 2012 and is then calibrated by comparing model predictions with observation data while z values vary between 1 to 30 sharp et al 2018 the average number of rainy events higher than 1 mm yr 1 in the study area is equal to 30 equation 4 yields thus z 6 donohue et al 2012 which is set as initial value for the model while z adopts values between 4 and 7 during calibration therefore the model was firstly run by adopting an initial z value z 6 and the corresponding wy was obtained subsequently the model was run by taking different other z values in the range from 4 to 7 specifically 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 5 and 7 and the obtained wy values were compared to the wy based on the initial z value z 6 the effect of the z value on the changes of wy was then investigated more precisely if wy changes are significant and the model output changes substantially compared to the initial estimate upon a change in a given parameter then it is concluded that the model is sensitive to the referred parameter we also considered other ranges for example 5 to 8 however for z values 4 the predicted water yield did not change much compared with predicted value using z 4 while using z 7 did not produce a substantial change in the predicted water yield compared to the value obtained with z 7 we note that the same range of z values between 4 and 7 has been applied in previous work by shirmohammadi et al 2020 and daneshi et al 2020 which was related to the climatic conditions of iran with a similar value of the number of rainfall events n higher than 1 mm yr 1 as in the present work the relative error defined below is computed to quantify the deviation of a predicted quantity from its observed counterpart this relative error is expressed in percentual change of the output results compared to the initial run observed value upon a change in the z value and is calculated using the following equation 11 relative error predicted value observed value observed value 100 we follow previous hydrological modeling tassew et al 2019 zhao et al 2009 and adopt a threshold of 10 to classify the relative error in our analysis as significant or not therefore the difference between observed and simulated value of a variable change is regarded as significant if is larger 10 otherwise the agreement between observed and simulated values is considered satisfactory tassew et al 2019 zhao et al 2009 in the present study the relative error in the water yield was smaller than 2 and thus negligible for any change in z within the aforementioned range of applied values furthermore the values of et coefficients k j x are obtained following the invest user s guide sharp et al 2018 irrigated agriculture constitutes the land use type associated with the most intensive water consumption agriculture ardakanian 2005 while rangeland is the prevailing land use type in the study area here the model starts assuming k ia x 0 65 and k r x 0 85 independent of the position x allen et al 1998 whereupon 15 changes in the respective et coefficients are applied and the updated model output is compared to its initial value following previous work to evaluate the model sensitivity to precipitation and et parameters we applied 15 changes in precipitation and reference et shirmohammadi et al 2020 and then compared the model output with the initial run accordingly the model was firstly run with its initial values of parameters and the initial wy was obtained based on these parameters thereafter changes from 15 to 15 were applied to these initial parameter values and their effects on the output wy were evaluated finally the wy obtained from the initial run was compared with the wy obtained from these 15 changes in the parameters the parameter that creates the most significant variation in the model output compared with the baseline initial value of wy is considered as the most relevant parameter in the sensitivity analysis process moreover to calibrate the invest model data from the kahnak e sheybani hydrometric station 1989 2019 located at the basin outlet were considered the calibration of the model was conducted by comparing the predicted wy with the available data from the hydrometric station the performance of invest model in the wy estimation of the study area was assessed by using the coefficient of determination r2 ozer 1985 and the nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which are given by 12 r 2 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o σ s σ o 2 13 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi and si are the observed and simulated data respectively with o and s denoting their respective averages and σ s and σ o standing for the associated standard deviation values both r2 and nse can adopt values from 0 to 1 and model performance is considered better the closer these parameters are to unity 2 2 2 9 climate and land use change scenarios for assessing the impacts of climate and land use change on water scarcity in the halil river basin seven land use and climate change cc scenarios were adopted 1 scenario 1 cc under scenario rcp 2 6 no luc 2 scenario 2 cc under scenario rcp 4 5 no luc 3 scenario 3 cc under scenario rcp 8 5 no luc 4 scenario 4 only luc 5 scenario 5 cc under scenario rcp 2 6 luc 6 scenario 6 cc under scenario rcp 4 5 luc 7 scenario 7 cc under scenario rcp 8 5 luc intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 has published the new climate change scenarios for the fifth assessment report ar5 called as representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 these scenarios were named based on emission pathways and greenhouse gas concentrations predicted for future times riahi et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 there are different general circulation models gcms for predicting climate change however in the present work we have decided for using the hadgem2 es model because this gcm has been widely applied in previous work to investigate climate change in iran tizro et al 2019 lotfi et al 2020 sharafati et al 2021 the hadgem2 es earth system model is thus run here under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 to assess the effects of future climate change on water scarcity the long ashton research stochastic weather generator lars wg was used to downscale the general circulation model gcm outputs and to create future time series of tmin tmax and precipitation in the period from 2031 to 2050 maghsood et al 2019 then based on the predicted temperature and precipitation data future reference et was calculated using the method of hargreaves and samani droogers and allen 2002 to create the land use map for the next 21 years i e until 2040 based on land use maps of 2002 and 2019 we applied the land change modeler lcm within terrset software eastman 2016 azareh et al 2021 furthermore multi layer perceptron mlp neural network was used for transition potential modeling in lcm mlp models the transition potential of each pixel to another pixel based on driver variables e g elevation distance to river etc thereby running multiple transitions at the same time eastman 2016 in the present study the transition potential maps were produced using the driver variables that were entered into each sub model structure the mlp then creates pixels for each chosen transition and adjusts the weights to enhance accuracy as the rmse root mean square error decreases eventually for scenario 2002 2019 five transition sub models were produced comprising rangeland to agriculture rangeland to bare land rangeland to orchard rangeland to urban and water to bare land seven explanatory variables including distance to river distance to road distance to urban distance to agriculture slope angle slope aspect and elevation were used these variables have been broadly applied to model land use kumar et al 2015 anand et al 2018 in the next step the model produced a predicted land use map for 2019 using markov chain analysis that was validated with the real 2019 land use map a markov chain determines the change probability from each class to another land use category by predicting future dynamics based on the current state thereby yielding a projection for future land use based on transition potential maps eastman 2016 furthermore kappa statistics were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and the agreement between real and predicted land use maps of 2019 the kappa statistic usually takes values between 0 and 1 where 1 denotes perfect agreement and 0 stands for perfect disagreement between a pair of maps van vliet et al 2011 kappa indices applied in the present study are kappa for no information kno kappa for grid cell level location klocation kappa for stratum level location klocation strata and kappa standard kstandard pontius 2000 cohen 1960 finally the prediction for 2040 was made using mlp and markov chain analysis to calculate land use changes the wy of the watershed was then predicted under each scenario for the period 2031 2050 and compared with the baseline period 1989 2019 2 2 2 10 water consumption wc consumptive water was estimated for agriculture and horticulture crops based on the water requirements of each crop using the software netwat alizadeh kamali 2007 which is developed by iran s national water resources development plan and a survey of provincial extension agents to acquire a dataset of mean water demands for various crops in iran water use is consumptive when water is removed from a water body surface or ground water source or basin for an objective and is not returned to the water resource system such as water used for the irrigation of agriculture and horticulture crops assigned to the irrigated agriculture class and orchard class and the human consumption assigned to the residential class sharp et al 2018 based on data from the ministry of agriculture jihad of iran in 2019 about 55 27 of cultivated lands in jiroft city was related to agricultural crops while 46 73 of these lands were associated with horticultural crops moreover agricultural and horticultural crops encompassed 49 9 and 50 9 respectively of cultivated lands in anbarabad most horticultural products from these two cities correspond to citrus gardens while agricultural products are mainly wheat barley corn watermelon cucumber potato onion and tomato these crops are irrigated using diverse irrigation methods of high water requirement so that the mean annual wc associated with agricultural land amounts to 16 250 m3 ha 1 based on netwat outputs extracted by agriculture ministry of iran to compare the mean annual wc due to citrus gardens obtained from netwat outputs is much lower around 1 130 m3 ha 1 domestic and residential wc water consumption depends on the total human population in the study area jiroft and anbarabad have estimated populations of 308 858 and 90 185 inhabitants respectively statistical centre of iran 2016 the average wc per person in iran is 150 liters per day tasnimnews 2019 while the per capita water consumption in developed countries is 70 liters per day the per capita water consumption in iran reaches 150 liters per day and the water consumption rate in iran is higher than in developed countries mehrnews 2021 based on present land use as well as on population and livestock densities in the study area the mean annual wc in residential areas is 3 246 5 m3 ha 1 2 2 2 11 costs associated with water supply ws water scarcity enhancement and ws reduction will increase the costs associated with water use brouwer et al 2015 ws is obtained based on the difference between wy and wc under climate and land use change in present and future times sharp et al 2018 the supplied water price by the ecosystem was estimated 0 4 per cubic meter for iran mousavi and arzani 2014 in this study price of supplied water was firstly calculated for every land use subsequently the economic value associated with the predicted reduction of ws was estimated 3 results 3 1 land use change land use maps of 2002 and 2019 were obtained using the maximum likelihood ml classification algorithm and then were categorized into seven classes bare land rangeland orchards bare rock agricultural lands urban and open water fig 3 table 2 indicates the accuracy and the values of kappa for land use maps created using ml classification algorithm for both years of 2002 and 2019 for predicting future land use change 2040 the land change modeller lcm in terrset software was applied to this end transition potential modeling was first conducted using the mlp neural network under the factors comprising accuracy rate while training and testing rmse were used to assess the transition potential modeling table 3 according to the results there is a high accuracy rate of mlp in all transition sub models 67 5 to 85 1 after training the mlp markov chain was used to determine the quantity of change thereafter the land use map of 2019 was simulated based on the maps of transition potential and the quantity of change obtained from the markov chain the kappa metrics were applied to quantify the agreement between the predicted and the ground truth maps in 2019 the high values of the kappa coefficients attest for the good performance of lcm in the simulation of land use for 2019 table 4 this good performance provides us thus with a successful proof of concept for the application of lcm in the prediction of land use for 2040 table 5 indicates the area of each land use class in 2002 2019 and 2040 the results indicate an increase in the areas associated with bare lands orchards agricultural lands and residential lands both for the period of 2002 2019 and for the subsequent years until 2040 this scenario contrasts with the results obtained for rangelands and open water water bodies areas for which negative values of land use change are obtained fig 3 displays the various land use categories in 2002 2019 and 2040 3 2 climate change table 6 displays performance evaluation of the lars wg model in downscaling temperature and precipitation based on r2 rmse and nse indices at bam baft kahnoj and miandeh e jiroft the results indicate that there is a significant correlation between observed and simulated data furthermore the low rmse values and the high r2 and nse values obtained for past years for all stations suggest that lars wg can be applied to predict climatic data in future years table 7 displays the mean annual precipitation temperature and reference evapotranspiration eto x current and future under consideration of diverse climate change scenarios for all sub basins of the study area the results indicate that temperature and et will increase while there will be decrease in precipitation under all considered scenarios furthermore these predicted changes will be the strongest under scenario rcp 8 5 see table 8 figs 4 and 5 show interpolated maps of precipitation and reference et for the study area according to the results the highest amount of precipitation occurs in the northeast of the study area while a decrease in precipitation towards the south of basin can be seen in fig 4 furthermore reference et achieves its highest values in the southern part of the study area fig 5 3 3 sensitivity analysis and calibration the results of sensitivity analysis of invest model are shown in table 8 this analysis aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of invest model predictions to variations in the plant et coefficient k j x for j r for rangeland and j ia for irrigated agriculture as dominant land use types the zhang coefficient z and the climatic factors precipitation and et as can be seen from table 9 a 15 increase decrease in the value of k r x leads to a 9 decrease 11 increase in mean predicted flow while the same variation of k ia x causes a 19 decrease 16 increase in the corresponding model output furthermore for 15 increase decrease in precipitation the wy decreases 34 increases 31 while the same variation in et causes a 21 decrease a 23 increase in the wy to compare the basin wy revealed a rather low sensitivity to the value of z according to the results a change of the z value from 4 to 7 negligibly affects the wy in the study area table 10 the performance of invest model in the wy estimation of the study area was evaluated by means of the coefficients r2 and nse the values of r2 and nse obtained from our calculations amount to 0 85 and 0 82 respectively thus indicating a good performance of invest for simulating the wy in the study area fig 6 3 4 impacts of future land use and climate change scenarios on wy ws and wc fig 7 displays the predicted wy mm yr 1 in the halil river basin under different scenarios of future land use and climate change as shown in fig 7 wy in the basin obtained using the invest model varies between 0 and 301 mm yr 1 in the baseline period and the mean wy of the basin wy 75 mm yr 1 was obtained based on zonal statistics as table command in arcgis 10 7 the mean wy of the basin for all scenarios was obtained in the same way and was compared with the mean wy in the baseline period overall climate change scenarios devoid of changes in land use type i e scenarios 1 3 produce a stronger decrease in wy compared to scenario 4 in which a change in land use is considered by maintaining climate conditions unaltered see fig 7 more precisely under scenario 1 a reduction in the mean wy by 13 6 to 64 77 mm yr 1 is predicted compare with baseline period furthermore the mean wy is reduced by 23 1 to 57 67 mm yr 1 under scenario 2 and by 26 9 to 54 83 mm yr 1 under scenario 3 to compare scenario 4 causes a relatively slight decrease in the mean wy by 2 6 to 73 08 mm yr 1 acting in concert land use change and climate change lead to a stronger decrease in wy scenarios 5 6 and 7 reduce the wy by 16 2 24 4 and 29 5 respectively see fig 7 there is a growing spatial trend in wy under all scenarios from north to south because of the associated increase in precipitation fig 8 shows the changes in wy ws and wc under different scenarios because ws is derived based on the difference between wy and wc its annual value decreases if there is a reduction in the annual wy and or an increase in annual wc while a change in land use type has a small effect on wy such a change plays a vital role in wc in particular the change in land use type from rangelands to agricultural lands in the study area is concatenated with an increase in water demand therefore sub basins 1 and 2 display negative ws under most of the scenarios adopted in the present study especially under the land use scenarios by virtue of the high concentration of agricultural and residential lands and thus the associated high water consumption in the area furthermore under most of the scenarios sub basins 1 and 2 have the lowest wy which results from the projected increase in agricultural and urban land use practices by contrast sub basins 3 and 4 display rather moderate wc and moderate to high wy while the model predicts under most of the scenarios the lowest wc levels and the highest wy and ws for sub basin 5 we conclude that sub basin 5 would meet the water requirement for agricultural and urban land use practices in most sub basins wy and ws will decrease under most of scenarios but this decrease will be most drastic under scenarios involving both climate and land use changes a scenario characterized by land use change but without any climate change scenario 4 would lead to a negligible impact on wy and ws 3 5 implications for water scarcity table 10 displays wy wc and ws changes in m3 ha 1 yr 1 for each land use under current situation and different scenarios as can be seen from the results in addition to current wy for cropland cultivation being low this land use type is associated with the most intensive wc thus leading to negative ws prevention of further cropland development constitutes one measure in favor of ecosystem stability in the regions associated with this land use type furthermore wy for residential lands is low and the related water demand is high thus also leading to negative ws by contrast for the land use types based on rangeland and orchard the amount of wy exceeds the wc thus leading to sufficient ws for the local population some previous studies suggested that land use changes exert a smaller effect on wy supply and consumption compared to climate change but is the most significant driver behind the amount of water demand in the future daneshi et al 2021 however our results suggest that land use type has a significant effect on wy ws and wc that is in line with other studies wang et al 2008 li et al 2018 indeed land use alters the wy and ws by affecting hydrological characteristics such as infiltration et and the capacity of groundwater recharge woldesenbet et al 2017 overall our study reveals distinct impacts of changes in land use type on wy ws and wc specifically a conversion of rangelands into croplands residential lands or orchards enhances considerably the water demand while wc increases under all scenarios involving land use changes scenarios 4 7 this consumption experiences a negligible change in scenarios 1 3 where climate change occurs and land use type remains unchanged as can be seen in table 10 wy and ws decreased under all scenarios for land use types orchard and rangeland however this reduction is the most drastic under scenarios 5 7 which combine climate and land use changes by contrast the corresponding decrease under scenario 4 only land use change is negligible compared to the other scenarios furthermore scenarios 5 7 also lead to the most substantial decrease in wy among all scenarios considered according to our results water scarcity will increase for land use types agriculture and residential lands without regard of the cc and luc scenarios table 10 3 6 economic implications the economic costs of ws are indicated in table 11 in us with ws under the cc and luc scenarios in m3 ha 1 yr 1 multiplied by us 0 4 per cubic meter mousavi and arzani 2014 the highest value of ws was associated with rangelands while orchards appear as the second major vegetation type in terms of ws current mean prices of water supplied by land uses of rangeland and orchard amount to 161 and 100 per hectare respectively while these land use types are not affected by water scarcity a decrease in the associated amount of ws and thus an increase in the economic value of their ws us ha 1 is predicted under different cc and luc scenarios in halil river basin agricultural and residential lands have negative impact on ws juckem et al 2008 daneshi et al 2021 conversion of rangelands to croplands and residential lands yields a decrease in ws of the ecosystem sharafatmandrad and khosravi mahizi 2021 water requirement for these two land use types has exceeded the total amount of available water in the ecosystem wy thus leading to negative ws currently 6 483 and 1 278 per hectare must be thus spent for agricultural and residential lands respectively as shown in table 11 given the increased water scarcity under different scenarios the costs associated with the efforts for compensating water scarcity will increase in the future this increase will be the most drastic under the scenarios that combine climate and land use change scenario 5 6 and 7 4 discussion the first main result of the present study is the observation that invest model predictions are sensitive mainly to precipitation and et by contrast a relatively low sensitivity of the model outcomes to the zhang coefficient z was found these observations are in line for instance with the results of shirmohammadi et al 2020 who investigated the effects of land use and climate change in mordagh chay basin iran furthermore a low sensitivity of invest model results concerning the coefficient z was also found by hamel guswa 2014 based on application of invest for modelling wy in cape fear basin north carolina our analysis complements previous studies on the performance of invest in simulating wy as a function of the various input parameters such as the work of lang et al 2017 shimohammadi et al 2020 and sharafatmandrad and khosravi mashizi 2021 the accuracy of the lcm was evaluated by comparing the predicted change versus observed change in the halil river basin the accuracy assessment of lcm in our study attested for the suitability of this model to simulate land use in 2019 table 4 thus corroborating the conclusions of jahanifar et al 2018 ansari golabi 2019 sardari et al 2019 and shooshtarian et al 2018 tiné et al 2019 reported that performance of lcm model was acceptable for simulation of future changes in open wetlands in the abitibi témiscamingue region québec canada the various reported kappa statistics of agreement in that study are close to our results finding oñate valdivieso and sendra 2010 reported that lcm had high accuracy in generation of land use scenarios for hydrological modeling in the catamayo chira binational basin with a kappa of 0 862 obtained through mlp with the map extracted from observed image furthermore the performance of lars wg in predicting climatic parameters proved satisfactory both in the present study and in previous work bayatvarkeshi et al 2020 daneshi et al 2021 farzanmanesh et al 2012 used lars wg model in iran and found that this model has a reasonable capability of simulating the temperature and precipitation zubaidi et al 2019 found that lars wg has the ability to do excellently in downscaling daily tmax data in columbia city usa change in temperature and precipitation plays important roles in shaping the wy the results of the present work show that climate change scenarios negatively affect wy and ws in the study area by contrast land use change has a rather low negative impact on wy and ws however it should be emphasized that land use changes may have both positive and negative impacts lian et al 2020 so that more research is needed to elucidate the role of land use changes on the overall water system for instance the results of this study are in line with the observations of wu et al 2017 and daneshi et al 2021 who found high share of climate change on water resources compared with a small land use change share by contrast alborzi et al 2018 khazaei et al 2019 and shirmohammadi et al 2020 proposed that land use change has more effect on hydrological changes than the decrease in precipitation we emphasize that the relative effects of land use and climate changes are context dependent in the present study the effect of precipitation and et on wy and ws was overall more significant than the effect of land use changes there are various reasons for this behavior in particular depending on the conversion scenario of one land use type into another the resulting wy may be either positive or negative so that the overall effect of multiple land use changes maybe largely attenuated owing to the combined effect of opposite contributions to the wy by contrast climate change directly changes overflow and has a determining effect on wy while precipitation plays a prevailing role for regional wy furthermore limitations in data and model uncertainties further influence the model predictions for the wy and the characterization of land use and climate change impacts lang et al 2017 it should also be emphasized that model input data are related to environmental attributes of the investigated area but wy is affected by socio economic aspects and human activities model uncertainties thus encode information on socio economic factors which are neglected in the considerations of the present work but which should be considered in future modelling in cc scenarios considered in this study the strongest decrease in water availability is caused by the effects of climate change on precipitation temperature and et evapotranspiration is a significant parameter of both the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance at the earth s surface li et al 2013 li et al 2017a the decrease in precipitation combined with the increase in et and temperature leads to a reduction in wy and a decrease in ws water resource managers need to focus on sustainable methods of water use especially in arid and semi arid regions because water scarcity has become a critical issue due to climate change in these areas our model shows that this impact is exacerbated by the projected increase of land use in particular irrigated agricultural lands and residential regions cropland development can enhance the basin exposure to climate change due to the high potential for et and the concatenated reduction in water yield and supply however this water supply has been reduced in agricultural lands a process that is associated with a reduction of soil permeability in these areas cultivated land encompasses shallow root systems which are associated with a rather low interception ability moreover crop growth has negative impact on water resources owing to the enhancement of water consumption that is concatenated with crop cultivation lang et al 2017 therefore land use changes especially the conversion of rangelands to farmlands and residential lands have a negative effect on water supply by enhancing water consumption one of the driving forces for global growing water demands are the rapid urbanization and the development of irrigated croplands while a decrease in water supply is projected in response to climate change water demand shall enhance in the future owing to the growing population and increasing per capita water consumption krueger et al 2019 mcdonald et al 2014 therefore urbanization and irrigated cropland development are important factors for water scarcity in the study area and constitute major drivers of future water supply consumption and yield in the study area the future land use and cover system should thus account for the local ecological climatological and eco hydrological characteristics of halil river basin and for the impact of urbanization and irrigated cropland development on the local water resources water resource managers need to focus on sustainable methods of water use especially in arid and semi arid regions because water scarcity has become a critical issue due to climate change in these areas the combined effect of land use and climate change in scenarios 5 6 and 7 has undesirable consequences on future water security in the study area cultivated crops are also more strongly influenced by climate change decreased precipitation and water stress compared to natural vegetation due to their shallow roots huete et al 2006 by contrast rangelands especially shrublands and orchards can obtain water from the soil depths using their deep roots under future decreased precipitation tang and dubayah 2017 maeda et al 2017 therefore in view of the negative water balance in agricultural lands this class will be more affected by future climate change given the water scarcity in the halil river basin improved ecosystem management is needed to ensure water availability especially for farmlands and residential areas based on our findings improvement of irrigation efficiency prevention of farmland extension and reduction of municipal wc may help to improve water resource management sustainability under future climate and land use changes 5 conclusions climate and land use change can significantly affect water resources of watershed systems these changes can influence precipitation et soil moisture infiltration water balance and other factors of wy and ws the present study evaluates the effect of luc and cc scenarios on the water resources of halil river basin iran by employing invest to quantitatively evaluate the future changes in wy ws and wc of regional ecosystems one main contribution of the present work is the extensive evaluation of the respective effects of climate and land use change on water resources changes and water scarcity under different environmental human scenarios the understanding of these impacts is important to improve our quantitative knowledge about the relations between wy ws and wc we found that climate change has overall a stronger impact on water resources of the halil river basin compared to land use changes according to our results wy in the study area would not meet the water requirement for developed agricultural land under the broad range of cc and luc scenarios considered furthermore the predicted increase in temperature and precipitation decrease would result in more et wc and more water scarcity therefore the future scenarios assessed in the present work are associated with a potentially strong environmental impact which calls for the development of sustainable development strategies that take the characteristics of the local hydrological system and water resources into account there are indeed various strategies for reducing water scarcity improving water use efficiency and achieving sustainable development goals in the study area for instance such strategies include the improvement of irrigation system efficiency the application of new technologies in agricultural and irrigation systems the control and optimization of cropping pattern choice according to local deficit irrigation the control of per capita water consumption in residential lands the establishment of farmer schools with focus on adaptation to climate change with drought resistant crops and crop rotation furthermore preventing the development of farming activities in the future would be an essential strategy for maintaining supply demand water resource balance in the study area our study shows that economic environmental assessment of water resources under different climate and land use change scenarios provides integrative information for managing water scarcity in arid and semi arid regions credit author statement elham rafiei sardooi conceptualization methodology software the analysis of

24470,water scarcity is a serious problem across many nations in recent years water scarcity has increased due to land use and climate change particularly in areas that are arid or semi arid like for instance iran while land use changes influence hydrological processes at the basin scale the impacts caused by climate change are reflected by dynamics of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration et at the regional to global scale however the respective impacts of land use change and climate change acting in concert on water yield water supply and water consumption are still poorly understood the present study aims at shedding further light into these effects by taking as example the halil river basin in iran to this end the integrated valuation of ecosystem service and tradeoffs invest modelling tool is applied to simulate water yield water supply and water consumption in the study area by adopting a range of scenarios of land use and climate change until 2040 specifically this study applies the hadgem2 es earth system model under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 to assess the effects of future climate change on water scarcity and the land change modeller lcm in terrset geospatial monitoring and modeling software to estimate land use maps in the next two decades our results indicate that water yield and water supply in the study area are more strongly influenced by climate change than by land use change by contrast change in land use provides the more significant impact on water consumption however while water scarcity in halil river basin is controlled mainly by climate change and precipitation the scenarios that combine land use and climate changes yield the most significant impact on water yield and water supply our findings provide thus insights for improving strategies of sustainable development in arid to semi arid regions threatened by land use and climate change driven water scarcity keywords water scarcity climate change invest land use

natural environment to humans liu et al 2017 li et al 2017b which include supply regulation support and culture wei et al 2021 land use changes can have marked effects on ecosystem properties processes and components bonan 2015 gao et al 2017 li et al 2020 by influencing the types patterns and ecological processes of the underlying ecosystem chen et al 2018 such changes consist in the modification of natural landscapes into anthropogenic landscapes and have in combination with rapid population growth potentially significant impacts on ecosystem health and hydrological processes including base flow soil water content groundwater recharge surface evapotranspiration as well as annual mean discharge joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 daneshi et al 2021 changes in land use influence the provision and value of ecosystem services especially on wy li et al 2018 furthermore climate change has significant impacts on the hydrologic balance at the regional basin scale thereby affecting runoff tu et al 2009 intensity of floods and drought frequency joorabisn shooshtari et al 2017 climate induced temperature increase is expected to considerably enhance water demand in the years ahead thereby leading to a reduction of water availability shirmohammadi et al 2020 water related ecosystem services such as water supply ws and regulation will be thus directly and indirectly affected by climate change chen et al 2018 wy is mainly controlled by precipitation and et yin et al 2020 and provides a key ecosystem function index of major relevance in agriculture industry fisheries domestic activities and life quality wei et al 2021 a broad range of studies on the quantification of water resources have focused on the impacts of land use changes on wy tadesse et al 2015 gao et al 2017 li et al 2018 furthermore considerable effort has been made to shed light on the standalone potential impacts of climate change on water resources ficklin et al 2009 mcfarlane et al 2012 zahabiyoun et al 2013 molina navarro et al 2016 however only a few studies have considered the combined effects of land use change and climate change on hydrological components for instance lópez moreno et al 2014 applied a hydro ecologic model for the upper aragón river basin in the central spanish pyrenees to evaluate the combined effect of land cover and climate changes on streamflow the authors found an association of this combined effect with a decrease of 29 6 in annual streamflow however wei et al 2021 showed that wy in the upstream regions of shule river basin increased significantly due to climate and land use changes furthermore joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 studied the influence of land cover and climate change on the evolution of water discharge in the neka river basin while clerici et al 2019 investigated the evolution of wy in the colombian andes the observations made by both teams suggested a stronger response of hydrological systems to climate evolution than to changes in the land use patterns joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 clerici et al 2019 further investigation is thus required to develop a better understanding of the response of hydrological systems and processes to climate and land use changes given the dynamics of land use and the broad range of climate change scenarios projected for the coming years ecosystem services have been quantified by shirmohammadi et al 2020 in a case study that considered a semiarid basin in iran by considering six combined climate land use change scenarios this study projected a decrease of wy under business as usual land use scenario in association with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios until 2030 iran is in a semi arid climatic zone daneshi et al 2021 that faces high inter annual spatio temporal patterns of precipitation variability and scarcity of fresh water molina navarro et al 2016 therefore quantitative information about the impacts of land cover and climate changes on hydrological responses is essential pre requisite for conservation planning and for developing sustainable water resource management strategies in the present manuscript we present a case study of wy response to projected climate and land cover change scenarios in halil river basin iran to this end we apply the integrated valuation of environmental service and tradeoffs invest model which proved superior to other spatially explicit ecosystem service modelling tools such as the soil and water assessment tool swat and the artificial intelligence for ecosystem services aries tools with respect to applications considering land use change scenarios vigerstol and aukema 2011 indeed invest has been successfully applied for different purposes such as modeling wy yang et al 2020 sediment retention hamel et al 2015 carbon storage and sequestration zhao et al 2019 nutrient exports and retention redhead et al 2018 and habitat quality gong et al 2019 however there are few applications of invest for wy modelling under future climate and land use changes particularly in iran daneshi et al 2021 therefore this manuscript presents a model to predict the combined effects of climate and land use change on water security as well as the costs associated with the concatenated water scarcity overall the specific objectives of this study consist in 1 assessing the dynamics of historical and future land cover changes thereby covering a time span of 39 years 2002 2040 2 projecting climatic change scenarios using lars wg long ashton research stochastic weather generator under specific greenhouse gas emission scenarios 3 applying the invest model to compute future wy ws and wc under future climate and land cover change scenarios in the halil river basin 4 estimating costs of ws associated with the various climate and land use change scenarios considered 5 discussing the contribution of the model results to the understanding of how future land use and climate change may impact hydrological resources and management in arid to semi arid regions based on the case study of halil river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area halil river basin is located in the south eastern of iran in the kerman province within 28 05 n to 29 15 n and 56 55 e to 58 15 e fig 1 the basin comprises an area of 9204 13 km2 is a tributary to the jazmourian wetland and yields surface water for the local agricultural activities local elevation ranges from 498 m to 3 868 m above sea level with altitude decreasing from north to south the upper and the middle parts of the basin include mountainous areas while the downstream parts form a flat plain sarhadi et al 2012 the mean annual precipitation in the study area ranges from 155 1 mm to 425 8 mm while the mean annual temperature varies from 16 7 to 25 8 c and the climate is arid and semi arid furthermore the study area hosts a broad range of vegetation species including irrigated orchards annual irrigated cultivated crops and natural vegetation irrigation of cultivated crops wheat barley corn watermelon cucumber potato onion and tomato constitute the most water intensive type of land use orchards are mostly covered by citruses while natural vegetation which colonizes a large part of the area under investigation is applied for livestock grazing type of land use halil river basin has a total population of 399 043 individuals living in 24 local communities statistical center for iran 2016 the basin is one of the major pillars of agricultural crops production in iran and the local economy depends much on it however more than 60 of agricultural lands have been negatively influenced by climate change cc and decreased precipitation in recent years thereby leading to socio economic problems and triggering emigration from the villages jiroft agriculture organization 2009 2 2 methodology this section briefly describes the main ingredients of invest model which is adopted to compute wy following this description a discussion on data requirements as well as on model calibration and validation is presented subsequently the climate and land use change scenarios adopted in this study as well as the procedure for the computation of wy supply and consumption are specified we note that a list of the abbreviations used in the present manuscript is provided to the reader at the beginning of this manuscript furthermore a flowchart of the research methodology is displayed in fig 2 2 2 1 the invest model in the present study the invest model from the natural capital project tallis et al 2011 is applied to estimate the wy i e the amount of runoff from the watershed this wy is modelled based on the budyko curve budyko 1974 which describes theoretically the water and energy limits from the catchment water balance the annual wy y j x at position x within a watershed can be estimated under consideration of local land use or land cover type j using the equation sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 1 y j x 1 ae t j x p x p x where ae t j x is the associated annual actual et while p x denotes the annual precipitation at position i e at pixel x sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 furthermore the ratio ae t j x p x is computed following the model of zhang et al 2001 2 ae t j x p x 1 ω x r j x 1 ω x r j x 1 r j x where r j x is the budyko drying index ratio of actual et to precipitation at pixel x when the land use or cover type is j sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 while ω x is given by zhang et al 2001 sharp et al 2018 3 ω x z awc x p x 1 25 in eq 3 awc x denotes the volumetric plant available water capacity mm which encodes information on soil texture and effective rooting depth zhou et al 2005 and gives the water amount that can be held in the soil and made available to plants furthermore z zhang coefficient is a seasonal rainfall factor that depends on monthly precipitation distribution and precipitation depth sharp et al 2018 this parameter is related to the number of rainfall events n higher than 1 mm yr 1 during the given period of time through the equation 4 z 0 2 n we use the following equation to compute the budyko dryness index sharafatmandrad and mashizi 2021 5 r j x k j x eto x p x where eto x is the reference et mm and k j x is the vegetation et coefficient at position x eto x encodes information on local climatic conditions while k j x is determined by the vegetation properties of land use at pixel x allen wardell et al 1998 allen et al 1998 values of r j x larger than 1 indicate arid climate conditions budyko 1974 2 2 2 data requirements and preparation this section specifies the input data required by invest model and the sources of the data used in the present study 2 2 2 1 watershed extraction sub watershed maps were created based on digital elevation model dem and arc hydro tools in arcgis 10 7 pascual et al 2015 the study area was divided into five sub watersheds 2 2 2 2 precipitation the invest model requires maps of precipitation and maps of et in the present study four meteorological stations were selected in and around the study area the location of each station is shown in fig 1 the datasets containing the information of minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation and radiation were obtained from the iran meteorological organization thirty years of data 1989 2017 from 4 weather stations in the area were applied for interpolation the stations of baft kahnoj bam and jiroft are at altitude 2280 469 7 1066 9 and 601 m asl above the average sea level respectively moreover jiroft station is located within the watershed while the distance from the stations of baft kahnoj and bam to the watershed is 26 19 6 and 40 73 km respectively we have tested different interpolation methods available within the geostatistical analyst package of arcgis 10 7 however the inverse distance weighting idw method displayed the lowest rmse compared to other methods such as kriging and cokriging therefore we have decided for idw as interpolating method of the climatic parameters in the study area 2 2 2 3 land use maps landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images for the years of 2002 and 2019 were used to evaluate land use change trends in this period after preprocessing the images supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood ml method was used in envi 5 3 to provide the land use maps ml was chosen here as its performance and accuracy in classification of remotely sensed data proved satisfactory in previous studies sun et al 2013 daneshi et al 2021 the 116 training polygons for the classification were designated through field studies and google earth images then land use maps were classified into seven classes bare land rangeland orchards rock agricultural land urban and open water in this study the kappa coefficient cohen 1960 and overall accuracy congalton 1991 were applied using an error matrix to evaluate the accuracy of the classified maps these indicators evaluate the simulation accuracy and the agreement between reference and simulated maps overall accuracy ranges from 0 to 100 and shows the possibility that a pixel classified into a specified class actually indicates that class on the ground kappa index is a measure of agreement between observed and predicted maps it usually falls between 0 and 1 where 1 represents a perfect agreement and 0 indicates that there is no agreement between two datasets kappa statistic represents the expected agreement between two datasets when the given category is allocated coincidentally over the map van vliet et al 2011 2 2 2 4 reference et there are various methods for estimating the reference et eto x such as penman monteith and hargreaves samani and thornthwaite mather monteith 1965 penman 1948 thornthwaite mather 1951 hargreaves samani 1982 the penman monteith approach is one of the most widely used methods silva et al 2013 but one main drawback of the penman monteith equation is that this equation requires weather data that are not available in most of the stations trajkovic 2007 as it is the case of the study area considered in the present work the results of sheikh et al 2013 indicated that the hargreaves samani model droogers and allen 2002 generated the highest degree of accuracy compared to blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1950 allen pruitt 1986 priestley taylor priestley taylor 1972 pereira 2004 turc turc 1961 trajkovic kolakovic 2009 thornthwaite mather thornthwaite mather 1957 and makkink makkink 1957 de bruin lablans 1998 models in arid and semi arid regions moreover the results of raziei and pereira 2013 for a wide range of climates in iran showed that the estimation of eto by hargreaves samani method has higher accuracy compared to the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 when applied to the arid and semi arid climate of iran therefore we model of hargeaves samani was also applied in the present study to estimate eto specifically the reference evapotranspiration eto x is modelled using the equation 6 eto x 0 0023 0 408 r a t mean x 17 8 t max x t min x where r a is the extraterrestrial solar radiation in mj m 2 d 1 which is estimated from a table that gives the approximate monthly value of r a for the northern hemisphere hargreaves samani 1982 furthermore t mean x is the local daily mean temperature c while t max x and t min x denote the daily maximum and minimum temperatures c respectively droogers and allen 2002 temperature data recorded from 4 synoptic stations were used to estimate the values of t mean x t max x and t min x based on the monthly average of eto x and precipitation the average annual precipitation and the mean annual potential et were calculated subsequently the spatial maps of the average annual precipitation and et were acquired using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation over the entire watershed in arcgis 10 7 2 2 2 5 vegetation et coefficient in eq 5 the et coefficient k j x at position x due to land use type j is computed using the equation 7 k j x m 1 12 k j m x eto x m m 1 12 eto x m where eto x m means the average of eto x at month m i e the mathematical operator denotes the time average of the embraced argument while the index m denotes the specific month for which this average has been computed m 1 for january m 2 for february m 12 for december this coefficient adopts values ranging from 0 to 1 5 depending on the land use type as specified in the invest user s guide sharp et al 2018 2 2 2 6 root restricting layer depth the soil depth of the study area was acquired from the harmonized world soil database hwsd with 1 1000 000 scale fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 fischer et al 2008 moreover the maximum root depth for the various land use types in the study area was obtained based on canadell et al 1996 and tallis et al 2011 2 2 2 7 paw plant available water capacity in the present study plant available water capacity was estimated using the model presented by de ridder and van keulen 1995 the stratified random soil sampling method was used for soil sampling hengl 2003 for this purpose land use map was firstly prepared then soil samples were randomly collected based on the area of each land use from 0 to 30 cm depth therefore 75 soil samples were collected in this method the number of soil samples is higher in land uses with higher area then soil texture and bulk density of soil were measured in soil laboratory finally the plant available water capacity was calculated using the following equation de ridder and van keulen 1995 8 paw fc pwp where fc cm3 cm 3 and pwp cm3 cm 3 denote values of water content at field capacity and wilting point respectively and are obtained using de ridder and van keulen 1995 9 fc 0 37 0 0035 s bd 100 10 pwp 0 007 0 0039 cl bd 100 with s and cl standing for the sand percentage 50 2 000 μ m and clay percentage 2 μ m respectively while bd is the bulk density of the soil g cm 3 table 1 lists the values of the parameters applied for invest in the present work we note that other pedotransfer functions take into account different soil properties i e organic matter gravel salinity and result in a better estimation of soil hydraulic parameters however for the purpose of the present study the collected soil parameters i e sand percentage clay percentage and soil bulk density constitute the parameters that we need to estimate plant available water capacity pawc mm therefore other soil parameters such as organic matter gravel and salinity were not collected although they are important for further characterization of soil hydraulic properties 2 2 2 8 model sensitivity analysis and calibration in this study a sensitivity analysis sa was conducted to quantify the effect of changes of input parameters which are the zhang coefficient z the et coefficients k j x j r for rangeland and j ia for irrigated agriculture as prevailing land use types and the climatic factors i e precipitation and et on the model output which is the annual wy sánchez canales et al 2012 shirmohammadi et al 2020 in the present study the method used in the sensitivity analysis was the one at a time oat method in this method variations in the output variables are induced by varying one input factor at a time while keeping all other factors fixed pianosi et al 2016 in the sensitivity analysis performed here z is calculated based on the number of rainfall events n higher than 1 mm yr 1 during the given period donohue et al 2012 and is then calibrated by comparing model predictions with observation data while z values vary between 1 to 30 sharp et al 2018 the average number of rainy events higher than 1 mm yr 1 in the study area is equal to 30 equation 4 yields thus z 6 donohue et al 2012 which is set as initial value for the model while z adopts values between 4 and 7 during calibration therefore the model was firstly run by adopting an initial z value z 6 and the corresponding wy was obtained subsequently the model was run by taking different other z values in the range from 4 to 7 specifically 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 5 and 7 and the obtained wy values were compared to the wy based on the initial z value z 6 the effect of the z value on the changes of wy was then investigated more precisely if wy changes are significant and the model output changes substantially compared to the initial estimate upon a change in a given parameter then it is concluded that the model is sensitive to the referred parameter we also considered other ranges for example 5 to 8 however for z values 4 the predicted water yield did not change much compared with predicted value using z 4 while using z 7 did not produce a substantial change in the predicted water yield compared to the value obtained with z 7 we note that the same range of z values between 4 and 7 has been applied in previous work by shirmohammadi et al 2020 and daneshi et al 2020 which was related to the climatic conditions of iran with a similar value of the number of rainfall events n higher than 1 mm yr 1 as in the present work the relative error defined below is computed to quantify the deviation of a predicted quantity from its observed counterpart this relative error is expressed in percentual change of the output results compared to the initial run observed value upon a change in the z value and is calculated using the following equation 11 relative error predicted value observed value observed value 100 we follow previous hydrological modeling tassew et al 2019 zhao et al 2009 and adopt a threshold of 10 to classify the relative error in our analysis as significant or not therefore the difference between observed and simulated value of a variable change is regarded as significant if is larger 10 otherwise the agreement between observed and simulated values is considered satisfactory tassew et al 2019 zhao et al 2009 in the present study the relative error in the water yield was smaller than 2 and thus negligible for any change in z within the aforementioned range of applied values furthermore the values of et coefficients k j x are obtained following the invest user s guide sharp et al 2018 irrigated agriculture constitutes the land use type associated with the most intensive water consumption agriculture ardakanian 2005 while rangeland is the prevailing land use type in the study area here the model starts assuming k ia x 0 65 and k r x 0 85 independent of the position x allen et al 1998 whereupon 15 changes in the respective et coefficients are applied and the updated model output is compared to its initial value following previous work to evaluate the model sensitivity to precipitation and et parameters we applied 15 changes in precipitation and reference et shirmohammadi et al 2020 and then compared the model output with the initial run accordingly the model was firstly run with its initial values of parameters and the initial wy was obtained based on these parameters thereafter changes from 15 to 15 were applied to these initial parameter values and their effects on the output wy were evaluated finally the wy obtained from the initial run was compared with the wy obtained from these 15 changes in the parameters the parameter that creates the most significant variation in the model output compared with the baseline initial value of wy is considered as the most relevant parameter in the sensitivity analysis process moreover to calibrate the invest model data from the kahnak e sheybani hydrometric station 1989 2019 located at the basin outlet were considered the calibration of the model was conducted by comparing the predicted wy with the available data from the hydrometric station the performance of invest model in the wy estimation of the study area was assessed by using the coefficient of determination r2 ozer 1985 and the nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which are given by 12 r 2 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o σ s σ o 2 13 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi and si are the observed and simulated data respectively with o and s denoting their respective averages and σ s and σ o standing for the associated standard deviation values both r2 and nse can adopt values from 0 to 1 and model performance is considered better the closer these parameters are to unity 2 2 2 9 climate and land use change scenarios for assessing the impacts of climate and land use change on water scarcity in the halil river basin seven land use and climate change cc scenarios were adopted 1 scenario 1 cc under scenario rcp 2 6 no luc 2 scenario 2 cc under scenario rcp 4 5 no luc 3 scenario 3 cc under scenario rcp 8 5 no luc 4 scenario 4 only luc 5 scenario 5 cc under scenario rcp 2 6 luc 6 scenario 6 cc under scenario rcp 4 5 luc 7 scenario 7 cc under scenario rcp 8 5 luc intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 has published the new climate change scenarios for the fifth assessment report ar5 called as representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 these scenarios were named based on emission pathways and greenhouse gas concentrations predicted for future times riahi et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 there are different general circulation models gcms for predicting climate change however in the present work we have decided for using the hadgem2 es model because this gcm has been widely applied in previous work to investigate climate change in iran tizro et al 2019 lotfi et al 2020 sharafati et al 2021 the hadgem2 es earth system model is thus run here under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 to assess the effects of future climate change on water scarcity the long ashton research stochastic weather generator lars wg was used to downscale the general circulation model gcm outputs and to create future time series of tmin tmax and precipitation in the period from 2031 to 2050 maghsood et al 2019 then based on the predicted temperature and precipitation data future reference et was calculated using the method of hargreaves and samani droogers and allen 2002 to create the land use map for the next 21 years i e until 2040 based on land use maps of 2002 and 2019 we applied the land change modeler lcm within terrset software eastman 2016 azareh et al 2021 furthermore multi layer perceptron mlp neural network was used for transition potential modeling in lcm mlp models the transition potential of each pixel to another pixel based on driver variables e g elevation distance to river etc thereby running multiple transitions at the same time eastman 2016 in the present study the transition potential maps were produced using the driver variables that were entered into each sub model structure the mlp then creates pixels for each chosen transition and adjusts the weights to enhance accuracy as the rmse root mean square error decreases eventually for scenario 2002 2019 five transition sub models were produced comprising rangeland to agriculture rangeland to bare land rangeland to orchard rangeland to urban and water to bare land seven explanatory variables including distance to river distance to road distance to urban distance to agriculture slope angle slope aspect and elevation were used these variables have been broadly applied to model land use kumar et al 2015 anand et al 2018 in the next step the model produced a predicted land use map for 2019 using markov chain analysis that was validated with the real 2019 land use map a markov chain determines the change probability from each class to another land use category by predicting future dynamics based on the current state thereby yielding a projection for future land use based on transition potential maps eastman 2016 furthermore kappa statistics were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and the agreement between real and predicted land use maps of 2019 the kappa statistic usually takes values between 0 and 1 where 1 denotes perfect agreement and 0 stands for perfect disagreement between a pair of maps van vliet et al 2011 kappa indices applied in the present study are kappa for no information kno kappa for grid cell level location klocation kappa for stratum level location klocation strata and kappa standard kstandard pontius 2000 cohen 1960 finally the prediction for 2040 was made using mlp and markov chain analysis to calculate land use changes the wy of the watershed was then predicted under each scenario for the period 2031 2050 and compared with the baseline period 1989 2019 2 2 2 10 water consumption wc consumptive water was estimated for agriculture and horticulture crops based on the water requirements of each crop using the software netwat alizadeh kamali 2007 which is developed by iran s national water resources development plan and a survey of provincial extension agents to acquire a dataset of mean water demands for various crops in iran water use is consumptive when water is removed from a water body surface or ground water source or basin for an objective and is not returned to the water resource system such as water used for the irrigation of agriculture and horticulture crops assigned to the irrigated agriculture class and orchard class and the human consumption assigned to the residential class sharp et al 2018 based on data from the ministry of agriculture jihad of iran in 2019 about 55 27 of cultivated lands in jiroft city was related to agricultural crops while 46 73 of these lands were associated with horticultural crops moreover agricultural and horticultural crops encompassed 49 9 and 50 9 respectively of cultivated lands in anbarabad most horticultural products from these two cities correspond to citrus gardens while agricultural products are mainly wheat barley corn watermelon cucumber potato onion and tomato these crops are irrigated using diverse irrigation methods of high water requirement so that the mean annual wc associated with agricultural land amounts to 16 250 m3 ha 1 based on netwat outputs extracted by agriculture ministry of iran to compare the mean annual wc due to citrus gardens obtained from netwat outputs is much lower around 1 130 m3 ha 1 domestic and residential wc water consumption depends on the total human population in the study area jiroft and anbarabad have estimated populations of 308 858 and 90 185 inhabitants respectively statistical centre of iran 2016 the average wc per person in iran is 150 liters per day tasnimnews 2019 while the per capita water consumption in developed countries is 70 liters per day the per capita water consumption in iran reaches 150 liters per day and the water consumption rate in iran is higher than in developed countries mehrnews 2021 based on present land use as well as on population and livestock densities in the study area the mean annual wc in residential areas is 3 246 5 m3 ha 1 2 2 2 11 costs associated with water supply ws water scarcity enhancement and ws reduction will increase the costs associated with water use brouwer et al 2015 ws is obtained based on the difference between wy and wc under climate and land use change in present and future times sharp et al 2018 the supplied water price by the ecosystem was estimated 0 4 per cubic meter for iran mousavi and arzani 2014 in this study price of supplied water was firstly calculated for every land use subsequently the economic value associated with the predicted reduction of ws was estimated 3 results 3 1 land use change land use maps of 2002 and 2019 were obtained using the maximum likelihood ml classification algorithm and then were categorized into seven classes bare land rangeland orchards bare rock agricultural lands urban and open water fig 3 table 2 indicates the accuracy and the values of kappa for land use maps created using ml classification algorithm for both years of 2002 and 2019 for predicting future land use change 2040 the land change modeller lcm in terrset software was applied to this end transition potential modeling was first conducted using the mlp neural network under the factors comprising accuracy rate while training and testing rmse were used to assess the transition potential modeling table 3 according to the results there is a high accuracy rate of mlp in all transition sub models 67 5 to 85 1 after training the mlp markov chain was used to determine the quantity of change thereafter the land use map of 2019 was simulated based on the maps of transition potential and the quantity of change obtained from the markov chain the kappa metrics were applied to quantify the agreement between the predicted and the ground truth maps in 2019 the high values of the kappa coefficients attest for the good performance of lcm in the simulation of land use for 2019 table 4 this good performance provides us thus with a successful proof of concept for the application of lcm in the prediction of land use for 2040 table 5 indicates the area of each land use class in 2002 2019 and 2040 the results indicate an increase in the areas associated with bare lands orchards agricultural lands and residential lands both for the period of 2002 2019 and for the subsequent years until 2040 this scenario contrasts with the results obtained for rangelands and open water water bodies areas for which negative values of land use change are obtained fig 3 displays the various land use categories in 2002 2019 and 2040 3 2 climate change table 6 displays performance evaluation of the lars wg model in downscaling temperature and precipitation based on r2 rmse and nse indices at bam baft kahnoj and miandeh e jiroft the results indicate that there is a significant correlation between observed and simulated data furthermore the low rmse values and the high r2 and nse values obtained for past years for all stations suggest that lars wg can be applied to predict climatic data in future years table 7 displays the mean annual precipitation temperature and reference evapotranspiration eto x current and future under consideration of diverse climate change scenarios for all sub basins of the study area the results indicate that temperature and et will increase while there will be decrease in precipitation under all considered scenarios furthermore these predicted changes will be the strongest under scenario rcp 8 5 see table 8 figs 4 and 5 show interpolated maps of precipitation and reference et for the study area according to the results the highest amount of precipitation occurs in the northeast of the study area while a decrease in precipitation towards the south of basin can be seen in fig 4 furthermore reference et achieves its highest values in the southern part of the study area fig 5 3 3 sensitivity analysis and calibration the results of sensitivity analysis of invest model are shown in table 8 this analysis aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of invest model predictions to variations in the plant et coefficient k j x for j r for rangeland and j ia for irrigated agriculture as dominant land use types the zhang coefficient z and the climatic factors precipitation and et as can be seen from table 9 a 15 increase decrease in the value of k r x leads to a 9 decrease 11 increase in mean predicted flow while the same variation of k ia x causes a 19 decrease 16 increase in the corresponding model output furthermore for 15 increase decrease in precipitation the wy decreases 34 increases 31 while the same variation in et causes a 21 decrease a 23 increase in the wy to compare the basin wy revealed a rather low sensitivity to the value of z according to the results a change of the z value from 4 to 7 negligibly affects the wy in the study area table 10 the performance of invest model in the wy estimation of the study area was evaluated by means of the coefficients r2 and nse the values of r2 and nse obtained from our calculations amount to 0 85 and 0 82 respectively thus indicating a good performance of invest for simulating the wy in the study area fig 6 3 4 impacts of future land use and climate change scenarios on wy ws and wc fig 7 displays the predicted wy mm yr 1 in the halil river basin under different scenarios of future land use and climate change as shown in fig 7 wy in the basin obtained using the invest model varies between 0 and 301 mm yr 1 in the baseline period and the mean wy of the basin wy 75 mm yr 1 was obtained based on zonal statistics as table command in arcgis 10 7 the mean wy of the basin for all scenarios was obtained in the same way and was compared with the mean wy in the baseline period overall climate change scenarios devoid of changes in land use type i e scenarios 1 3 produce a stronger decrease in wy compared to scenario 4 in which a change in land use is considered by maintaining climate conditions unaltered see fig 7 more precisely under scenario 1 a reduction in the mean wy by 13 6 to 64 77 mm yr 1 is predicted compare with baseline period furthermore the mean wy is reduced by 23 1 to 57 67 mm yr 1 under scenario 2 and by 26 9 to 54 83 mm yr 1 under scenario 3 to compare scenario 4 causes a relatively slight decrease in the mean wy by 2 6 to 73 08 mm yr 1 acting in concert land use change and climate change lead to a stronger decrease in wy scenarios 5 6 and 7 reduce the wy by 16 2 24 4 and 29 5 respectively see fig 7 there is a growing spatial trend in wy under all scenarios from north to south because of the associated increase in precipitation fig 8 shows the changes in wy ws and wc under different scenarios because ws is derived based on the difference between wy and wc its annual value decreases if there is a reduction in the annual wy and or an increase in annual wc while a change in land use type has a small effect on wy such a change plays a vital role in wc in particular the change in land use type from rangelands to agricultural lands in the study area is concatenated with an increase in water demand therefore sub basins 1 and 2 display negative ws under most of the scenarios adopted in the present study especially under the land use scenarios by virtue of the high concentration of agricultural and residential lands and thus the associated high water consumption in the area furthermore under most of the scenarios sub basins 1 and 2 have the lowest wy which results from the projected increase in agricultural and urban land use practices by contrast sub basins 3 and 4 display rather moderate wc and moderate to high wy while the model predicts under most of the scenarios the lowest wc levels and the highest wy and ws for sub basin 5 we conclude that sub basin 5 would meet the water requirement for agricultural and urban land use practices in most sub basins wy and ws will decrease under most of scenarios but this decrease will be most drastic under scenarios involving both climate and land use changes a scenario characterized by land use change but without any climate change scenario 4 would lead to a negligible impact on wy and ws 3 5 implications for water scarcity table 10 displays wy wc and ws changes in m3 ha 1 yr 1 for each land use under current situation and different scenarios as can be seen from the results in addition to current wy for cropland cultivation being low this land use type is associated with the most intensive wc thus leading to negative ws prevention of further cropland development constitutes one measure in favor of ecosystem stability in the regions associated with this land use type furthermore wy for residential lands is low and the related water demand is high thus also leading to negative ws by contrast for the land use types based on rangeland and orchard the amount of wy exceeds the wc thus leading to sufficient ws for the local population some previous studies suggested that land use changes exert a smaller effect on wy supply and consumption compared to climate change but is the most significant driver behind the amount of water demand in the future daneshi et al 2021 however our results suggest that land use type has a significant effect on wy ws and wc that is in line with other studies wang et al 2008 li et al 2018 indeed land use alters the wy and ws by affecting hydrological characteristics such as infiltration et and the capacity of groundwater recharge woldesenbet et al 2017 overall our study reveals distinct impacts of changes in land use type on wy ws and wc specifically a conversion of rangelands into croplands residential lands or orchards enhances considerably the water demand while wc increases under all scenarios involving land use changes scenarios 4 7 this consumption experiences a negligible change in scenarios 1 3 where climate change occurs and land use type remains unchanged as can be seen in table 10 wy and ws decreased under all scenarios for land use types orchard and rangeland however this reduction is the most drastic under scenarios 5 7 which combine climate and land use changes by contrast the corresponding decrease under scenario 4 only land use change is negligible compared to the other scenarios furthermore scenarios 5 7 also lead to the most substantial decrease in wy among all scenarios considered according to our results water scarcity will increase for land use types agriculture and residential lands without regard of the cc and luc scenarios table 10 3 6 economic implications the economic costs of ws are indicated in table 11 in us with ws under the cc and luc scenarios in m3 ha 1 yr 1 multiplied by us 0 4 per cubic meter mousavi and arzani 2014 the highest value of ws was associated with rangelands while orchards appear as the second major vegetation type in terms of ws current mean prices of water supplied by land uses of rangeland and orchard amount to 161 and 100 per hectare respectively while these land use types are not affected by water scarcity a decrease in the associated amount of ws and thus an increase in the economic value of their ws us ha 1 is predicted under different cc and luc scenarios in halil river basin agricultural and residential lands have negative impact on ws juckem et al 2008 daneshi et al 2021 conversion of rangelands to croplands and residential lands yields a decrease in ws of the ecosystem sharafatmandrad and khosravi mahizi 2021 water requirement for these two land use types has exceeded the total amount of available water in the ecosystem wy thus leading to negative ws currently 6 483 and 1 278 per hectare must be thus spent for agricultural and residential lands respectively as shown in table 11 given the increased water scarcity under different scenarios the costs associated with the efforts for compensating water scarcity will increase in the future this increase will be the most drastic under the scenarios that combine climate and land use change scenario 5 6 and 7 4 discussion the first main result of the present study is the observation that invest model predictions are sensitive mainly to precipitation and et by contrast a relatively low sensitivity of the model outcomes to the zhang coefficient z was found these observations are in line for instance with the results of shirmohammadi et al 2020 who investigated the effects of land use and climate change in mordagh chay basin iran furthermore a low sensitivity of invest model results concerning the coefficient z was also found by hamel guswa 2014 based on application of invest for modelling wy in cape fear basin north carolina our analysis complements previous studies on the performance of invest in simulating wy as a function of the various input parameters such as the work of lang et al 2017 shimohammadi et al 2020 and sharafatmandrad and khosravi mashizi 2021 the accuracy of the lcm was evaluated by comparing the predicted change versus observed change in the halil river basin the accuracy assessment of lcm in our study attested for the suitability of this model to simulate land use in 2019 table 4 thus corroborating the conclusions of jahanifar et al 2018 ansari golabi 2019 sardari et al 2019 and shooshtarian et al 2018 tiné et al 2019 reported that performance of lcm model was acceptable for simulation of future changes in open wetlands in the abitibi témiscamingue region québec canada the various reported kappa statistics of agreement in that study are close to our results finding oñate valdivieso and sendra 2010 reported that lcm had high accuracy in generation of land use scenarios for hydrological modeling in the catamayo chira binational basin with a kappa of 0 862 obtained through mlp with the map extracted from observed image furthermore the performance of lars wg in predicting climatic parameters proved satisfactory both in the present study and in previous work bayatvarkeshi et al 2020 daneshi et al 2021 farzanmanesh et al 2012 used lars wg model in iran and found that this model has a reasonable capability of simulating the temperature and precipitation zubaidi et al 2019 found that lars wg has the ability to do excellently in downscaling daily tmax data in columbia city usa change in temperature and precipitation plays important roles in shaping the wy the results of the present work show that climate change scenarios negatively affect wy and ws in the study area by contrast land use change has a rather low negative impact on wy and ws however it should be emphasized that land use changes may have both positive and negative impacts lian et al 2020 so that more research is needed to elucidate the role of land use changes on the overall water system for instance the results of this study are in line with the observations of wu et al 2017 and daneshi et al 2021 who found high share of climate change on water resources compared with a small land use change share by contrast alborzi et al 2018 khazaei et al 2019 and shirmohammadi et al 2020 proposed that land use change has more effect on hydrological changes than the decrease in precipitation we emphasize that the relative effects of land use and climate changes are context dependent in the present study the effect of precipitation and et on wy and ws was overall more significant than the effect of land use changes there are various reasons for this behavior in particular depending on the conversion scenario of one land use type into another the resulting wy may be either positive or negative so that the overall effect of multiple land use changes maybe largely attenuated owing to the combined effect of opposite contributions to the wy by contrast climate change directly changes overflow and has a determining effect on wy while precipitation plays a prevailing role for regional wy furthermore limitations in data and model uncertainties further influence the model predictions for the wy and the characterization of land use and climate change impacts lang et al 2017 it should also be emphasized that model input data are related to environmental attributes of the investigated area but wy is affected by socio economic aspects and human activities model uncertainties thus encode information on socio economic factors which are neglected in the considerations of the present work but which should be considered in future modelling in cc scenarios considered in this study the strongest decrease in water availability is caused by the effects of climate change on precipitation temperature and et evapotranspiration is a significant parameter of both the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance at the earth s surface li et al 2013 li et al 2017a the decrease in precipitation combined with the increase in et and temperature leads to a reduction in wy and a decrease in ws water resource managers need to focus on sustainable methods of water use especially in arid and semi arid regions because water scarcity has become a critical issue due to climate change in these areas our model shows that this impact is exacerbated by the projected increase of land use in particular irrigated agricultural lands and residential regions cropland development can enhance the basin exposure to climate change due to the high potential for et and the concatenated reduction in water yield and supply however this water supply has been reduced in agricultural lands a process that is associated with a reduction of soil permeability in these areas cultivated land encompasses shallow root systems which are associated with a rather low interception ability moreover crop growth has negative impact on water resources owing to the enhancement of water consumption that is concatenated with crop cultivation lang et al 2017 therefore land use changes especially the conversion of rangelands to farmlands and residential lands have a negative effect on water supply by enhancing water consumption one of the driving forces for global growing water demands are the rapid urbanization and the development of irrigated croplands while a decrease in water supply is projected in response to climate change water demand shall enhance in the future owing to the growing population and increasing per capita water consumption krueger et al 2019 mcdonald et al 2014 therefore urbanization and irrigated cropland development are important factors for water scarcity in the study area and constitute major drivers of future water supply consumption and yield in the study area the future land use and cover system should thus account for the local ecological climatological and eco hydrological characteristics of halil river basin and for the impact of urbanization and irrigated cropland development on the local water resources water resource managers need to focus on sustainable methods of water use especially in arid and semi arid regions because water scarcity has become a critical issue due to climate change in these areas the combined effect of land use and climate change in scenarios 5 6 and 7 has undesirable consequences on future water security in the study area cultivated crops are also more strongly influenced by climate change decreased precipitation and water stress compared to natural vegetation due to their shallow roots huete et al 2006 by contrast rangelands especially shrublands and orchards can obtain water from the soil depths using their deep roots under future decreased precipitation tang and dubayah 2017 maeda et al 2017 therefore in view of the negative water balance in agricultural lands this class will be more affected by future climate change given the water scarcity in the halil river basin improved ecosystem management is needed to ensure water availability especially for farmlands and residential areas based on our findings improvement of irrigation efficiency prevention of farmland extension and reduction of municipal wc may help to improve water resource management sustainability under future climate and land use changes 5 conclusions climate and land use change can significantly affect water resources of watershed systems these changes can influence precipitation et soil moisture infiltration water balance and other factors of wy and ws the present study evaluates the effect of luc and cc scenarios on the water resources of halil river basin iran by employing invest to quantitatively evaluate the future changes in wy ws and wc of regional ecosystems one main contribution of the present work is the extensive evaluation of the respective effects of climate and land use change on water resources changes and water scarcity under different environmental human scenarios the understanding of these impacts is important to improve our quantitative knowledge about the relations between wy ws and wc we found that climate change has overall a stronger impact on water resources of the halil river basin compared to land use changes according to our results wy in the study area would not meet the water requirement for developed agricultural land under the broad range of cc and luc scenarios considered furthermore the predicted increase in temperature and precipitation decrease would result in more et wc and more water scarcity therefore the future scenarios assessed in the present work are associated with a potentially strong environmental impact which calls for the development of sustainable development strategies that take the characteristics of the local hydrological system and water resources into account there are indeed various strategies for reducing water scarcity improving water use efficiency and achieving sustainable development goals in the study area for instance such strategies include the improvement of irrigation system efficiency the application of new technologies in agricultural and irrigation systems the control and optimization of cropping pattern choice according to local deficit irrigation the control of per capita water consumption in residential lands the establishment of farmer schools with focus on adaptation to climate change with drought resistant crops and crop rotation furthermore preventing the development of farming activities in the future would be an essential strategy for maintaining supply demand water resource balance in the study area our study shows that economic environmental assessment of water resources under different climate and land use change scenarios provides integrative information for managing water scarcity in arid and semi arid regions credit author statement elham rafiei sardooi conceptualization methodology software the analysis of

24471,we develop a discrete time tick host pathogen model to describe the spread of a disease in a hard bodied tick species this model incorporates the developmental stages for a tick the dependence of the tick life cycle and disease transmission on host availability and three sources of pathogen transmission we first establish the global dynamics of the disease free system we then apply the model to two pathogens borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila using ixodes ricinus as the tick species to study properties of the invasion and establishment of a disease numerically in particular we consider the basic reproduction number which determines whether a disease can invade the tick host system as well as disease prevalence and time to establishment in the case of successful disease invasion using monte carlo simulations we calculate the means of each of these disease metrics and their elasticities with respect to various model parameters we find that increased tick survival may help enable disease invasion decrease the time to disease establishment and increase disease prevalence once established in contrast though disease invasion is sensitive to tick to host transmission and tick searching efficiencies neither disease prevalence nor time to disease establishment is sensitive to these parameters these differences emphasize the importance of developing approaches such as the one highlighted here that can be used to study disease dynamics beyond just pathogen invasion including transitional and long term dynamics keywords hard bodied ticks basic reproduction number next generation matrix borellia burgdorferi anaplasma phagocytophila ixodes ricinus 1 introduction worldwide ticks are one of the most important vectors of human diseases in the united states they account for 95 of vector borne diseases reported annually rochlin and toledo 2020 sonenshine 2018 troughton and levin 2007 in recent decades geographical expansions of tick populations as well as local abundances in both pre existing and newly established locations have increased dramatically sonenshine 2018 these increases have been attributed to reforestation and the coinciding expansions of deer populations such as in northeastern united states and to climate change ogden et al 2014 ostfeld and brunner 2015 sonenshine 2018 troughton and levin 2007 concurrent to this range expansion has been an increase in the incidence of tick borne diseases including lyme disease and human ehrlichiosis in the united states and tick borne encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever in europe and asia rochlin and toledo 2020 understanding the complexities involved in the emergence and establishment of tick borne diseases is crucial for mitigating the impacts of these emerging disease threats in epidemiological modeling the next generation matrix approach is used to calculate the basic reproduction number r 0 from an sir type compartmental model in which individuals are classified according to infection status such as susceptible infected or recovered the next generation matrix describes how much an individual of a particular infection status contributes to new infections and the basic reproduction number r 0 is calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of this matrix this quantity provides a single threshold value that determines whether the introduction of an infectious individual into an entirely susceptible population will result in an epidemic allen and van den driessche 2008 calculation of r 0 relies on a system of equations that gives the densities over time of the various ecological and epidemiological states involved in the disease spread previously this approach has been applied to calculate r 0 for continuous time ordinary differential equation models of tick borne pathogens norman et al 1999 rosa et al 2003 rosa and pugliese 2007 a major emphasis of these models has been to understand how the presence of a non competent host impacts disease invasion more detailed models which include features such as temperature and seasonal activity have also been investigated numerically using the software program stella see for instance ogden et al 2005 2007 2013 2014 these models have been used to explore how seasonal asynchrony in immature questing and climate change may affect tick and disease dynamics modeling of tick borne diseases can be quite complicated since it involves multiple species multiple transmission routes and dependence on life stage specific differences in transmission hartemink et al 2008 to circumvent these difficulties an alternative next generation matrix approach has been developed that computes the next generation matrix directly from biological principles and does not rely on developing a system of model equations to describe time series dynamics davis and bent 2011 hartemink et al 2008 matser et al 2009 this approach has the advantage of being easily modified to account for additional factors such as including additional host types it also provides a threshold value r 0 that is more biologically meaningful than the quantity obtained via a modeling approach hartemink et al 2008 however while this approach provides information about disease invasion it cannot be used to understand what happens after a disease has invaded in this paper relying on fundamental biological principles of the disease we develop an explicit discrete time tick host pathogen model to study the spread of a tick borne infection in a hard bodied tick population this model incorporates the developmental stages for a tick egg larva nymph and adult as well as the dependence on obtaining a blood meal for transitions between these stages to occur it also includes three sources of transmission systemic transmission non systemic co feeding transmission and transovarial transmission unlike many of the previously developed models e g norman et al 1999 rosa et al 2003 rosa and pugliese 2007 here we use a discrete time step to model the tick host pathogen interaction and include an egg stage though the egg stage does not contribute to the pathogen dynamics since the time to hatching can take weeks or months padgett and lane 2001 randolph 2004 the inclusion of the egg stage helps to better capture the tick developmental dynamics the model developed here presents some advantages in contrast with the alternative next generation matrix approach and continuous time models unlike the alternative next generation matrix approach the model is described by a discrete time dynamical system that can be used to generate disease dynamics in the form of time series this allows for the understanding of specific pre disease dynamics and post invasion disease dynamics and thus presents a tool to examine different disease metrics and study control strategies and scenarios in comparison with continuous time models in the form of differential equations it is much easier and faster to solve computationally a discrete time system to generate time series dynamics and does not require efficient numerical solvers this is important when it comes to studying sensitivity and elasticity analysis parameter estimation and control problems associated with such diseases which usually involve solving the model many times until an optimal control or parameter is found we use this model to examine three disease metrics pathogen invasion prevalence and time to establishment given the uncertainty surrounding tick ecology and pathogens as well as the dependence of both the tick life cycle and disease prevalence on environmental factors halos et al 2010 sonenshine 2018 rather then working with point estimates for model parameters here we follow matser et al 2009 and instead consider ranges for parameter values specifically we apply monte carlo simulations in which parameters are chosen uniformly from specified intervals we apply this approach to two tick pathogens borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila using ixodes ricinus a major vector of these diseases in europe as the tick species we calculate means of the three disease metrics as well as the elasticity of these metrics to various model parameters in order to test whether the established model produces biologically reasonable predictions we compare estimates for r 0 and its elasticities to those obtained in matser et al 2009 using the alternative next generation matrix approach we find that though not all assumptions used in these two fundamentally different modeling approaches are the same they produce similar results all together these calculations help identify which biological processes may be driving disease invasion and establishment 2 model development in this section we provide a detailed derivation of the tick host pathogen model we first present a discrete time stage structured tick model in which biological processes depend on obtaining a blood meal from a host we then derive expressions for systemic and non systemic pathogen transmission before giving the full model 2 1 baseline tick model without disease we describe a female hard tick population using a discrete time stage structured model consisting of fours developmental stages egg e larva l nymph n and adult a a female tick that survives to reproduce will consume three blood meals in its lifetime we assume that the tick species is a three host species meaning that each of these blood meals will occur on a different host individual the three host seeking developmental stages larva nymph and adult often have different host preferences with the immature stages feeding on smaller hosts such as lizards birds and small to medium sized mammals and the adult stage feeding on a larger hosts such as hedgehogs hares deer and domestic livestock gray et al 2016 here we assume two distinct host classes with the larvae and nymphs feeding on a small host h and the adults feeding on a large host h these assumptions are appropriate for some species of hard tick from the genera amblyomma spp dermacentor spp ixodes spp ornithodoros spp and rhipicephalus spp with the exception of the egg stage in order for a tick individual to transition to the next developmental stage or reproduce it must both reach developmental maturity and obtain a blood meal let γ j denote the probability of a stage j tick reaching developmental maturity conditioned it has obtained a blood meal we assume that this quantity which accounts for the delay between feeding in one developmental stage and actively questing in the next is equivalent to the probability of a stage j individual feeding from a host conditioned it has encountered a host define e a j k to be the probability a stage j tick does not encounter a host of type k where the proportionality constant a j may be interpreted as representing the searching efficiency of stage j then the probability of a tick transitioning to the next developmental stage or an adult reproducing is the probability of the tick reaching developmental maturation and having at least one host encounter γ j 1 e a j k meanwhile if both of these events do not occur 1 γ j 1 e a j k then the tick does not mature to the next developmental stage and may remain in its current stage in either case in order for a tick to be present in the next time unit it must also survive the current time interval as is determined by the survival probability s j we note that the nonlinearity e a j k may arise if for instance it is assumed that encounters follow a poisson distribution the model equations are given by 1 e t 1 β γ a 1 e a a h t a t s a γ a 1 e a a h t a t s e 1 γ e e t l t 1 s e γ e e t s l 1 γ l 1 e a l h t l t n t 1 s l γ l 1 e a l h t l t s n 1 γ n 1 e a n h t n t a t 1 s n γ n 1 e a n h t n t s a 1 γ a 1 e a a h t a t h t 1 β h h t 1 c h h t s h h t h t 1 β h h t 1 c h h t s h h t where we take the unit of time to be one month we define the tick fecundity β as the beverton holt nonlinearity β x β 0 1 c x where β 0 is the inherent density independent fecundity and c 0 is an intraspecific competition coefficient this is the equivalent of logistic growth for discrete time models since reproduction occurs on hosts and after a blood meal we have assumed that the density effect is a function of feeding adults rather than all adults notice that a female tick will only reproduce once in its lifetime with death following we assume that fecundity for each of the host species is defined in an equivalent manner and that each host has a density independent survival probability s k 2 2 the disease model to incorporate the pathogen we assume that individuals in each developmental stage may be in one of two disease states either susceptible s or infectious i where the disease state is indicated by a subscript thus l s and l i denote the densities of susceptible and infectious larvae respectively similarly both hosts types are assumed to be competent hosts and are also assigned disease states s or i once infected ticks are assumed to remain infected with 100 transstadial transmission thus once a tick is infected it remains infected until death the hosts meanwhile recover from infection with recovery determined by the average length of infection for the tick population we consider three types of infection systemic infection from a susceptible tick feeding on an infected host non systemic co feeding infection from susceptible and infectious ticks feeding on a host at the same time and transovarial transmission i e infected adults laying infected eggs for hosts the only type of infection considered is systemic infection arising from an infected tick feeding on a susceptible host before giving the complete model we first provide a detailed description of how each of these sources of infection are derived for the model to simplify the discussion we describe infection in the larva stage with equivalent terms for the other stages defined in a similar manner 2 2 1 systemic infection host to tick consider the larva stage a mature larva individual has two options to feed on a susceptible small host h s or an infected small host h i since a larva individual will only feed once we assume that a fraction ϕ h of the mature larvae will to feed on h i hosts and the remaining fraction 1 ϕ h will to feed on h s hosts a similar formulation was used in van den driessche and yakubu 2020 to define a situation in which only one type of infectious encounter either with an infected juvenile or an infected adult was allowed per unit time unlike van den driessche and yakubu 2020 rather than assuming ϕ h is constant we define ϕ h as ϕ h ϕ h 0 1 ϕ h 0 h i h c where ϕ h 0 0 and h c is the small host carrying capacity thus ϕ h 0 when infected hosts are rare and ϕ h 1 when they dominate the host population we note that a more natural definition for ϕ h might be ϕ h h i h s h i however defining ϕ h in this manner creates a technical issue when applying the basic reproduction number theory specifically we require that the jacobian matrix formed from the disease states evaluated at the disease free equilibrium is irreducible allen and van den driessche 2008 since this does not hold in this case the basic reproduction number r 0 at least as calculated using the next generation matrix approach does not correctly predict the invasion of a disease heuristically the issue that arises is that evaluation of the jacobian matrix at zero disease density should represent what happens at low disease density but by defining ϕ h in this manner the first derivative of the infection terms describing infection in ticks by hosts in model 2 when evaluated at zero disease density vanishes see for instance the first term in the equation n i of model 2 following the same assumptions as the disease free model the probability that a mature susceptible larva successfully encounters a susceptible host is 1 e a l h s and the probability a mature susceptible larva successfully encounters an infectious host is 1 e a l h i all together we have 1 e a l h s 1 ϕ h γ l l s susceptible larvae feed on h s and 1 e a l h i ϕ h γ l l s feed on h i defining p l to be the probability that a meal on an infected host results in infection we have that feeding results in p l 1 e a l h i γ l ϕ h l s infections each of the transition terms either maturation or maturation and infection is multiplied by a probability s l that a larva survives a unit of time here we make the simplifying assumption that survival is not impacted by infection state alternatively a larva may remain in the larva stage if it does not obtain a blood meal the number of susceptible larvae that do not feed but survive to the next time unit is given by s l 1 ϕ h 1 γ l 1 e a l h s ϕ h 1 γ l 1 e a l h i l s and an equivalent term may be defined for the infectious larvae since we assume 100 transstadial transmission an infectious larva may become an infectious nymph if it feeds and survives molting which is given by s l 1 ϕ h γ l 1 e a l h s ϕ h γ l 1 e a l h i l i equivalent terms may be defined for the nymph and adult stages where adults are assumed to feed on the larger hosts h 2 2 2 systemic infection tick to host define ν j to be the probability a bite from an infectious tick of stage j results in an infection in a host individual assuming an individual small host has on average a l l i encounters with infectious larvae per time unit the probability that a host does not become infected from encounters with l i is 1 ν l a l l i similarly the probability a host does not become infected from encounters with n i is 1 ν n a n n i thus overall the probability a small host does not become infected is 1 ν l a l l i 1 ν n a n n i exp a l ω l l i a n ω n n i where ω j ln 1 ν j a similar term may be defined for large hosts h where infection is assumed to occur due to encounters with infected adults ticks infection was defined in this manner in lewis et al 2006 which considered a single infectious state alternatively to define infection from multiple infectious states in allen and van den driessche 2008 it was assumed that the probability of infection follows a poisson distribution with the weights ω i defining the impacts of the different stages this leads to the probability of no infection for an individual h s being the same form as we have here e a l ω l l i a n ω n n i however the above derivation allows for a direct biological interpretation of weights ω i notice that systemic infections in hosts are assumed to follow from density dependent mass action incidence rates motivated by the assumption that higher tick densities will lead to higher tick burdens 2 2 3 non systemic infection co feeding transmission define η j i to be the probability that a susceptible stage j tick is infected from co feeding on a host with an infected tick of stage i then the probability a stage l s tick is not infected due to co feeding with infectious individuals on a small infected host is given by 1 η l l ϕ h 1 e a l h i l i k l h i 1 η l n ϕ h 1 e a n h i n i k l h i where ϕ h 1 e a l h i l i and ϕ h 1 e a l h i n i are the number of infectious larvae and nymph ticks respectively that feed on infected hosts in the given time period this quantity is divided by k l h i to account for individuals feeding on different hosts and at different days during the time interval here k l is the average number of larval feedings that can occur in one unit time and is obtained by dividing 30 days by the average number of days that larvae feed this may be rewritten in the equivalent form e 1 k l h i λ l l ϕ h 1 e a l h i l i λ l n ϕ h 1 e a n h i n i where λ i k ln 1 η i k meanwhile the probability a stage l s tick is not infected due to co feeding with infectious individuals on a small susceptible host is given by 1 η l l 1 ϕ h 1 e a l h s l i k l h s 1 η l n 1 ϕ h 1 e a n h s n i k l h s similar terms may be defined for co feeding infection in nymphs and adults where nymphs may be infected through co feeding with infected larvae or nymphs but adults may be infected only through co feeding with infected adults since we have assumed that the adults do not feed on the same hosts as the immature stages 2 2 4 the full model the full tick

r a gives the probability of transovarial transmission that is it is the fraction of infected eggs produced by an infected adult notice that a susceptible adult that becomes infected during its third

given in fig 1 3 persistence and global dynamics of the tick host model in this section we present a complete characterization of the global dynamics of the tick host model including the existence uniqueness and global stability of the interior equilibrium of model 1 an understanding of the dynamics of model 1 is essential for studying the full tick host pathogen model as these describe the dynamics of model 2 in the absence of the disease omitted proofs of the statements below are provided in the appendix first note that the difference equation system 1 can be written in the matrix form 3 x t 1 p x t x t where x t e t l t n t a t h t h t is a column vector containing the densities of the different stages and the projection matrix p has the form p x p 1 x 0 0 p 2 x where p 1 x is given in box i and p 2 x β h 1 c h h s h 0 0 β h 1 c h h s h next observe that the equation for host h is decoupled from the rest of the system and the same is true for the equation for host h it is not hard to show that for k h h if β k s k 1 and k 0 0 then each host population converges to its carrying capacity 4 lim t k t k c β k 1 s k c k 1 s k thus for the rest of this section we focus on establishing a global stability result for the interior equilibrium of the model 5 x 1 t 1 p 1 x 1 t h c h c x 1 t where x 1 t e t l t n t a t then we lift up the global stability to the model 1 by utilizing results on asymptotically autonomous systems and 4 to this end first note that it is not difficult to verify that 6 x 1 y 1 implies p 1 y 1 h c h c p 1 x 1 h c h c where x y denotes the usual component wise partial order on r n next following caswell 2000 and cushing 1998 define t ˆ as given in box ii and f ˆ 0 0 0 β 0 s a γ a 1 e a a h c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 note that the inherent projection matrix of the nonlinear system for the tick sub model 5 is p 1 0 f ˆ t ˆ thus the inherent net reproductive number r ˆ 0 which gives the expected number of offspring produced by a female throughout its lifetime in the absence of density dependence is the positive simple and strictly dominant eigenvalue of f ˆ i t ˆ 1 where i denotes the identity matrix a simple calculation shows that r ˆ 0 β 0 s e s l s n s a γ e γ l γ n γ a 1 e a l h c 1 e a n h c 1 e a a h c 1 s e 1 γ e π j l n 1 s j 1 γ j 1 e a j h c 1 s a 1 γ a 1 e a a h c by theorem 1 1 3 in cushing 1998 the inherent net reproductive number is on the same side of one as the spectral radius of p 1 0 thus we make use of r ˆ 0 in establishing the local and global dynamics of model 1 we now have the following result lemma 3 1 suppose r ˆ 0 1 then the origin e 0 0 0 0 0 is a globally asymptotically stable fixed point of system 5 next we establish the existence uniqueness and local stability of an interior fixed point theorem 3 2 suppose r ˆ 0 1 then 5 has a unique interior fixed point x 1 e l n a which is locally asymptotically stable lemma 3 3 establishes boundedness of solutions uniformly in the parameters lemma 3 3 let ξ 0 define k 0 e ˆ 0 l ˆ 0 n ˆ 0 a ˆ where e ˆ β 0 s a c 1 s e 1 γ e 1 ξ l ˆ s e γ e 1 s l 1 γ l 1 e a l h c e ˆ 1 ξ n ˆ s l γ l 1 e a l h c 1 s n 1 γ n 1 e a n h c l ˆ 1 ξ a ˆ s n γ n 1 e a n h c 1 s a 1 γ a 1 e a a h c n ˆ 1 ξ then every forward solution of 5 enters k in finite time and remains in k forever after next we show that if the net reproductive number is greater than one then the origin is unstable and system 5 is uniformly persistent theorem 3 4 suppose r ˆ 0 1 then 5 is uniformly persistent finally we establish the global stability of the interior fixed point the proof of this result relies on the following lemma from ackleh and deleenheer 2008 consider a map g r n r n we say that g is monotone if x y implies that g x g y lemma 3 5 ackleh and deleenheer 2008 let g r n r n be a continuous monotone map and a b be points in r n if a g a and g b b and if g has a unique fixed point x in the ordered interval a b x r n a x b then every solution sequence of the discrete system 7 x t 1 g x t starting in a b converges to x theorem 3 6 suppose that r ˆ 0 1 then every solution of 5 starting in r 4 0 0 0 0 converges to the unique interior equilibrium this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable proof first observe that every solution starting on the boundary of r 4 but not in 0 0 0 0 enters the positively invariant set int r 4 therefore it is enough to establish the theorem for solutions in int r 4 to this end pick x 1 0 e 0 l 0 n 0 a 0 int r 4 in fact by lemma 3 3 it suffices to consider x 1 0 int r 4 k the unique positive fixed point clearly belongs to k define b e ˆ l ˆ n ˆ a ˆ the maximal element in k then by lemma 3 3 we have that g b b where g x denotes the right hand side of 5 clearly g is monotone since the jacobian of g g x is a nonnegative matrix for all x since p 1 0 is an irreducible non negative matrix its spectral radius r which we know is larger than 1 because r ˆ 0 1 is an eigenvalue with a corresponding positive eigenvector v p 1 0 v r v in addition for all ε 0 sufficiently small it holds that g ε v r ε v o ε ε v since r 1 now for a given x 1 0 int r 4 k we can pick a sufficiently small ε 0 such that a ε v x 1 0 and a g a it follows from an application of lemma 3 5 that every solution of 5 starting in r 4 0 0 0 0 converges to the unique interior equilibrium the global asymptotic stability of the unique interior fixed point now follows from the local asymptotic stability in theorem 3 2 together with the global attractivity established above next we establish the global stability of the interior equilibrium for the full model 1 to prove this theorem we rely on theory for asymptotically autonomous discrete dynamical systems in d aniello and elaydi 2020 and mokni et al 2020 theorem 3 7 suppose that r ˆ 0 1 and s k β k 1 for k h h then every solution of 1 with initial condition e 0 l 0 n 0 a 0 i n t r 4 0 0 0 0 h 0 0 and h 0 0 converges to the unique interior equilibrium e l n a h c h c proof by theorem 3 2 in mokni et al 2020 it is sufficient to show that assumptions a1 and a2 in that paper are satisfied since h t h c and h t h c exponentially due to the global asymptotic stability then g t defined by the right hand side mapping of the first four equation of 1 converge uniformly to g the map defined by the right hand side of 5 hence a1 is satisfied as for a2 this is clearly satisfied as it is easily seen that g t maps int r 4 int r 4 4 case study borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila in ixodes ricinus in this section we apply model 2 to study two tick borne pathogens borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila we use the hard bodied tick species ixodes ricinus which is one of the primary vectors of these pathogens in europe i ricinus is a three host tick with immature stages preferring small hosts such as lizards birds and small to medium sized mammals and adult ticks preferring larger hosts such as hedgehogs hares deer and domestic livestock gray et al 2016 estimates for life history parameters and pathogen specific parameters are provided in tables 1 and 2 tick and pathogen estimates primarily come from matser et al 2009 since we model female ticks only fecundity is estimated as half of the values provided in matser et al 2009 survival probabilities in model 2 are estimated using s j s j 1 t j where s j is the stage to stage survival probability provided in matser et al 2009 and t j is the average length of stage j meanwhile we estimate the probability a stage j tick reaches maturation as the inverse of the average length of stage j γ i 1 t j caswell 2000 following matser et al 2009 we assume the same co feeding transmission η for all tick stage we base parameter estimates for small and large hosts on mice and deer respectively note that while deer are not competent reservoir for b burgdorferi they may be competent reservoirs for a phagocytophila svitálková et al 2015 4 1 the basic reproduction number disease invasion we first apply the next generation matrix approach to calculate the basic reproduction number r 0 which gives the expected number of secondary infections produced by a primary infection in a totally susceptible population allen and van den driessche 2008 this quantity determines whether a pathogen will be able to invade the tick host system specifically a pathogen is able to invade the system if and only if r 0 1 note that in comparison r ˆ 0 determines whether a tick population can invade a given location to calculate r 0 we follow allen and van den driessche 2008 namely we first linearize the projection matrix of system 2 around the disease free equilibrium e l n a h c h c 0 0 0 0 0 0 of model 2 which is equivalent to the positive equilibrium of model 1 when ϕ h 0 ϕ h 0 0 recall that in order for a non trivial disease free equilibrium to exist we must have the inherent net reproductive number greater than one this results in a block triangular matrix with the 6 6 lower right block corresponding to the jacobian matrix for the disease states we then decompose this 6 6 block matrix into a matrix f describing new infections and a matrix t containing all other types of transitions the basic net reproduction number is calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix defined as f i t 1 where i is the identity matrix in many disease models f is a low rank matrix which makes it possible to obtain an exact expression for the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix f i t 1 however for model 2 since there are many sources of new infections this is not the case and r 0 is a zero of a high degree polynomial for which solutions are not generally tractable therefore we instead calculate r 0 numerically in matlab using the built in eig function to calculate the dominant eigenvalue in addition to calculating r 0 we also consider the elasticity of r 0 with respect to changes in model parameters the elasticity of r 0 with respect to parameter ζ is defined as 8 ζ r 0 r 0 ζ and gives the proportional change in r 0 given a proportional change in the input ζ caswell 2000 elasticity calculations indicate which processes may be key drivers of disease invasion and can help identify important information gaps in parameter estimates given both the variability and uncertainty surrounding tick ecology and pathogens we choose to work with interval estimates rather than point estimates for the model parameters therefore we compute r 0 for 20 000 sets of parameters chosen randomly from uniform distributions defined on the intervals given in tables 1 and 2 for each simulation r 0 is calculated as well as its elasticity with respect to proportional changes in the disease transmission parameters all derivatives are calculated numerically using the standard forward difference approximation with step size 0 01 approximately 1 of the simulations 238 and 239 for b burgdorferi and a phagocytophila respectively resulted in r ˆ 0 values less than one since this means the tick population dies out these simulations were removed a histogram of the obtained r 0 estimates is provided in fig 2 a for b burgdorferi since the distribution is skewed we applied a logarithmic transformation shown in fig 2 b to obtain the 95 confidence interval in figs 2 c 2 d we also provide normal probability plots for this logarithmic transformation we observe that after dropping 500 of the largest and smallest r 0 estimates r 0 appears to follow a log normal distribution similar results not shown were also obtained for a phagocytophila the estimated mean basic reproduction number r 0 and the 95 confidence intervals for both diseases are given in table 3 when compared to the estimates obtained in matser et al 2009 also provided in table 3 we observe that for b burgdorferi the r 0 estimate obtained from model 2 is larger as is the confidence interval while the opposite is true for a phagocytophila however relative to the length of the confidence intervals from matser et al 2009 these r 0 estimates are within 14 3 and 8 9 respectively of the estimates provided in matser et al 2009 we find the level of agreement between these two complementary approaches promising given the complicated nature of tick host pathogen systems as well as the existing uncertainty surrounding the many tick species and their pathogens the elasticities of r 0 for b burgdorferi with respect to the six disease transmission parameters from each of the 20 000 simulations minus the 500 largest and 500 smallest values and those simulations resulting in r ˆ 0 1 are provided in fig 3 we observe that r 0 is most sensitive to changes in parameters describing systemic transmission meanwhile it is less sensitive to changes in transovarial transmission the elasticities of r 0 for a phagocytophila not shown follow similar trends these results are in agreement with the results from matser et al 2009 which also found that r 0 for both diseases was most sensitive to changes in systemic infection parameters mean elasticities for both diseases are provided in table 4 in table 4 we also provide the coefficient of determination when these elasticities are fit to a linear regression in order to observe which parameters are correlated with r 0 since each of the 20 000 simulations are obtained by first choosing model parameters uniformly from their respective intervals and thus each simulation is based a different set of parameter values in general we should not expect to see a significant correlation between changes in a single model parameter and changes in r 0 in this case the only correlation we observe is with ν n in b burgdorferi which is quadratically correlated this correlation is also in agreement with what is known about the transmission of these pathogens specifically for b burgdorferi since the likelihood of transovarial transmission is small resulting few infected larvae nymphs are the primary drivers of this pathogen van duijvendijk et al 2015 hence the strong correlation of r 0 with the infection of hosts from infected nymphs ν n we hypothesize that the nonlinear relationship with ν n is likely due to the fact that an infection in a host may lead to multiple tick infections though host abundance is an important factor in the establishment and survival of tick populations ixodes ticks spend a majority of their life cycle off hosts cheng et al 2017 therefore abiotic environmental factors play a crucial role in tick survival and development cheng et al 2017 sonenshine 2018 in fact recent studies on the effect of climate change on tick population expansion have found that increasing temperature leading to increased survival rates can help enable tick invasion into new environments cheng et al 2017 hamer et al 2010 in order to understand how these parameters may contribute to disease invasion in table 5 we provide the elasticity of r 0 with respect to tick life cycle parameters and host carrying capacities we observe that r 0 tends to be more sensitive to changes in life history parameters such as survival probabilities than to changes in the pathogen parameters these elasticity results suggest that increased temperatures may also help enable disease invasion with respect to the survival of the different tick stages we observe that r 0 is most sensitive to the survival of the larva stage this is in agreement with previous studies which found survival from the larva to the nymph stage is critical for r 0 in both tick borne encephalitis and lyme borreliosis ostfeld and brunner 2015 for both diseases we observe in table 5 that the tick competition coefficient c is correlated with r 0 notice that larger c values result in smaller tick populations thus r 0 is positively correlated with larger tick densities the correlation of r 0 with the competition coefficient highlights an important data gap as intraspecific density dependent effects in ticks are difficult to estimate for example though estimates of questing ticks obtained through blanket dragging or flagging methods can be used to measure epidemiological risk they cannot yield information on absolute tick population sizes unless host assemblages and densities are also known randolph 2004 in addition these methods only capture a minority of active ticks and thus tick abundance estimates may be biased downward nyrhilä et al 2020 4 2 beyond r 0 disease establishment while r 0 is a useful quantity for determining whether a pathogen can invade a tick host system it does not provide any information about what happens after invasion occurs this fact is highlighted in fig 4 which gives the disease prevalence in the tick population against r 0 for cases when invasion occurs i e r 0 1 specifically we define disease prevalence to be the proportion of ticks in host seeking tick stages larva nymph and adult that are infected as can be seen in this figure the same disease prevalence may be obtained for a wide range of r 0 values in this section we use model 2 to examine two important disease metrics once invasion has occurred disease prevalence and time to disease establishment we define the establishment time to be the amount of time it takes the number of host seeking infected ticks to reach some proportion of the total disease equilibrium density for simulation purposes here we choose the proportion to be 50 for all numerical simulations of model 2 generated with parameter values selected from tables 1 and 2 we observed the system converge to a stationary equilibrium this was confirmed numerically by verifying that the final time densities for each of the tick stages was sufficiently close here we used 10 8 to the nine previous values thus the infection prevalence in the long run is essentially constant and may be found by numerically simulating model 2 for sufficiently long time histograms for the disease prevalence and time to disease establishment for b burgdorferi generated from 20 000 monte carlo simulations are provided in fig 5 table 6 provides the means and confidence intervals for the two disease metrics for both diseases both a logarithmic and square root transformation of the calculated histograms result in distributions that are approximately normal thus we provide confidence intervals obtained from each of these transformations meanwhile tables 7 and 8 give elasticities of these two metrics with respect to changes in the model parameters reported values in tables 6 8 were calculated from 20 000 monte carlo simulations after removing all cases where r 0 1 and then removing the 500 largest and 500 smallest values simulations for time to disease establishment were initialized with a single individual in each of the infected states the mean disease prevalence was found to be 11 85 for b burgdorferi and 9 00 for a phagocytophila though previous studies have shown that disease prevalence may be highly variable in different habitat types these estimates fall within prevalence ranges reported in the literature see for example ogden et al 2013 reye et al 2010 schorn et al 2011 a metaanalysis of 154 european studies found that 13 7 of i ricinus were infected with borrelia spp but prevalence varied from 2 to 49 depending on the region reye et al 2010 in luxembourg the mean prevalence was found to be 11 3 for b burgdorferi with highest and lowest observed prevalences of 21 9 and 2 8 respectively reye et al 2010 a study of the prevalence of b burgdorferi in i scapularis for different locations in canada found similar prevalences which ranged from 9 8 to 14 1 ogden et al 2013 in luxembourg the mean prevalence for a phagocytophilum in i ricinus was 1 9 with highest and lowest observed prevalences of 4 5 and 0 8 respectively reye et al 2010 however in bavarian public parks in germany higher prevalences of a phagocytophilum were found with a mean prevalence of 11 6 and ranges from 8 1 to 20 1 schorn et al 2011 notably it is remarked in schorn et al 2011 that the prevalence of a phagocytophilum appears to be lower in woodland areas with respect to the elasticity calculations we continue to observe that as with disease invasion disease prevalence is also sensitive to the tick survival probabilities however infection of hosts and tick searching efficiency have no impact on infection prevalence in addition there are no significant correlations the mean time to disease establishment was found to be 21 77 months for b burgdorferi and 20 84 months for a phagocytophila for comparison it was found that it takes the pathogen b burgdorferi three to five years to invade following the invasion of the tick i scapularis in central and eastern canada respectively ogden et al 2013 however these estimates are based on the time since the tick rather than the pathogen first invades a region and disease establishment is defined as the first time that the disease prevalence increases in table 8 we observe that there are a number of model parameters that the time to disease establishment is not sensitive to however as with the previous metrics it is sensitive to the tick survival probabilities we also observe that the transovarial transmission probability r a and egg survival probability s e are correlated with disease establishment time since increases in the parameter c decreases tick density and thus may make it possible that the infection never reaches establishment as defined here we do not include elasticity calculations for c in table 8 5 discussion the tick host pathogen system involves many complex interactions that depend on both abiotic conditions such as temperature and humidity and biotic factors such as availability of hosts gray et al 2016 randolph 2004 clearly not all of these factors have been included in model 2 in this section we briefly discuss how the model framework developed here may be extended to incorporate some of these elements since tick development and questing is temperature dependent variation in seasonal tick dynamics may occur in different geographic regions which may have significant impacts on pathogen transmission randolph 2004 for example maintenance of b burgdorferi in i scapularis depends heavily on the timing of seasonal activity in the immature stages since efficient infection of the larva stage from reservoir hosts requires that larvae feed after infected nymphs gatewood et al 2009 though model 2 does not include seasonality this may be easily incorporated by making the search efficiencies a j a function of time given the one month time unit this would mean that rather than a disease free equilibrium the model would possess a disease free p cycle for some 1 p 12 in this case r 0 is calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of i 1 p f i i t i 1 where matrices f i and t i describe new infections and other transitions respectively evaluated at each point of the p cycle cushing and ackleh 2012 van den driessche and yakubu 2019 similarly it is also possible to define the survival probabilities to be functions of temperature as is commonly done in stella models model 2 also does not account for all of the possible complicated interactions between ticks and host species for example ticks often feed on multiple host types with only a portion of these hosts being reservoirs for the pathogen depending on the specific biological population under consideration it may be appropriate to incorporate additional host types into model 2 such as a non competent host for the immature stages in addition it has been observed that ticks have a tendency to aggregate on hosts for example a study of i ricinus on rodents in slovakia found that 20 of hosts fed 74 of nymphs and 61 of larvae randolph et al 1999 accounting for this aggregation can be particularly important for pathogens such as tick borne encephalitis where short infection durations in reservoir hosts mean that co feeding is a major source of transmission this aggregation tendency may be incorporated into model 2 following the arguments developed in rosa et al 2003 specifically suppose the distribution of stage j ticks on hosts follows a negative binomial distribution with the shape parameter σ j determining the degree of aggregation then the average numbers of infected larvae and nymphs feeding with a susceptible larva individual on a susceptible host become ϕ h 1 e a l h s l i k l h s 1 1 σ l and ϕ h 1 e a n h s l i n i k l h s 1 ρ l n σ l σ n respectively where ρ l n is a correlation coefficient for larvae and nymphs thus the probability that a susceptible larva feeding on a susceptible host does not become infected through co feeding is now given by ψ l s e 1 k l h s λ l l ϕ h 1 e a l h s 1 1 σ l l i λ l n ϕ h 1 e a n h s 1 ρ l n σ l σ n n i with the other co feeding terms defined similarly finally we note that the two pathogens considered in this paper were chosen because of the long durations of infection in competent hosts for other diseases in which host infection lasts for only a matter of days such as tick borne encephalitis the one month time unit used in model 2 means that the contribution of infected hosts to disease transmission becomes exaggerated however this one month time unit allows us to take a more coarse grain approach to modeling the tick population by only distinguishing between different developmental stages and not different tick activity states e g questing larvae versus feeding larvae as has been done in other models such as norman et al 1999 rosa et al 2003 rosa and pugliese 2007 since questing and feeding may last for weeks or days respectively reducing the unit of time to a week or a day to account for shorter durations of infection would mean that these different activity states should also be included an extension of model 2 that includes these states is currently being developed by the authors and in future work we intend to examine how these differences in scales may affect model predictions 6 conclusion in this paper we developed a tick host pathogen system to study the invasion and establishment of tick borne diseases this discrete time model incorporates different developmental stages of the tick variable host preference based on developmental stage and three forms of pathogen transmission since model 2 describes changes in densities over time it is possible to study disease metrics beyond the basic reproduction number r 0 such as disease prevalence and time to establishment a consistent pattern we observed for all three disease metrics considered here is that the tick survival probabilities play an important role in both disease invasion and establishment since increased temperatures have been shown to result in increased tick survival rates this supports previous findings that climate change may facilitate the expansion of both tick populations and their associated pathogens cheng et al 2017 hamer et al 2010 in contrast though disease invasion is sensitive to tick to host transmission ν j and tick searching efficiency a j neither disease prevalence nor time to disease establishment are sensitive to these parameters though model 2 does not include some biological features of the tick host pathogen system as described above we find that the model is still able to produce results similar to those found using the alternative next generation matrix approach applied in matser et al 2009 as well as results obtained from field studies in future work we aim to incorporate at least some of these additional aspects into our model framework model 2 will serve as a benchmark for understanding the effects of these added factors since comparisons of the two model outputs may help to identify which characteristics cause fundamental changes in the predictions of disease transmission and thus are important to include when studying tick borne pathogens understanding what enables the successful invasion of ticks into new geographic locations and coinciding pathogen invasions is essential for controlling the expansion of tick borne diseases variations of models 1 and 2 will also be used to gain further insights into this issue in these studies invasion and time to extinction for ticks and their pathogens will be studied by extending the models developed here to include demographic stochasticity and allee effects both of which are be particularly important for small populations as well as spatial structure and host

has a positive simple strictly dominant eigenvalue r by theorem 1 1 3 in cushing 1998 we have r 1 if and only if r ˆ 0 1 thus the extinction equilibrium e 0 is locally asymptotically stable if r ˆ 0 1 moreover following the same argument as in lemma a 2 we have that for any x 0 0 x t 0 as t whenever r ˆ 0 1 thus the extinction equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for r ˆ 0 1 proof of

establish uniform persistence we follow similar arguments to those in ackleh and deleenheer 2008 that rely on an application of theorem 4 1 in hofbauer and so 1989 first note that since r ˆ 0 1 it follows from theorem 1 1 3 in cushing 1998 that p 1 0 has a positive strictly dominant eigenvalue r 1 hence 0 0 0 0 is unstable now using similar notation as in hofbauer and so 1989 we let h r 4 y bd r 4 and f denote the map on the right hand side of 5 then clearly f h y h y since int r 4 is positively invariant for the system 5 by theorem 2 1 in hale and waltman 1989 and using lemma 3 3 it

here w s m the stable set of m denotes the set of points whose solution sequence for 5 converges to m in fact next we prove a stronger result that m is a repeller which by theorem 2 1 in hofbauer and so 1989 is equivalent to showing 1 m is isolated in h and 2 w s m m utilizing corollary 2 2 in hofbauer and so 1989 we can prove that m is a repeller by constructing a continuous function q r 4 r which satisfies 1 q x 0 for x m and 2 there is a neighborhood u of m such that for all x u m there exists a t 0 where q f t x p 1 x x to this end since p 1 0 is non negative and irreducible its dominant eigenvalue r 1 has a corresponding left eigenvector p 0 i e p p 1 0 r p pick r 1 r such that p p 1 0 r p 0 then by continuity of p 1 x there exists a neighborhood u of m in h such that p p 1

24471,we develop a discrete time tick host pathogen model to describe the spread of a disease in a hard bodied tick species this model incorporates the developmental stages for a tick the dependence of the tick life cycle and disease transmission on host availability and three sources of pathogen transmission we first establish the global dynamics of the disease free system we then apply the model to two pathogens borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila using ixodes ricinus as the tick species to study properties of the invasion and establishment of a disease numerically in particular we consider the basic reproduction number which determines whether a disease can invade the tick host system as well as disease prevalence and time to establishment in the case of successful disease invasion using monte carlo simulations we calculate the means of each of these disease metrics and their elasticities with respect to various model parameters we find that increased tick survival may help enable disease invasion decrease the time to disease establishment and increase disease prevalence once established in contrast though disease invasion is sensitive to tick to host transmission and tick searching efficiencies neither disease prevalence nor time to disease establishment is sensitive to these parameters these differences emphasize the importance of developing approaches such as the one highlighted here that can be used to study disease dynamics beyond just pathogen invasion including transitional and long term dynamics keywords hard bodied ticks basic reproduction number next generation matrix borellia burgdorferi anaplasma phagocytophila ixodes ricinus 1 introduction worldwide ticks are one of the most important vectors of human diseases in the united states they account for 95 of vector borne diseases reported annually rochlin and toledo 2020 sonenshine 2018 troughton and levin 2007 in recent decades geographical expansions of tick populations as well as local abundances in both pre existing and newly established locations have increased dramatically sonenshine 2018 these increases have been attributed to reforestation and the coinciding expansions of deer populations such as in northeastern united states and to climate change ogden et al 2014 ostfeld and brunner 2015 sonenshine 2018 troughton and levin 2007 concurrent to this range expansion has been an increase in the incidence of tick borne diseases including lyme disease and human ehrlichiosis in the united states and tick borne encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever in europe and asia rochlin and toledo 2020 understanding the complexities involved in the emergence and establishment of tick borne diseases is crucial for mitigating the impacts of these emerging disease threats in epidemiological modeling the next generation matrix approach is used to calculate the basic reproduction number r 0 from an sir type compartmental model in which individuals are classified according to infection status such as susceptible infected or recovered the next generation matrix describes how much an individual of a particular infection status contributes to new infections and the basic reproduction number r 0 is calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of this matrix this quantity provides a single threshold value that determines whether the introduction of an infectious individual into an entirely susceptible population will result in an epidemic allen and van den driessche 2008 calculation of r 0 relies on a system of equations that gives the densities over time of the various ecological and epidemiological states involved in the disease spread previously this approach has been applied to calculate r 0 for continuous time ordinary differential equation models of tick borne pathogens norman et al 1999 rosa et al 2003 rosa and pugliese 2007 a major emphasis of these models has been to understand how the presence of a non competent host impacts disease invasion more detailed models which include features such as temperature and seasonal activity have also been investigated numerically using the software program stella see for instance ogden et al 2005 2007 2013 2014 these models have been used to explore how seasonal asynchrony in immature questing and climate change may affect tick and disease dynamics modeling of tick borne diseases can be quite complicated since it involves multiple species multiple transmission routes and dependence on life stage specific differences in transmission hartemink et al 2008 to circumvent these difficulties an alternative next generation matrix approach has been developed that computes the next generation matrix directly from biological principles and does not rely on developing a system of model equations to describe time series dynamics davis and bent 2011 hartemink et al 2008 matser et al 2009 this approach has the advantage of being easily modified to account for additional factors such as including additional host types it also provides a threshold value r 0 that is more biologically meaningful than the quantity obtained via a modeling approach hartemink et al 2008 however while this approach provides information about disease invasion it cannot be used to understand what happens after a disease has invaded in this paper relying on fundamental biological principles of the disease we develop an explicit discrete time tick host pathogen model to study the spread of a tick borne infection in a hard bodied tick population this model incorporates the developmental stages for a tick egg larva nymph and adult as well as the dependence on obtaining a blood meal for transitions between these stages to occur it also includes three sources of transmission systemic transmission non systemic co feeding transmission and transovarial transmission unlike many of the previously developed models e g norman et al 1999 rosa et al 2003 rosa and pugliese 2007 here we use a discrete time step to model the tick host pathogen interaction and include an egg stage though the egg stage does not contribute to the pathogen dynamics since the time to hatching can take weeks or months padgett and lane 2001 randolph 2004 the inclusion of the egg stage helps to better capture the tick developmental dynamics the model developed here presents some advantages in contrast with the alternative next generation matrix approach and continuous time models unlike the alternative next generation matrix approach the model is described by a discrete time dynamical system that can be used to generate disease dynamics in the form of time series this allows for the understanding of specific pre disease dynamics and post invasion disease dynamics and thus presents a tool to examine different disease metrics and study control strategies and scenarios in comparison with continuous time models in the form of differential equations it is much easier and faster to solve computationally a discrete time system to generate time series dynamics and does not require efficient numerical solvers this is important when it comes to studying sensitivity and elasticity analysis parameter estimation and control problems associated with such diseases which usually involve solving the model many times until an optimal control or parameter is found we use this model to examine three disease metrics pathogen invasion prevalence and time to establishment given the uncertainty surrounding tick ecology and pathogens as well as the dependence of both the tick life cycle and disease prevalence on environmental factors halos et al 2010 sonenshine 2018 rather then working with point estimates for model parameters here we follow matser et al 2009 and instead consider ranges for parameter values specifically we apply monte carlo simulations in which parameters are chosen uniformly from specified intervals we apply this approach to two tick pathogens borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila using ixodes ricinus a major vector of these diseases in europe as the tick species we calculate means of the three disease metrics as well as the elasticity of these metrics to various model parameters in order to test whether the established model produces biologically reasonable predictions we compare estimates for r 0 and its elasticities to those obtained in matser et al 2009 using the alternative next generation matrix approach we find that though not all assumptions used in these two fundamentally different modeling approaches are the same they produce similar results all together these calculations help identify which biological processes may be driving disease invasion and establishment 2 model development in this section we provide a detailed derivation of the tick host pathogen model we first present a discrete time stage structured tick model in which biological processes depend on obtaining a blood meal from a host we then derive expressions for systemic and non systemic pathogen transmission before giving the full model 2 1 baseline tick model without disease we describe a female hard tick population using a discrete time stage structured model consisting of fours developmental stages egg e larva l nymph n and adult a a female tick that survives to reproduce will consume three blood meals in its lifetime we assume that the tick species is a three host species meaning that each of these blood meals will occur on a different host individual the three host seeking developmental stages larva nymph and adult often have different host preferences with the immature stages feeding on smaller hosts such as lizards birds and small to medium sized mammals and the adult stage feeding on a larger hosts such as hedgehogs hares deer and domestic livestock gray et al 2016 here we assume two distinct host classes with the larvae and nymphs feeding on a small host h and the adults feeding on a large host h these assumptions are appropriate for some species of hard tick from the genera amblyomma spp dermacentor spp ixodes spp ornithodoros spp and rhipicephalus spp with the exception of the egg stage in order for a tick individual to transition to the next developmental stage or reproduce it must both reach developmental maturity and obtain a blood meal let γ j denote the probability of a stage j tick reaching developmental maturity conditioned it has obtained a blood meal we assume that this quantity which accounts for the delay between feeding in one developmental stage and actively questing in the next is equivalent to the probability of a stage j individual feeding from a host conditioned it has encountered a host define e a j k to be the probability a stage j tick does not encounter a host of type k where the proportionality constant a j may be interpreted as representing the searching efficiency of stage j then the probability of a tick transitioning to the next developmental stage or an adult reproducing is the probability of the tick reaching developmental maturation and having at least one host encounter γ j 1 e a j k meanwhile if both of these events do not occur 1 γ j 1 e a j k then the tick does not mature to the next developmental stage and may remain in its current stage in either case in order for a tick to be present in the next time unit it must also survive the current time interval as is determined by the survival probability s j we note that the nonlinearity e a j k may arise if for instance it is assumed that encounters follow a poisson distribution the model equations are given by 1 e t 1 β γ a 1 e a a h t a t s a γ a 1 e a a h t a t s e 1 γ e e t l t 1 s e γ e e t s l 1 γ l 1 e a l h t l t n t 1 s l γ l 1 e a l h t l t s n 1 γ n 1 e a n h t n t a t 1 s n γ n 1 e a n h t n t s a 1 γ a 1 e a a h t a t h t 1 β h h t 1 c h h t s h h t h t 1 β h h t 1 c h h t s h h t where we take the unit of time to be one month we define the tick fecundity β as the beverton holt nonlinearity β x β 0 1 c x where β 0 is the inherent density independent fecundity and c 0 is an intraspecific competition coefficient this is the equivalent of logistic growth for discrete time models since reproduction occurs on hosts and after a blood meal we have assumed that the density effect is a function of feeding adults rather than all adults notice that a female tick will only reproduce once in its lifetime with death following we assume that fecundity for each of the host species is defined in an equivalent manner and that each host has a density independent survival probability s k 2 2 the disease model to incorporate the pathogen we assume that individuals in each developmental stage may be in one of two disease states either susceptible s or infectious i where the disease state is indicated by a subscript thus l s and l i denote the densities of susceptible and infectious larvae respectively similarly both hosts types are assumed to be competent hosts and are also assigned disease states s or i once infected ticks are assumed to remain infected with 100 transstadial transmission thus once a tick is infected it remains infected until death the hosts meanwhile recover from infection with recovery determined by the average length of infection for the tick population we consider three types of infection systemic infection from a susceptible tick feeding on an infected host non systemic co feeding infection from susceptible and infectious ticks feeding on a host at the same time and transovarial transmission i e infected adults laying infected eggs for hosts the only type of infection considered is systemic infection arising from an infected tick feeding on a susceptible host before giving the complete model we first provide a detailed description of how each of these sources of infection are derived for the model to simplify the discussion we describe infection in the larva stage with equivalent terms for the other stages defined in a similar manner 2 2 1 systemic infection host to tick consider the larva stage a mature larva individual has two options to feed on a susceptible small host h s or an infected small host h i since a larva individual will only feed once we assume that a fraction ϕ h of the mature larvae will to feed on h i hosts and the remaining fraction 1 ϕ h will to feed on h s hosts a similar formulation was used in van den driessche and yakubu 2020 to define a situation in which only one type of infectious encounter either with an infected juvenile or an infected adult was allowed per unit time unlike van den driessche and yakubu 2020 rather than assuming ϕ h is constant we define ϕ h as ϕ h ϕ h 0 1 ϕ h 0 h i h c where ϕ h 0 0 and h c is the small host carrying capacity thus ϕ h 0 when infected hosts are rare and ϕ h 1 when they dominate the host population we note that a more natural definition for ϕ h might be ϕ h h i h s h i however defining ϕ h in this manner creates a technical issue when applying the basic reproduction number theory specifically we require that the jacobian matrix formed from the disease states evaluated at the disease free equilibrium is irreducible allen and van den driessche 2008 since this does not hold in this case the basic reproduction number r 0 at least as calculated using the next generation matrix approach does not correctly predict the invasion of a disease heuristically the issue that arises is that evaluation of the jacobian matrix at zero disease density should represent what happens at low disease density but by defining ϕ h in this manner the first derivative of the infection terms describing infection in ticks by hosts in model 2 when evaluated at zero disease density vanishes see for instance the first term in the equation n i of model 2 following the same assumptions as the disease free model the probability that a mature susceptible larva successfully encounters a susceptible host is 1 e a l h s and the probability a mature susceptible larva successfully encounters an infectious host is 1 e a l h i all together we have 1 e a l h s 1 ϕ h γ l l s susceptible larvae feed on h s and 1 e a l h i ϕ h γ l l s feed on h i defining p l to be the probability that a meal on an infected host results in infection we have that feeding results in p l 1 e a l h i γ l ϕ h l s infections each of the transition terms either maturation or maturation and infection is multiplied by a probability s l that a larva survives a unit of time here we make the simplifying assumption that survival is not impacted by infection state alternatively a larva may remain in the larva stage if it does not obtain a blood meal the number of susceptible larvae that do not feed but survive to the next time unit is given by s l 1 ϕ h 1 γ l 1 e a l h s ϕ h 1 γ l 1 e a l h i l s and an equivalent term may be defined for the infectious larvae since we assume 100 transstadial transmission an infectious larva may become an infectious nymph if it feeds and survives molting which is given by s l 1 ϕ h γ l 1 e a l h s ϕ h γ l 1 e a l h i l i equivalent terms may be defined for the nymph and adult stages where adults are assumed to feed on the larger hosts h 2 2 2 systemic infection tick to host define ν j to be the probability a bite from an infectious tick of stage j results in an infection in a host individual assuming an individual small host has on average a l l i encounters with infectious larvae per time unit the probability that a host does not become infected from encounters with l i is 1 ν l a l l i similarly the probability a host does not become infected from encounters with n i is 1 ν n a n n i thus overall the probability a small host does not become infected is 1 ν l a l l i 1 ν n a n n i exp a l ω l l i a n ω n n i where ω j ln 1 ν j a similar term may be defined for large hosts h where infection is assumed to occur due to encounters with infected adults ticks infection was defined in this manner in lewis et al 2006 which considered a single infectious state alternatively to define infection from multiple infectious states in allen and van den driessche 2008 it was assumed that the probability of infection follows a poisson distribution with the weights ω i defining the impacts of the different stages this leads to the probability of no infection for an individual h s being the same form as we have here e a l ω l l i a n ω n n i however the above derivation allows for a direct biological interpretation of weights ω i notice that systemic infections in hosts are assumed to follow from density dependent mass action incidence rates motivated by the assumption that higher tick densities will lead to higher tick burdens 2 2 3 non systemic infection co feeding transmission define η j i to be the probability that a susceptible stage j tick is infected from co feeding on a host with an infected tick of stage i then the probability a stage l s tick is not infected due to co feeding with infectious individuals on a small infected host is given by 1 η l l ϕ h 1 e a l h i l i k l h i 1 η l n ϕ h 1 e a n h i n i k l h i where ϕ h 1 e a l h i l i and ϕ h 1 e a l h i n i are the number of infectious larvae and nymph ticks respectively that feed on infected hosts in the given time period this quantity is divided by k l h i to account for individuals feeding on different hosts and at different days during the time interval here k l is the average number of larval feedings that can occur in one unit time and is obtained by dividing 30 days by the average number of days that larvae feed this may be rewritten in the equivalent form e 1 k l h i λ l l ϕ h 1 e a l h i l i λ l n ϕ h 1 e a n h i n i where λ i k ln 1 η i k meanwhile the probability a stage l s tick is not infected due to co feeding with infectious individuals on a small susceptible host is given by 1 η l l 1 ϕ h 1 e a l h s l i k l h s 1 η l n 1 ϕ h 1 e a n h s n i k l h s similar terms may be defined for co feeding infection in nymphs and adults where nymphs may be infected through co feeding with infected larvae or nymphs but adults may be infected only through co feeding with infected adults since we have assumed that the adults do not feed on the same hosts as the immature stages 2 2 4 the full model the full tick

r a gives the probability of transovarial transmission that is it is the fraction of infected eggs produced by an infected adult notice that a susceptible adult that becomes infected during its third and last blood meal either by systemic or non systemic infection may pass on the infection to her eggs the meanings of the remaining parameters are provided in tables 1 and 2 a schematic of model 2 is given in fig 1 3 persistence and global dynamics of the tick host model in this section we present a complete characterization of the global dynamics of the tick host model including the existence uniqueness and global stability of the interior equilibrium of model 1 an understanding of the dynamics of model 1 is essential for studying the full tick host pathogen model as these describe the dynamics of model 2 in the absence of the disease omitted proofs of the statements below are provided in the appendix first note that the difference equation system 1 can be written in the matrix form 3 x t 1 p x t x t where x t e t l t n t a t h t h t is a column vector containing the densities of the different stages and the projection matrix p has the form p x p 1 x 0 0 p 2 x where p 1 x is given in box i and p 2 x β h 1 c h h s h 0 0 β h 1 c h h s h next observe that the equation for host h is decoupled from the rest of the system and the same is true for the equation for host h it is not hard to show that for k h h if β k s k 1 and k 0 0 then each host population converges to its carrying capacity 4 lim t k t k c β k 1 s k c k 1 s k thus for the rest of this section we focus on establishing a global stability result for the interior equilibrium of the model 5 x 1 t 1 p 1 x 1 t h c h c x 1 t where x 1 t e t l t n t a t then we lift up the global stability to the model 1 by utilizing results on asymptotically autonomous systems and 4 to this end first note that it is not difficult to verify that 6 x 1 y 1 implies p 1 y 1 h c h c p 1 x 1 h c h c where x y denotes the usual component wise partial order on r n next following caswell 2000 and cushing 1998 define t ˆ as given in box ii and f ˆ 0 0 0 β 0 s a γ a 1 e a a h c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 note that the inherent projection matrix of the nonlinear system for the tick sub model 5 is p 1 0 f ˆ t ˆ thus the inherent net reproductive number r ˆ 0 which gives the expected number of offspring produced by a female throughout its lifetime in the absence of density dependence is the positive simple and strictly dominant eigenvalue of f ˆ i t ˆ 1 where i denotes the identity matrix a simple calculation shows that r ˆ 0 β 0 s e s l s n s a γ e γ l γ n γ a 1 e a l h c 1 e a n h c 1 e a a h c 1 s e 1 γ e π j l n 1 s j 1 γ j 1 e a j h c 1 s a 1 γ a 1 e a a h c by theorem 1 1 3 in cushing 1998 the inherent net reproductive number is on the same side of one as the spectral radius of p 1 0 thus we make use of r ˆ 0 in establishing the local and global dynamics of model 1 we now have the following result lemma 3 1 suppose r ˆ 0 1 then the origin e 0 0 0 0 0 is a globally asymptotically stable fixed point of system 5 next we establish the existence uniqueness and local stability of an interior fixed point theorem 3 2 suppose r ˆ 0 1 then 5 has a unique interior fixed point x 1 e l n a which is locally asymptotically stable lemma 3 3 establishes boundedness of solutions uniformly in the parameters lemma 3 3 let ξ 0 define k 0 e ˆ 0 l ˆ 0 n ˆ 0 a ˆ where e ˆ β 0 s a c 1 s e 1 γ e 1 ξ l ˆ s e γ e 1 s l 1 γ l 1 e a l h c e ˆ 1 ξ n ˆ s l γ l 1 e a l h c 1 s n 1 γ n 1 e a n h c l ˆ 1 ξ a ˆ s n γ n 1 e a n h c 1 s a 1 γ a 1 e a a h c n ˆ 1 ξ then every forward solution of 5 enters k in finite time and remains in k forever after next we show that if the net reproductive number is greater than one then the origin is unstable and system 5 is uniformly persistent theorem 3 4 suppose r ˆ 0 1 then 5 is uniformly persistent finally we establish the global stability of the interior fixed point the proof of this result relies on the following lemma from ackleh and deleenheer 2008 consider a map g r n r n we say that g is monotone if x y implies that g x g y lemma 3 5 ackleh and deleenheer 2008 let g r n r n be a continuous monotone map and a b be points in r n if a g a and g b b and if g has a unique fixed point x in the ordered interval a b x r n a x b then every solution sequence of the discrete system 7 x t 1 g x t starting in a b converges to x theorem 3 6 suppose that r ˆ 0 1 then every solution of 5 starting in r 4 0 0 0 0 converges to the unique interior equilibrium this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable proof first observe that every solution starting on the boundary of r 4 but not in 0 0 0 0 enters the positively invariant set int r 4 therefore it is enough to establish the theorem for solutions in int r 4 to this end pick x 1 0 e 0 l 0 n 0 a 0 int r 4 in fact by lemma 3 3 it suffices to consider x 1 0 int r 4 k the unique positive fixed point clearly belongs to k define b e ˆ l ˆ n ˆ a ˆ the maximal element in k then by lemma 3 3 we have that g b b where g x denotes the right hand side of 5 clearly g is monotone since the jacobian of g g x is a nonnegative matrix for all x since p 1 0 is an irreducible non negative matrix its spectral radius r which we know is larger than 1 because r ˆ 0 1 is an eigenvalue with a corresponding positive eigenvector v p 1 0 v r v in addition for all ε 0 sufficiently small it holds that g ε v r ε v o ε ε v since r 1 now for a given x 1 0 int r 4 k we can pick a sufficiently small ε 0 such that a ε v x 1 0 and a g a it follows from an application of lemma 3 5 that every solution of 5 starting in r 4 0 0 0 0 converges to the unique interior equilibrium the global asymptotic stability of the unique interior fixed point now follows from the local asymptotic stability in theorem 3 2 together with the global attractivity established above next we establish the global stability of the interior equilibrium for the full model 1 to prove this theorem we rely on theory for asymptotically autonomous discrete dynamical systems in d aniello and elaydi 2020 and mokni et al 2020 theorem 3 7 suppose that r ˆ 0 1 and s k β k 1 for k h h then every solution of 1 with initial condition e 0 l 0 n 0 a 0 i n t r 4 0 0 0 0 h 0 0 and h 0 0 converges to the unique interior equilibrium e l n a h c h c proof by theorem 3 2 in mokni et al 2020 it is sufficient to show that assumptions a1 and a2 in that paper are satisfied since h t h c and h t h c exponentially due to the global asymptotic stability then g t defined by the right hand side mapping of the first four equation of 1 converge uniformly to g the map defined by the right hand side of 5 hence a1 is satisfied as for a2 this is clearly satisfied as it is easily seen that g t maps int r 4 int r 4 4 case study borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila in ixodes ricinus in this section we apply model 2 to study two tick borne pathogens borellia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophila we use the hard bodied tick species ixodes ricinus which is one of the primary vectors of these pathogens in europe i ricinus is a three host tick with immature stages preferring small hosts such as lizards birds and small to medium sized mammals and adult ticks preferring larger hosts such as hedgehogs hares deer and domestic livestock gray et al 2016 estimates for life history parameters and pathogen specific parameters are provided in tables 1 and 2 tick and pathogen estimates primarily come from matser et al 2009 since we model female ticks only fecundity is estimated as half of the values provided in matser et al 2009 survival probabilities in model 2 are estimated using s j s j 1 t j where s j is the stage to stage survival probability provided in matser et al 2009 and t j is the average length of stage j meanwhile we estimate the probability a stage j tick reaches maturation as the inverse of the average length of stage j γ i 1 t j caswell 2000 following matser et al 2009 we assume the same co feeding transmission η for all tick stage we base parameter estimates for small and large hosts on mice and deer respectively note that while deer are not competent reservoir for b burgdorferi they may be competent reservoirs for a phagocytophila svitálková et al 2015 4 1 the basic reproduction number disease invasion we first apply the next generation matrix approach to calculate the basic reproduction number r 0 which gives the expected number of secondary infections produced by a primary infection in a totally susceptible population allen and van den driessche 2008 this quantity determines whether a pathogen will be able to invade the tick host system specifically a pathogen is able to invade the system if and only if r 0 1 note that in comparison r ˆ 0 determines whether a tick population can invade a given location to calculate r 0 we follow allen and van den driessche 2008 namely we first linearize the projection matrix of system 2 around the disease free equilibrium e l n a h c h c 0 0 0 0 0 0 of model 2 which is equivalent to the positive equilibrium of model 1 when ϕ h 0 ϕ h 0 0 recall that in order for a non trivial disease free equilibrium to exist we must have the inherent net reproductive number greater than one this results in a block triangular matrix with the 6 6 lower right block corresponding to the jacobian matrix for the disease states we then decompose this 6 6 block matrix into a matrix f describing new infections and a matrix t containing all other types of transitions the basic net reproduction number is calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix defined as f i t 1 where i is the identity matrix in many disease models f is a low rank matrix which makes it possible to obtain an exact expression for the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix f i t 1 however for model 2 since there are many sources of new infections this is not the case and r 0 is a zero of a high degree polynomial for which solutions are not generally tractable therefore we instead calculate r 0 numerically in matlab using the built in eig function to calculate the dominant eigenvalue in addition to calculating r 0 we also consider the elasticity of r 0 with respect to changes in model parameters the elasticity of r 0 with respect to parameter ζ is defined as 8 ζ r 0 r 0 ζ and gives the proportional change in r 0 given a proportional change in the input ζ caswell 2000 elasticity calculations indicate which processes may be key drivers of disease invasion and can help identify important information gaps in parameter estimates given both the variability and uncertainty surrounding tick ecology and pathogens we choose to work with interval estimates rather than point estimates for the model parameters therefore we compute r 0 for 20 000 sets of parameters chosen randomly from uniform distributions defined on the intervals given in tables 1 and 2 for each simulation r 0 is calculated as well as its elasticity with respect to proportional changes in the disease transmission parameters all derivatives are calculated numerically using the standard forward difference approximation with step size 0 01 approximately 1 of the simulations 238 and 239 for b burgdorferi and a phagocytophila respectively resulted in r ˆ 0 values less than one since this means the tick population dies out these simulations were removed a histogram of the obtained r 0 estimates is provided in fig 2 a for b burgdorferi since the distribution is skewed we applied a logarithmic transformation shown in fig 2 b to obtain the 95 confidence interval in figs 2 c 2 d we also provide normal probability plots for this logarithmic transformation we observe that after dropping 500 of the largest and smallest r 0 estimates r 0 appears to follow a log normal distribution similar results not shown were also obtained for a phagocytophila the estimated mean basic reproduction number r 0 and the 95 confidence intervals for both diseases are given in table 3 when compared to the estimates obtained in matser et al 2009 also provided in table 3 we observe that for b burgdorferi the r 0 estimate obtained from model 2 is larger as is the confidence interval while the opposite is true for a phagocytophila however relative to the length of the confidence intervals from matser et al 2009 these r 0 estimates are within 14 3 and 8 9 respectively of the estimates provided in matser et al 2009 we find the level of agreement between these two complementary approaches promising given the complicated nature of tick host pathogen systems as well as the existing uncertainty surrounding the many tick species and their pathogens the elasticities of r 0 for b burgdorferi with respect to the six disease transmission parameters from each of the 20 000 simulations minus the 500 largest and 500 smallest values and those simulations resulting in r ˆ 0 1 are provided in fig 3 we observe that r 0 is most sensitive to changes in parameters describing systemic transmission meanwhile it is less sensitive to changes in transovarial transmission the elasticities of r 0 for a phagocytophila not shown follow similar trends these results are in agreement with the results from matser et al 2009 which also found that r 0 for both diseases was most sensitive to changes in systemic infection parameters mean elasticities for both diseases are provided in table 4 in table 4 we also provide the coefficient of determination when these elasticities are fit to a linear regression in order to observe which parameters are correlated with r 0 since each of the 20 000 simulations are obtained by first choosing model parameters uniformly from their respective intervals and thus each simulation is based a different set of parameter values in general we should not expect to see a significant correlation between changes in a single model parameter and changes in r 0 in this case the only correlation we observe is with ν n in b burgdorferi which is quadratically correlated this correlation is also in agreement with what is known about the transmission of these pathogens specifically for b burgdorferi since the likelihood of transovarial transmission is small resulting few infected larvae nymphs are the primary drivers of this pathogen van duijvendijk et al 2015 hence the strong correlation of r 0 with the infection of hosts from infected nymphs ν n we hypothesize that the nonlinear relationship with ν n is likely due to the fact that an infection in a host may lead to multiple tick infections though host abundance is an important factor in the establishment and survival of tick populations ixodes ticks spend a majority of their life cycle off hosts cheng et al 2017 therefore abiotic environmental factors play a crucial role in tick survival and development cheng et al 2017 sonenshine 2018 in fact recent studies on the effect of climate change on tick population expansion have found that increasing temperature leading to increased survival rates can help enable tick invasion into new environments cheng et al 2017 hamer et al 2010 in order to understand how these parameters may contribute to disease invasion in table 5 we provide the elasticity of r 0 with respect to tick life cycle parameters and host carrying capacities we observe that r 0 tends to be more sensitive to changes in life history parameters such as survival probabilities than to changes in the pathogen parameters these elasticity results suggest that increased temperatures may also help enable disease invasion with respect to the survival of the different tick stages we observe that r 0 is most sensitive to the survival of the larva stage this is in agreement with previous studies which found survival from the larva to the nymph stage is critical for r 0 in both tick borne encephalitis and lyme borreliosis ostfeld and brunner 2015 for both diseases we observe in table 5 that the tick competition coefficient c is correlated with r 0 notice that larger c values result in smaller tick populations thus r 0 is positively correlated with larger tick densities the correlation of r 0 with the competition coefficient highlights an important data gap as intraspecific density dependent effects in ticks are difficult to estimate for example though estimates of questing ticks obtained through blanket dragging or flagging methods can be used to measure epidemiological risk they cannot yield information on absolute tick population sizes unless host assemblages and densities are also known randolph 2004 in addition these methods only capture a minority of active ticks and thus tick abundance estimates may be biased downward nyrhilä et al 2020 4 2 beyond r 0 disease establishment while r 0 is a useful quantity for determining whether a pathogen can invade a tick host system it does not provide any information about what happens after invasion occurs this fact is highlighted in fig 4 which gives the disease prevalence in the tick population against r 0 for cases when invasion occurs i e r 0 1 specifically we define disease prevalence to be the proportion of ticks in host seeking tick stages larva nymph and adult that are infected as can be seen in this figure the same disease prevalence may be obtained for a wide range of r 0 values in this section we use model 2 to examine two important disease metrics once invasion has occurred disease prevalence and time to disease establishment we define the establishment time to be the amount of time it takes the number of host seeking infected ticks to reach some proportion of the total disease equilibrium density for simulation purposes here we choose the proportion to be 50 for all numerical simulations of model 2 generated with parameter values selected from tables 1 and 2 we observed the system converge to a stationary equilibrium this was confirmed numerically by verifying that the final time densities for each of the tick stages was sufficiently close here we used 10 8 to the nine previous values thus the infection prevalence in the long run is essentially constant and may be found by numerically simulating model 2 for sufficiently long time histograms for the disease prevalence and time to disease establishment for b burgdorferi generated from 20 000 monte carlo simulations are provided in fig 5 table 6 provides the means and confidence intervals for the two disease metrics for both diseases both a logarithmic and square root transformation of the calculated histograms result in distributions that are approximately normal thus we provide confidence intervals obtained from each of these transformations meanwhile tables 7 and 8 give elasticities of these two metrics with respect to changes in the model parameters reported values in tables 6 8 were calculated from 20 000 monte carlo simulations after removing all cases where r 0 1 and then removing the 500 largest and 500 smallest values simulations for time to disease establishment were initialized with a single individual in each of the infected states the mean disease prevalence was found to be 11 85 for b burgdorferi and 9 00 for a phagocytophila though previous studies have shown that disease prevalence may be highly variable in different habitat types these estimates fall within prevalence ranges reported in the literature see for example ogden et al 2013 reye et al 2010 schorn et al 2011 a metaanalysis of 154 european studies found that 13 7 of i ricinus were infected with borrelia spp but prevalence varied from 2 to 49 depending on the region reye et al 2010 in luxembourg the mean prevalence was found to be 11 3 for b burgdorferi with highest and lowest observed prevalences of 21 9 and 2 8 respectively reye et al 2010 a study of the prevalence of b burgdorferi in i scapularis for different locations in canada found similar prevalences which ranged from 9 8 to 14 1 ogden et al 2013 in luxembourg the mean prevalence for a phagocytophilum in i ricinus was 1 9 with highest and lowest observed prevalences of 4 5 and 0 8 respectively reye et al 2010 however in bavarian public parks in germany higher prevalences of a phagocytophilum were found with a mean prevalence of 11 6 and ranges from 8 1 to 20 1 schorn et al 2011 notably it is remarked in schorn et al 2011 that the prevalence of a phagocytophilum appears to be lower in woodland areas with respect to the elasticity calculations we continue to observe that as with disease invasion disease prevalence is also sensitive to the tick survival probabilities however infection of hosts and tick searching efficiency have no impact on infection prevalence in addition there are no significant correlations the mean time to disease establishment was found to be 21 77 months for b burgdorferi and 20 84 months for a phagocytophila for comparison it was found that it takes the pathogen b burgdorferi three to five years to invade following the invasion of the tick i scapularis in central and eastern canada respectively ogden et al 2013 however these estimates are based on the time since the tick rather than the pathogen first invades a region and disease establishment is defined as the first time that the disease prevalence increases in table 8 we observe that there are a number of model parameters that the time to disease establishment is not sensitive to however as with the previous metrics it is sensitive to the tick survival probabilities we also observe that the transovarial transmission probability r a and egg survival probability s e are correlated with disease establishment time since increases in the parameter c decreases tick density and thus may make it possible that the infection never reaches establishment as defined here we do not include elasticity calculations for c in table 8 5 discussion the tick host pathogen system involves many complex interactions that depend on both abiotic conditions such as temperature and humidity and biotic factors such as availability of hosts gray et al 2016 randolph 2004 clearly not all of these factors have been included in model 2 in this section we briefly discuss how the model framework developed here may be extended to incorporate some of these elements since tick development and questing is temperature dependent variation in seasonal tick dynamics may occur in different geographic regions which may have significant impacts on pathogen transmission randolph 2004 for example maintenance of b burgdorferi in i scapularis depends heavily on the timing of seasonal activity in the immature stages since efficient infection of the larva stage from reservoir hosts requires that larvae feed after infected nymphs gatewood et al 2009 though model 2 does not include seasonality this may be easily incorporated by making the search efficiencies a j a function of time given the one month time unit this would mean that rather than a disease free equilibrium the model would possess a disease free p cycle for some 1 p 12 in this case r 0 is calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of i 1 p f i i t i 1 where matrices f i and t i describe new infections and other transitions respectively evaluated at each point of the p cycle cushing and ackleh 2012 van den driessche and yakubu 2019 similarly it is also possible to define the survival probabilities to be functions of temperature as is commonly done in stella models model 2 also does not account for all of the possible complicated interactions between ticks and host species for example ticks often feed on multiple host types with only a portion of these hosts being reservoirs for the pathogen depending on the specific biological population under consideration it may be appropriate to incorporate additional host types into model 2 such as a non competent host for the immature stages in addition it has been observed that ticks have a tendency to aggregate on hosts for example a study of i ricinus on rodents in slovakia found that 20 of hosts fed 74 of nymphs and 61 of larvae randolph et al 1999 accounting for this aggregation can be particularly important for pathogens such as tick borne encephalitis where short infection durations in reservoir hosts mean that co feeding is a major source of transmission this aggregation tendency may be incorporated into model 2 following the arguments developed in rosa et al 2003 specifically suppose the distribution of stage j ticks on hosts follows a negative binomial distribution with the shape parameter σ j determining the degree of aggregation then the average numbers of infected larvae and nymphs feeding with a susceptible larva individual on a susceptible host become ϕ h 1 e a l h s l i k l h s 1 1 σ l and ϕ h 1 e a n h s l i n i k l h s 1 ρ l n σ l σ n respectively where ρ l n is a correlation coefficient for larvae and nymphs thus the probability that a susceptible larva feeding on a susceptible host does not become infected through co feeding is now given by ψ l s e 1 k l h s λ l l ϕ h 1 e a l h s 1 1 σ l l i λ l n ϕ h 1 e a n h s 1 ρ l n σ l σ n n i with the other co feeding terms defined similarly finally we note that the two pathogens considered in this paper were chosen because of the long durations of infection in competent hosts for other diseases in which host infection lasts for only a matter of days such as tick borne encephalitis the one month time unit used in model 2 means that the contribution of infected hosts to disease transmission becomes exaggerated however this one month time unit allows us to take a more coarse grain approach to modeling the tick population by only distinguishing between different developmental stages and not different tick activity states e g questing larvae versus feeding larvae as has been done in other models such as norman et al 1999 rosa et al 2003 rosa and pugliese 2007 since questing and feeding may last for weeks or days respectively reducing the unit of time to a week or a day to account for shorter durations of infection would mean that these different activity states should also be included an extension of model 2 that includes these states is currently being developed by the authors and in future work we intend to examine how these differences in scales may affect model predictions 6 conclusion in this paper we developed a tick host pathogen system to study the invasion and establishment of tick borne diseases this discrete time model incorporates different developmental stages of the tick variable host preference based on developmental stage and three forms of pathogen transmission since model 2 describes changes in densities over time it is possible to study disease metrics beyond the basic reproduction number r 0 such as disease prevalence and time to establishment a consistent pattern we observed for all three disease metrics considered here is that the tick survival probabilities play an important role in both disease invasion and establishment since increased temperatures have been shown to result in increased tick survival rates this supports previous findings that climate change may facilitate the expansion of both tick populations and their associated pathogens cheng et al 2017 hamer et al 2010 in contrast though disease invasion is sensitive to tick to host transmission ν j and tick searching efficiency a j neither disease prevalence nor time to disease establishment are sensitive to these parameters though model 2 does not include some biological features of the tick host pathogen system as described above we find that the model is still able to produce results similar to those found using the alternative next generation matrix approach applied in matser et al 2009 as well as results obtained from field studies in future work we aim to incorporate at least some of these additional aspects into our model framework model 2 will serve as a benchmark for understanding the effects of these added factors since comparisons of the two model outputs may help to identify which characteristics cause fundamental changes in the predictions of disease transmission and thus are important to include when studying tick borne pathogens understanding what enables the successful invasion of ticks into new geographic locations and coinciding pathogen invasions is essential for controlling the expansion of tick borne diseases variations of models 1 and 2 will also be used to gain further insights into this issue in these studies invasion and time to extinction for ticks and their pathogens will be studied by extending the models developed here to include demographic stochasticity and allee effects both of which are be particularly important for small populations as well as spatial structure and host

has a positive simple strictly dominant eigenvalue r by theorem 1 1 3 in cushing 1998 we have r 1 if and only if r ˆ 0 1 thus the extinction equilibrium e 0 is locally asymptotically stable if r ˆ 0 1 moreover following the same argument as in lemma a 2 we have that for any x 0 0 x t 0 as t whenever r ˆ 0 1 thus the extinction equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for r ˆ 0 1 proof of

establish uniform persistence we follow similar arguments to those in ackleh and deleenheer 2008 that rely on an application of theorem 4 1 in hofbauer and so 1989 first note that since r ˆ 0 1 it follows from theorem 1 1 3 in cushing 1998 that p 1 0 has a positive strictly dominant eigenvalue r 1 hence 0 0 0 0 is unstable now using similar notation as in hofbauer and so 1989 we let h r 4 y bd r 4 and f denote the map on the right hand side of 5 then clearly f h y h y since int r 4 is positively invariant for the system 5 by theorem 2 1 in hale and waltman 1989 and using lemma 3 3 it follows that there exists a global attractor x in h let m be the maximal compact invariant set in y here m 0 0 0 0 uniform persistence follows if we can prove that 1 m is isolated in x and 2 w s m y here w s m the stable set of m denotes the set of points whose solution sequence for 5 converges to m in fact next we prove a stronger result that m is a repeller which by theorem 2 1 in hofbauer and so 1989 is equivalent to showing 1 m is isolated in h and 2 w s m m utilizing corollary 2 2 in hofbauer and so 1989 we can prove that m is a repeller by constructing a continuous function q r 4 r which satisfies 1 q x 0 for x m and 2 there is a neighborhood u of m such that for all x u m there exists a t 0 where q f t x p 1 x x to this end since p 1 0 is non negative and irreducible its dominant eigenvalue r 1 has a corresponding left eigenvector p 0 i e p p 1 0 r p pick r 1 r such that p p 1 0 r p 0 then by continuity of p 1 x there exists a neighborhood u of m in h such that p p 1 x r p 0 now define q r 4 r as follows q x p x then q x 0 for x u iff x m and is positive everywhere else in u moreover q f x p p 1 x x r p x q x x u m this proves that the system 5 uniformly

24472,established pests are often overlooked as candidates for eradication or containment programmes because the use of traditional control techniques over very large areas usually becomes uneconomic in such cases classical biological control can be an attractive option if biocontrol agents become established in equilibrium with the invasive species there are no ongoing costs of control arriving at the point of biocontrol release however requires significant time and investment in research and testing and success of biocontrol agents is not guaranteed it is therefore advisable to undertake preliminary analysis of the likelihood of success simulation modelling using population dynamics models can be very useful in this regard here we develop a model for biocontrol of an invasive social insect the european wasp vespula germanica and derive the conditions for success of a biocontrol program keywords invasive species classical biological control vespula germanica control feasibility simulation model 1 introduction insects are the planet s most species rich group playing important roles in food web interactions and ecosystem processes while also featuring prominently as invasive species in terms of their number and impact brockerhoff and liebhold 2017 the impacts of invasive insects are well known they threaten human health via stinging and as vectors of disease consume crops putting food supplies at risk disrupt ecosystem function endanger valued species and damage infrastructure as a result governments across the globe routinely spend significant amounts of money protecting their economies environment and communities from the negative impacts of invasive insects bradshaw et al 2016 estimate invasive insects cost a minimum of us 70 0 billion per year globally while associated health costs exceed us 6 9 billion per year depending on the stage of invasion strategies available to biosecurity agencies to avoid or minimise impacts of invasive insects typically consist of prevention via pre border and border quarantine activities surveillance for early detection rapid response with a view to eradication or containment to slow the spread sharov and liebhold 1998 cacho et al 2008 epanchin niell 2017 hester et al 2017 as the size of an invasion grows so too do the costs of traditional control techniques that typically form part of eradication or containment programmes eventually their use over very large areas becomes uneconomic given budget constraints and such programmes may be abandoned cacho et al 2007 epanchin niell and hastings 2010 if mitigation of impacts is still desired biological control where the goal is permanent establishment of an agent and control of the pest is usually the only economically feasible option classical biological control cbc the introduction of populations of an exotic natural enemy into a new environment to control a pest where the aim is permanent control of the pest without further intervention hajek 2004 van driesche et al 2008 has been used in pest management for more than a century although success has been mixed cock et al 2016 naranjo 2018 it is difficult to predict the likely success of an agent and a substantial proportion of biocontrol agents fail to control their target beggs et al 2008 a recent analysis of cbc programmes for the control of insect pests found that since the 1970s 33 of the introductions led to establishment and 10 resulted in satisfactory control cock et al 2016 where programmes do succeed economic analyses suggest very large benefit to cost ratios naranjo et al 2015 despite this the number of classical biological control programmes and releases have decreased in recent decades due in part to the increased regulatory oversight imposed in many countries out of concerns about non target and indirect effects that may be caused by agent introduction hajek et al 2016 as the cost in time and resources required for host specificity testing has increased the number of natural enemies proposed for release has slowed hajek et al 2016 furthermore biological control programmes are typically constrained by small budgets and short timetables godfray and waage 1991 given the long time frames involved in testing agents the uncertainty surrounding successful control and limited budgets for cbc programmes mathematical models of biological control can provide useful prospective information about the conditions required for success prior to significant investment occurring models of biological control exist in the literature they range from the simple analytical models of theoretical population biology which allow very general predictions about equilibrium population levels e g beddington et al 1978 davis et al 2006 kaser and heimpel 2015 to detailed simulation models e g gutierrez et al 1988 gutierrez et al 2008 portela et al 2020 poggi et al 2021 which contain a large number of parameters to be estimated in order to apply the model and which may not be useful in information poor and time limited contexts godfray and waage 1991 in this paper we develop a simulation model of intermediate complexity for an invasive insect in an attempt to strike a balance between model applicability and data needs we apply the model to the case of the european wasp vespula germanica fabricius hymenoptera vespidae in australia where the pest has significant potential to spread further de villiers et al 2017 cook 2019 and we determine the conditions that would make the biocontrol successful based on combinations of parameter values in the model the european wasp is native to europe northern africa and temperate asia and introduced into north america chile argentina australia new zealand spradbery and maywald 1992 it is adaptable to a wide range of habitats and climates de villiers et al 2017 and has significant negative impacts on communities industry and the environment in regions where it has been introduced macintyre and hellstrom 2015 cook 2019 lester and beggs 2019 the european wasp is widespread in new zealand and south eastern australia and was the subject of a past biological control program in both countries with mixed success field and darby 1991 moller et al 1991 lefoe et al 2001 beggs et al 2008 the poor performance of the chosen agent sphecophaga vesparum vesparum curtis hymenoptera ichneumonidae is thought to have been caused by a genetic bottleneck because all releases were essentially derived from a single female parasitoid beggs et al 2008 ward 2014 unfortunately no other information that could assist in understanding agent performance in australia was recorded during the release program the possibility of improved control from using different genetic strains of the agent and the likelihood of reduced screening and testing requirements has spurred renewed interest in using s v vesparum to control wasps however there are other candidates that could be considered and tested with the model developed here these include two agents recently approved for import and release in new zealand the wasp nest beetle metoecus paradoxus linnaeus coleoptera ripiphoridae and a hoverfly volucella inanis linnaeus diptera syrphidae landcare research n d m paradoxus has a complex lifecycle adults lay eggs in wood and bark outside wasp nests and once hatched larvae are transported into nests inadvertently by foraging wasps attacking wasp larva once inside ward 2014 in contrast adult females of v pellucens enter wasp nests laying eggs which hatch with larvae dropping to the bottom of nests and feeding on wasp young and dead adults ward 2014 the goal of this work is to develop a general model that allows an improved understanding of biocontrol programmes for invasive insects to demonstrate the model we use s v vesparum as the biological control agent for v germanica although the model could be easily adapted to understand other pest biological control interactions 1 1 life cycles of v germanica and s vesparum the european wasp is a social insect and possesses characteristics of eusociality that allow it to succeed as an invasive species moller 1996 kasper 2004 beggs et al 2011 there is an overlap of generations reproduction is restricted to a few individuals and there is cooperative brood care wilson and hölldobler 2005 the normal colony life cycle is annual with nests being founded by a single reproductive queen in the spring the reproductive cycle progresses as follows the queen emerges in spring to forage and prepare new nests of about 20 cells in size workers emerge 4 6 weeks after egg lay and assume foraging nest protection and nest building duties thus freeing up the queen for egg laying the nest grows over summer and new queens are produced in autumn these queens mate with drones in autumn then fly off to hibernate in sheltered areas during winter widmer et al 1995 in their native range european wasp colonies naturally die off in winter this is not the case in locations experiencing mild winters including parts of australia where nest construction can continue throughout the year and over wintered nests are common spradbery and maywald 1992 widmer et al 1995 kasper 2004 overwintering is a modification of the usual annual life cycle where polygyny multi queening occurs more than one and often many hundreds of productive queens share the same nest as a result overwintered nests can reach very large sizes in summer producing thousands of individuals while the process of predation by s v vesparum on european wasp is relatively straightforward it attacks european wasp nests and feeds on the developing larvae and pupae its life cycle is complex beggs et al 1996 harris and rose 1999 during spring winged male and female s v vesparum emerge from cocoons in the remains of old wasp nests one to four springs after their cocoons were formed females enter new wasp nests and lay eggs onto larvae or pupae with the parasitoid larvae feeding on the host and subsequently forming one of three types of cocoons yellow weak walled yellow and white yellow cocoons are thick walled that will remain dormant in the nest producing winged adults up to four years later weak walled yellow cocoons produce winged adults capable of flight within two weeks weak walled white cocoons produce short winged females within two weeks and these continue to lay eggs within the parental nest so that multiple generations follow during the same season harris and rose 1999 2 method the model is centred on the population dynamics of the invasive wasp and a biocontrol agent that affects the viability of wasp nests as well as the ability of colonies to reproduce 2 1 model studies from australia kasper 2004 and new zealand barlow et al 2002 have modelled the population dynamics of european wasp using a ricker equation ricker 1975 incorporating weather effects and density dependence we modify the model of barlow et al 1996 to represent the growth of wasp and parasitoid populations and their interaction and introduce dispersal equations for spatial spread of both the wasp w and the biocontrol agent b we also introduce the option for detected nests to be destroyed based on the probability of encounter between wasps and humans which in turn depends on the density of households and wasp nests in the given location the model is presented below and a summary of model parameters and descriptions is given in table 1 2 1 1 population dynamics based on the life cycles discussed earlier the wasp population is expressed as number of nests per km2 in spring ws and autumn wa whereas the biocontrol population is expressed as number of adults per km2 in spring bs and autumn ba the value of ba is a proxy for the number of cocoons of all types that overwinter in wasp nests growth of the two populations is given by 1 w a t α w 1 e α t w s t e β w w s t 2 w s t 1 w a t 1 e μ t 3 b a t α b b s t e β b t b s t 4 b s t 1 b a

the biocontrol on growth and winter mortality of wasp nests respectively defined as linear functions of biocontrol agent density 5 e α t m i n ρ b b s t 1 6 e μ t min φ b b s t 1 the shape of these functions is open to debate but a linear relationship is a good start in the absence of other evidence the biocontrol efficiency parameters are the reduction in the wasp growth rate ρ b and the winter

in 8 is adjusted based on the number of wasp nests on the site in spring w s t which essentially measures habitat available to colonise the time step t is one year with each year starting in spring when wasp queens emerge to start building up new nests 2 1 2 dispersal each spring queens emerge from hibernation and start building new nests and multiplying their colonies dispersal to new sites can occur early in the season as queens find nesting sites and later in the season as new queens establish new nests for simplicity we assume that dispersal occurs in spring the probability that a queen emerging in site i will move to site j and establish a nest there is given by 9 p i j 1 π γ 1 d i j γ 2 where γ is a median dispersal distance and d is the distance between points i and j the area under this curve in the interval to equals 1 whereas the area in the interval γ to γ is 0 5 see sm section a the same dispersal kernel is applied for both species but with γ replaced by the corresponding parameter γw or γb in the numerical model the landscape is represented as a grid with n square cells of equal size or sites and distance is expressed as a matrix d of dimensions n n representing the distance between each cell and every other cell on the map composed of elements di j this allows dispersal probability to be estimated for all sites at once using eq 9 yielding the matrices p w and p b of the same dimensions as d the expected numbers of wasp nests and biocontrol agents after dispersal are 10 w d p w w t 11 b d p b b t where w and b are column vectors of n elements containing the density of wasps and biocontrol agents in every site on the map leung et al 2010 present an application of this dispersal kernel in 2 dimensional discrete space the approach we followed using matrices representing discrete sites in space is similar to theirs in stochastic simulations the actual dispersal for each run of the model is selected randomly by sampling from a uniform distribution against matrix p the numerical process is explained in sm section a 2 1 3 detection we assume that all nests detected by humans are destroyed when the wasps are active during spring and summer the probability that a nest will be detected is given by 12 p d 1 e δ w w a t h where h is the number of households per km2 in the given site and δw is a detectability parameter related to the probability of encounter between humans and wasps given their respective local density the number of nests destroyed is 13 k t p d w a t and after destruction the number of nests is updated to 14 w a t w a t 1 p d 2 2 running simulations all the variables above are expressed as column vectors of dimension n where each row represents a site on the map the results of solving the model 1 8 for a planning horizon of t years are presented as matrices of dimensions n t where columns are time periods there is one such result matrix for each vector such that w ws t solved for t 1 t b bs t solved for t 1 t k kt solved for t 1 t this matrix representation of results is useful for analysis of patterns in space as well as in time the model is implemented in matlab language mathworks 2020a each scenario was run for 1000 stochastic iterations over a planning horizon of 60 years to initialise the simulation we need initial values ws 0 and bs 0 for the wasp and biocontrol populations see eqs 1 and 3 for each site expressed as vectors for the area of interest the initial states are w 0 and b 0 of dimensions n 1 for each stochastic iteration the values of w 0 were generated randomly based on atlas of living australia data ala see 2 3 and the wasp parameters for the area of interest for convenience a matrix w0 of dimensions n 1000 was created and used to initialise all the simulation runs with each column providing the w 0 value for the corresponding random iteration the initial vector b 0 depends on the biocontrol release strategy for the given w 0 we consider two decision variables for the biocontrol program xp the percentage of wasp nests that are initially infested with the biocontrol agent on a given site xc the spatial coverage of the biocontrol release expressed as the top percentile of wasp infested sites selected for inoculation for example xc 10 indicates that only the top 10 percent of sites in terms of wasp nest density are selected for release of the biocontrol several combinations of these decision variables were selected for exploratory runs within the ranges xp 10 to 50 and xc 1 to 20 these experiments represent strategies with different combinations of spatial coverage and intensity of control per site 2 3 data and model calibration model calibration was carried out based on data from the literature combined with four spatial datasets maps a to d in table 2 and overlaid onto map e table 2 to create the final dataset for analysis and modelling the following variables were created as column vectors of 2462 elements representing the cells sites on the grid map e ala reports of european wasp presence per site estimated by overlaying the point data in map a with the grid map e and summing the number of points that fall into each site area the area of the site in km2 not all sites are the same area because of truncation along the coastline household density households per km2 estimated by intersecting sa1 map c with the grid map e estimating the weighed sum of households for each site and dividing by its area land use proportion estimated by overlaying the raster in map b onto the grid map e and calculating the proportion of the area of each site that is covered by each of seven categories of land use the seven categories were aggregated from the australian land use and management alum classification see sm for an explanation of this process 2 3 1 vespula germanica parameters parameters for the population dynamics of european wasps are available for new zealand plunkett et al 1989 barlow et al 1996 beggs et al 2008 and england archer 1985 but not for australia some parameters reported in the literature provide a starting point for calibrating our model but differences between countries need to be considered notably the maximum number of wasp nests per ha κ w reported for beech forests in nz 12 nests per ha is too high for australian conditions crosland 1991 kasper 2004 tennant et al 2011 there is also uncertainty regarding the number of years it takes for the population to reach saturation in the absence of control which is determined by α w for a given κ w other important sources of uncertainty are the dispersal parameter γ w and the detection probability parameter δ w these four parameters were estimated through simulation using a genetic algorithm ga combined with the occurrence data from ala wasp detection records in ala start as early as 1960 with increasing reports since 2010 fig 1 to estimate likely values of uncertain parameters a likelihood function was created based on data from ala and the simulation model the likelihood function minimised by the ga is 15 f u ω n n o b s n p r e d u i 2 ω a a o b s a p r e d u i 2 with ω n ω a 1 0 ω n 1 0 ω a 1 where ui αi κi γi δi is the vector of parameter values representing chromosome i in the population of possible solutions n o b s is the total number of cells in the cluster for which wasp presence has been reported in ala and a o b s is the area of the minimum convex hull enclosing all those infestations the area invaded the predicted variables n p r e d and a p r e d are the means of predicted number of cells and area invaded over the nr stochastic runs of the model the number of infestations and area invaded are weighed by ω n and ω a in the minimization the weights were set at 0 5 0 5 for this analysis the problem was solved using the matlab ga function mathworks 2020b with a population of 50 individuals 50 sets of parameter values chromosomes that evolve over time in a stochastic environment according to a given fitness function 15 this process is analogous to that used by hester and cacho 2012 see sm section c for further details 2 3 2 biocontrol parameters parameters for the biocontrol agent would vary depending on the organism selected some parameter values for new zealand exist for s v vesparum in the literature for example barlow et al 1996 estimated the winter mortality parameter μb at 0 85 and the carrying capacity parameter κb at 235 parasitoid cocoons per wasp nest given the uncertainty in the values of biocontrol parameters and lack of data for australia simulations were conducted using a factorial experiment with 4 factors 3 levels resulting in 81 parameter sets consisting of all combinations of αb 2 3 4 μb 0 1 0 3 0 5 γb 1 3 5 ρb φb 0 05 0 1 0 2 each of these 81 parameters sets was used to run a 60 year simulation with 1000 stochastic iterations 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence data and wasp population parameters european wasp occurrence reports in ala remained relatively low from 1960 until the mid 1990s fig 1a with an average of 2 reports per year from 1997 the number of reports started to increase at an increasing rate to reach 191 reports in 2020 this has been accompanied by a growing spatial extent starting in tasmania 1960 and spreading to victoria 1982 new south wales and western australia 2010 and south australia 2011 we know that european wasps have been present in mainland australia before their first reports in ala spradbery and maywald 1992 crosland 1991 but that is not relevant for our purpose of estimating population parameters given the data available and the scale of the analysis increasing numbers of reports in ala over time indicate growing wasp population densities which increase the probability of contact with humans and therefore the probability that the encounter will be reported to ala in terms of seasonality fig 1b reports tend to increase in late summer and early autumn march and april when the wasps are most active and populations are growing the lowest number of reports occur in winter june to august when wasps are less active and outdoor human activity is reduced these patterns are consistent with other studies crosland 1991 kasper et al 2008 the majority of reports 305 have occurred in urban residential areas table 3 followed by conservation areas 246 agriculture and forestry 142 and recreation areas 132 these are all areas where humans are likely to come into contact with wasps and where wasps are likely to disrupt recreational and work activities we selected only observations from eastern australia for further analysis fig 2 visual inspection suggested that there are 4 different clusters and this was confirmed by applying cluster analysis to the point data based on distance these clusters were used to estimate parameter values for the wasp population using a ga as explained in the methods section the parameter values estimated independently for each of the clusters were generally consistent table 4 average values of αw growth rate and κw carrying capacity were 3 69 ranging from 3 48 to 3 88 and 1 28 1 26 1 30 respectively the dispersal parameter γw had an average value of 3 24 but with lower values for tas and vic 1 50 and 1 89 compared to nsw and sa 4 75 and 4 81 these differences reflect the temporal patterns of spread which were slower in the former clusters than in the latter ones the detection parameter δw had an average value of 0 59 with a range of 0 52 in nsw to 0 63 in tas now that plausible parameter values for the invasive wasp have been obtained the focus can shift to feasibility of the biocontrol 3 2 biocontrol feasibility the success of the biocontrol program hinges on two factors 1 the feasibility that the agent will establish and spread and 2 the effectiveness of the agent in suppressing growth and spread of wasp nests factor 1 is related to three biocontrol parameters growth rate α b winter mortality μ b and spread rate γ b factor 2 is related to two biocontrol parameters the reduction in wasp growth rate ρ b and the winter mortality of wasp nests ϕ b that are infested by the agent the relative rate of increase for a population r bs t 1 bs t must be 1 in order for the population to grow fig 3 a shows that for this example when αb 2 winter mortality must be 0 5 in order for the biocontrol population to establish and grow given the presence of wasp nests this is lower than the mortality of 0 85 estimated by barlow et al 1996 and so an important question is whether this rate may be lower in australia given the dryer conditions compared to new zealand the curves in fig 3a and 3b will shift as the value of the fixed parameter α or μ in panels a and b repectively changes but the bottom line is that if r 1 for the biocontrol there is no need to undertake further evaluation as the organism will be unable to establish a viable population in this case the main question is whether there are other suitable species for biocontrol with high values of r regarding the dispersal parameter barlow et al 1998 estimated a velocity of spread of 1 15 to 1 6 km per year in new zealand which is equivalent to γb values of 0 4 0 6 see sm section a these may be too low to keep up with the spread of the wasp given the average γw value of 3 24 in table 4 and this has implications for the spatial pattern of biocontrol release the effectiveness of the biocontrol in the model occurs through ρb and φb these are uncertain parameters that have not been measured for australian conditions while some australian release sites of s v vesparum were monitored g lefoe pers comm there was no evidence in subsequent years that the parasitoid established at any of those sites lefoe et al 2001 however using the model we can explore combinations of parameter values that would make the program feasible in the sense of classical biological control where the biocontrol agent becomes established and maintains the population of the pest at a low level hajek et al 2016 the model is a simplified version of the life cycle and does not represent different types of cocoons explicitly the density of biocontrol adults in spring is represented by bs this variable influences negatively the growth rate of the european wasp population in spring and summer the density of biocontrol cocoons in v germanica nests at the end of autumn is ba this variable influences the mortality of wasp nests during winter in this way we can represent two different mechanisms for the effect of the biocontrol on the pest one on the mortality of wasp nests given by φb in eqs 2 and 6 and the other on the rate at which new queens establish new nests during spring and summer given by ρb in eqs 1 and 5 we tested different options and identified sets of parameter values that would make the biocontrol program feasible fig 4 in all phase diagrams the system starts on the top left high wasp density low biocontrol density and moves down and to the right towards some sort of dynamic equilibrium all four cases in fig 4 are feasible in the classical biological control sense the effectiveness parameters interact with growth and mortality parameters of the pest to result in different population patterns through time fig 4 in all cases there is a cyclical behaviour in the population densities of both species as expected but in some cases the system settles into an equilibrium point over time at high growth and mortality rates both the frequency and amplitude of the cycle are higher curves a and b than at the corresponding low growth and mortality rates curves c and d it is interesting that relative high effectiveness ρb φb 0 03 increases the fluctuations in both wasp and biocontrol populations curves b and d compared to the case of low effectiveness curves a and c in case b the biocontrol grows fast and is highly effective causing the wasp population to collapse leading to a collapse of the biocontrol as less wasp nests become available which in turn allows the wasp population to increase and so on in a cyclical equilibrium where wasp populations can become as high as 0 7 nests per km2 in some years the cases we are interested in are those that tend towards some sort of equilibrium between the two species with wasp density maintained at a relatively low level these are the cases for which classical biological control can succeed in the long term our modelling approach allows us to screen alternatives before considering the costs and benefits of the program at this stage scientists may be able to assess whether it is likely that the biocontrol agent will reach the required levels of growth mortality and pest suppression to make the program feasible perhaps through additional research targeted at measuring the most uncertain parameters 3 3 simulation results and decision analysis above we have seen conditions for feasibility of the biocontrol program for a given site without considering the spatial distribution of the invasion as it progresses through time once we introduce dispersal in the simulations we need to track the wasp and biocontrol populations in space as well as in time this is done through matrices w and b of dimensions n t see section 2 2 where each of the n rows represents a site on the map and the columns represent time periods 1 t we selected clusters b vic and c nsw from table 4 for further analysis this provides an interesting comparison between two sites that have similar growth parameters αw 3 79 and 3 48 κw 1 30 and 1 26 but differ in terms of dispersal parameters γw 1 89 and 4 75 the areas of interest were selected by finding the minimum convex hull of clusters b and c in fig 2 and adding a buffer of 0 5 the ala reports were overlaid on the grid map map e in table 2 to calculate the number of reports per cell fig 5 each cell site on the map for the given cluster is represented by one row of the state matrices w and b the number of sites n using this selection method were 658 for vic 244 681 km2 and 389 sites for nsw 144 493 km2 not all sites have the same area because of truncation of cells along the coastline the spread simulations were conducted on this discrete representation of space fig 5 using the centroids of cells to calculate the distance matrix d of dimensions n n with elements dij as in eq 9 several combinations of the two decision variables associated with the biocontrol release xp intensity of inoculation per site and xc spatial coverage of the release were simulated fig 6 shows phase diagrams for a selection of those simulations amongst the 81 parameter sets tested 15 of simulations resulted in failure of the biocontrol with xp xc 10 20 and 35 failed with xp xc 50 1 this suggests that the low biocontrol release coverage in the second case increases the probability of failure for any set of biocontrol parameter values for cases that led to establishment of the biocontrol the final density of biocontrol agents tended to be higher in nsw than in vic notice the higher density of points towards the right of the plots in figs 6c and d compared to a and b the 95th percentiles of final biocontrol density were 4 5 adults km 2 in vic and 6 2 adults km 2 in nsw see sm section d for details there are interesting differences between cases in the phase diagrams fig 6 comparing the top panel vic cluster against the bottom panel nsw cluster and focusing on the best parameter combinations those with final values towards the bottom of each plot the mean state trajectories tend to a long term equilibrium of 0 24 wasp nests per km2 in vic and 0 34 wasp nests per km2 in nsw the equilibrium density of the biocontrol also tends to be higher in nsw as seen above both clusters have similar wasp growth parameters see table 4 but very different dispersal parameters γw in nsw is more than double the value in vic 4 75 vs 1 89 this is reflected in wider cycles in the approach to equilibrium for nsw figs 6c and 6d compared to vic figs 6a and 6b as wasp invasions can move longer distances to new sites comparing the left panel to the right panel of fig 6 we have two extreme cases with xp 10 and xc 20 figs 6a and 6c the biocontrol release covers a larger area the top 20 percent of invaded sites but at low intensity per site only 10 percent of wasp nests are targeted in each site with xp 50 and xc 1 figs 6b and 6d we have the opposite situation where the biocontrol release has lower coverage only the top 1 percent of invaded sites but at high intensity per site with 50 percent of wasp nests targeted in each site these differences in release strategy affect the actual pattern of approach to equilibrium but have a minor effect on the final densities of wasps and biocontrol for the best parameter sets results presented so far are average values for a whole cluster of n sites and the overall patterns shown above are the results of aggregate trajectories ignoring spatial variation one of the important aspects of the model is the assumption that nests that are detected are destroyed see eqs 12 to 14 the probability of detection depends on the density of wasp nests and the density of humans in a given site and this leads to spatial variation in wasp density as the biocontrol becomes established towards an equilibrium the ultimate effect is that there is a strong negative relationship between the density of households and final density of wasp nests in a simulation fig 7 in the absence of biocontrol the counterfactual simulation there is a pronounced decrease in the final density of wasp nests as household density on a site increases starting from a density of 0 15 households per km2 equivalent to a log value of 1 9 on the x axes of fig 7 to the left of this point the effect of household density is minor once we introduce biocontrol the pattern still exists but the final wasp densities are much lower 0 20 and 0 35 wasp nests per km2 for vic fig 7a and nsw fig 7b respectively at low household densities compared to 1 2 wasps nests per km2 in the counterfactual this illustrates the effectiveness of the biocontrol maintaining wasp density at between 20 and 35 percent of the no biocontrol option the question of whether this is a worthwhile investment depends on the cost of the biocontrol program compared with the avoided damages to households businesses government and environment there may also be alternative biocontrol release allocations in space that account for household density that will result in lower wasp densities in equilibrium the assumption that all wasp nests detected are destroyed is applied to the whole cluster but perhaps there are spatial variations considering that a single european wasp nest can have tens of thousands of workers kasper et al 2008 foraging for sugar and protein in late summer and early autumn combined with their aggressive behaviour and tendency to swarm around food sources means that this assumption is realistic at least in urban areas where families and pets may be threatened by wasps this assumption is also realistic for other sites where european wasps have been reported table 3 such as agriculture and forestry recreation and culture public services transport and communication in these cases local governments or businesses may be called to destroy wasp nests due to threats to workers and visitors however this assumption may be less realistic for conservation and natural environments except for the case of visitor centres and camping areas that are maintained by rangers as casual visitors to national parks would not attempt to destroy wasp nests this is something to consider when planning the spatial distribution of biocontrol releases and monitoring the best results for each release strategy as plotted in fig 7 are obtained when the dispersal parameter for the biocontrol γb is high this highlights the importance of broad spatial coverage of the biocontrol for a successful program in terms of biocontrol effectiveness parameters ρb and φb the best performers were 0 1 to 0 2 in vic and 0 05 in nsw an important question is whether these levels of effectiveness are realistic and if not whether other features of the biocontrol and or the release strategy may make up for lower effectiveness alternatively a combination of biocontrol agents attacking the wasp on several fronts may be a better option 3 4 limitations and implications of findings we have combined a number of data sources to develop and calibrate a model for an invasive wasp and a biocontrol agent despite the lack of data for the specific species involved our spatio temporal model is based on conventional equations of population dynamics and spread so it is on solid ground in that regard we used a parasitoid that invades wasp nests as the agent for this example but abstracted away from the specific species by solving the model for 81 parameter sets using a factorial experiment we were able to show the conditions that would make biological control technically feasible this is the necessary condition for economic feasibility if the biocontrol is not technically feasible then an economic evaluation is not needed in this way the model could help agencies avoid the time and expense of full economic evaluations for projects that are technically doomed in the model the biocontrol agent supresses the wasp population in two ways by reducing wasp growth rate and by increasing the winter mortality of wasp nests as such the model is flexible and can be applied to different case studies the two parameters involved can be varied to represent any number of biocontrol species as well as combinations of species that may act at different stages in the life cycle of the wasp the main challenge in applying the model to other cases is the effort required for calibration public databases such as the abs census and the atlas of living australia provide information at a broad scale which helps ground the model in reality but they are no substitute for field and laboratory trials to estimate biological parameters which would reduce the uncertainty attached to parameter values the model is discrete in time and space the annual time increments fit well with the life cycles of the species involved but the spatial scale is arbitrary we used a grid of 0 2 as a compromise between spatial resolution and computational feasibility while increasing the spatial resolution could improve spread simulation it is demanding in terms of memory and processing power required the size of the distance matrix used to simulate spread increases quadratically with the number of cells n on the grid this combined with multiple runs required for stochastic simulations limits either the scale or the resolution of the model depending on availability of memory and processing power this is a limitation especially when using a ga to estimate parameter values from spatio temporal data a ga is computationally expensive because of the large number of function evaluations required but is also well suited for parallel processing when available the spatial scales we used are fairly broad 244 000 km2 for vic and 144 000 km2 for nsw but in some cases finer scales would be preferable such as for local government areas that may have more detailed data on wasp nests detected and destroyed in such cases the size of the cells in the model would be reduced so that spread can be followed at the suburb scale for example spatial variation in human population was an important driver in the model see fig 7 through the probability that a nest will be detected and destroyed spatial variation can also occur in habitat suitability the likelihood that a queen arriving at a site will become established is based on food availability and other factors in this case study we implicitly assumed uniform habitat suitability with value of 1 for all cells on the map but this can be changed spatially in the model when data are available finally our simulations for decision analysis started with cocoons of the biocontrol agent released across space depending on two decision variables the intensity of inoculation per site xp and the spatial coverage of the release xc all the cocoons released are implicitly assumed to become established but in reality there would be a proportion of failures in the release this does not affect the application of the model but it does affect the cost of the biocontrol program simulated any economic evaluation would need to account for the probability that agents fail to establish as well as for the possibility that it may take several years and repeat releases to reach the biocontrol density simulated in year 1 related to this the release strategy is based on knowledge of the location and density of wasp nests uncertainty in these variables will also affect the cost of the release as a poor match between wasp presence and biocontrol release will increase the failure rate 4 conclusion we have addressed the question of technical feasibility of a biocontrol program based on growth mortality and dispersal parameters of the target species and the biocontrol agent the spatio temporal model developed for this purpose is on solid ground in its representation of population dynamics and the interaction between an invasive insect and a biocontrol agent the ricker equations used are standard and realistic ranges of model parameters are known from the literature using the model and data available from public sources we identified parameter sets that are feasible in the classical biocontrol sense where the biocontrol agent becomes established and maintains the pest population at a low level equilibrium phase diagrams of the two populations over time were found to be useful visual tools to identify feasible parameter sets application of the model to the european wasp in australia a damaging invasive insect in that country produced some useful insights for the specific case study and revealed the need for research to identify biocontrol species with the right combination of parameters technical feasibility is a necessary condition for economic feasibility and pre screening candidates through modelling can save

24472,established pests are often overlooked as candidates for eradication or containment programmes because the use of traditional control techniques over very large areas usually becomes uneconomic in such cases classical biological control can be an attractive option if biocontrol agents become established in equilibrium with the invasive species there are no ongoing costs of control arriving at the point of biocontrol release however requires significant time and investment in research and testing and success of biocontrol agents is not guaranteed it is therefore advisable to undertake preliminary analysis of the likelihood of success simulation modelling using population dynamics models can be very useful in this regard here we develop a model for biocontrol of an invasive social insect the european wasp vespula germanica and derive the conditions for success of a biocontrol program keywords invasive species classical biological control vespula germanica control feasibility simulation model 1 introduction insects are the planet s most species rich group playing important roles in food web interactions and ecosystem processes while also featuring prominently as invasive species in terms of their number and impact brockerhoff and liebhold 2017 the impacts of invasive insects are well known they threaten human health via stinging and as vectors of disease consume crops putting food supplies at risk disrupt ecosystem function endanger valued species and damage infrastructure as a result governments across the globe routinely spend significant amounts of money protecting their economies environment and communities from the negative impacts of invasive insects bradshaw et al 2016 estimate invasive insects cost a minimum of us 70 0 billion per year globally while associated health costs exceed us 6 9 billion per year depending on the stage of invasion strategies available to biosecurity agencies to avoid or minimise impacts of invasive insects typically consist of prevention via pre border and border quarantine activities surveillance for early detection rapid response with a view to eradication or containment to slow the spread sharov and liebhold 1998 cacho et al 2008 epanchin niell 2017 hester et al 2017 as the size of an invasion grows so too do the costs of traditional control techniques that typically form part of eradication or containment programmes eventually their use over very large areas becomes uneconomic given budget constraints and such programmes may be abandoned cacho et al 2007 epanchin niell and hastings 2010 if mitigation of impacts is still desired biological control where the goal is permanent establishment of an agent and control of the pest is usually the only economically feasible option classical biological control cbc the introduction of populations of an exotic natural enemy into a new environment to control a pest where the aim is permanent control of the pest without further intervention hajek 2004 van driesche et al 2008 has been used in pest management for more than a century although success has been mixed cock et al 2016 naranjo 2018 it is difficult to predict the likely success of an agent and a substantial proportion of biocontrol agents fail to control their target beggs et al 2008 a recent analysis of cbc programmes for the control of insect pests found that since the 1970s 33 of the introductions led to establishment and 10 resulted in satisfactory control cock et al 2016 where programmes do succeed economic analyses suggest very large benefit to cost ratios naranjo et al 2015 despite this the number of classical biological control programmes and releases have decreased in recent decades due in part to the increased regulatory oversight imposed in many countries out of concerns about non target and indirect effects that may be caused by agent introduction hajek et al 2016 as the cost in time and resources required for host specificity testing has increased the number of natural enemies proposed for release has slowed hajek et al 2016 furthermore biological control programmes are typically constrained by small budgets and short timetables godfray and waage 1991 given the long time frames involved in testing agents the uncertainty surrounding successful control and limited budgets for cbc programmes mathematical models of biological control can provide useful prospective information about the conditions required for success prior to significant investment occurring models of biological control exist in the literature they range from the simple analytical models of theoretical population biology which allow very general predictions about equilibrium population levels e g beddington et al 1978 davis et al 2006 kaser and heimpel 2015 to detailed simulation models e g gutierrez et al 1988 gutierrez et al 2008 portela et al 2020 poggi et al 2021 which contain a large number of parameters to be estimated in order to apply the model and which may not be useful in information poor and time limited contexts godfray and waage 1991 in this paper we develop a simulation model of intermediate complexity for an invasive insect in an attempt to strike a balance between model applicability and data needs we apply the model to the case of the european wasp vespula germanica fabricius hymenoptera vespidae in australia where the pest has significant potential to spread further de villiers et al 2017 cook 2019 and we determine the conditions that would make the biocontrol successful based on combinations of parameter values in the model the european wasp is native to europe northern africa and temperate asia and introduced into north america chile argentina australia new zealand spradbery and maywald 1992 it is adaptable to a wide range of habitats and climates de villiers et al 2017 and has significant negative impacts on communities industry and the environment in regions where it has been introduced macintyre and hellstrom 2015 cook 2019 lester and beggs 2019 the european wasp is widespread in new zealand and south eastern australia and was the subject of a past biological control program in both countries with mixed success field and darby 1991 moller et al 1991 lefoe et al 2001 beggs et al 2008 the poor performance of the chosen agent sphecophaga vesparum vesparum curtis hymenoptera ichneumonidae is thought to have been caused by a genetic bottleneck because all releases were essentially derived from a single female parasitoid beggs et al 2008 ward 2014 unfortunately no other information that could assist in understanding agent performance in australia was recorded during the release program the possibility of improved control from using different genetic strains of the agent and the likelihood of reduced screening and testing requirements has spurred renewed interest in using s v vesparum to control wasps however there are other candidates that could be considered and tested with the model developed here these include two agents recently approved for import and release in new zealand the wasp nest beetle metoecus paradoxus linnaeus coleoptera ripiphoridae and a hoverfly volucella inanis linnaeus diptera syrphidae landcare research n d m paradoxus has a complex lifecycle adults lay eggs in wood and bark outside wasp nests and once hatched larvae are transported into nests inadvertently by foraging wasps attacking wasp larva once inside ward 2014 in contrast adult females of v pellucens enter wasp nests laying eggs which hatch with larvae dropping to the bottom of nests and feeding on wasp young and dead adults ward 2014 the goal of this work is to develop a general model that allows an improved understanding of biocontrol programmes for invasive insects to demonstrate the model we use s v vesparum as the biological control agent for v germanica although the model could be easily adapted to understand other pest biological control interactions 1 1 life cycles of v germanica and s vesparum the european wasp is a social insect and possesses characteristics of eusociality that allow it to succeed as an invasive species moller 1996 kasper 2004 beggs et al 2011 there is an overlap of generations reproduction is restricted to a few individuals and there is cooperative brood care wilson and hölldobler 2005 the normal colony life cycle is annual with nests being founded by a single reproductive queen in the spring the reproductive cycle progresses as follows the queen emerges in spring to forage and prepare new nests of about 20 cells in size workers emerge 4 6 weeks after egg lay and assume foraging nest protection and nest building duties thus freeing up the queen for egg laying the nest grows over summer and new queens are produced in autumn these queens mate with drones in autumn then fly off to hibernate in sheltered areas during winter widmer et al 1995 in their native range european wasp colonies naturally die off in winter this is not the case in locations experiencing mild winters including parts of australia where nest construction can continue throughout the year and over wintered nests are common spradbery and maywald 1992 widmer et al 1995 kasper 2004 overwintering is a modification of the usual annual life cycle where polygyny multi queening occurs more than one and often many hundreds of productive queens share the same nest as a result overwintered nests can reach very large sizes in summer producing thousands of individuals while the process of predation by s v vesparum on european wasp is relatively straightforward it attacks european wasp nests and feeds on the developing larvae and pupae its life cycle is complex beggs et al 1996 harris and rose 1999 during spring winged male and female s v vesparum emerge from cocoons in the remains of old wasp nests one to four springs after their cocoons were formed females enter new wasp nests and lay eggs onto larvae or pupae with the parasitoid larvae feeding on the host and subsequently forming one of three types of cocoons yellow weak walled yellow and white yellow cocoons are thick walled that will remain dormant in the nest producing winged adults up to four years later weak walled yellow cocoons produce winged adults capable of flight within two weeks weak walled white cocoons produce short winged females within two weeks and these continue to lay eggs within the parental nest so that multiple generations follow during the same season harris and rose 1999 2 method the model is centred on the population dynamics of the invasive wasp and a biocontrol agent that affects the viability of wasp nests as well as the ability of colonies to reproduce 2 1 model studies from australia kasper 2004 and new zealand barlow et al 2002 have modelled the population dynamics of european wasp using a ricker equation ricker 1975 incorporating weather effects and density dependence we modify the model of barlow et al 1996 to represent the growth of wasp and parasitoid populations and their interaction and introduce dispersal equations for spatial spread of both the wasp w and the biocontrol agent b we also introduce the option for detected nests to be destroyed based on the probability of encounter between wasps and humans which in turn depends on the density of households and wasp nests in the given location the model is presented below and a summary of model parameters and descriptions is given in table 1 2 1 1 population dynamics based on the life cycles discussed earlier the wasp population is expressed as number of nests per km2 in spring ws and autumn wa whereas the biocontrol population is expressed as number of adults per km2 in spring bs and autumn ba the value of ba is a proxy for the number of cocoons of all types that overwinter in wasp nests growth of the two populations is given by 1 w a t α w 1 e α t w s t e β w w s t 2 w s t 1 w a t 1 e μ t 3 b a t α b b s t e β b t b s t 4 b s t 1 b a t 1 μ b where α and β are growth parameters in the ricker equations and μ are mortality parameters with the subscripts representing wasps w or biocontrol b eα t and eμ t are proportional effects of the biocontrol on growth and winter mortality of wasp nests respectively defined as linear functions of biocontrol agent density 5 e α t m i n ρ b b s t 1 6 e μ t min φ b b s t 1 the shape of these functions is open to debate but a linear relationship is a good start in the absence of other evidence the biocontrol efficiency parameters are the reduction in the wasp growth rate ρ b and the winter mortality of wasp nests ϕ b caused by the agent in spring the exponents of the ricker equations β in 1 and 3 are functions of the carrying capacity κ of the site defined as the maximum number of nests per km2 in the case of wasps and the maximum number of cocoons per wasp nest in the case of the biocontrol 7 β w ln α w κ w θ w 8 β b t ln α b κ b w s t in the model the growth exponents in 7 and 8 are intermediate parameters that depend on carrying capacity κ for a given α in the case of the wasp κw in 7 is adjusted based on habitat suitability of the site θ w in the case of the biocontrol κb in 8 is adjusted based on the number of wasp nests on the site in spring w s t which essentially measures habitat available to colonise the time step t is one year with each year starting in spring when wasp queens emerge to start building up new nests 2 1 2 dispersal each spring queens emerge from hibernation and start building new nests and multiplying their colonies dispersal to new sites can occur early in the season as queens find nesting sites and later in the season as new queens establish new nests for simplicity we assume that dispersal occurs in spring the probability that a queen emerging in site i will move to site j and establish a nest there is given by 9 p i j 1 π γ 1 d i j γ 2 where γ is a median dispersal distance and d is the distance between points i and j the area under this curve in the interval to equals 1 whereas the area in the interval γ to γ is 0 5 see sm section a the same dispersal kernel is applied for both species but with γ replaced by the corresponding parameter γw or γb in the numerical model the landscape is represented as a grid with n square cells of equal size or sites and distance is expressed as a matrix d of dimensions n n representing the distance between each cell and every other cell on the map composed of elements di j this allows dispersal probability to be estimated for all sites at once using eq 9 yielding the matrices p w and p b of the same dimensions as d the expected numbers of wasp nests and biocontrol agents after dispersal are 10 w d p w w t 11 b d p b b t where w and b are column vectors of n elements containing the density of wasps and biocontrol agents in every site on the map leung et al 2010 present an application of this dispersal kernel in 2 dimensional discrete space the approach we followed using matrices representing discrete sites in space is similar to theirs in stochastic simulations the actual dispersal for each run of the model is selected randomly by sampling from a uniform distribution against matrix p the numerical process is explained in sm section a 2 1 3 detection we assume that all nests detected by humans are destroyed when the wasps are active during spring and summer the probability that a nest will be detected is given by 12 p d 1 e δ w w a t h where h is the number of households per km2 in the given site and δw is a detectability parameter related to the probability of encounter between humans and wasps given their respective local density the number of nests destroyed is 13 k t p d w a t and after destruction the number of nests is updated to 14 w a t w a t 1 p d 2 2 running simulations all the variables above are expressed as column vectors of dimension n where each row represents a site on the map the results of solving the model 1 8 for a planning horizon of t years are presented as matrices of dimensions n t where columns are time periods there is one such result matrix for each vector such that w ws t solved for t 1 t b bs t solved for t 1 t k kt solved for t 1 t this matrix representation of results is useful for analysis of patterns in space as well as in time the model is implemented in matlab language mathworks 2020a each scenario was run for 1000 stochastic iterations over a planning horizon of 60 years to initialise the simulation we need initial values ws 0 and bs 0 for the wasp and biocontrol populations see eqs 1 and 3 for each site expressed as vectors for the area of interest the initial states are w 0 and b 0 of dimensions n 1 for each stochastic iteration the values of w 0 were generated randomly based on atlas of living australia data ala see 2 3 and the wasp parameters for the area of interest for convenience a matrix w0 of dimensions n 1000 was created and used to initialise all the simulation runs with each column providing the w 0 value for the corresponding random iteration the initial vector b 0 depends on the biocontrol release strategy for the given w 0 we consider two decision variables for the biocontrol program xp the percentage of wasp nests that are initially infested with the biocontrol agent on a given site xc the spatial coverage of the biocontrol release expressed as the top percentile of wasp infested sites selected for inoculation for example xc 10 indicates that only the top 10 percent of sites in terms of wasp nest density are selected for release of the biocontrol several combinations of these decision variables were selected for exploratory runs within the ranges xp 10 to 50 and xc 1 to 20 these experiments represent strategies with different combinations of spatial coverage and intensity of control per site 2 3 data and model calibration model calibration was carried out based on data from the literature combined with four spatial datasets maps a to d in table 2 and overlaid onto map e table 2 to create the final dataset for analysis and modelling the following variables were created as column vectors of 2462 elements representing the cells sites on the grid map e ala reports of european wasp presence per site estimated by overlaying the point data in map a with the grid map e and summing the number of points that fall into each site area the area of the site in km2 not all sites are the same area because of truncation along the coastline household density households per km2 estimated by intersecting sa1 map c with the grid map e estimating the weighed sum of households for each site and dividing by its area land use proportion estimated by overlaying the raster in map b onto the grid map e and calculating the proportion of the area of each site that is covered by each of seven categories of land use the seven categories were aggregated from the australian land use and management alum classification see sm for an explanation of this process 2 3 1 vespula germanica parameters parameters for the population dynamics of european wasps are available for new zealand plunkett et al 1989 barlow et al 1996 beggs et al 2008 and england archer 1985 but not for australia some parameters reported in the literature provide a starting point for calibrating our model but differences between countries need to be considered notably the maximum number of wasp nests per ha κ w reported for beech forests in nz 12 nests per ha is too high for australian conditions crosland 1991 kasper 2004 tennant et al 2011 there is also uncertainty regarding the number of years it takes for the population to reach saturation in the absence of control which is determined by α w for a given κ w other important sources of uncertainty are the dispersal parameter γ w and the detection probability parameter δ w these four parameters were estimated through simulation using a genetic algorithm ga combined with the occurrence data from ala wasp detection records in ala start as early as 1960 with increasing reports since 2010 fig 1 to estimate likely values of uncertain parameters a likelihood function was created based on data from ala and the simulation model the likelihood function minimised by the ga is 15 f u ω n n o b s n p r e d u i 2 ω a a o b s a p r e d u i 2 with ω n ω a 1 0 ω n 1 0 ω a 1 where ui αi κi γi δi is the vector of parameter values representing chromosome i in the population of possible solutions n o b s is the total number of cells in the cluster for which wasp presence has been reported in ala and a o b s is the area of the minimum convex hull enclosing all those infestations the area invaded the predicted variables n p r e d and a p r e d are the means of predicted number of cells and area invaded over the nr stochastic runs of the model the number of infestations and area invaded are weighed by ω n and ω a in the minimization the weights were set at 0 5 0 5 for this analysis the problem was solved using the matlab ga function mathworks 2020b with a population of 50 individuals 50 sets of parameter values chromosomes that evolve over time in a stochastic environment according to a given fitness function 15 this process is analogous to that used by hester and cacho 2012 see sm section c for further details 2 3 2 biocontrol parameters parameters for the biocontrol agent would vary depending on the organism selected some parameter values for new zealand exist for s v vesparum in the literature for example barlow et al 1996 estimated the winter mortality parameter μb at 0 85 and the carrying capacity parameter κb at 235 parasitoid cocoons per wasp nest given the uncertainty in the values of biocontrol parameters and lack of data for australia simulations were conducted using a factorial experiment with 4 factors 3 levels resulting in 81 parameter sets consisting of all combinations of αb 2 3 4 μb 0 1 0 3 0 5 γb 1 3 5 ρb φb 0 05 0 1 0 2 each of these 81 parameters sets was used to run a 60 year simulation with 1000 stochastic iterations 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence data and wasp population parameters european wasp occurrence reports in ala remained relatively low from 1960 until the mid 1990s fig 1a with an average of 2 reports per year from 1997 the number of reports started to increase at an increasing rate to reach 191 reports in 2020 this has been accompanied by a growing spatial extent starting in tasmania 1960 and spreading to victoria 1982 new south wales and western australia 2010 and south australia 2011 we know that european wasps have been present in mainland australia before their first reports in ala spradbery and maywald 1992 crosland 1991 but that is not relevant for our purpose of estimating population parameters given the data available and the scale of the analysis increasing numbers of reports in ala over time indicate growing wasp population densities which increase the probability of contact with humans and therefore the probability that the encounter will be reported to ala in terms of seasonality fig 1b reports tend to increase in late summer and early autumn march and april when the wasps are most active and populations are growing the lowest number of reports occur in winter june to august when wasps are less active and outdoor human activity is reduced these patterns are consistent with other studies crosland 1991 kasper et al 2008 the majority of reports 305 have occurred in urban residential areas table 3 followed by conservation areas 246 agriculture and forestry 142 and recreation areas 132 these are all areas where humans are likely to come into contact with wasps and where wasps are likely to disrupt recreational and work activities we selected only observations from eastern australia for further analysis fig 2 visual inspection suggested that there are 4 different clusters and this was confirmed by applying cluster analysis to the point data based on distance these clusters were used to estimate parameter values for the wasp population using a ga as explained in the methods section the parameter values estimated independently for each of the clusters were generally consistent table 4 average values of αw growth rate and κw carrying capacity were 3 69 ranging from 3 48 to 3 88 and 1 28 1 26 1 30 respectively the dispersal parameter γw had an average value of 3 24 but with lower values for tas and vic 1 50 and 1 89 compared to nsw and sa 4 75 and 4 81 these differences reflect the temporal patterns of spread which were slower in the former clusters than in the latter ones the detection parameter δw had an average value of 0 59 with a range of 0 52 in nsw to 0 63 in tas now that plausible parameter values for the invasive wasp have been obtained the focus can shift to feasibility of the biocontrol 3 2 biocontrol feasibility the success of the biocontrol program hinges on two factors 1 the feasibility that the agent will establish and spread and 2 the effectiveness of the agent in suppressing growth and spread of wasp nests factor 1 is related to three biocontrol parameters growth rate α b winter mortality μ b and spread rate γ b factor 2 is related to two biocontrol parameters the reduction in wasp growth rate ρ b and the winter mortality of wasp nests ϕ b that are infested by the agent the relative rate of increase for a population r bs t 1 bs t must be 1 in order for the population to grow fig 3 a shows that for this example when αb 2 winter mortality must be 0 5 in order for the biocontrol population to establish and grow given the presence of wasp nests this is lower than the mortality of 0 85 estimated by barlow et al 1996 and so an important question is whether this rate may be lower in australia given the dryer conditions compared to new zealand the curves in fig 3a and 3b will shift as the value of the fixed parameter α or μ in panels a and b repectively changes but the bottom line is that if r 1 for the biocontrol there is no need to undertake further evaluation as the organism will be unable to establish a viable population in this case the main question is whether there are other suitable species for biocontrol with high values of r regarding the dispersal parameter barlow et al 1998 estimated a velocity of spread of 1 15 to 1 6 km per year in new zealand which is equivalent to γb values of 0 4 0 6 see sm section a these may be too low to keep up with the spread of the wasp given the average γw value of 3 24 in table 4 and this has implications for the spatial pattern of biocontrol release the effectiveness of the biocontrol in the model occurs through ρb and φb these are uncertain parameters that have not been measured for australian conditions while some australian release sites of s v vesparum were monitored g lefoe pers comm there was no evidence in subsequent years that the parasitoid established at any of those sites lefoe et al 2001 however using the model we can explore combinations of parameter values that would make the program feasible in the sense of classical biological control where the biocontrol agent becomes established and maintains the population of the pest at a low level hajek et al 2016 the model is a simplified version of the life cycle and does not represent different types of cocoons explicitly the density of biocontrol adults in spring is represented by bs this variable influences negatively the growth rate of the european wasp population in spring and summer the density of biocontrol cocoons in v germanica nests at the end of autumn is ba this variable influences the mortality of wasp nests during winter in this way we can represent two different mechanisms for the effect of the biocontrol on the pest one on the mortality of wasp nests given by φb in eqs 2 and 6 and the other on the rate at which new queens establish new nests during spring and summer given by ρb in eqs 1 and 5 we tested different options and identified sets of parameter values that would make the biocontrol program feasible fig 4 in all phase diagrams the system starts on the top left high wasp density low biocontrol density and moves down and to the right towards some sort of dynamic equilibrium all four cases in fig 4 are feasible in the classical biological control sense the effectiveness parameters interact with growth and mortality parameters of the pest to result in different population patterns through time fig 4 in all cases there is a cyclical behaviour in the population densities of both species as expected but in some cases the system settles into an equilibrium point over time at high growth and mortality rates both the frequency and amplitude of the cycle are higher curves a and b than at the corresponding low growth and mortality rates curves c and d it is interesting that relative high effectiveness ρb φb 0 03 increases the fluctuations in both wasp and biocontrol populations curves b and d compared to the case of low effectiveness curves a and c in case b the biocontrol grows fast and is highly effective causing the wasp population to collapse leading to a collapse of the biocontrol as less wasp nests become available which in turn allows the wasp population to increase and so on in a cyclical equilibrium where wasp populations can become as high as 0 7 nests per km2 in some years the cases we are interested in are those that tend towards some sort of equilibrium between the two species with wasp density maintained at a relatively low level these are the cases for which classical biological control can succeed in the long term our modelling approach allows us to screen alternatives before considering the costs and benefits of the program at this stage scientists may be able to assess whether it is likely that the biocontrol agent will reach the required levels of growth mortality and pest suppression to make the program feasible perhaps through additional research targeted at measuring the most uncertain parameters 3 3 simulation results and decision analysis above we have seen conditions for feasibility of the biocontrol program for a given site without considering the spatial distribution of the invasion as it progresses through time once we introduce dispersal in the simulations we need to track the wasp and biocontrol populations in space as well as in time this is done through matrices w and b of dimensions n t see section 2 2 where each of the n rows represents a site on the map and the columns represent time periods 1 t we selected clusters b vic and c nsw from table 4 for further analysis this provides an interesting comparison between two sites that have similar growth parameters αw 3 79 and 3 48 κw 1 30 and 1 26 but differ in terms of dispersal parameters γw 1 89 and 4 75 the areas of interest were selected by finding the minimum convex hull of clusters b and c in fig 2 and adding a buffer of 0 5 the ala reports were overlaid on the grid map map e in table 2 to calculate the number of reports per cell fig 5 each cell site on the map for the given cluster is represented by one row of the state matrices w and b the number of sites n using this selection method were 658 for vic 244 681 km2 and 389 sites for nsw 144 493 km2 not all sites have the same area because of truncation of cells along the coastline the spread simulations were conducted on this discrete representation of space fig 5 using the centroids of cells to calculate the distance matrix d of dimensions n n with elements dij as in eq 9 several combinations of the two decision variables associated with the biocontrol release xp intensity of inoculation per site and xc spatial coverage of the release were simulated fig 6 shows phase diagrams for a selection of those simulations amongst the 81 parameter sets tested 15 of simulations resulted in failure of the biocontrol with xp xc 10 20 and 35 failed with xp xc 50 1 this suggests that the low biocontrol release coverage in the second case increases the probability of failure for any set of biocontrol parameter values for cases that led to establishment of the biocontrol the final density of biocontrol agents tended to be higher in nsw than in vic notice the higher density of points towards the right of the plots in figs 6c and d compared to a and b the 95th percentiles of final biocontrol density were 4 5 adults km 2 in vic and 6 2 adults km 2 in nsw see sm section d for details there are interesting differences between cases in the phase diagrams fig 6 comparing the top panel vic cluster against the bottom panel nsw cluster and focusing on the best parameter combinations those with final values towards the bottom of each plot the mean state trajectories tend to a long term equilibrium of 0 24 wasp nests per km2 in vic and 0 34 wasp nests per km2 in nsw the equilibrium density of the biocontrol also tends to be higher in nsw as seen above both clusters have similar wasp growth parameters see table 4 but very different dispersal parameters γw in nsw is more than double the value in vic 4 75 vs 1 89 this is reflected in wider cycles in the approach to equilibrium for nsw figs 6c and 6d compared to vic figs 6a and 6b as wasp invasions can move longer distances to new sites comparing the left panel to the right panel of fig 6 we have two extreme cases with xp 10 and xc 20 figs 6a and 6c the biocontrol release covers a larger area the top 20 percent of invaded sites but at low intensity per site only 10 percent of wasp nests are targeted in each site with xp 50 and xc 1 figs 6b and 6d we have the opposite situation where the biocontrol release has lower coverage only the top 1 percent of invaded sites but at high intensity per site with 50 percent of wasp nests targeted in each site these differences in release strategy affect the actual pattern of approach to equilibrium but have a minor effect on the final densities of wasps and biocontrol for the best parameter sets results presented so far are average values for a whole cluster of n sites and the overall patterns shown above are the results of aggregate trajectories ignoring spatial variation one of the important aspects of the model is the assumption that nests that are detected are destroyed see eqs 12 to 14 the probability of detection depends on the density of wasp nests and the density of humans in a given site and this leads to spatial variation in wasp density as the biocontrol becomes established towards an equilibrium the ultimate effect is that there is a strong negative relationship between the density of households and final density of wasp nests in a simulation fig 7 in the absence of biocontrol the counterfactual simulation there is a pronounced decrease in the final density of wasp nests as household density on a site increases starting from a density of 0 15 households per km2 equivalent to a log value of 1 9 on the x axes of fig 7 to the left of this point the effect of household density is minor once we introduce biocontrol the pattern still exists but the final wasp densities are much lower 0 20 and 0 35 wasp nests per km2 for vic fig 7a and nsw fig 7b respectively at low household densities compared to 1 2 wasps nests per km2 in the counterfactual this illustrates the effectiveness of the biocontrol maintaining wasp density at between 20 and 35 percent of the no biocontrol option the question of whether this is a worthwhile investment depends on the cost of the biocontrol program compared with the avoided damages to households businesses government and environment there may also be alternative biocontrol release allocations in space that account for household density that will result in lower wasp densities in equilibrium the assumption that all wasp nests detected are destroyed is applied to the whole cluster but perhaps there are spatial variations considering that a single european wasp nest can have tens of thousands of workers kasper et al 2008 foraging for sugar and protein in late summer and early autumn combined with their aggressive behaviour and tendency to swarm around food sources means that this assumption is realistic at least in urban areas where families and pets may be threatened by wasps this assumption is also realistic for other sites where european wasps have been reported table 3 such as agriculture and forestry recreation and culture public services transport and communication in these cases local governments or businesses may be called to destroy wasp nests due to threats to workers and visitors however this assumption may be less realistic for conservation and natural environments except for the case of visitor centres and camping areas that are maintained by rangers as casual visitors to national parks would not attempt to destroy wasp nests this is something to consider when planning the spatial distribution of biocontrol releases and monitoring the best results for each release strategy as plotted in fig 7 are obtained when the dispersal parameter for the biocontrol γb is high this highlights the importance of broad spatial coverage of the biocontrol for a successful program in terms of biocontrol effectiveness parameters ρb and φb the best performers were 0 1 to 0 2 in vic and 0 05 in nsw an important question is whether these levels of effectiveness are realistic and if not whether other features of the biocontrol and or the release strategy may make up for lower effectiveness alternatively a combination of biocontrol agents attacking the wasp on several fronts may be a better option 3 4 limitations and implications of findings we have combined a number of data sources to develop and calibrate a model for an invasive wasp and a biocontrol agent despite the lack of data for the specific species involved our spatio temporal model is based on conventional equations of population dynamics and spread so it is on solid ground in that regard we used a parasitoid that invades wasp nests as the agent for this example but abstracted away from the specific species by solving the model for 81 parameter sets using a factorial experiment we were able to show the conditions that would make biological control technically feasible this is the necessary condition for economic feasibility if the biocontrol is not technically feasible then an economic evaluation is not needed in this way the model could help agencies avoid the time and expense of full economic evaluations for projects that are technically doomed in the model the biocontrol agent supresses the wasp population in two ways by reducing wasp growth rate and by increasing the winter mortality of wasp nests as such the model is flexible and can be applied to different case studies the two parameters involved can be varied to represent any number of biocontrol species as well as combinations of species that may act at different stages in the life cycle of the wasp the main challenge in applying the model to other cases is the effort required for calibration public databases such as the abs census and the atlas of living australia provide information at a broad scale which helps ground the model in reality but they are no substitute for field and laboratory trials to estimate biological parameters which would reduce the uncertainty attached to parameter values the model is discrete in time and space the annual time increments fit well with the life cycles of the species involved but the spatial scale is arbitrary we used a grid of 0 2 as a compromise between spatial resolution and computational feasibility while increasing the spatial resolution could improve spread simulation it is demanding in terms of memory and processing power required the size of the distance matrix used to simulate spread increases quadratically with the number of cells n on the grid this combined with multiple runs required for stochastic simulations limits either the scale or the resolution of the model depending on availability of memory and processing power this is a limitation especially when using a ga to estimate parameter values from spatio temporal data a ga is computationally expensive because of the large number of function evaluations required but is also well suited for parallel processing when available the spatial scales we used are fairly broad 244 000 km2 for vic and 144 000 km2 for nsw but in some cases finer scales would be preferable such as for local government areas that may have more detailed data on wasp nests detected and destroyed in such cases the size of the cells in the model would be reduced so that spread can be followed at the suburb scale for example spatial variation in human population was an important driver in the model see fig 7 through the probability that a nest will be detected and destroyed spatial variation can also occur in habitat suitability the likelihood that a queen arriving at a site will become established is based on food availability and other factors in this case study we implicitly assumed uniform habitat suitability with value of 1 for all cells on the map but this can be changed spatially in the model when data are available finally our simulations for decision analysis started with cocoons of the biocontrol agent released across space depending on two decision variables the intensity of inoculation per site xp and the spatial coverage of the release xc all the cocoons released are implicitly assumed to become established but in reality there would be a proportion of failures in the release this does not affect the application of the model but it does affect the cost of the biocontrol program simulated any economic evaluation would need to account for the probability that agents fail to establish as well as for the possibility that it may take several years and repeat releases to reach the biocontrol density simulated in year 1 related to this the release strategy is based on knowledge of the location and density of wasp nests uncertainty in these variables will also affect the cost of the release as a poor match between wasp presence and biocontrol release will increase the failure rate 4 conclusion we have addressed the question of technical feasibility of a biocontrol program based on growth mortality and dispersal parameters of the target species and the biocontrol agent the spatio temporal model developed for this purpose is on solid ground in its representation of population dynamics and the interaction between an invasive insect and a biocontrol agent the ricker equations used are standard and realistic ranges of model parameters are known from the literature using the model and data available from public sources we identified parameter sets that are feasible in the classical biocontrol sense where the biocontrol agent becomes established and maintains the pest population at a low level equilibrium phase diagrams of the two populations over time were found to be useful visual tools to identify feasible parameter sets application of the model to the european wasp in australia a damaging invasive insect in that country produced some useful insights for the specific case study and revealed the need for research to identify biocontrol species with the right combination of parameters technical feasibility is a necessary condition for economic feasibility and pre screening candidates through modelling can save funds by excluding species with low feasibility from further evaluation credit authorship contribution statement oscar j cacho conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original

agricultural drought risk assessment and early warning application of an agricultural catastrophe management system application of drought relief operations research shows the accuracy of the model is greatly improved by determining the genetic parameters of crops modifying the parameters according to the weather land use and technical conditions and establishing the local and even global model parameter database the uncertainty of model parameters input data and model structure is analyzed to improve the stability of the model in the process of discussing the influence mechanism and sensitivity analysis of climate change on crop growth the analysis of various meteorological factors is concentrated from multi factor analysis to temperature and precipitation with the development of computing technology the emergence of gis technology and gcms technology makes it possible to predict the impact of different meteorological factors on crop growth under future climate change in some studies epic crop growth model has been performed to reduce the risk of agricultural drought keywords environmental policy impact climate model crop growth model climate change agricultural drought risk 1 introduction the special report on climate change and land released in 2019 by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that rising temperatures changing rainfall patterns and more frequent extreme weather have destroyed the stability of the global food supply shukla et al 2019 climate change has brought uncertainties in food production and a significant increase in disasters which will increase the risk of agricultural drought and have an impact on food security from the perspective of disaster factors therefore how agricultural production adapts to these climate changes will be significant to reduce the risk of agricultural drought and formulate adaptive countermeasures for the sustainable development of agriculture in the future the crop growth model is one of the most important tools to study the impact of climate change on crops it is based on the physiological process and genetic theory of crops wenjia and hao 2012 the widely used us dssat series models and australian apism series models at present integrate various crop models into a common platform compared to these crop models the epic crop growth model uses one crop growth routine and a unified approach to simulate all crops williams et al 1989 which facilitates the development of a consistent and comparable calibration procedure for a range of crops studies even show that the epic model is superior to the csm ceres maize of the dssat series in terms of model calibration and evaluation yawen bao et al 2017 the united states department of agriculture developed the erosion productivity impact calculator epic crop growth model in 1981 which could simulate soil erosion and crop productivity over hundreds of years in a variety of climate scenarios environmental conditions and management systems to evaluate the impact of land use cropping patterns and wind and water erosion on crop yields and land productivity wenjia and hao 2012 the model was often used to simulate climate change impacts on agricultural research after adding modules related to water quality assessment and atmospheric co2 change in 1996 the model was also known as environmental policy impact climate gassman et al 2004 which is now maintained by the texas a m black land research and expansion center brec texas a m agrilife research 2004 the theoretical basis of crop growth in the epic crop growth model includes five parts potential biomass growth water use nutrient absorption growth stress and crop yield potential biomass is determined by the crop parameters that convert energy into biomass and the ability to intercept effective photosynthesis the water use situation is determined by the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of the soil the soil water volume fraction and the water demand during crop growth nutrient absorption is determined by the soil water volume fraction soil nutrient content and the supply and demand relationship during crop growth growth stress mainly includes temperature stress water stress nutrient stress aeration stress aluminum stress etc crop yield is a function of cumulative biomass harvesting factors and stress factors the epic crop growth model calculates these segments on a daily scale and eventually accumulates over the course of each growing season epic crop growth model can simulate crop growth indicators under various environments growing period lai dynamic root depth biomass yield drought stress and temperature stress however it is necessary to carry out parameter localization work test the sensitivity of the model and verify it in order to realize the use in different regions to facilitate the running of the model brecs developed a series of interface software that offered graphical parameters such as the interacting epic i epic that was developed to facilitate the management and execution of large epic simulation sets and interactive windows epic win epic that was designed to help agricultural practitioners optimize crop management and maximize production and profit texas a m agrilife research 2004 the epic crop growth model includes 11 submodules 1 weather module 2 hydrology module 3 erosion module 4 nutrient module 5 pesticide module 6 soil temperature module 7 crop growth module 8 cultivation module 9 crop environment module 10 economic module and 11 carbon cycle module singh 2002 the epic model has been widely used in watershed management gassman et al 2010 soil nutrient cycles torbert et al 2008 soil organic carbon simulations le et al 2018 and crop growth simulations xiong et al 2014 since the 1980s in recent years the epic crop growth model has also been applied to reduce agricultural drought wang et al 2008 since the development of epic crop growth model it has been widely used this paper systematically reviews the worldwide literature related to the application field of models we followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma approach raikes et al 2019 to search and select the literature samples and analyze the content of the selected literature according to the selected literature the research contents of the epic crop growth model on crop growth are classified into three aspects accuracy of crop growth model impact of climate change on crop growth and mitigation of agricultural drought risk 2 research methodology systematic reviews are common approaches to literature reviews involving a structured technique for data collection and analysis raikes et al 2019 while this approach originated in the health sciences it is increasingly used in social science research the first step of the literature review was a literature search to obtain as many retrieval results as possible and to exclude unexpected results epic abbreviation stands for many meanings we used the keyword epic crop growth model for the literature search a preliminary search was performed on google academics https scholar google com a total of 590 000 records were obtained after browsing the first 30 pages of literature records according to their relevance it was found that almost all the literature came from two databases web of science and elsevier sciencedirect according to mongeon paul hus and thome eckhardt et al 2019 at least two databases or journals need to be searched in the literature review therefore in addition to web of science which is an important source of citation data in natural science and engineering the elsevier sciencedirect database was also added to broaden the research scope after the selection of the databases a formal literature retrieval was conducted since the study was about the application of the epic crop growth model in crop growth the second keyword agriculture was added using an advanced search with two keywords epic crop growth model and agriculture there were 767 records from the elsevier sciencedirect database and 362 records from the web of science database the second step of the literature review was literature screening although two keywords were used for the first literature exclusion in the literature retrieval section there were still many studies that did not conform to the research content therefore exclusion criteria were developed for further screening fig 1 we performed a preliminary filter on the records by using the filter function of the database through four aspects years 1981 2019 document type article review availability full text available and language english through reading the title abstract and full text manually duplicates and documents irrelevant to the research content were removed and eighty six studies were eventually selected from two databases the third step of the literature review was to use meta analysis to analyze the selected literature meta analysis was first applied by researchers in the fields of medicine psychology and education and then sociological researchers introduced the idea of qualitative comparative analysis into the meta analysis according to the research objects and their properties lei and quan 2019 the main idea of meta analysis is to conduct research by means of classification comparison therefore the collected literature was analyzed by classification according to the research content after williams determined the genetic parameters of most crops in 1990 williams et al 1989 researchers started to use the epic crop growth model to assess crop growth however crop parameters are simultaneously affected by weather land use and technical conditions which further affects the accuracy of the model s output therefore how to improve the precision of epic crop growth model s output has become the first research direction of epic crop growth model applied to crop growth model climate change can affect crop growth through a variety of factors such as temperature precipitation co2 concentration and humidity which belong to the most uncontrollable category of crop influencing factors therefore the impact of climate change on crop growth has become the second research direction in crop growth model and is currently the most studied direction since the 21st century with the acceleration of global warming the food problem caused by extreme disasters has become the focus of attention research on how to reduce the risk of agricultural drought by using the epic crop growth model has become the third emerging research fig 2 therefore this article will review the following three aspects the improvement of crop growth model accuracy the applied research on the effects of climate change on crop growth and the mitigation of agricultural drought risk 3 result using the meta analysis method the selected 86 documents were divided into three categories according to the research content in different time periods the number of documents in three research directions showed fluctuations over time fig 2 the improvement of the accuracy of crop growth simulation model and the application research of the impact of climate change on crop growth are the main research directions in which the epic model was applied to crop growth simulation for example there were 25 related documents from 1990 to 1999 among them there are a total of 9 documents on the improvement of the accuracy of crop growth simulation model and 14 documents on the application research of the impact of climate change on crop growth it can be seen that on the basis of the improved accuracy from the simulation of epic model applied research on climate change became another focus of research since 1990 the first type of research content has increasing year by year mitigation of agricultural drought risk although there were only 2 documents from 1990 to 1999 it reached 13 during the period 2010 2019 indicating that the agricultural drought risk has been paid more and more attention by researchers and the epic model has been used to reduce the agricultural drought risk on a large scale although the number of documents has declined from 2000 to 2009 these three types of research are ongoing from 2010 to 2019 it became the high frequency stage of the application of epic model to crop growth there are 42 articles in total 3 1 improvement of epic crop growth model accuracy improving the mechanism and applicability of the model is the core to improve the model accuracy wang et al 2008 including how to adjust the genetic parameters of the crops and whether the growth factors of various crops can be well integrated into the model this is also the focus of continuous research on improving the epic crop growth model accuracy of crop yield to improve the accuracy of the model researchers localized the model parameters based on geographic location and revised the genetic parameters of the crops themselves to calibrate the parameters since the 1990s at the same time uncertainty analysis including incorrect or improper input data and incomplete model structure were also developed fig 3 3 1 1 parameter calibration parameter calibration is mainly carried out from two aspects genetic parameter revision of the crop itself and localization of model parameters according to the conditions of each research area the each crop parameter values of epic crop growth model were optimized mainly through influencing factors such as weather land use technical conditions e g irrigation and fertilization and optimization methods parameter calibration ranges from small scale regions such as farms to large scale regions such as topographic regions countries continents and global regions the genetic parameter revision of the crop itself and localization of model parameters can effectively improve the accuracy of the model the total number of model parameters is more than 300 in principle model parameter settings have the meaning of context correct but the coefficients of most parameters have only the meaning inherent in the model the default value of the model parameters can be obtained from the epic program package with unique values for each crop but the values need to be optimized with respect to the circumstances in each study region tatsumi 2016 since 1989 williams first simulated the growth process of field crops for 11 years such as rice wheat soybean sunflower and pea and determined the genetic parameters of most field crops williams et al 1989 cabelguenne continued to improve the factors affecting the yield simulation results taking into account the effects of drought radiation utilization rate water utilization rate and nutrient absorption on crop growth at different phenological stages and improved the model accuracy of main crops from 20 to less than 3 which greatly improved the accuracy of model cabelguenne et al 1990 kiniry et al 1992 cabelguenne et al 1999 in the early 21st century bernardos and barros discovered that the accuracy of the epic crop growth model was greatly improved after the modification of parameters according to weather land use and technical conditions in the process of agricultural crop simulation in argentina and parts of brazil bernardos et al 2001 de barros et al 2004 to model cotton growth in south texas j k et al found that appropriate estimates of model parameters including radiation use efficiency rue were critical to enabling crop models to accurately reproduce field conditions in simulating crop growth yield and other variables ko et al 2009 since 2010 local parameter databases have gradually been established by scholars worldwide in 2010 thomas gaiser et al conducted multi location calibration and validation of the epic crop growth model of maize production using data sets from 22 sites in the semiarid and semihumid tropics of west africa and northeastern brazil gaiser et al 2010 xuechun wang et al established a database of crop and soil parameters for the epic crop growth model and proved that the model could be applied to grassland and grain crop field systems in the loess plateau of china wang and li 2010 in 2014 wei xiong et al identified four parameters potential heat unit phu planting density pd harvest index hi and biomass energy ratio ber and calibrated them regionally to capture the spatial pattern of reported rice yield in 2000 and proved that the global calibration scheme performs satisfactorily in reproducing the spatial pattern of rice yield xiong et al 2014 xuxu et al presented an efficient global methodology of sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation for a physically based agro hydrological model swap epic and successfully found and constrained 14 highly sensitive parameters niu et al 2009 parameter calibration has developed rapidly since 1990 its development process has experienced the determination of crop genetic parameters in the 1990s modification of parameters according to weather land use and technical conditions in the 2000s and then the local and even global model parameter database since the decade gradually mature and widely used 3 1 2 uncertainty analysis the uncertainties associated with model parameters and inputs and the model structure can lead to the uncertainty of epic crop growth model so it is of great significance to carry out uncertainty analysis to improve the accuracy of crop yield simulation niu et al 2009 the uncertainty of the model is related to the model parameters and inputs the setting of model parameters and inputs such as weather soil fertilizer crop and field operations can increase or decrease model uncertainty this source of variability is known as parameter and input uncertainty tatsumi 2016 however detailed soil weather and crop management data are scarce on regional continental and global scales therefore it is imperative for the model calibration to closely match the behavior of the real agricultural system so that it can genuinely improve the accuracy of the crop yield simulation results and aid in developing better agricultural practices in the region to achieve this optimizing model parameters and inputs is critical bouman studied the effects of uncertainty in soil and management parameters in rice yield simulation results and found that there was 90 probability that simulated yields ranged from 0 6 to 1 65 times the standard yield bouman 1994 aggarwal found that in rain fed environments soil and weather inputs were dominant over crop parameters in introducing uncertainty aggarwal 1995 bulatewicz et al calibrated ten parameters using a genetic algorithm in irrigated lands of kansas bulatewicz et al 2009 kenichi tatsumi et al used the multi objective complex evolution mocom ua algorithm in combination with the epic crop growth model to perform uncertainty analysis of the model by comparing the simulation results obtained using randomly generated initial parameters and inputs with the available calibration parameters and inputs tatsumi 2016 the input values were often approximated through constructing representative farms easterling et al 1992 interpolating or extrapolating digital maps using a geographical information system gis carbone et al 2003 or through model simulations liu et al 2007 inappropriate approximation could considerably propagate from errors of input values to the uncertainty of model outputs the limited consideration of many important model parameters and inputs has rendered the application of most available crop models to wide areas rather difficult even with the same input and data set the difference of model structure will lead to the difference of model uncertainty xianzeng niu examined the reliability of the epic crop growth model in simulating grain sorghum and investigated model uncertainties introduced by input data the results showed that the overall model reliability was approximately 56 niu et al 2009 carlos angulo et al used four crop models simplace lintul slim dssat csm epic and daisy to simulate the growth of winter wheat in two german states from 1995 to 2008 the study indicated that the usefulness of the simulated yield uncertainty introduced by the crop growth simulation method should be considered by using a multi model approach angulo et al 2014 s asseng used 27 different wheat crop models to estimate the climate impacts on crop yields the study showed that impact uncertainties can be reduced by improving temperature and co2 relationships in models and can be better quantified through the use of multi model ensembles asseng et al 2013 optimization allows for explicit interpretation of simulation outputs the mechanism affecting the uncertainty of epic model is complex mainly including weather soil field management and other factors the calibration of model input data and parameters must closely match the behavior of actual agricultural systems to truly improve the accuracy of crop yield simulation results at the same time multi model method and multi model integration should be adopted to reduce the uncertainty of the model and improve the accuracy which is also the focus of future research in terms of parameter calibration the accuracy of the model was greatly improved by determining the genetic parameters of crops modifying the parameters according to the weather land use and technical conditions and establishing the local and even global model parameter database in the aspect of uncertainty analysis the uncertainty of model parameters input data and model structure was analyzed to improve the stability of the model 3 2 applied research on the effects of climate change of epic crop growth model the study of the influence of climate change on crop growth using the epic crop growth model began in the 1990s exploring the impact of climate change on crop growth mechanisms through the analysis of various meteorological factors and their combination for sensitivity analysis of crop growth this is the first research direction to apply the epic crop growth model to the impact of climate change on crop growth with the development of computing technology gis geographic information system technology and gcms global circulation models are emerging and applied to the study of the impact of climate change on crop growth which is the second research direction gis technology promotes the study of climate change from site research to regional research and gcms drive climate research from simple climate scenario settings to future climate model scenario simulations fig 4 3 2 1 sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors to epic crop growth model scholars paid more attention to the sensitivity analysis of temperature and precipitation on crop growth model sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors to crop growth involves scenario setting of many factors such as temperature precipitation and co2 concentration solar radiation relative humidity wind and water wang et al 2008 for example in the 1990s c o stockle et al set different temperature precipitation co2 concentration and other climate scenarios in their research and took wheat corn and soybean in the central dry land of the united states as an example to analyze the sensitivity of meteorological factors to crop growth stockle et al 1992 d l phillips and r a brown set more than 30 climate change scenarios to simulate corn and large yields in the united states and concluded that changes in factors such as precipitation temperature co2 concentration solar radiation and relative humidity would affect crop yields phillips et al 1996 brown and rosenberg 1997 under the influence of global climate change precipitation and temperature have undergone significant changes shukla et al 2019 so some researches have focused on the sensitivity analysis of temperature and precipitation of crop growth since 2010 christopher j anderson et al developed an empirical model relating observed yields to climate variables and soil moisture in a high maize production region in the united states to indicate the importance of using both water availability and temperature to model crop yield responses to explain future climate change on crop yields in 2015 anderson et al 2015 by setting a climate scenario xuechun wang et al in 2017 showed that both the decrease in precipitation and the increase in maximum temperature in the loess plateau region were not conducive to winter wheat production while the increase in minimum temperature was more beneficial to winter wheat production wang et al 2017 the sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors to crop growth is gradually concentrated from multiple factors to the influence of two factors temperature and precipitation on crop yield how to predict the influence of different meteorological factors on crop growth under future climate change is the research direction of sensitivity analysis 3 2 2 gis technology promotes the application from site research to regional research with the development of gis technology the application scale of epic crop growth model has changed from site to regional to global geleta simulated crop yield and no and n movement to the surface and groundwater in four soils and nine principal cropping systems in 1994 geleta et al 1994 the simulation was based on a modeling system that includes epic pst crop growth chemical movement model interfaced with a geographic information system gis the results showed wide variations in no and n losses for different soils irrigation systems and cropping systems gepic has been widely used to simulate the growth of crops in different regions since then priya compared and analyzed the characteristics of crop yield changes with seasonal climate at different resolutions on national scale 50 km and regional scale 10 km in india priya and shibasaki 2001 tan and shibasaki 2003 and liu and yang 2010 combined gis and epic crop growth models to estimate global crop yields and the results showed that the method was feasible for rice wheat and maize by combining the epic crop growth model and gai with integrating european wide land use elevation soil and daily meteorological gridded data juraj balkovic et al simulated winter wheat rain fed and irrigated maize spring barley and winter rye yields in europe and found that long term average forecasts were better than annual changes with relative estimation errors within 30 in most cases balkovič et al 2013 the introduction of gis technology promoted the application research of the epic crop growth model on the regional scale and extended the original crop model based on the site or homogeneous and small area to the medium scale and even the heterogeneous space on the global scale 3 2 3 gcm drives the development of models for future climate scenarios with the development of global atmospheric circulation models gcms could generate past and future climate data in the form of grids which provides the possibility for the simulation of crop growth under future climate scenarios on a regional scale since the 1990s touré used four models epic ceres stewart sinclair to evaluate the impact of climate change temperature precipitation co2 concentration on the continuous rotation of spring wheat yield per unit area in drylands in 1995 and the climate scenario generated from the canadian climate center general circulation model for lethbridge ab the four models showed decreases in dryland spring wheat yields due to high temperature and low precipitation touré et al 1995 dhakhwa used two general circulation models gcms the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl and the united kingdom meteorological office ukmo with epic to assess the climate change impact on the yield and biomass of maize dhakhwa et al 1997 since the 21st century the simulation of climate scenarios has focused on the effect of co2 concentrations on crop growth izaurralde comprehensively evaluated the impact of future climate change on regional agricultural productivity in the united states based on hadley center s hadcm2 climate scenario and showed that national wheat production will increase as atmospheric co2 concentrations increase izaurralde et al 2003 robetra selected two common circulation model gcms giss hadcm3 for climate prediction suggesting that soil cultivation and crop rotation to a certain extent played a role in mitigating or enhancing the effects of climate change on soil organic carbon farina et al 2011 juraj balkovi estimated crop yield changes in slovak farms under different climate change scenarios a2 and b2 sres emissions scenarios as well as reference climate scenarios and concluded that epic could reliably model the effects of climate change on soil organic carbon and crop yields balkovič et al 2011 based on data from field trials kieu n le et al successfully calibrated the epic crop growth model and verified crop yield in 2018 the results showed that under all treatments in the middle of this century the upland rice yield increased the most under scenario b1 followed by soybean and corn le et al 2018 previous studies have used gcms to simulate crop yield changes under different climate change scenarios in the future temperature precipitation co2 concentration etc future studies can continue to simulate crop growth under climate change scenarios with other factors and expand the spatiotemporal range of crop growth models with gis technology in the process of discussing the influence mechanism and sensitivity analysis of climate change on crop growth the analysis of various meteorological factors is concentrated from multi factor analysis to temperature and precipitation with the development of computing technology the emergence of gis technology and gcms technology makes it possible to predict the impact of different meteorological factors on crop growth under future climate change 3 3 application of epic crop growth model in mitigating agricultural drought risk the epic crop growth model can be used for disaster assessment in combination with meteorological factors to simulate crop yield and comprehensively consider carrier and disaster causing factors climate change alters crop growth conditions crop yields and the profitability of crop production and even leads to agricultural disasters studies have shown that temperature and precipitation can affect the number of crop seedlings prato et al 2010 by enabling crop companies to adapt to actual or anticipated climate change some crop farmers may be able to take advantage of these benefits or reduce the risk of future climate change the in depth study of crop disaster risk and assessment is of great significance for food security risk response and adaptive countermeasures the epic crop growth model can effectively assess the impact of climate change on agricultural economy richard m adams et al used epic and the u s department of agriculture s stochastic economic model to estimate the economic consequences of el niño and la niña on u s agriculture in 1999 adams et al 1999 which is an early example of the use of epic crop growth models for farm economic forecasting tony prato et al evaluated the potential economic impacts of future climate change on crop enterprise net returns and annual net farm income nfi for small and large representative farms in america crop enterprise net returns and nfi in a historical climate period 1960 2005 and future climate period 2006 2050 were compared when agricultural production systems apss were adapted to future climate change prato et al 2010 hermine mitter et al used the epic crop growth model to assess climate change impacts on the level and variability of crop yields and profits by simulating crop yields in historical periods 1975 2005 and five climate change scenarios 2010 2040 mitter et al 2014 the epic crop growth model can evaluate the expected loss of crop yield per unit area wang et al was the first to successfully used the epic crop growth model to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop growth in 2008 wang et al 2008 the epic crop growth model was combined with natural vulnerability crop drought risk theory to simulate the natural vulnerability curves of typical wheat varieties constructed risk quantitative evaluation analyzed based on the intensity index of wheat drought and water stress on chinese wheat drought wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 then wang et al used this method to assess the risk of drought disaster of maize in the farming pastoral ecotone in northern china wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 this was the first time that scholars applied the epic crop growth model to agricultural drought risk assessment many scholars have started to use the epic crop growth model to assess drought risk since then based on the conceptual framework of agricultural drought risk assessment some researchers quantitatively evaluated the spatial and temporal distribution of summer maize drought risk in the huang huai hai region from the whole growth period and sub growth period jia et al 2011 wheat vulnerability was represented by dividing yield loss per unit area by the drought risk index dhi and establishing a wheat drought vulnerability curve by simulating various wheat yield losses and related dhis yue et al 2015 some researchers used epic crop growth models to assess global maize drought risk in 2014 and 2016 yin et al 2014 guo et al 2016 in addition a method was proposed to assess the potential risks of future food insecurity globally by combining biophysical social and economic factors wu et al 2011 at present epic has been widely used in agricultural drought risk assessment 4 discussion the application of the epic crop growth model in crop growth model in different fields is interrelated and inseparable the application progress analysis could be conducted according to the research institution time and genre improving the accuracy of model is the earliest research direction of the epic crop growth model used in crop growth in 1989 after the genetic parameters of most field crops were determined by the united states department of agriculture usda and blackland research center brec northwest a f university nwafu china agricultural university cau agricultural research for development cirad and chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas also started to use the epic crop growth model to simulate crop growth by calibrating parameters it started as a simple parameter calibration and then different algorithms and operating frameworks were used to help calibrate parameters in addition the uncertainty analysis of the model was carried out by the dlo research institute for agrobiology and soil fertility ab dlo and other research institutes to improve crop model accuracy in 1992 the improvement of crop model accuracy can serve to study the impact of climate change on crop growth washington state university wsu first carried out a sensitivity analysis of simple meteorological factors on crop growth gis technology was first introduced into the epic crop growth model led by the university of oklahoma state ou in 1994 which greatly promoted the applied research on the simulation of crop growth based on climate change as the discussion of future climate models deepens the agriculture and agri food research centre of canada aafc introduced the gcm into the epic crop growth model in 1995 at the same time texas a m university tamu began to assess the benefits of climate change to farm economies in 2008 the application of the epic crop growth model to disaster assessment was initiated by beijing normal university bnu and the national disaster reduction center of china ndrcc and continued by the chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas and other institutions fig 5 therefore the development and application of the epic crop growth model involved in this paper are complementary relations fig 6 the three parts are the basis of each other and could promote the further progress in the development of the model through the calibration of epic crop growth model crop parameters were constantly adjusted to provide a more accurate simulation of crop growth in different geographical locations at the same time different models and algorithms were also combined with epic crop growth model to improve the accuracy of estimation the uncertainty was analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the model with the improvement of model accuracy applications like climate change and crop risk management were conducted for the applied research on the effects of climate change the historical sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors was first conducted in epic crop growth model the addition of gis technology promoted the application from site research to regional research with the introduction of the gcm the future climate scenario model was combined with the epic crop growth model the application of the epic crop growth model was then expanded from the perspective of both time and space as climate change deepens the research on crop growth the demand for epic crop growth model accuracy becomes higher which in turn promotes the improvement of model accuracy under the background of global climate change the applied research on crop yield and disaster assessment with epic crop growth model gains more and more attention the epic crop growth model was combined with vulnerability theory to conduct risk evaluation and studies were extended in temporal and spatial to assess global crop drought risk with the development of drought risk assessment studies on crop risk assessment could provide more effective guides and analysis for people in response to climate change in agriculture management 5 conclusions and prospects with the threat to food security brought by climate change the study of crop growth model using the epic crop growth model has been gradually developed the research contents of the epic crop growth model applied to crop growth model can be divided into three categories precision of crop growth model impact of climate change on crop growth and mitigation of agricultural disaster risk the methods to improve the accuracy of crop growth model mainly include crop parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis research on the impact of climate change on crop growth mainly includes a sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors on crop growth gis technology and gcms to promote the application of field research in regional studies and future scenarios the application of agricultural disaster risk mitigation is mainly beneficial assessment and disaster assessment the application areas of epic crop growth model is not only expanded from site to region but also applied from historical observation data to future climate model data the application direction is also extended from focusing on the improvement of model accuracy to taking into account the development of agricultural economy from focusing on the assessment of the impact of climate change to assisting the evaluation of agricultural drought risk in recent years due to global climate change extreme weather events have increased in frequency and intensity agricultural production in our country has experienced major cold warm drought flood and other extreme climate disasters which has become a major social concern creating difficulties for theoretical research and serving as the key points of management decisions in summary the epic crop growth model still faces many challenges in the context of global warming and extreme weather events 1 applications of extreme climate change global warming and the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events may have a great impact on the growth of crops but there are few studies focused on the impact of extreme climate on the growth of crops it is meaningful to study the degree of impact of extreme climate change on different fields and how to deal with the change 2 application of agricultural drought risk assessment and early warning the epic crop growth model can be used to restore and reconstruct the vulnerability curve database of agricultural drought which provides a way of thinking for research on agricultural drought vulnerability from statistical significance to the disaster mechanism 3 application of an agricultural catastrophe management system how to apply the epic crop growth model to catastrophe assessment build a complete agricultural catastrophe model develop appropriate catastrophe insurance products and form a catastrophe management system is the direction of future research 4 application of drought relief operations the results of real time crop growth yield assessment and prediction can be obtained through the fusion of remote sensing technology and crop growth model and can be generated as a series of business products which can play a certain role in the drought relief work of the state the government and relevant departments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
24473,climate change is breaking global food supplies the environmental policy impact climate epic model is capable of simulating crop productivity for hundreds of years under a variety of climate scenarios environmental conditions and management systems and is often used to study the impact of climate change on agriculture combined with systematic evaluation and meta analysis this paper reviews the application of epic crop growth model those research can be divided into three categories the improvement of crop growth model accuracy the applied research on the effects of climate change and the mitigation of agricultural drought risk in addition the paper puts forward four aspects of research hot spots in the future applications of extreme climate change application of agricultural drought risk assessment and early warning application of an agricultural catastrophe management system application of drought relief operations research shows the accuracy of the model is greatly improved by determining the genetic parameters of crops modifying the parameters according to the weather land use and technical conditions and establishing the local and even global model

sensitivity analysis of climate change on crop growth the analysis of various meteorological factors is concentrated from multi factor analysis to temperature and precipitation with the development of computing technology the emergence of gis technology and gcms technology makes it possible to predict the impact of different meteorological factors on crop growth under future climate change in some studies epic crop growth model has been performed to reduce the risk of agricultural drought keywords environmental policy impact climate model crop growth model climate change agricultural drought risk 1 introduction the special report on climate change and land released in 2019 by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that rising temperatures changing rainfall patterns and more frequent extreme weather have destroyed the stability of the global food supply shukla et al 2019 climate change has brought uncertainties in food production and a significant increase in disasters which will increase the risk of agricultural drought and have an impact on food security from the perspective of disaster factors therefore how agricultural production adapts to these climate changes will be significant to reduce the risk of agricultural drought and formulate adaptive countermeasures for the sustainable development of agriculture in the future the crop growth model is one of the most important tools to study the impact of climate change on crops it is based on the physiological process and genetic theory of crops wenjia and hao 2012 the widely used us dssat series models and australian apism series models at present integrate various crop models into a common platform compared to these crop models the epic crop growth model uses one crop growth routine and a unified approach to simulate all crops williams et al 1989 which facilitates the development of a consistent and comparable calibration procedure for a range of crops studies even show that the epic model is superior to the csm ceres maize of the dssat series in terms of model calibration and evaluation yawen bao et al 2017 the united states department of agriculture developed the erosion productivity impact calculator epic crop growth model in 1981 which could simulate soil erosion and crop productivity over hundreds of years in a variety of climate scenarios environmental conditions and management systems to evaluate the impact of land use cropping patterns and wind and water erosion on crop yields and land productivity wenjia and hao 2012 the model was often used to simulate climate change impacts on agricultural research after adding modules related to water quality assessment and atmospheric co2 change in 1996 the model was also known as environmental policy impact climate gassman et al 2004 which is now maintained by the texas a m black land research and expansion center brec texas a m agrilife research 2004 the theoretical basis of crop growth in the epic crop growth model includes five parts potential biomass growth water use nutrient absorption growth stress and crop yield potential biomass is determined by the crop parameters that convert energy into biomass and the ability to intercept effective photosynthesis the water use situation is determined by the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of the soil the soil water volume fraction and the water demand during crop growth nutrient absorption is determined by the soil water volume fraction soil nutrient content and the supply and demand relationship during crop growth growth stress mainly includes temperature stress water stress nutrient stress aeration stress aluminum stress etc crop yield is a function of cumulative biomass harvesting factors and stress factors the epic crop growth model calculates these segments on a daily scale and eventually accumulates over the course of each growing season epic crop growth model can simulate crop growth indicators under various environments growing period lai dynamic root depth biomass yield drought stress and temperature stress however it is necessary to carry out parameter localization work test the sensitivity of the model and verify it in order to realize the use in different regions to facilitate the running of the model brecs developed a series of interface software that offered graphical parameters such as the interacting epic i epic that was developed to facilitate the management and execution of large epic simulation sets and interactive windows epic win epic that was designed to help agricultural practitioners optimize crop management and maximize production and profit texas a m agrilife research 2004 the epic crop growth model includes 11 submodules 1 weather module 2 hydrology module 3 erosion module 4 nutrient module 5 pesticide module 6 soil temperature module 7 crop growth module 8 cultivation module 9 crop environment module 10 economic module and 11 carbon cycle module singh 2002 the epic model has been widely used in watershed management gassman et al 2010 soil nutrient cycles torbert et al 2008 soil organic carbon simulations le et al 2018 and crop growth simulations xiong et al 2014 since the 1980s in recent years the epic crop growth model has also been applied to reduce agricultural drought wang et al 2008 since the development of epic crop growth model it has been widely used this paper systematically reviews the worldwide literature related to the application field of models we followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma approach raikes et al 2019 to search and select the literature samples and analyze the content of the selected literature according to the selected literature the research contents of the epic crop growth model on crop growth are classified into three aspects accuracy of crop growth model impact of climate change on crop growth and mitigation of agricultural drought risk 2 research methodology systematic reviews are common approaches to literature reviews involving a structured technique for data collection and analysis raikes et al 2019 while this approach originated in the health sciences it is increasingly used in social science research the first step of the literature review was a literature search to obtain as many retrieval results as possible and to exclude unexpected results epic abbreviation stands for many meanings we used the keyword epic crop growth model for the literature search a preliminary search was performed on google academics https scholar google com a total of 590 000 records were obtained after browsing the first 30 pages of literature records according to their relevance it was found that almost all the literature came from two databases web of science and elsevier sciencedirect according to mongeon paul hus and thome eckhardt et al 2019 at least two databases or journals need to be searched in the literature review therefore in addition to web of science which is an important source of citation data in natural science and engineering the elsevier sciencedirect database was also added to broaden the research scope after the selection of the databases a formal literature retrieval was conducted since the study was about the application of the epic crop growth model in crop growth the second keyword agriculture was added using an advanced search with two keywords epic crop growth model and agriculture there were 767 records from the elsevier sciencedirect database and 362 records from the web of science database the second step of the literature review was literature screening although two keywords were used for the first literature exclusion in the literature retrieval section there were still many studies that did not conform to the research content therefore exclusion criteria were developed for further screening fig 1 we performed a preliminary filter on the records by using the filter function of the database through four aspects years 1981 2019 document type article review availability full text available and language english through reading the title abstract and full text manually duplicates and documents irrelevant to the research content were removed and eighty six studies were eventually selected from two databases the third step of the literature review was to use meta analysis to analyze the selected literature meta analysis was first applied by researchers in the fields of medicine psychology and education and then sociological researchers introduced the idea of qualitative comparative analysis into the meta analysis according to the research objects and their properties lei and quan 2019 the main idea of meta analysis is to conduct research by means of classification comparison therefore the collected literature was analyzed by classification according to the research content after williams determined the genetic parameters of most crops in 1990 williams et al 1989 researchers started to use the epic crop growth model to assess crop growth however crop parameters are simultaneously affected by weather land use and technical conditions which further affects the accuracy of the model s output therefore how to improve the precision of epic crop growth model s output has become the first research direction of epic crop growth model applied to crop growth model climate change can affect crop growth through a variety of factors such as temperature precipitation co2 concentration and humidity which belong to the most uncontrollable category of crop influencing factors therefore the impact of climate change on crop growth has become the second research direction in crop growth model and is currently the most studied direction since the 21st century with the acceleration of global warming the food problem caused by extreme disasters has become the focus of attention research on how to reduce the risk of agricultural drought by using the epic crop growth model has become the third emerging research fig 2 therefore this article will review the following three aspects the improvement of crop growth model accuracy the applied research on the effects of climate change on crop growth and the mitigation of agricultural drought risk 3 result using the meta analysis method the selected 86 documents were divided into three categories according to the research content in different time periods the number of documents in three research directions showed fluctuations over time fig 2 the improvement of the accuracy of crop growth simulation model and the application research of the impact of climate change on crop growth are the main research directions in which the epic model was applied to crop growth simulation for example there were 25 related documents from 1990 to 1999 among them there are a total of 9 documents on the improvement of the accuracy of crop growth simulation model and 14 documents on the application research of the impact of climate change on crop growth it can be seen that on the basis of the improved accuracy from the simulation of epic model applied research on climate change became another focus of research since 1990 the first type of research content has increasing year by year mitigation of agricultural drought risk although there were only 2 documents from 1990 to 1999 it reached 13 during the period 2010 2019 indicating that the agricultural drought risk has been paid more and more attention by researchers and the epic model has been used to reduce the agricultural drought risk on a large scale although the number of documents has declined from 2000 to 2009 these three types of research are ongoing from 2010 to 2019 it became the high frequency stage of the application of epic model to crop growth there are 42 articles in total 3 1 improvement of epic crop growth model accuracy improving the mechanism and applicability of the model is the core to improve the model accuracy wang et al 2008 including how to adjust the genetic parameters of the crops and whether the growth factors of various crops can be well integrated into the model this is also the focus of continuous research on improving the epic crop growth model accuracy of crop yield to improve the accuracy of the model researchers localized the model parameters based on geographic location and revised the genetic parameters of the crops themselves to calibrate the parameters since the 1990s at the same time uncertainty analysis including incorrect or improper input data and incomplete model structure were also developed fig 3 3 1 1 parameter calibration parameter calibration is mainly carried out from two aspects genetic parameter revision of the crop itself and localization of model parameters according to the conditions of each research area the each crop parameter values of epic crop growth model were optimized mainly through influencing factors such as weather land use technical conditions e g irrigation and fertilization and optimization methods parameter calibration ranges from small scale regions such as farms to large scale regions such as topographic regions countries continents and global regions the genetic parameter revision of the crop itself and localization of model parameters can effectively improve the accuracy of the model the total number of model parameters is more than 300 in principle model parameter settings have the meaning of context correct but the coefficients of most parameters have only the meaning inherent in the model the default value of the model parameters can be obtained from the epic program package with unique values for each crop but the values need to be optimized with respect to the circumstances in each study region tatsumi 2016 since 1989 williams first simulated the growth process of field crops for 11 years such as rice wheat soybean sunflower and pea and determined the genetic parameters of most field crops williams et al 1989 cabelguenne continued to improve the factors affecting the yield simulation results taking into account the effects of drought radiation utilization rate water utilization rate and nutrient absorption on crop growth at different phenological stages and improved the model accuracy of main crops from 20 to less than 3 which greatly improved the accuracy of model cabelguenne et al 1990 kiniry et al 1992 cabelguenne et al 1999 in the early 21st century bernardos and barros discovered that the accuracy of the epic crop growth model was greatly improved after the modification of parameters according to weather land use and technical conditions in the process of agricultural crop simulation in argentina and parts of brazil bernardos et al 2001 de barros et al 2004 to model cotton growth in south texas j k et al found that appropriate estimates of model parameters including radiation use efficiency rue were critical to enabling crop models to accurately reproduce field conditions in simulating crop growth yield and other variables ko et al 2009 since 2010 local parameter databases have gradually been established by scholars worldwide in 2010 thomas gaiser et al conducted multi location calibration and validation of the epic crop growth model of maize production using data sets from 22 sites in the semiarid and semihumid tropics of west africa and northeastern brazil gaiser et al 2010 xuechun wang et al established a database of crop and soil parameters for the epic crop growth model and proved that the model could be applied to grassland and grain crop field systems in the loess plateau of china wang and li 2010 in 2014 wei xiong et al identified four parameters potential heat unit phu planting density pd harvest index hi and biomass energy ratio ber and calibrated them regionally to capture the spatial pattern of reported rice yield in 2000 and proved that the global calibration scheme performs satisfactorily in reproducing the spatial pattern of rice yield xiong et al 2014 xuxu et al presented an efficient global methodology of sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation for a physically based agro hydrological model swap epic and successfully found and constrained 14 highly sensitive parameters niu et al 2009 parameter calibration has developed rapidly since 1990 its development process has experienced the determination of crop genetic parameters in the 1990s modification of parameters according to weather land use and technical conditions in the 2000s and then the local and even global model parameter database since the decade gradually mature and widely used 3 1 2 uncertainty analysis the uncertainties associated with model parameters and inputs and the model structure can lead to the uncertainty of epic crop growth model so it is of great significance to carry out uncertainty analysis to improve the accuracy of crop yield simulation niu et al 2009 the uncertainty of the model is related to the model parameters and inputs the setting of model parameters and inputs such as weather soil fertilizer crop and field operations can increase or decrease model uncertainty this source of variability is known as parameter and input uncertainty tatsumi 2016 however detailed soil weather and crop management data are scarce on regional continental and global scales therefore it is imperative for the model calibration to closely match the behavior of the real agricultural system so that it can genuinely improve the accuracy of the crop yield simulation results and aid in developing better agricultural practices in the region to achieve this optimizing model parameters and inputs is critical bouman studied the effects of uncertainty in soil and management parameters in rice yield simulation results and found that there was 90 probability that simulated yields ranged from 0 6 to 1 65 times the standard yield bouman 1994 aggarwal found that in rain fed environments soil and weather inputs were dominant over crop parameters in introducing uncertainty aggarwal 1995 bulatewicz et al calibrated ten parameters using a genetic algorithm in irrigated lands of kansas bulatewicz et al 2009 kenichi tatsumi et al used the multi objective complex evolution mocom ua algorithm in combination with the epic crop growth model to perform uncertainty analysis of the model by comparing the simulation results obtained using randomly generated initial parameters and inputs with the available calibration parameters and inputs tatsumi 2016 the input values were often approximated through constructing representative farms easterling et al 1992 interpolating or extrapolating digital maps using a geographical information system gis carbone et al 2003 or through model simulations liu et al 2007 inappropriate approximation could considerably propagate from errors of input values to the uncertainty of model outputs the limited consideration of many important model parameters and inputs has rendered the application of most available crop models to wide areas rather difficult even with the same input and data set the difference of model structure will lead to the difference of model uncertainty xianzeng niu examined the reliability of the epic crop growth model in simulating grain sorghum and investigated model uncertainties introduced by input data the results showed that the overall model reliability was approximately 56 niu et al 2009 carlos angulo et al used four crop models simplace lintul slim dssat csm epic and daisy to simulate the growth of winter wheat in two german states from 1995 to 2008 the study indicated that the usefulness of the simulated yield uncertainty introduced by the crop growth simulation method should be considered by using a multi model approach angulo et al 2014 s asseng used 27 different wheat crop models to estimate the climate impacts on crop yields the study showed that impact uncertainties can be reduced by improving temperature and co2 relationships in models and can be better quantified through the use of multi model ensembles asseng et al 2013 optimization allows for explicit interpretation of simulation outputs the mechanism affecting the uncertainty of epic model is complex mainly including weather soil field management and other factors the calibration of model input data and parameters must closely match the behavior of actual agricultural systems to truly improve the accuracy of crop yield simulation results at the same time multi model method and multi model integration should be adopted to reduce the uncertainty of the model and improve the accuracy which is also the focus of future research in terms of parameter calibration the accuracy of the model was greatly improved by determining the genetic parameters of crops modifying the parameters according to the weather land use and technical conditions and establishing the local and even global model parameter database in the aspect of uncertainty analysis the uncertainty of model parameters input data and model structure was analyzed to improve the stability of the model 3 2 applied research on the effects of climate change of epic crop growth model the study of the influence of climate change on crop growth using the epic crop growth model began in the 1990s exploring the impact of climate change on crop growth mechanisms through the analysis of various meteorological factors and their combination for sensitivity analysis of crop growth this is the first research direction to apply the epic crop growth model to the impact of climate change on crop growth with the development of computing technology gis geographic information system technology and gcms global circulation models are emerging and applied to the study of the impact of climate change on crop growth which is the second research direction gis technology promotes the study of climate change from site research to regional research and gcms drive climate research from simple climate scenario settings to future climate model scenario simulations fig 4 3 2 1 sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors to epic crop growth model scholars paid more attention to the sensitivity analysis of temperature and precipitation on crop growth model sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors to crop growth involves scenario setting of many factors such as temperature precipitation and co2 concentration solar radiation relative humidity wind and water wang et al 2008 for example in the 1990s c o stockle et al set different temperature precipitation co2 concentration and other climate scenarios in their research and took wheat corn and soybean in the central dry land of the united states as an example to analyze the sensitivity of meteorological factors to crop growth stockle et al 1992 d l phillips and r a brown set more than 30 climate change scenarios to simulate corn and large yields in the united states and concluded that changes in factors such as precipitation temperature co2 concentration solar radiation and relative humidity would affect crop yields phillips et al 1996 brown and rosenberg 1997 under the influence of global climate change precipitation and temperature have undergone significant changes shukla et al 2019 so some researches have focused on the sensitivity analysis of temperature and precipitation of crop growth since 2010 christopher j anderson et al developed an empirical model relating observed yields to climate variables and soil moisture in a high maize production region in the united states to indicate the importance of using both water availability and temperature to model crop yield responses to explain future climate change on crop yields in 2015 anderson et al 2015 by setting a climate scenario xuechun wang et al in 2017 showed that both the decrease in precipitation and the increase in maximum temperature in the loess plateau region were not conducive to winter wheat production while the increase in minimum temperature was more beneficial to winter wheat production wang et al 2017 the sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors to crop growth is gradually concentrated from multiple factors to the influence of two factors temperature and precipitation on crop yield how to predict the influence of different meteorological factors on crop growth under future climate change is the research direction of sensitivity analysis 3 2 2 gis technology promotes the application from site research to regional research with the development of gis technology the application scale of epic crop growth model has changed from site to regional to global geleta simulated crop yield and no and n movement to the surface and groundwater in four soils and nine principal cropping systems in 1994 geleta et al 1994 the simulation was based on a modeling system that includes epic pst crop growth chemical movement model interfaced with a geographic information system gis the results showed wide variations in no and n losses for different soils irrigation systems and cropping systems gepic has been widely used to simulate the growth of crops in different regions since then priya compared and analyzed the characteristics of crop yield changes with seasonal climate at different resolutions on national scale 50 km and regional scale 10 km in india priya and shibasaki 2001 tan and shibasaki 2003 and liu and yang 2010 combined gis and epic crop growth models to estimate global crop yields and the results showed that the method was feasible for rice wheat and maize by combining the epic crop growth model and gai with integrating european wide land use elevation soil and daily meteorological gridded data juraj balkovic et al simulated winter wheat rain fed and irrigated maize spring barley and winter rye yields in europe and found that long term average forecasts were better than annual changes with relative estimation errors within 30 in most cases balkovič et al 2013 the introduction of gis technology promoted the application research of the epic crop growth model on the regional scale and extended the original crop model based on the site or homogeneous and small area to the medium scale and even the heterogeneous space on the global scale 3 2 3 gcm drives the development of models for future climate scenarios with the development of global atmospheric circulation models gcms could generate past and future climate data in the form of grids which provides the possibility for the simulation of crop growth under future climate scenarios on a regional scale since the 1990s touré used four models epic ceres stewart sinclair to evaluate the impact of climate change temperature precipitation co2 concentration on the continuous rotation of spring wheat yield per unit area in drylands in 1995 and the climate scenario generated from the canadian climate center general circulation model for lethbridge ab the four models showed decreases in dryland spring wheat yields due to high temperature and low precipitation touré et al 1995 dhakhwa used two general circulation models gcms the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl and the united kingdom meteorological office ukmo with epic to assess the climate change impact on the yield and biomass of maize dhakhwa et al 1997 since the 21st century the simulation of climate scenarios has focused on the effect of co2 concentrations on crop growth izaurralde comprehensively evaluated the impact of future climate change on regional agricultural productivity in the united states based on hadley center s hadcm2 climate scenario and showed that national wheat production will increase as atmospheric co2 concentrations increase izaurralde et al 2003 robetra selected two common circulation model gcms giss hadcm3 for climate prediction suggesting that soil cultivation and crop rotation to a certain extent played a role in mitigating or enhancing the effects of climate change on soil organic carbon farina et al 2011 juraj balkovi estimated crop yield changes in slovak farms under different climate change scenarios a2 and b2 sres emissions scenarios as well as reference climate scenarios and concluded that epic could reliably model the effects of climate change on soil organic carbon and crop yields balkovič et al 2011 based on data from field trials kieu n le et al successfully calibrated the epic crop growth model and verified crop yield in 2018 the results showed that under all treatments in the middle of this century the upland rice yield increased the most under scenario b1 followed by soybean and corn le et al 2018 previous studies have used gcms to simulate crop yield changes under different climate change scenarios in the future temperature precipitation co2 concentration etc future studies can continue to simulate crop growth under climate change scenarios with other factors and expand the spatiotemporal range of crop growth models with gis technology in the process of discussing the influence mechanism and sensitivity analysis of climate change on crop growth the analysis of various meteorological factors is concentrated from multi factor analysis to temperature and precipitation with the development of computing technology the emergence of gis technology and gcms technology makes it possible to predict the impact of different meteorological factors on crop growth under future climate change 3 3 application of epic crop growth model in mitigating agricultural drought risk the epic crop growth model can be used for disaster assessment in combination with meteorological factors to simulate crop yield and comprehensively consider carrier and disaster causing factors climate change alters crop growth conditions crop yields and the profitability of crop production and even leads to agricultural disasters studies have shown that temperature and precipitation can affect the number of crop seedlings prato et al 2010 by enabling crop companies to adapt to actual or anticipated climate change some crop farmers may be able to take advantage of these benefits or reduce the risk of future climate change the in depth study of crop disaster risk and assessment is of great significance for food security risk response and adaptive countermeasures the epic crop growth model can effectively assess the impact of climate change on agricultural economy richard m adams et al used epic and the u s department of agriculture s stochastic economic model to estimate the economic consequences of el niño and la niña on u s agriculture in 1999 adams et al 1999 which is an early example of the use of epic crop growth models for farm economic forecasting tony prato et al evaluated the potential economic impacts of future climate change on crop enterprise net returns and annual net farm income nfi for small and large representative farms in america crop enterprise net returns and nfi in a historical climate period 1960 2005 and future climate period 2006 2050 were compared when agricultural production systems apss were adapted to future climate change prato et al 2010 hermine mitter et al used the epic crop growth model to assess climate change impacts on the level and variability of crop yields and profits by simulating crop yields in historical periods 1975 2005 and five climate change scenarios 2010 2040 mitter et al 2014 the epic crop growth model can evaluate the expected loss of crop yield per unit area wang et al was the first to successfully used the epic crop growth model to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop growth in 2008 wang et al 2008 the epic crop growth model was combined with natural vulnerability crop drought risk theory to simulate the natural vulnerability curves of typical wheat varieties constructed risk quantitative evaluation analyzed based on the intensity index of wheat drought and water stress on chinese wheat drought wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 then wang et al used this method to assess the risk of drought disaster of maize in the farming pastoral ecotone in northern china wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 this was the first time that scholars applied the epic crop growth model to agricultural drought risk assessment many scholars have started to use the epic crop growth model to assess drought risk since then based on the conceptual framework of agricultural drought risk assessment some researchers quantitatively evaluated the spatial and temporal distribution of summer maize drought risk in the huang huai hai region from the whole growth period and sub growth period jia et al 2011 wheat vulnerability was represented by dividing yield loss per unit area by the drought risk index dhi and establishing a wheat drought vulnerability curve by simulating various wheat yield losses and related dhis yue et al 2015 some researchers used epic crop growth models to assess global maize drought risk in 2014 and 2016 yin et al 2014 guo et al 2016 in addition a method was proposed to assess the potential risks of future food insecurity globally by combining biophysical social and economic factors wu et al 2011 at present epic has been widely used in agricultural drought risk assessment 4 discussion the application of the epic crop growth model in crop growth model in different fields is interrelated and inseparable the application progress analysis could be conducted according to the research institution time and genre improving the accuracy of model is the earliest research direction of the epic crop growth model used in crop growth in 1989 after the genetic parameters of most field crops were determined by the united states department of agriculture usda and blackland research center brec northwest a f university nwafu china agricultural university cau agricultural research for development cirad and chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas also started to use the epic crop growth model to simulate crop growth by calibrating parameters it started as a simple parameter calibration and then different algorithms and operating frameworks were used to help calibrate parameters in addition the uncertainty analysis of the model was carried out by the dlo research institute for agrobiology and soil fertility ab dlo and other research institutes to improve crop model accuracy in 1992 the improvement of crop model accuracy can serve to study the impact of climate change on crop growth washington state university wsu first carried out a sensitivity analysis of simple meteorological factors on crop growth gis technology was first introduced into the epic crop growth model led by the university of oklahoma state ou in 1994 which greatly promoted the applied research on the simulation of crop growth based on climate change as the discussion of future climate models deepens the agriculture and agri food research centre of canada aafc introduced the gcm into the epic crop growth model in 1995 at the same time texas a m university tamu began to assess the benefits of climate change to farm economies in 2008 the application of the epic crop growth model to disaster assessment was initiated by beijing normal university bnu and the national disaster reduction center of china ndrcc and continued by the chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas and other institutions fig 5 therefore the development and application of the epic crop growth model involved in this paper are complementary relations fig 6 the three parts are the basis of each other and could promote the further progress in the development of the model through the calibration of epic crop growth model crop parameters were constantly adjusted to provide a more accurate simulation of crop growth in different geographical locations at the same time different models and algorithms were also combined with epic crop growth model to improve the accuracy of estimation the uncertainty was analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the model with the improvement of model accuracy applications like climate change and crop risk management were conducted for the applied research on the effects of climate change the historical sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors was first conducted in epic crop growth model the addition of gis technology promoted the application from site research to regional research with the introduction of the gcm the future climate scenario model was combined with the epic crop growth model the application of the epic crop growth model was then expanded from the perspective of both time and space as climate change deepens the research on crop growth the demand for epic crop growth model accuracy becomes higher which in turn promotes the improvement of model accuracy under the background of global climate change the applied research on crop yield and disaster assessment with epic crop growth model gains more and more attention the epic crop growth model was combined with vulnerability theory to conduct risk evaluation and studies were extended in temporal and spatial to assess global crop drought risk with the development of drought risk assessment studies on crop risk assessment could provide more effective guides and analysis for people in response to climate change in agriculture management 5 conclusions and prospects with the threat to food security brought by climate change the study of crop growth model using the epic crop growth model has been gradually developed the research contents of the epic crop growth model applied to crop growth model can be divided into three categories precision of crop growth model impact of climate change on crop growth and mitigation of agricultural disaster risk the methods to improve the accuracy of crop growth model mainly include crop parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis research on the impact of climate change on crop growth mainly includes a sensitivity analysis of meteorological factors on crop growth gis technology and gcms to promote the application of field research in regional studies and future scenarios the application of agricultural disaster risk mitigation is mainly beneficial assessment and disaster assessment the application areas of epic crop growth model is not only expanded from site to region but also applied from historical observation data to future climate model data the application direction is also extended from focusing on the improvement of model accuracy to taking into account the development of agricultural economy from focusing on the assessment of the impact of climate change to assisting the evaluation of agricultural drought risk in recent years due to global climate change extreme weather events have increased in frequency and intensity agricultural production in our country has experienced major cold warm drought flood and other extreme climate disasters which has become a major social concern creating difficulties for theoretical research and serving as the key points of management decisions in summary the epic crop growth model still faces many challenges in the context of global warming and extreme weather events 1 applications of extreme climate change global warming and the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events may have a great impact on the growth of crops but there are few studies focused on the impact of extreme climate on the growth of crops it is meaningful to study the degree of impact of extreme climate change on different fields and how to deal with the change 2 application of agricultural drought risk assessment and early warning the epic crop growth model can be used to restore and reconstruct the vulnerability curve database of agricultural drought which provides a way of thinking for research on agricultural drought vulnerability from statistical significance to the disaster mechanism 3 application of an agricultural catastrophe management system how to apply the epic crop growth model to catastrophe assessment build a complete agricultural catastrophe model develop appropriate catastrophe insurance products and form a catastrophe management system is the direction of future research 4 application of drought relief operations the results of real time crop growth yield assessment and prediction can be obtained through the fusion of remote sensing technology and crop growth model and can be generated as a series of business products which can play a certain role in the drought relief work of the state the government and relevant departments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
24474,a central issue of ecological data analysis is the pairwise comparison of variables describing biological entities and the environment difficulties arise with calculations if the measurement scales of the variables differ in particular no method is available for measuring the association between a nominal and a fully ranked ordinal variable here two coefficients are suggested by reducing this problem to the evaluation of pattern in string representations the first one is a topological measure that counts the number of other types of elements occurring between pairs of elements of a given state along the entire length of the string thus providing a global coefficient of aggregation segregation the second coefficient is based on counting the number of different elements within substrings generated from the complete string with the moving window technique thus it is a local measure there is no compact and general formula for calculating these measures and heuristics are involved for finding the possible minimum and maximum values by algorithmic approximation and markov chain monte carlo simulation an r function is provided for computations the methods are applied to the comparison of nominal variables biological traits categorizing marine food web nodes with fully ranked variables describing major graph theory properties of the same nodes in the network the most descriptive traits mobility major functional group significantly associated with network metrics weighted indices were identified from a variety of combinations across three marine ecosystems these coefficients thus provide an objective statistically sound method for identifying ecologically meaningful traits keywords biological trait food webs nominal variables ordinal data string 1 introduction quantifying the relationship between variables is an everyday practice in statistical ecology the choice amongst available functions is governed primarily by the type of scale on which the variables are measured depending on the relations that apply to the possible values character states on the measurement scale four types of variables are distinguished anderberg 1973 the simplest case is the nominal one in which equality or inequality of character states may be examined only the ordinal scale has the additional property that the potential values can be ordered on the interval scale differences between values are also meaningful and finally on the ratio scale division of values is allowed as well many well known statistical functions apply to a pair of variables that have the same scale type such as the association coefficients for nominal variables the rank statistics for ordinal ones and the correlation or covariance between interval or ratio scale variables difficulties arise if the two variables being compared have different scale properties except that interval and ratio scale variables can be handled together in most cases the operation of subtraction is obviously meaningless for nominal and ordinal variables and therefore application of metric coefficients to such type of data is not recommended to overcome these difficulties it is a common practice to modify one variable to the same scale as the other for example by replacing the values of a ratio scale variable by ranks to allow calculating its rank correlation with an ordered variable however this operation implies loss of information because differences between scores of the ratio scale variable are disregarded thus coefficients considering the basic properties of variables are sought but these are relatively rare and limited in scope for instance the point biserial correlation coefficient applies to the comparison of an interval ratio scale variable with a nominal variable having two different states which is a well known mathematical equivalent to pearson s product moment correlation existing proposals for measuring strength between nominal and ordinal variables consider the nominal variable as explanatory and the ordinal one as response in addition the ordinal variable is also subdivided to categories with a clear ordering and the functions are based on the joint frequency distribution of observations as summed up in a cross classification table e g the δ functions of agresti 1981 their extensions by piccarreta 2001 as well as the generalized pearson like coefficient suggested by baak et al 2020 this type of ordinal variables is considered as partially ranked critchlow 1985 in which many values are tied 1 1 such data require special treatment via rank statistics for instance the tie adjusted kendall tau diday simon 1976 or the goodman kruskal 1954 1959 gamma when two such variables are compared with each other a well known example for measuring association between a nominal and a partially ranked ordinal variable is provided by agresti 1990 in which party affiliation is the nominal political ideology is the ordinal variable each with three categories democrat independent and republican versus liberal moderate conservative and the calculations use a large sample of more than 1000 individual voters however no method has been suggested for the case when the ordinal variable is fully ranked that is entirely free of tied values to fill this methodological gap two coefficients of association between a nominal variable and an ordinal variable of the latter type are proposed biology offers many such situations as will be demonstrated by actual examples coming from food web studies in three different marine ecosystems food webs provide a representation of nodes species or functional groups and their trophic connections the position of a species or functional group can be correlated with functional traits delmas et al 2018 brose et al 2019 but the question remains which traits are ecologically relevant and meaningful kremer et al 2017 with the incorporation of traits in network analysis we can improve the ecological interpretation between structure and function of network components ultimately better understanding food web organization and ecosystem functioning thompson et al 2012 tavares et al 2019 martini et al 2021 in our analysis network nodes are described in terms of biological nominal variables related to functional traits such as mobility habitat preference and major ecological functional groups the importance of the same nodes in the network is expressed by six network coefficients including components of the keystone index weighted topological indices and the keystoneness index after ranking the importance values our objective was to determine the relationship between the nominal categories and network properties to find the most descriptive traits and network metrics 2 new measures of nominal ordinal association let x be a nominal variable with k different categories character states and an ordinal fully ranked variable y both observed for a collection of l k elements each variable can be represented as a vector of length l so that x i i 1 l denotes the character state 1 2 k taken by element i and y i i 1 l corresponds to the rank of element i however visualization and programming greatly simplify if this information is condensed into a string s of the same length in this digit si is the character state taken by the element with rank i let n h be the number of elements with character state h giving vector n and n be the number of elements in each category if all categories are equal in size an example with k 3 n 4 and l 12 is given by x 1 1 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 3 2 y 2 3 6 7 1 4 5 10 9 8 12 11 which can be converted to the string as described above 1 s 111322231323 s can be considered as a multiset permutation of elements 1 2 and 3 with frequencies equal to 4 2 1 raw measures the intuitive starting point is that x and y exhibit maximum positive association aggregation if elements having the same character state form contiguous blocks in s that is for the example above we get 2 s 111133332222 since the nominal variable is unordered all k permutations of the k blocks are equal in this sense with rare exceptions for substring diversity see below it means that a nominal and an ordinal variable are maximally and positively associated if exactly k 1 changes are found when the string is read from left to right it follows that in the extreme case of k l every permutation of elements corresponds to maximum aggregation the other extreme situation is that elements of the same type are as distant from each other as possible in the sequence i e their segregation is the highest which corresponds to maximum negative association or repulsion for the above set of parameters this string takes the form 3 s 123123123123 or any other similarly repeated pattern of the k permutations of the substring 123 in developing formulae for measuring association between x and y we first define raw measures that rely on positional information of different elements examined directly or indirectly 2 1 1 topological segregation this measure counts the number of other character states appearing between every possible pair of elements in each category if this number is denoted by w i j for x i x j w i j k then we calculate the sum 4 u i j w i j which has the minimum value of zero for a perfectly aggregated pattern such as the one given by 2 the maximum value for categories equal in size is calculated from 5 u max k k 1 n 2 for example in string 3 there are exactly two other types of elements between every possible pair of identical elements since the number of pairs for each type is 4 3 2 6 and the number of categories is 3 the u statistic will be 3 2 6 36 this equals to u max there is no formula for the general case however we can get a proxy for the maximum by an algorithmic construction of the sequence corresponding to maximum or by a markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation for details see section 2 3 2 1 2 substring diversity the second proposed measure tv counts the number of different elements in all possible substrings of length v that can be distinguished in s in practice we use a window of width v and scan s from the left to right by shifting the window by one element in each step the number of such substrings is l ν 1 for string 2 with ν 3 we have the following series of substrings 111 111 113 133 333 333 332 322 222 222 since there are 6 substrings containing one type of elements and 4 strings containing two we obtain t 3 6 1 4 2 14 which is the minimum for ν 3 l 12 and n 4 in general if n h ν h 1 k the minimum can be calculated analytically while a window of width ν moves along the sequence there are l ν 1 positions if the window contains a homogeneous block it adds one to t v if there is a block boundary in the window it adds two since there are k 1 block boundaries in the string and at each block boundary there are ν 1 positions of the window that contains a boundary the minimum is the following 6 t v min l ν 1 k 1 ν 1 l k 2 v 1 if n h ν does not hold for all h there is no simple analytical expression for the minimum and the sequence of the k categories matters in this case one can construct the string with minimum tv as follows the sequence sought starts with the block of elements of the type of the smallest category and ends with the second smallest the elements of the third smallest category are right after the first block those of the fourth are before the second and so on for string 3 with the same value of v as above we obtain the following set of substrings 123 231 312 123 231 312 123 231 312 123 all substrings have three different elements therefore we get t 3 10 3 30 the maximum for this set of parameters an analytic expression for determining the maximum is easy to derive for the special case k n ν in this case each window of width ν contains all the k types as the total number of positions of windows is l ν 1 the maximum is obtained as 7 t v max k l v 1 k 3 k 2 k similar to the previous measure we can get a proxy for the maximum by an algorithmic construction of the sequence corresponding to maximum or by an mcmc simulation see section 2 3 for details notice that the computational complexity of u is quadratic with l whereas it is linear for t 2 2 normalized forms the two coefficients derived above provide results that are incomparable across different studies normalization is necessary to scale the values into the same range irrespective of the magnitude of k l and the n h s with known or estimated values of the lower and upper bounds of the three coefficients normalization by range is the first step in addition to allow comparisons between standard functions of rank statistics or product moment correlation these coefficients are scaled to 1 1 thus we get the following equations 8a b μ u 1 2 u u min u max u min and μ t 1 2 t t min t max t min as a result a value of 1 will correspond to maximum segregation that is maximum negative association while 1 indicates maximum aggregation that is maximum positive association between x and y since the substring diversity is a family of measures specified by the parameter v it is important to demonstrate the behaviour of this function for l 200 different values of k from 2 to 11 and with equal or nearly equal categories we determined the averages of μt at ν 2 20 each from 1000 randomly generated strings and found that the maxima appeared for window size equal to the number of categories i e for ν k fig 1 this choice is recommended in general when categories are approximately equal in size we have examined this problem for l 100 and l 400 and reached the same conclusion 2 3 determining the extremum values heuristic algorithms were used to calculate the extremum values of the two statistics the validity of these algorithms was checked through an mcmc method detailed later 2 3 1 heuristic minima for u and t u min 0 whereas t min can be obtained by creating a sequence consisting of homogeneous blocks of the different elements and placing the shorter blocks with smaller n h as close to either the left or right ends as possible 2 3 2 heuristic maxima for u the maximum value of the u statistic and derived forms for given n h s can also be well approximated by constructing a sequence according to the following rules 1 assign p priority values to all elements i 1 2 n c of all types c 1 2 k according to the rule p i n c 1 2 order the elements according to their priorities break ties between elements of different types consistently according to any arbitrary ordering of types consider for example the sequence s abbaac with k 3 na 3 nb 2 nc 1 the priority values are 0 25 0 5 0 75 for a elements 1 3 2 3 for b elements and 0 5 for the single c element after ordering the elements by their priorities we get sumax abacba note that in case of tie the order of elements does not affect the value of umax as suggested by our numerical experiments 2 3 3 heuristic maxima for t the maximum value of the t statistic and derived forms for given n h s can be well approximated by constructing a sequence according to the following rules 1 create an indexed list of the different types e g 1 2 3 4 initially the number of available elements for all types is equal to their n h values 2 assign elements to the different places of the sequence starting from the middle and going towards the left and right ends using an auxiliary variable i ranging from 1 to l for each value of i a the place to assign a value to is p floor l 2 i 1 2 if i is odd p floor l 2 i 2 if i is even b let the candidate to this place be the type with the index p mod k denoted by c c if n c is zero then let c be the type with the highest remaining number d assign c to position p of the sequence and decrease n c with one 2 3 4 heuristic maxima obtained by mcmc the mcmc simulation method a metropolis type searching algorithm metropolis et al 1953 is adapted to the present problem as follows step 1 specify l n the number of permutations to be examined n and the controlling parameter θ temperature explained later generate a multiset permutation at random or prepare one based on some external considerations see below depending on the investigator s choice calculate function u or t in general a set the counter i 1 and a old a step 2 set i i 1 generate a random integer z with uniform distribution within the range 1 n 1 interchange elements z and z 1 in the permutation step 3 calculate the new value a new accept the interchange with probability 10 p min 1 e a new a old and in case of acceptance set a new a old if i n then go back to step 2 else output the final permutation and the associated value of a formula 10 implies that increase of a will always be accepted however if increases were accepted only then there would be some chance for the algorithm to be trapped in a local optimum an undesirable property of greedy search algorithms to avoid this the metropolis algorithm allows backward moves a proposed interchange may be accepted even though the new permutation is worse than the previous one temperature θ controls the probability of such events the larger its value the larger the negative exponent of e and therefore backward moves will be accepted at increasing probabilities for very high values all changes are accepted and the search may run through all possible multiset permutations test runs are necessary to find an optimal setting of θ for each problem and parameter combination we have found that θ 0 5 is a safe choice for all investigated values of l and k the performance of mcmc and the heuristic methods was compared for both measures as follows we generated 10 000 random sequences in which the number of categories was a random number from the uniform distribution within the range 2 9 the numbers of elements in the categories were drawn from the range 1 50 the maximum measures were computed with mcmc θ 0 5 n 10000 and with the heuristic method for measure μ u eq 8a we have found no cases in which mcmc outperformed the heuristic method for measure μ t eq 8b in 53 of cases the two methods gave the same results while in 29 of cases the heuristic performed better the average of relative difference between the two methods was quite small mcmc heur mcmc 1 54 10 3 where mcmc and heur denote the unnormalized stochastic and the heuristic maxima respectively denotes the average over the 10 000 random sequences the minimum for t measure was also computed with mcmc and heuristic method and we have found no cases in which mcmc outperformed the heuristic method the r implementation of the u and t statistics can be found in the r package nomordr available at https cran r project org package nomordr the package provides the nomord probe function which performs the statistical analysis on an input vector sequence of nominal categorical values the function first calculates the chosen statistic then performs a randomization test to check for a significant association the normalized values are calculated based on equations 8a b using the heuristic extremum calculations described in sections 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 4 distributions and significance tests whereas the maxima of coefficients u and t are estimated via sequence generating algorithms their distributions are estimated by full randomization this allows determining the probability points for measures u and t or their derived variants in our case we present probabilities for μ u and μ t that a random sequence is more aggregated than the actual one tables 2 4 if p 0 05 we can conclude that elements of the same nominal category are significantly aggregated at α 0 05 whereas p 0 95 indicates significant segregation 3 example distributions 3 1 estimating distributions for various values of l the distributions of μ u and μ t are derived from a random sample of 100 000 strings with increasing values of l 20 40 100 and 200 fig 2 and 3 the sequences consist of four types k 4 with the same amount n 5 10 25 and 50 respectively the maximum values for μ u and μ t are computed with the heuristic algorithm described in section 2 3 as seen along with increases of l the variance decreases and as a consequence the relative frequency of the mean increases for both coefficients they do differ however in the behaviour of the estimated mean for the topological coefficient μ u the mean approximates closely the minimum value that is perfect segregation of categories in the string fig 2 demonstrates therefore that for long strings randomness differs relatively little from full segregation exemplified by string 3 the reason is that for large l s there is an increasing number of pairs of elements which enclose all other categories whose arrangement is of less importance since remote pairs influence the result we can conclude that μ u is a global coefficient this is not so with μ t whose mean is little affected by l if affected at all fig 3 apparently if k is the same and the numbers of categories are also identical then the length of the string will not matter the coefficient is sensitive to arrangements within small pieces of the string therefore we can refer to it as a local measure of association 3 2 comparison of coefficients the two coefficients μ t and μ u are compared graphically using strings with l 100 k 4 and n 25 the calculations started from the sequence of maximum aggregation 30 times and minimum aggregation 15 times for minimum μ u and 15 times for minimum μ t and involved 20 000 random swaps nearest neighbour interchanges with both coefficients recorded in each step note that the sequences of maximum aggregation are the same for both μ u and μ t in this way the entire range of both coefficients was sampled the scatter diagram fig 4 demonstrates that the overall relationship between the two coefficients in nonlinear however if examined in two sections i e left and right from the point determined by the approximate medians μ u μ t 0 82 0 18 as seen in figs 2 3 bottom left approximate linearity is detected 4 case studies the use of association coefficients is demonstrated here using ecological data describing marine food webs if we can link biological nominal traits with certain food web characteristics e g positional importance we can identify ecologically and functionally meaningful traits and increase the interpretability of food webs the aim is to better describe and understand the ecological roles of organisms by characterizing each network node trait based approaches can reveal explanations of food web structure however traits are currently limited by the lack of methodological standards and context dependence meaning that even the identification of relevant traits is problematic kremer et al 2017 for this we looked at two case studies of representative ecosystems and an integrated dataset of four reef food webs 4 1 data the first network comes from the gulf of nicoya estuary in costa rica and is composed of 20 nodes representing various groups such as fishes birds squids and so on wolff et al 1998 each node is characterized by three nominal variables 1 major ecological functional group fgr with six states 1 producers 2 zooplankton 3 invertebrates 4 fishes 5 all other vertebrates 6 bacteria 2 mobility mob with four states 1 mobile 2 limited mobility 3 drifter 4 sessile and 3 habitat hab with two states 1 benthic and 2 pelagic biological traits are commonly used to describe marine groups and many of them are expressed on the nominal scale costello et al 2015 in addition the importance of nodes is described in terms of six network indices as follows k keystone index describing vertical network structure kdir direct keystone index summarizing vertical direct effects component of k kindir indirect keystone index summarizing vertical indirect effects component of k wdc weighted degree centrality quantifying the number of immediate network connections weighted by their strength wi3 weighted topological importance quantifying the strength of direct and indirect network connections up to 3 steps and ksi keystoneness index identifying keystone groups having small biomass yet large effect see jordán et al 2006 for details concerning the first five indices and libralato et al 2006 for ksi our interest is to evaluate whether the three categorizations are statistically associated with the rank orders thus we have 3 6 18 pairwise comparisons of nominal and ordinal variables the second food web comes from the north sea continental shelf mackinson and daskalov 2007 and contains 63 nodes here we use the same three nominal variables to evaluate their association with four network measures wi3 kdir kindir k for which the nodes were fully ranked without ties the third example of calculation is based on the pooled set of 4 reef food webs from the great barrier reef 22 nodes gribble 2003 loyalty islands atoll 23 nodes bozec et al 2004 looe key sanctuary 18 nodes venier and pauly 1997 and virgin islands 19 nodes opitz 1993 containing a total of 82 nodes in this case weighted indices wdc wi3 provided rank order of nodes without ties which will be contrasted with the same three nominal variables the four reef networks were also evaluated separately to see whether the results and conclusions are strongly influenced by pooling the data food webs were compiled using ecobase online database repository colléter et al 2013 and heymans et al 2014 based on ecopath with ecosim ewe standard modelling software christensen et al 2005 since we were interested in the traits of biological components of the networks we omitted isolated and non living nodes e g detritus n 12 and those without available trait data n 3 for all networks examined here similar to endrédi et al 2021 although detritus is a major component of any food web data constraints also made it inevitable to exclude it detritus was missing nominal data i e biological traits are not relevant for detritus and in some cases topological data e g keystoneness index omits detritus libralato et al 2006 we calculated network indices for each node using methods detailed in jordán et al 2006 and ucinet software borgatti et al 2002 and converted these values to ranks in network analysis the larger index value signifies greater positional importance for the six indices being evaluated jordán et al 2006 libralato et al 2006 therefore we ranked index values from the largest to the smallest this allowed us to focus on interspecific interactions and the biological components of the networks that are described both in terms of positional importance ranks of network indices as well as biological traits appendix 4 2 results coefficient values for gulf of nicoya network are calculated based on 10 5 random permutations significant association of categories at 0 05 p 0 01 is detected by μ t in two cases and at 0 01 p 0 001 by μ u once all of them involving the nominal variable of mobility table 1 a specifically the mobility mob variable was significantly associated with a weighted index wdc and the hierarchical index measuring indirect effects kindir for the north sea network we used the same number of permutations mobility was significantly positively associated with wi3 for both coefficients and with k for μ t whereas the functional categorization fgr was associated with all four ordinal variables for both coefficients table 2 a no significant negative association i e segregation occurred in these two networks we need to examine the aggregation of character states and ranks within the strings to ecologically interpret the results table 1b and 2b we notice that drifter organisms phytoplankton and zooplankton mob 3 have top weighted wdc wi3 ranks while mobile groups mostly fish mob 1 are less important in general drifters are a highly aggregated group disproportionately weighted in food webs resulting in top rank values for weighted and indirect effects in contrast mobile animals e g fishes are better resolved groups often at species level with fewer more specific connections having negligible ranks for these indices overall for both food webs the mobility trait seems to be a good indicator of positional importance especially if paired with weighted network indices showing significant association the k index is a sum of direct kdir and indirect kindir effects but they are not consistently important in these networks mobility was not significantly associated with the directional component kdir or keystone index ksi suggesting that other traits are needed to capture the association with these network indices surprisingly the fgr variable with 5 categories in this case did not yield significant association for the gulf of nicoya network table 1a which could come from the fact the differences between major functional ecological groups are negligible in this small estuarine food web for the north sea food web however a sixth category bacteria fgr 6 was added and had important rank in all four indices but most visibly in k and kindir table 2b ecologically microbial organisms play a crucial part in energy flow in marine food webs fenchel 1988 invertebrates fgr 3 also seemed to be more frequently found at the top meaning that both bacteria and invertebrates are important groups in weighted wi3 and vertical effects both direct and indirect phytoplankton fgr 1 had only one instance thus aggregation could not be explored for this category in contrast fish fgr 4 aggregated on the opposite side of the string with ranks less important in the context of network analysis this makes sense because fishes are usually in the middle of the food web hierarchy with abated vertical trophic effects a few outliers are interesting to point out for example in all four of the fgr associations gelatinous zooplankton fgr 2 is the only invertebrate group found with mostly fishes fgr 4 showing that larger medusae are ecologically more similar to fishes than the smaller zooplankton e g copepods table 2 b pauly et al 2009 emphasize the need for better parametrization of jellyfish in ewe models it is also clear that members of the vertebrates category fgr 5 do not aggregate well suggesting that lumping reptiles birds and mammals into one category is functionally and ecologically too broad overall better resolution of food web groups as in the north sea model increases the interpretability of the fgr variable the binary habitat category was not sufficiently detailed to show significant association in either food web in fact most coefficient values fell into the middle region of the probability distribution suggesting a complete random pattern its consequence is that the binary habitat category is not helpful to characterize food web nodes in sufficient detail and therefore multiple habitat categories or a combination of traits should be used in agreement with the findings of costello et al 2015 for the combined coral reef networks all but one pair of variables are significantly associated for both coefficients the only exception being hab wi3 table 3 a the four reef networks are of similar size 18 23 nodes and resolution allowing examination of the pooled dataset indeed specific trophic groups e g sea turtles from different reefs were grouped together appendix top wi3 ranks entail nodes with direct and indirect effects while wdc quantifies the weighted centrality of a node within the network both weighted indices showed significant association with mobility variable table 3a as an example within the mob wi3 string drifters e g zooplankton mob 3 and sessile organisms e g benthic production mob 4 have top ranks while mobile groups mob 1 and mob 2 have negligible wi3 ranks in total 62 n 51 of nodes appeared to aggregate accordingly at the two extreme ends of the mob wi3 string the middle section n 31 38 is a mix of all four mobility categories containing groups that are not consistent across networks e g echinoderms appendix these groups in the middle have varying importance in the four reefs indicating that although reef nodes show several similarities e g benthic production drifters sea turtles these ecosystems have groups that remain unique the mob wdc association shows similar pattern with drifters being important and mobile groups found to have lower ranks low importance the fgr wi3 and fgr wdc associations were significant at p 0 001 for both coefficients table 3a and generally followed the same pattern producers fgr 1 and zooplankton fgr 2 occupying top ranks invertebrates fgr 3 and fishes fgr 4 in the middle and all other vertebrates grouped at the bottom fgr 5 the mob and fgr variables as in the previous two case studies are good indicators of positional importance by weighted network indices the habitat hab variable showed significant association with wdc but not with wi3 table 3a both indices are weighted but wi3 includes indirect effects up to 3 steps it appears that in reef networks weighted direct effects can be related to habitat structure but indirect effects are not well captured in the hab wi3 association in the hab wdc association 10 node long contiguous blocks appeared the association between these variables is difficult to interpret perhaps feeding guild groupings based on diet and life stages in relation to habitat would be a more appropriate trait in food web studies thompson et al 2020 no significant negative association i e segregation occurred in the reef networks the separate analysis of the four networks provided similar results confirming the conclusions derived from the evaluation of the pooled data see appendix for details we briefly discuss these findings here considering significance at p 0 05 fgr was significantly associated with wdc for all reefs and both coefficients and with wi3 for all but one case μ t for looe key sanctuary mob was significantly associated with wdc in all but one case the exception being μ t for the looe key sanctuary its association with wi3 proved significant in six cases exceptions are μ t for the great barrier reef and looe key sanctuary the trait of hab had the weakest association with the two indices similar to the combined data its only significant relationship is detected with wdc in the looe key sanctuary for both μ u and μ t 5 closing remarks the comparison between variables expressed on different scales has always been a challenge in statistical ecology because conventional measures of correlation and association are meaningless and therefore inapplicable this is particularly true if one variable is nominal while the other is a fully ranked ordinal one in this paper two radically different solutions are proposed demonstrating the enormous computational difficulties created by this problem the intuitive idea behind both strategies is nevertheless the same the starting point is that the relationship between two such variables is maximally positive when elements with the same nominal category appear as a contiguous block in the rank order a situation called aggregation the other extreme maximum negative relationship results when objects of a given nominal category fall as far as possible from one another in the sequence that is they are maximally segregated or overdispersed in this case the interplay amongst the different categories will eventually lead to a regularly alternating pattern of substrings in the rank order which is most conspicuous when all categories are represented by the same number of elements to express quantitatively where a given case is positioned between the two extremes two raw measures are suggested the first one is topological the number of other elements occurring between every possible pair of identical elements is counted and summed the second raw measure operates via the moving window technique the entire rank order is screened for all substrings of a given size the number of different nominal categories is found for each then summed these measures are transformed into the range 1 1 to ensure commensurability of results derived from different studies to achieve this one needs to determine the minimum and maximum raw values for the given combination of parameters the number of elements the number of categories and the number of elements in each for the topological measure the minimum is always zero whereas the lower bound of the diversity measure is obtained by a simple function if the number of elements in every category is not smaller than window size for determining the maximum values we conjecture that no compact formula can be derived instead two alternative procedures may be used an algorithmic sequence construction and monte carlo simulation to find an approximate maximum our experience suggests that these procedures give results with negligible differences and that the application of either one is sufficient for the purpose of standardization the sampling distributions of μ u and μ t were found to be very different the distribution of μ u is strongly right skewed and the mean is shifted considerably towards the left tail when the length of the string increases this is not so with μ t whose mean appears unaffected by the length of the string on the other hand this latter mean value is affected by window size with extreme maximum values attained when window size equals the number of nominal categories despite differences between the behaviour of these two functions they provided similar results when the significance of actual coefficient values was evaluated in all but two of the 36 pairs of variables we examined the results were consistent at p 0 05 we expect however that discrepancy between the two coefficients is deepened for longer strings being a global measure μ u approximates 1 because an increasing number of pairs of elements will enclose all other category types this is not so with μ t since it is based on examining the composition of short substrings that is a local condition one might conclude that the local measure is therefore more appropriate in general choice between the two coefficients is not that simple however as illustrated by the following examples s 1 1111111111112222222222222333333333333111111111 s 2 1111111111111111111112222222222222333333333333 the local measure shows only a slight difference between the s 1 and s 2 0 944 and 1 respectively contrary to the global measure 0 377 versus 1 which is apparently more sensitive to situations when elements of a given category appear in two distant blocks the use of both coefficients is therefore recommended and visual examination of strings cannot be avoided to reach meaningful conclusions currently these coefficients apply to fully ranked ordinal variables therefore further investigations are necessary to examine how ties influence the results and to extend their utility to such situations the use of association coefficients was applied to marine food webs for three different ecosystems estuary continental shelf reef specifically to find association between nominal biological traits and fully ranked ordinal network index variables significant positive association aggregation was found in all three cases whereas no negative association segregation was detected at all in all three ecosystems the mobility trait mob was consistently a good indicator of positional importance of certain trophic groups e g drifter organisms especially if paired with weighted network indices wdc or wi3 similarly other studies had the same conclusion and recommend using the mobility trait in marine ecosystems costello et al 2015 olmo gilabert et al 2019 mobility is a commonly used biological trait as it transcends over all taxa and the categories are well defined degen et al 2018 the functional group trait fgr was indicative of positional importance in the large network with greater resolution north sea and in the 4 reef networks taken together or examined separately depending on the ecosystem fgr was positively associated with the weighted index wi3 or with measures describing vertical food web structure k kdir kindir note its significant association with wdc for the reef networks either pooled or taken separately the fgr trait is a coarse categorization of trophic level which is a fundamental descriptor of any food web network and an important trait related to positional importance costello et al 2015 gravel et al 2016 the habitat hab category was only significantly associated with wdc and marginally significant for wi3 for the four concatenated network data the separate evaluation of reef networks revealed that the structure in the looe key sanctuary was solely responsible for this significant result these findings suggest limited applicability of the hab trait certain weighted indices and k components have been found to be clustered together in previous studies jordán et al 2006 endrédi et al 2021 thus their similar

24474,a central issue of ecological data analysis is the pairwise comparison of variables describing biological entities and the environment difficulties arise with calculations if the measurement scales of the variables differ in particular no method is available for measuring the association between a nominal and a fully ranked ordinal variable here two coefficients are suggested by reducing this problem to the evaluation of pattern in string representations the first one is a topological measure that counts the number of other types of elements occurring between pairs of elements of a given state along the entire length of the string thus providing a global coefficient of aggregation segregation the second coefficient is based on counting the number of different elements within substrings generated from the complete string with the moving window technique thus it is a local measure there is no compact and general formula for calculating these measures and heuristics are involved for finding the possible minimum and maximum values by algorithmic approximation and markov chain monte carlo simulation an r function is provided for computations the methods are applied to the comparison of nominal variables biological traits categorizing marine food web nodes with fully ranked variables describing major graph theory properties of the same nodes in the network the most descriptive traits mobility major functional group significantly associated with network metrics weighted indices were identified from a variety of combinations across three marine ecosystems these coefficients thus provide an objective statistically sound method for identifying ecologically meaningful traits keywords biological trait food webs nominal variables ordinal data string 1 introduction quantifying the relationship between variables is an everyday practice in statistical ecology the choice amongst available functions is governed primarily by the type of scale on which the variables are measured depending on the relations that apply to the possible values character states on the measurement scale four types of variables are distinguished anderberg 1973 the simplest case is the nominal one in which equality or inequality of character states may be examined only the ordinal scale has the additional property that the potential values can be ordered on the interval scale differences between values are also meaningful and finally on the ratio scale division of values is allowed as well many well known statistical functions apply to a pair of variables that have the same scale type such as the association coefficients for nominal variables the rank statistics for ordinal ones and the correlation or covariance between interval or ratio scale variables difficulties arise if the two variables being compared have different scale properties except that interval and ratio scale variables can be handled together in most cases the operation of subtraction is obviously meaningless for nominal and ordinal variables and therefore application of metric coefficients to such type of data is not recommended to overcome these difficulties it is a common practice to modify one variable to the same scale as the other for example by replacing the values of a ratio scale variable by ranks to allow calculating its rank correlation with an ordered variable however this operation implies loss of information because differences between scores of the ratio scale variable are disregarded thus coefficients considering the basic properties of variables are sought but these are relatively rare and limited in scope for instance the point biserial correlation coefficient applies to the comparison of an interval ratio scale variable with a nominal variable having two different states which is a well known mathematical equivalent to pearson s product moment correlation existing proposals for measuring strength between nominal and ordinal variables consider the nominal variable as explanatory and the ordinal one as response in addition the ordinal variable is also subdivided to categories with a clear ordering and the functions are based on the joint frequency distribution of observations as summed up in a cross classification table e g the δ functions of agresti 1981 their extensions by piccarreta 2001 as well as the generalized pearson like coefficient suggested by baak et al 2020 this type of ordinal variables is considered as partially ranked critchlow 1985 in which many values are tied 1 1 such data require special treatment via rank statistics for instance the tie adjusted kendall tau diday simon 1976 or the goodman kruskal 1954 1959 gamma when two such variables are compared with each other a well known example for measuring association between a nominal and a partially ranked ordinal variable is provided by agresti 1990 in which party affiliation is the nominal political ideology is the ordinal variable each with three categories democrat independent and republican versus liberal moderate conservative and the calculations use a large sample of more than 1000 individual voters however no method has been suggested for the case when the ordinal variable is fully ranked that is entirely free of tied values to fill this methodological gap two coefficients of association between a nominal variable and an ordinal variable of the latter type are proposed biology offers many such situations as will be demonstrated by actual examples coming from food web studies in three different marine ecosystems food webs provide a representation of nodes species or functional groups and their trophic connections the position of a species or functional group can be correlated with functional traits delmas et al 2018 brose et al 2019 but the question remains which traits are ecologically relevant and meaningful kremer et al 2017 with the incorporation of traits in network analysis we can improve the ecological interpretation between structure and function of network components ultimately better understanding food web organization and ecosystem functioning thompson et al 2012 tavares et al 2019 martini et al 2021 in our analysis network nodes are described in terms of biological nominal variables related to functional traits such as mobility habitat preference and major ecological functional groups the importance of the same nodes in the network is expressed by six network coefficients including components of the keystone index weighted topological indices and the keystoneness index after ranking the importance values our objective was to determine the relationship between the nominal categories and network properties to find the most descriptive traits and network metrics 2 new measures of nominal ordinal association let x be a nominal variable with k different categories character states and an ordinal fully ranked variable y both observed for a collection of l k elements each variable can be represented as a vector of length l so that x i i 1 l denotes the character state 1 2 k taken by element i and y i i 1 l corresponds to the rank of element i however visualization and programming greatly simplify if this information is condensed into a string s of the same length in this digit si is the character state taken by the element with rank i let n h be the number of elements with character state h giving vector n and n be the number of elements in each category if all categories are equal in size an example with k 3 n 4 and l 12 is given by x 1 1 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 3 2 y 2 3 6 7 1 4 5 10 9 8 12 11 which can be converted to the string as described above 1 s 111322231323 s can be considered as a multiset permutation of elements 1 2 and 3 with frequencies equal to 4 2 1 raw measures the intuitive starting point is that x and y exhibit maximum positive association aggregation if elements having the same character state form contiguous blocks in s that is for the example above we get 2 s 111133332222 since the nominal variable is unordered all k permutations of the k blocks are equal in this sense with rare exceptions for substring diversity see below it means that a nominal and an ordinal variable are maximally and positively associated if exactly k 1 changes are found when the string is read from left to right it follows that in the extreme case of k l every permutation of elements corresponds to maximum aggregation the other extreme situation is that elements of the same type are as distant from each other as possible in the sequence i e their segregation is the highest which corresponds to maximum negative association or repulsion for the above set of parameters this string takes the form 3 s 123123123123 or any other similarly repeated pattern of the k permutations of the substring 123 in developing formulae for measuring association between x and y we first define raw measures that rely on positional information of different elements examined directly or indirectly 2 1 1 topological segregation this measure counts the number of other character states appearing between every possible pair of elements in each category if this number is denoted by w i j for x i x j w i j k then we calculate the sum 4 u i j w i j which has the minimum value of zero for a perfectly aggregated pattern such as the one given by 2 the maximum value for categories equal in size is calculated from 5 u max k k 1 n 2 for example in string 3 there are exactly two other types of elements between every possible pair of identical elements since the number of pairs for each type is 4 3 2 6 and the number of categories is 3 the u statistic will be 3 2 6 36 this equals to u max there is no formula for the general case however we can get a proxy for the maximum by an algorithmic construction of the sequence corresponding to maximum or by a markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation for details see section 2 3 2 1 2 substring diversity the second proposed measure tv counts the number of different elements in all possible substrings of length v that can be distinguished in s in practice we use a window of width v and scan s from the left to right by shifting the window by one element in each step the number of such substrings is l ν 1 for string 2 with ν 3 we have the following series of substrings 111 111 113 133 333 333 332 322 222 222 since there are 6 substrings containing one type of elements and 4 strings containing two we obtain t 3 6 1 4 2 14 which is the minimum for ν 3 l 12 and n 4 in general if n h ν h 1 k the minimum can be calculated analytically while a window of width ν moves along the sequence there are l ν 1 positions if the window contains a homogeneous block it adds one to t v if there is a block boundary in the window it adds two since there are k 1 block boundaries in the string and at each block boundary there are ν 1 positions of the window that contains a boundary the minimum is the following 6 t v min l ν 1 k 1 ν 1 l k 2 v 1 if n h ν does not hold for all h there is no simple analytical expression for the minimum and the sequence of the k categories matters in this case one can construct the string with minimum tv as follows the sequence sought starts with the block of elements of the type of the smallest category and ends with the second smallest the elements of the third smallest category are right after the first block those of the fourth are before the second and so on for string 3 with the same value of v as above we obtain the following set of substrings 123 231 312 123 231 312 123 231 312 123 all substrings have three different elements therefore we get t 3 10 3 30 the maximum for this set of parameters an analytic expression for determining the maximum is easy to derive for the special case k n ν in this case each window of width ν contains all the k types as the total number of positions of windows is l ν 1 the maximum is obtained as 7 t v max k l v 1 k 3 k 2 k similar to the previous measure we can get a proxy for the maximum by an algorithmic construction of the sequence corresponding to maximum or by an mcmc simulation see section 2 3 for details notice that the computational complexity of u is quadratic with l whereas it is linear for t 2 2 normalized forms the two coefficients derived above provide results that are incomparable across different studies normalization is necessary to scale the values into the same range irrespective of the magnitude of k l and the n h s with known or estimated values of the lower and upper bounds of the three coefficients normalization by range is the first step in addition to allow comparisons between standard functions of rank statistics or product moment correlation these coefficients are scaled to 1 1 thus we get the following equations 8a b μ u 1 2 u u min u max u min and μ t 1 2 t t min t max t min as a result a value of 1 will correspond to maximum segregation that is maximum negative association while 1 indicates maximum aggregation that is maximum positive association between x and y since the substring diversity is a family of measures specified by the parameter v it is important to demonstrate the behaviour of this function for l 200 different values of k from 2 to 11 and with equal or nearly equal categories we determined the averages of μt at ν 2 20 each from 1000 randomly generated strings and found that the maxima appeared for window size equal to the number of categories i e for ν k fig 1 this choice is recommended in general when categories are approximately equal in size we have examined this problem for l 100 and l 400 and reached the same conclusion 2 3 determining the extremum values heuristic algorithms were used to calculate the extremum values of the two statistics the validity of these algorithms was checked through an mcmc method detailed later 2 3 1 heuristic minima for u and t u min 0 whereas t min can be obtained by creating a sequence consisting of homogeneous blocks of the different elements and placing the shorter blocks with smaller n h as close to either the left or right ends as possible 2 3 2 heuristic maxima for u the maximum value of the u statistic and derived forms for given n h s can also be well approximated by constructing a sequence according to the following rules 1 assign p priority values to all elements i 1 2 n c of all types c 1 2 k according to the rule p i n c 1 2 order the elements according to their priorities break ties between elements of different types consistently according to any arbitrary ordering of types consider for example the sequence s abbaac with k 3 na 3 nb 2 nc 1 the priority values are 0 25 0 5 0 75 for a elements 1 3 2 3 for b elements and 0 5 for the single c element after ordering the elements by their priorities we get sumax abacba note that in case of tie the order of elements does not affect the value of umax as suggested by our numerical experiments 2 3 3 heuristic maxima for t the maximum value of the t statistic and derived forms for given n h s can be well approximated by constructing a sequence according to the following rules 1 create an indexed list of the different types e g 1 2 3 4 initially the number of available elements for all types is equal to their n h values 2 assign elements to the different places of the sequence starting from the middle and going towards the left and right ends using an auxiliary variable i ranging from 1 to l for each value of i a the place to assign a value to is p floor l 2 i 1 2 if i is odd p floor l 2 i 2 if i is even b let the candidate to this place be the type with the index p mod k denoted by c c if n c is zero then let c be the type with the highest remaining number d assign c to position p of the sequence and decrease n c with one 2 3 4 heuristic maxima obtained by mcmc the mcmc simulation method a metropolis type searching algorithm metropolis et al 1953 is adapted to the present problem as follows step 1 specify l n the number of permutations to be examined n and the controlling parameter θ temperature explained later generate a multiset permutation at random or prepare one based on some external considerations see below depending on the investigator s choice calculate function u or t in general a set the counter i 1 and a old a step 2 set i i 1 generate a random integer z with uniform distribution within the range 1 n 1 interchange elements z and z 1 in the permutation step 3 calculate the new value a new accept the interchange with probability 10 p min 1 e a new a old and in case of acceptance set a new a old if i n then go back to step 2 else output the final permutation and the associated value of a formula 10 implies that increase of a will always be accepted however if increases were accepted only then there would be some chance for the algorithm to be trapped in a local optimum an undesirable property of greedy search algorithms to avoid this the metropolis algorithm allows backward moves a proposed interchange may be accepted even though the new permutation is worse than the previous one temperature θ controls the probability of such events the larger its value the larger the negative exponent of e and therefore backward moves will be accepted at increasing probabilities for very high values all changes are accepted and the search may run through all possible multiset permutations test runs are necessary to find an optimal setting of θ for each problem and parameter combination we have found that θ 0 5 is a safe choice for all investigated values of l and k the performance of mcmc and the heuristic methods was compared for both measures as follows we generated 10 000 random sequences in which the number of categories was a random number from the uniform distribution within the range 2 9 the numbers of elements in the categories were drawn from the range 1 50 the maximum measures were computed with mcmc θ 0 5 n 10000 and with the heuristic method for measure μ u eq 8a we have found no cases in which mcmc outperformed the heuristic method for measure μ t eq 8b in 53 of cases the two methods gave the same results while in 29 of cases the heuristic performed better the average of relative difference between the two methods was quite small mcmc heur mcmc 1 54 10 3 where mcmc and heur denote the unnormalized stochastic and the heuristic maxima respectively denotes the average over the 10 000 random sequences the minimum for t measure was also computed with mcmc and heuristic method and we have found no cases in which mcmc outperformed the heuristic method the r implementation of the u and t statistics can be found in the r package nomordr available at https cran r project org package nomordr the package provides the nomord probe function which performs the statistical analysis on an input vector sequence of nominal categorical values the function first calculates the chosen statistic then performs a randomization test to check for a significant association the normalized values are calculated based on equations 8a b using the heuristic extremum calculations described in sections 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 4 distributions and significance tests whereas the maxima of coefficients u and t are estimated via sequence generating algorithms their distributions are estimated by full randomization this allows determining the probability points for measures u and t or their derived variants in our case we present probabilities for μ u and μ t that a random sequence is more aggregated than the actual one tables 2 4 if p 0 05 we can conclude that elements of the same nominal category are significantly aggregated at α 0 05 whereas p 0 95 indicates significant segregation 3 example distributions 3 1 estimating distributions for various values of l the distributions of μ u and μ t are derived from a random sample of 100 000 strings with increasing values of l 20 40 100 and 200 fig 2 and 3 the sequences consist of four types k 4 with the same amount n 5 10 25 and 50 respectively the maximum values for μ u and μ t are computed with the heuristic algorithm described in section 2 3 as seen along with increases of l the variance decreases and as a consequence the relative frequency of the mean increases for both coefficients they do differ however in the behaviour of the estimated mean for the topological coefficient μ u the mean approximates closely the minimum value that is perfect segregation of categories in the string fig 2 demonstrates therefore that for long strings randomness differs relatively little from full segregation exemplified by string 3 the reason is that for large l s there is an increasing number of pairs of elements which enclose all other categories whose arrangement is of less importance since remote pairs influence the result we can conclude that μ u is a global coefficient this is not so with μ t whose mean is little affected by l if affected at all fig 3 apparently if k is the same and the numbers of categories are also identical then the length of the string will not matter the coefficient is sensitive to arrangements within small pieces of the string therefore we can refer to it as a local measure of association 3 2 comparison of coefficients the two coefficients μ t and μ u are compared graphically using strings with l 100 k 4 and n 25 the calculations started from the sequence of maximum aggregation 30 times and minimum aggregation 15 times for minimum μ u and 15 times for minimum μ t and involved 20 000 random swaps nearest neighbour interchanges with both coefficients recorded in each step note that the sequences of maximum aggregation are the same for both μ u and μ t in this way the entire range of both coefficients was sampled the scatter diagram fig 4 demonstrates that the overall relationship between the two coefficients in nonlinear however if examined in two sections i e left and right from the point determined by the approximate medians μ u μ t 0 82 0 18 as seen in figs 2 3 bottom left approximate linearity is detected 4 case studies the use of association coefficients is demonstrated here using ecological data describing marine food webs if we can link biological nominal traits with certain food web characteristics e g positional importance we can identify ecologically and functionally meaningful traits and increase the interpretability of food webs the aim is to better describe and understand the ecological roles of organisms by characterizing each network node trait based approaches can reveal explanations of food web structure however traits are currently limited by the lack of methodological standards and context dependence meaning that even the identification of relevant traits is problematic kremer et al 2017 for this we looked at two case studies of representative ecosystems and an integrated dataset of four reef food webs 4 1 data the first network comes from the gulf of nicoya estuary in costa rica and is composed of 20 nodes representing various groups such as fishes birds squids and so on wolff et al 1998 each node is characterized by three nominal variables 1 major ecological functional group fgr with six states 1 producers 2 zooplankton 3 invertebrates 4 fishes 5 all other vertebrates 6 bacteria 2 mobility mob with four states 1 mobile 2 limited mobility 3 drifter 4 sessile and 3 habitat hab with two states 1 benthic and 2 pelagic biological traits are commonly used to describe marine groups and many of them are expressed on the nominal scale costello et al 2015 in addition the importance of nodes is described in terms of six network indices as follows k keystone index describing vertical network structure kdir direct keystone index summarizing vertical direct effects component of k kindir indirect keystone index summarizing vertical indirect effects component of k wdc weighted degree centrality quantifying the number of immediate network connections weighted by their strength wi3 weighted topological importance quantifying the strength of direct and indirect network connections up to 3 steps and ksi keystoneness index identifying keystone groups having small biomass yet large effect see jordán et al 2006 for details concerning the first five indices and libralato et al 2006 for ksi our interest is to evaluate whether the three categorizations are statistically associated with the rank orders thus we have 3 6 18 pairwise comparisons of nominal and ordinal variables the second food web comes from the north sea continental shelf mackinson and daskalov 2007 and contains 63 nodes here we use the same three nominal variables to evaluate their association with four network measures wi3 kdir kindir k for which the nodes were fully ranked without ties the third example of calculation is based on the pooled set of 4 reef food webs from the great barrier reef 22 nodes gribble 2003 loyalty islands atoll 23 nodes bozec et al 2004 looe key sanctuary 18 nodes venier and pauly 1997 and virgin islands 19 nodes opitz 1993 containing a total of 82 nodes in this case weighted indices wdc wi3 provided rank order of nodes without ties which will be contrasted with the same three nominal variables the four reef networks were also evaluated separately to see whether the results and conclusions are strongly influenced by pooling the data food webs were compiled using ecobase online database repository colléter et al 2013 and heymans et al 2014 based on ecopath with ecosim ewe standard modelling software christensen et al 2005 since we were interested in the traits of biological components of the networks we omitted isolated and non living nodes e g detritus n 12 and those without available trait data n 3 for all networks examined here similar to endrédi et al 2021 although detritus is a major component of any food web data constraints also made it inevitable to exclude it detritus was missing nominal data i e biological traits are not relevant for detritus and in some cases topological data e g keystoneness index omits detritus libralato et al 2006 we calculated network indices for each node using methods detailed in jordán et al 2006 and ucinet software borgatti et al 2002 and converted these values to ranks in network analysis the larger index value signifies greater positional importance for the six indices being evaluated jordán et al 2006 libralato et al 2006 therefore we ranked index values from the largest to the smallest this allowed us to focus on interspecific interactions and the biological components of the networks that are described both in terms of positional importance ranks of network indices as well as biological traits appendix 4 2 results coefficient values for gulf of nicoya network are calculated based on 10 5 random permutations significant association of categories at 0 05 p 0 01 is detected by μ t in two cases and at 0 01 p 0 001 by μ u once all of them involving the nominal variable of mobility table 1 a specifically the mobility mob variable was significantly associated with a weighted index wdc and the hierarchical index measuring indirect effects kindir for the north sea network we used the same number of permutations mobility was significantly positively associated with wi3 for both coefficients and with k for μ t whereas the functional categorization fgr was associated with all four ordinal variables for both coefficients table 2 a no significant negative association i e segregation occurred in these two networks we need to examine the aggregation of character states and ranks within the strings to ecologically interpret the results table 1b and 2b we notice that drifter organisms phytoplankton and zooplankton mob 3 have top weighted wdc wi3 ranks while mobile groups mostly fish mob 1 are less important in general drifters are a highly aggregated group disproportionately weighted in food webs resulting in top rank values for weighted and indirect effects in contrast mobile animals e g fishes are better resolved groups often at species level with fewer more specific connections having negligible ranks for these indices overall for both food webs the mobility trait seems to be a good indicator of positional importance especially if paired with weighted network indices showing significant association the k index is a sum of direct kdir and indirect kindir effects but they are not consistently important in these networks mobility was not significantly associated with the directional component kdir or keystone index ksi suggesting that other traits are needed to capture the association with these network indices surprisingly the fgr variable with 5 categories in this case did not yield significant association for the gulf of nicoya network table 1a which could come from the fact the differences between major functional ecological groups are negligible in this small estuarine food web for the north sea food web however a sixth category bacteria fgr 6 was added and had important rank in all four indices but most visibly in k and kindir table 2b ecologically microbial organisms play a crucial part in energy flow in marine food webs fenchel 1988 invertebrates fgr 3 also seemed to be more frequently found at the top meaning that both bacteria and invertebrates are important groups in weighted wi3 and vertical effects both direct and indirect phytoplankton fgr 1 had only one instance thus aggregation could not be explored for this category in contrast fish fgr 4 aggregated on the opposite side of the string with ranks less important in the context of network analysis this makes sense because fishes are usually in the middle of the food web hierarchy with abated vertical trophic effects a few outliers are interesting to point out for example in all four of the fgr associations gelatinous zooplankton fgr 2 is the only invertebrate group found with mostly fishes fgr 4 showing that larger medusae are ecologically more similar to fishes than the smaller zooplankton e g copepods table 2 b pauly et al 2009 emphasize the need for better parametrization of jellyfish in ewe models it is also clear that members of the vertebrates category fgr 5 do not aggregate well suggesting that lumping reptiles birds and mammals into one category is functionally and ecologically too broad overall better resolution of food web groups as in the north sea model increases the interpretability of the fgr variable the binary habitat category was not sufficiently detailed to show significant association in either food web in fact most coefficient values fell into the middle region of the probability distribution suggesting a complete random pattern its consequence is that the binary habitat category is not helpful to characterize food web nodes in sufficient detail and therefore multiple habitat categories or a combination of traits should be used in agreement with the findings of costello et al 2015 for the combined coral reef networks all but one pair of variables are significantly associated for both coefficients the only exception being hab wi3 table 3 a the four reef networks are of similar size 18 23 nodes and resolution allowing examination of the pooled dataset indeed specific trophic groups e g sea turtles from different reefs were grouped together appendix top wi3 ranks entail nodes with direct and indirect effects while wdc quantifies the weighted centrality of a node within the network both weighted indices showed significant association with mobility variable table 3a as an example within the mob wi3 string drifters e g zooplankton mob 3 and sessile organisms e g benthic production mob 4 have top ranks while mobile groups mob 1 and mob 2 have negligible wi3 ranks in total 62 n 51 of nodes appeared to aggregate accordingly at the two extreme ends of the mob wi3 string the middle section n 31 38 is a mix of all four mobility categories containing groups that are not consistent across networks e g echinoderms appendix these groups in the middle have varying importance in the four reefs indicating that although reef nodes show several similarities e g benthic production drifters sea turtles these ecosystems have groups that remain unique the mob wdc association shows similar pattern with drifters being important and mobile groups found to have lower ranks low importance the fgr wi3 and fgr wdc associations were significant at p 0 001 for both coefficients table 3a and generally followed the same pattern producers fgr 1 and zooplankton fgr 2 occupying top ranks invertebrates fgr 3 and fishes fgr 4 in the middle and all other vertebrates grouped at the bottom fgr 5 the mob and fgr variables as in the previous two case studies are good indicators of positional importance by weighted network indices the habitat hab variable showed significant association with wdc but not with wi3 table 3a both indices are weighted but wi3 includes indirect effects up to 3 steps it appears that in reef networks weighted direct effects can be related to habitat structure but indirect effects are not well captured in the hab wi3 association in the hab wdc association 10 node long contiguous blocks appeared the association between these variables is difficult to interpret perhaps feeding guild groupings based on diet and life stages in relation to habitat would be a more appropriate trait in food web studies thompson et al 2020 no significant negative association i e segregation occurred in the reef networks the separate analysis of the four networks provided similar results confirming the conclusions derived from the evaluation of the pooled data see appendix for details we briefly discuss these findings here considering significance at p 0 05 fgr was significantly associated with wdc for all reefs and both coefficients and with wi3 for all but one case μ t for looe key sanctuary mob was significantly associated with wdc in all but one case the exception being μ t for the looe key sanctuary its association with wi3 proved significant in six cases exceptions are μ t for the great barrier reef and looe key sanctuary the trait of hab had the weakest association with the two indices similar to the combined data its only significant relationship is detected with wdc in the looe key sanctuary for both μ u and μ t 5 closing remarks the comparison between variables expressed on different scales has always been a challenge in statistical ecology because conventional measures of correlation and association are meaningless and therefore inapplicable this is particularly true if one variable is nominal while the other is a fully ranked ordinal one in this paper two radically different solutions are proposed demonstrating the enormous computational difficulties created by this problem the intuitive idea behind both strategies is nevertheless the same the starting point is that the relationship between two such variables is maximally positive when elements with the same nominal category appear as a contiguous block in the rank order a situation called aggregation the other extreme maximum negative relationship results when objects of a given nominal category fall as far as possible from one another in the sequence that is they are maximally segregated or overdispersed in this case the interplay amongst the different categories will eventually lead to a regularly alternating pattern of substrings in the rank order which is most conspicuous when all categories are represented by the same number of elements to express quantitatively where a given case is positioned between the two extremes two raw measures are suggested the first one is topological the number of other elements occurring between every possible pair of identical elements is counted and summed the second raw measure operates via the moving window technique the entire rank order is screened for all substrings of a given size the number of different nominal categories is found for each then summed these measures are transformed into the range 1 1 to ensure commensurability of results derived from different studies to achieve this one needs to determine the minimum and maximum raw values for the given combination of parameters the number of elements the number of categories and the number of elements in each for the topological measure the minimum is always zero whereas the lower bound of the diversity measure is obtained by a simple function if the number of elements in every category is not smaller than window size for determining the maximum values we conjecture that no compact formula can be derived instead two alternative procedures may be used an algorithmic sequence construction and monte carlo simulation to find an approximate maximum our experience suggests that these procedures give results with negligible differences and that the application of either one is sufficient for the purpose of standardization the sampling distributions of μ u and μ t were found to be very different the distribution of μ u is strongly right skewed and the mean is shifted considerably towards the left tail when the length of the string increases this is not so with μ t whose mean appears unaffected by the length of the string on the other hand this latter mean value is affected by window size with extreme maximum values attained when window size equals the number of nominal categories despite differences between the behaviour of these two functions they provided similar results when the significance of actual coefficient values was evaluated in all but two of the 36 pairs of variables we examined the results were consistent at p 0 05 we expect however that discrepancy between the two coefficients is deepened for longer strings being a global measure μ u approximates 1 because an increasing number of pairs of elements will enclose all other category types this is not so with μ t since it is based on examining the composition of short substrings that is a local condition one might conclude that the local measure is therefore more appropriate in general choice between the two coefficients is not that simple however as illustrated by the following examples s 1 1111111111112222222222222333333333333111111111 s 2 1111111111111111111112222222222222333333333333 the local measure shows only a slight difference between the s 1 and s 2 0 944 and 1 respectively contrary to the global measure 0 377 versus 1 which is apparently more sensitive to situations when elements of a given category appear in two distant blocks the use of both coefficients is therefore recommended and visual examination of strings cannot be avoided to reach meaningful conclusions currently these coefficients apply to fully ranked ordinal variables therefore further investigations are necessary to examine how ties influence the results and to extend their utility to such situations the use of association coefficients was applied to marine food webs for three different ecosystems estuary continental shelf reef specifically to find association between nominal biological traits and fully ranked ordinal network index variables significant positive association aggregation was found in all three cases whereas no negative association segregation was detected at all in all three ecosystems the mobility trait mob was consistently a good indicator of positional importance of certain trophic groups e g drifter organisms especially if paired with weighted network indices wdc or wi3 similarly other studies had the same conclusion and recommend using the mobility trait in marine ecosystems costello et al 2015 olmo gilabert et al 2019 mobility is a commonly used biological trait as it transcends over all taxa and the categories are well defined degen et al 2018 the functional group trait fgr was indicative of positional importance in the large network with greater resolution north sea and in the 4 reef networks taken together or examined separately depending on the ecosystem fgr was positively associated with the weighted index wi3 or with measures describing vertical food web structure k kdir kindir note its significant association with wdc for the reef networks either pooled or taken separately the fgr trait is a coarse categorization of trophic level which is a fundamental descriptor of any food web network and an important trait related to positional importance costello et al 2015 gravel et al 2016 the habitat hab category was only significantly associated with wdc and marginally significant for wi3 for the four concatenated network data the separate evaluation of reef networks revealed that the structure in the looe key sanctuary was solely responsible for this significant result these findings suggest limited applicability of the hab trait certain weighted indices and k components have been found to be clustered together in previous studies jordán et al 2006 endrédi et al 2021 thus their similar importance related to traits seems logical but needs more justification in other ecosystems using coefficients of association μ u μ t the most descriptive traits mob fgr and network metrics wi3 wdc were identified from a variety of combinations across different marine ecosystems when examining the strings positional outliers e g gelatinous zooplankton of ecological importance in marine food webs were found although network analysis is a great way to explore components of an ecosystem one should remember that it also has limitations it is highly dependant on the resolution of the data martinez 1993 and that traditional food webs provide a snapshot in space and time belgrano et al 2005 databases of ecological traits are quickly expanding e g fishbase froese and pauly 2021 sealifebase
