acclimatizing seed sludge to artificial wastewater and increasing levels of microorganisms associated with se removal as selenate reducers are reported to grow by anaerobic selenate respiration nancharaiah and lens 2015b 5 mm selenate was added in phase i to promote the growth of selenate reducers excessive sodium acetate levels of 1600 mg l doc were supplemented to form anoxic conditions by sbr oxygen consumption influent concentration of selenate and effluent concentrations of total and soluble se during start up phases phases i and ii are shown in fig 1 during phase i batch 1 negligible amounts of soluble se were removed in 7 days whereas soluble se removal at 56 65 was observed during batches 2 and 3 fig 1a along with soluble se removal sludge color varied to a red hue specific to elemental se fig 1b which confirmed the reduction of selenate to elemental se by contrast solid se in the effluent increased during phase i which resulted in a slight decline in total se removal from batch 2 to batch 3 therefore during phase ii batch 4 influent selenate concentration decreased from 5 mm to 1 mm which drastically improved the removal of soluble and solid se removal to above 98 and 72 respectively fig 1a monitoring temporal changes of soluble se during batch 6 revealed a maximum soluble se removal of 97 in 72 h data not shown in addition during phase ii sludge color changed from red to black fig 1b which might indicate the formation of immobilized elemental se as reported previously nancharaiah et al 2018 by contrast during the start up period the removal of acetate derived doc was always less than 16 data not shown achieving successful selenate removal during start up within a short period indicated that halotolerant selenate reducers existed in the seed sludge and could be enriched relatively readily the presence of halotolerant selenite reducers has been reported previously mishra et al 2011 and our earlier study clarified that they can be enriched from activated sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant under aerobic conditions without difficulty zhang et al 2019 by contrast this study clearly indicated that enrichment of halotolerant selenate reducers is possible under oxygen limiting conditions during the sbr start up period especially in batch 3 solid se remained at considerable concentrations in the effluent despite efficient removal of soluble se however this problem was solved by the decline of influent se concentration and consequently the start up of an sbr capable of removing selenate at a stable high ratio without flowing solid se was achieved 3 2 se treatment experiment since both soluble and solid se could be removed almost completely within 3 days in batch 6 phase ii the sbr was operated with a shorter cycle duration of 3 days from phase iii to phase vii during phases iii to vii the influent substrate acetate concentration was decreased gradually after confirming stable se removal since high substrate supplementation leads to increased cost not only for the substrate itself but also the doc removal post treatment it is important to identify appropriate substrate donation levels the performance of se and doc removal during phases iii to vii are shown in fig 2 during phase iii substrate was added at a doc concentration of 1600 mg l and soluble se was removed efficiently at 90 excepting temporal worsening in batch 31 which confirmed stable removal of soluble se by contrast solid se was detected in the effluent at 0 05 0 40 mm and total se removal efficiency was 76 12 although doc removal efficiency increased to 20 40 during the former part of phase iii it declined to around 10 after batch 30 the decline in doc removal efficiency might be associated with the decrease of soluble se removal observed in batch 31 and could have been caused by incomplete sealing of the flask during phases iv to vii where the influent concentration of doc was decreased to 1200 phase iv 800 phase v 400 phase vi and 200 mg l phase vii at intervals of 6 batches soluble se removal performance was maintained above 96 solid se concentration in the effluent was also maintained at 0 05 0 26 mm and above 80 total se removal was achieved in most batches the abnormally high solid se in the effluent in batch 60 might be caused by unsuitable placement of the sbr flask in the rotary shaker doc consumption during phases iv to vii was generally 100 200 mg l per batch fig s1 and doc removal efficiency varied largely with average removal efficiencies of 6 21 55 and 58 in phases iv v vi and vii respectively consequently high concentrations of doc remained in the effluent the results during phases iii to vii verified that soluble se can be removed from high salinity selenate wastewater stably with a high efficiency by sbr with acclimatized activated sludge it was also found that residual solid se in the effluent can be avoided by appropriately adjusting substrate concentrations further residual solid se can be easily removed by appropriate post treatment like chemical coagulation and filtration staicu et al 2015 thus the results demonstrated biological removal of selenate in high salinity wastewater for the first time organic substrate is an important factor that greatly affects the biological se removal process acetate used as the substrate in this study has been practically applied as a denitrification substrate dong et al 2017 gong et al 2013 and thus would be economically acceptable in wastewater treatment however even in phase vii with the lowest acetate supplementation 200 mg l as doc during which nearly 8 mm carbon on average was consumed along with nearly complete removal of 1 mm selenate in the influent acetate remained at considerable concentration in the effluent residual doc should be further removed by post treatment like subsequential aerobic biological treatment by activated sludge mal et al 2017 also exploration of alternative substrates could prove useful time courses of soluble se selenite and selenate in a batch cycle were monitored in batches 34 and 71 fig 3 during batch 34 selenate was gradually depleted in 70 h with little 0 1 mm selenite accumulation fig 3a in contrast selenate was reduced completely within 28 h during batch 71 with a partial accumulation of selenite which was further removed to an undetectable level within 48 h fig 3b more efficient se removal in batch 71 phase vii than in batch 34 phase iii might be due to further enrichment of microorganisms associated with se removal especially selenate reducers after the start up period or by the negative influence of excessive organic substrate on selenate reduction or total se removal although the reason for the difference in se removal levels between batches could not be identified the slight succession of bacterial communities as described below may support the former possibility soluble se time course monitoring verified that selenate and selenite reductions proceed synchronously biological reduction of selenate to selenite has been known to occur by anaerobic respiration under anoxic conditions thus it could be speculated that selenite removal also occurs under anoxic conditions which differs from our earlier study performing aerobic selenite removal in activated sludge zhang et al 2019 3 3 se mass balance to clarify the fate of selenate added to the sbr and removed from the water phase the se mass balance was investigated by monitoring the amount of se accumulated in the sludge in addition to soluble and solid se in the influent effluent and es discharged from the sbr se accumulation in the sludge was observed from batch 2 when detectable soluble se removal occurred which gradually increased to around 2800 mg l fig 2e figure 4 gives the cumulative se distribution during phases iii and vii soluble se that existed as selenate in the influent at the beginning of a batch cycle was transformed mostly to solid se namely elemental se for example during phase vii 82 of elemental se generated was accumulated in the sludge including 54 remaining in the sbr 28 removed as es and 12 present in the effluent these results indicated that the removal of soluble se selenate in the sbr occurred mainly by bioprecipitation namely in a series of reductive reactions from selenate to elemental selenium via selenite although the results of mass balance analysis during phase iii also inferred the possibility of biovolatilization its contribution to se removal from the water phase was minor if any biovolatilization of selenium has been reported to occur when protein substrates are supplemented thompson eagle and frankenberger 1990 zhang et al 2019 zhang and frankenberger 1999 and thus minimally occurred in this study where acetate was used as the substrate in contrast the amount of solid se discharged as es increased from 12 phase iii to 28 phase vii along with an increase of solid se accumulated in the sbr sludge nevertheless solid se in effluent decreased slightly from 20 phase iii to 12 phase vii this might be a result of generated se particle properties that settle easily and are resistant to suspension in the water phase a previous study has reported that elemental se was generated as nano particles and readily discharged from the reactor in fresh water whereas biogenic se was colloidally destabilized and was expected to settle faster in marine environments buchs et al 2013 3 4 characterization of sludge and se deposition the se mass balance study revealed that most soluble se removed was accumulated in the sludge as shown in fig 2e solid se in the sludge accounted for approximately 22 902 mg l of mlss concentration at 4050 mg l in batch 23 and 47 2577 mg l of mlss concentration at 5460 mg l in batch 69 respectively this indicated that biomass concentration was maintained stably at around 3000 mg l and that accumulation of solid se in the sludge increased throughout the sbr operation period the color change of the sludge to red during the start up period indicated the formation of amorphous se this resulted in poor sludge settleability and effluent containing relatively high concentrations of solid se thereafter sludge color change to black indicated the formation of crystalline se and excellent sludge settleability was maintained independently from the mlss concentration excepting the temporal worsening of settleability at batch 60 due to suspected equipment trouble in general activated sludge with mlss as high as 5000 mg l encountered difficulty in solid liquid separation thus it was suggested that enhancement of sludge settleability was attributable to the accumulation of solid se in the sludge as similar phenomena have been observed in previous studies jain et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 tem analysis was conducted to characterize the sludge se accumulation tem analysis of the sludge after phase vii where se was removed efficiently found that the particles most of which were confirmed to consist of se by stem edx were present mainly as large rods approximately 2 μm long fig 5 rod se particles were further confirmed by edx mapping of the same area fig s2 extremely large rod particles of above 10 μm were also observed which has never been reported before by contrast smaller nanospheres which have been reported as the major morphology of elemental selenium accumulated in aerobic granular sludge nancharaiah et al 2018 and activated sludge jain et al 2015 were rarely observed inside or at the surface of bacterial cells data not shown the formation of such large crystalline se particles in the sludge would strongly support good sludge settleability throughout the sbr operation period as reported previously jain et al 2015 although the reason for the formation of large crystalline se particles is unclear it might be a specific phenomenon for solid se formation from high se containing wastewater under high salinity conditions 3 5 sbr bacterial communities 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the nine sludge samples obtained 41 449 to 59 912 sequence reads per a sample 483 575 sequence reads in total which were further classified into 3 756 otus table 2 based on the otu number shannon diversity index and chao1 richness estimator the diversity of bacterial communities was highest in the seed sludge and phase i declined from phase i to phase vi and slightly increased from phase vi to phase vii the results clearly indicated the enrichment of bacterial populations associated with reduction and removal of se under high salinity conditions bacterial community composition at the phylum level is summarized in fig 6 overall phylum composition did not change greatly throughout the sbr operation period proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant phylum across all samples accounting for 49 69 of total populations the abundance of bacteroidetes increased during phase i but thereafter decreased along with the cultivation at the otu level 35 otus were abundantly detected 1 in at least one of the nine samples analyzed the most abundant representative otus are summarized in table 3 denovo9544 16 denovo22361 8 and denovo4423 5 were present in relatively high abundance in the seed sludge and were assigned to dermatophilaceae arcobacter and chromatiales respectively however their abundance declined following batch 3 phase i alternatively denovo2041 and denovo6468 which were assigned to marinobacterium and marinobacter respectively grew from previously undetectable levels in the seed sludge to highly dominant colonies of 42 and 11 in phase v batch 47 along with decreasing doc input the abundance of denovo2041 declined to 24 phase vii whereas denovo6468 maintained its increasing trend till the end of sbr operation the dominance of these halophilic bacteria would be attributable to the saline condition of the synthetic wastewater in this study also sulfur reducers denovo18020 and denovo3537 and a nitrate reducer denovo7316 were detected accounting for 7 and 6 of the total population in batch 92 phase vii throughout the sbr operation period in this study bacterial populations that have been previously reported as capable of reducing selenate selenite under saline conditions such as bacillus blum et al 1998 mishra et al 2011 and selenihalanaerobacter blum et al 2001 were never detected in addition our attempt by conventional cultivation methods could not isolate halotolerant bacteria with a strong selenate reducing ability that could explain the selenate removal performance observed in the sbr data not shown thus the bacterial populations responsible for se removal in the sbr were not identified in this study some of the predominant bacteria detected in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing such as marinobacterium and marinobacter might be associated with selenate reduction but are difficult to isolate by conventional cultivation methods another possibility would be cooperative selenate reduction by weak selenate reducers identification of responsible bacteria or clarification of the cooperative relationship for selenate reduction is an important factor for understanding se removal mechanisms and developing more efficient treatments of selenate containing saline wastewater under anoxic conditions 4 conclusions biological reduction of selenate in the presence of considerable salinity 3 w v nacl was demonstrated for the first time by sbr inoculated with activated sludge under oxygen limiting conditions soluble se removal above 96 and total se removal above 80 were achieved in most batches biologically reduced se was accumulated mainly as large rods in the sludge which contributed to good sludge settleability in contrast the considerable remaining doc concentrations following treatment even at the lowest acetate donation suggested the requirement of residual doc post treatment

threshold and taxonomic assignments were conducted using the greengenes database http greengenes secondgenome com details in data processing and methods for calculation of shannon diversity index and chao1 richness estimator were described previously takada et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 sbr start up during phases i and ii the sbr was started with a 7 day cycle duration with the aim of acclimatizing seed sludge to artificial wastewater and increasing levels of microorganisms associated with se removal as selenate reducers are reported to grow by anaerobic selenate respiration nancharaiah and lens 2015b 5 mm selenate was added in phase i to promote the growth of selenate reducers excessive sodium acetate levels of 1600 mg l doc were supplemented to form anoxic conditions by sbr oxygen consumption influent concentration of selenate and effluent concentrations of total and soluble se during start up phases phases i and ii are shown in fig 1 during phase i batch 1 negligible amounts of soluble se were removed in 7 days whereas soluble se removal at 56 65 was observed during batches 2 and 3 fig 1a along with soluble se removal sludge color varied to a red hue specific to elemental se fig 1b which confirmed the reduction of selenate to elemental se by contrast solid se in the effluent increased during phase i which resulted in a slight decline in total se removal from batch 2 to batch 3 therefore during phase ii batch 4 influent selenate concentration decreased from 5 mm to 1 mm which drastically improved the removal of soluble and solid se removal to above 98 and 72 respectively fig 1a monitoring temporal changes of soluble se during batch 6 revealed a maximum soluble se removal of 97 in 72 h data not shown in addition during phase ii sludge color changed from red to black fig 1b which might indicate the formation of immobilized elemental se as reported previously nancharaiah et al 2018 by contrast during the start up period the removal of acetate derived doc was always less than 16 data not shown achieving successful selenate removal during start up within a short period indicated that halotolerant selenate reducers existed in the seed sludge and could be enriched relatively readily the presence of halotolerant selenite reducers has been reported previously mishra et al 2011 and our earlier study clarified that they can be enriched from activated sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant under aerobic conditions without difficulty zhang et al 2019 by contrast this study clearly indicated that enrichment of halotolerant selenate reducers is possible under oxygen limiting conditions during the sbr start up period especially in batch 3 solid se remained at considerable concentrations in the effluent despite efficient removal of soluble se however this problem was solved by the decline of influent se concentration and consequently the start up of an sbr capable of removing selenate at a stable high ratio without flowing solid se was achieved 3 2 se treatment experiment since both soluble and solid se could be removed almost completely within 3 days in batch 6 phase ii the sbr was operated with a shorter cycle duration of 3 days from phase iii to phase vii during phases iii to vii the influent substrate acetate concentration was decreased gradually after confirming stable se removal since high substrate supplementation leads to increased cost not only for the substrate itself but also the doc removal post treatment it is important to identify appropriate substrate donation levels the performance of se and doc removal during phases iii to vii are shown in fig 2 during phase iii substrate was added at a doc concentration of 1600 mg l and soluble se was removed efficiently at 90 excepting temporal worsening in batch 31 which confirmed stable removal of soluble se by contrast solid se was detected in the effluent at 0 05 0 40 mm and total se removal efficiency was 76 12 although doc removal efficiency increased to 20 40 during the former part of phase iii it declined to around 10 after batch 30 the decline in doc removal efficiency might be associated with the decrease of soluble se removal observed in batch 31 and could have been caused by incomplete sealing of the flask during phases iv to vii where the influent concentration of doc was decreased to 1200 phase iv 800 phase v 400 phase vi and 200 mg l phase vii at intervals of 6 batches soluble se removal performance was maintained above 96 solid se concentration in the effluent was also maintained at 0 05 0 26 mm and above 80 total se removal was achieved in most batches the abnormally high solid se in the effluent in batch 60 might be caused by unsuitable placement of the sbr flask in the rotary shaker doc consumption during phases iv to vii was generally 100 200 mg l per batch fig s1 and doc removal efficiency varied largely with average removal efficiencies of 6 21 55 and 58 in phases iv v vi and vii respectively consequently high concentrations of doc remained in the effluent the results during phases iii to vii verified that soluble se can be removed from high salinity selenate wastewater stably with a high efficiency by sbr with acclimatized activated sludge it was also found that residual solid se in the effluent can be avoided by appropriately adjusting substrate concentrations further residual solid se can be easily removed by appropriate post treatment like chemical coagulation and filtration staicu et al 2015 thus the results demonstrated biological removal of selenate in high salinity wastewater for the first time organic substrate is an important factor that greatly affects the biological se removal process acetate used as the substrate in this study has been practically applied as a denitrification substrate dong et al 2017 gong et al 2013 and thus would be economically acceptable in wastewater treatment however even in phase vii with the lowest acetate supplementation 200 mg l as doc during which nearly 8 mm carbon on average was consumed along with nearly complete removal of 1 mm selenate in the influent acetate remained at considerable concentration in the effluent residual doc should be further removed by post treatment like subsequential aerobic biological treatment by activated sludge mal et al 2017 also exploration of alternative substrates could prove useful time courses of soluble se selenite and selenate in a batch cycle were monitored in batches 34 and 71 fig 3 during batch 34 selenate was gradually depleted in 70 h with little 0 1 mm selenite accumulation fig 3a in contrast selenate was reduced completely within 28 h during batch 71 with a partial accumulation of selenite which was further removed to an undetectable level within 48 h fig 3b more efficient se removal in batch 71 phase vii than in batch 34 phase iii might be due to further enrichment of microorganisms associated with se removal especially selenate reducers after the start up period or by the negative influence of excessive organic substrate on selenate reduction or total se removal although the reason for the difference in se removal levels between batches could not be identified the slight succession of bacterial communities as described below may support the former possibility soluble se time course monitoring verified that selenate and selenite reductions proceed synchronously biological reduction of selenate to selenite has been known to occur by anaerobic respiration under anoxic conditions thus it could be speculated that selenite removal also occurs under anoxic conditions which differs from our earlier study performing aerobic selenite removal in activated sludge zhang et al 2019 3 3 se mass balance to clarify the fate of selenate added to the sbr and removed from the water phase the se mass balance was investigated by monitoring the amount of se accumulated in the sludge in addition to soluble and solid se in the influent effluent and es discharged from the sbr se accumulation in the sludge was observed from batch 2 when detectable soluble se removal occurred which gradually increased to around 2800 mg l fig 2e figure 4 gives the cumulative se distribution during phases iii and vii soluble se that existed as selenate in the influent at the beginning of a batch cycle was transformed mostly to solid se namely elemental se for example during phase vii 82 of elemental se generated was accumulated in the sludge including 54 remaining in the sbr 28 removed as es and 12 present in the effluent these results indicated that the removal of soluble se selenate in the sbr occurred mainly by bioprecipitation namely in a series of reductive reactions from selenate to elemental selenium via selenite although the results of mass balance analysis during phase iii also inferred the possibility of biovolatilization its contribution to se removal from the water phase was minor if any biovolatilization of selenium has been reported to occur when protein substrates are supplemented thompson eagle and frankenberger 1990 zhang et al 2019 zhang and frankenberger 1999 and thus minimally occurred in this study where acetate was used as the substrate in contrast the amount of solid se discharged as es increased from 12 phase iii to 28 phase vii along with an increase of solid se accumulated in the sbr sludge nevertheless solid se in effluent decreased slightly from 20 phase iii to 12 phase vii this might be a result of generated se particle properties that settle easily and are resistant to suspension in the water phase a previous study has reported that elemental se was generated as nano particles and readily discharged from the reactor in fresh water whereas biogenic se was colloidally destabilized and was expected to settle faster in marine environments buchs et al 2013 3 4 characterization of sludge and se deposition the se mass balance study revealed that most soluble se removed was accumulated in the sludge as shown in fig 2e solid se in the sludge accounted for approximately 22 902 mg l of mlss concentration at 4050 mg l in batch 23 and 47 2577 mg l of mlss concentration at 5460 mg l in batch 69 respectively this indicated that biomass concentration was maintained stably at around 3000 mg l and that accumulation of solid se in the sludge increased throughout the sbr operation period the color change of the sludge to red during the start up period indicated the formation of amorphous se this resulted in poor sludge settleability and effluent containing relatively high concentrations of solid se thereafter sludge color change to black indicated the formation of crystalline se and excellent sludge settleability was maintained independently from the mlss concentration excepting the temporal worsening of settleability at batch 60 due to suspected equipment trouble in general activated sludge with mlss as high as 5000 mg l encountered difficulty in solid liquid separation thus it was suggested that enhancement of sludge settleability was attributable to the accumulation of solid se in the sludge as similar phenomena have been observed in previous studies jain et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 tem analysis was conducted to characterize the sludge se accumulation tem analysis of the sludge after phase vii where se was removed efficiently found that the particles most of which were confirmed to consist of se by stem edx were present mainly as large rods approximately 2 μm long fig 5 rod se particles were further confirmed by edx mapping of the same area fig s2 extremely large rod particles of above 10 μm were also observed which has never been reported before by contrast smaller nanospheres which have been reported as the major morphology of elemental selenium accumulated in aerobic granular sludge nancharaiah et al 2018 and activated sludge jain et al 2015 were rarely observed inside or at the surface of bacterial cells data not shown the formation of such large crystalline se particles in the sludge would strongly support good sludge settleability throughout the sbr operation period as reported previously jain et al 2015 although the reason for the formation of large crystalline se particles is unclear it might be a specific phenomenon for solid se formation from high se containing wastewater under high salinity conditions 3 5 sbr bacterial communities 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the nine sludge samples obtained 41 449 to 59 912 sequence reads per a sample 483 575 sequence reads in total which were further classified into 3 756 otus table 2 based on the otu number shannon diversity index and chao1 richness estimator the diversity of bacterial communities was highest in the seed sludge and phase i declined from phase i to phase vi and slightly increased from phase vi to phase vii the results clearly indicated the enrichment of bacterial populations associated with reduction and removal of se under high salinity conditions bacterial community composition at the phylum level is summarized in fig 6 overall phylum composition did not change greatly throughout the sbr operation period proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant phylum across all samples accounting for 49 69 of total populations the abundance of bacteroidetes increased during phase i but thereafter decreased along with the cultivation at the otu level 35 otus were abundantly detected 1 in at least one of the nine samples analyzed the most abundant representative otus are summarized in table 3 denovo9544 16 denovo22361 8 and denovo4423 5 were present in relatively high abundance in the seed sludge and were assigned to dermatophilaceae arcobacter and chromatiales respectively however their abundance declined following batch 3 phase i alternatively denovo2041 and denovo6468 which were assigned to marinobacterium and marinobacter respectively grew from previously undetectable levels in the seed sludge to highly dominant colonies of 42 and 11 in phase v batch 47 along with decreasing doc input the abundance of denovo2041 declined to 24 phase vii whereas denovo6468 maintained its increasing trend till the end of sbr operation the dominance of these halophilic bacteria would be attributable to the saline condition of the synthetic wastewater in this study also sulfur reducers denovo18020 and denovo3537 and a nitrate reducer denovo7316 were detected accounting for 7 and 6 of the total population in batch 92 phase vii throughout the sbr operation period in this study bacterial populations that have been previously reported as capable of reducing selenate selenite under saline conditions such as bacillus blum et al 1998 mishra et al 2011 and selenihalanaerobacter blum et al 2001 were never detected in addition our attempt by conventional cultivation methods could not isolate halotolerant bacteria with a strong selenate reducing ability that could explain the selenate removal performance observed in the sbr data not shown thus the bacterial populations responsible for se removal in the sbr were not identified in this study some of the predominant bacteria detected in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing such as marinobacterium and marinobacter might be associated with selenate reduction but are difficult to isolate by conventional cultivation methods another possibility would be cooperative selenate reduction by weak selenate reducers identification of responsible bacteria or clarification of the cooperative relationship for selenate reduction is an important factor for understanding se removal mechanisms and developing more efficient treatments of selenate containing saline wastewater under anoxic conditions 4 conclusions biological reduction of selenate in the presence of considerable salinity 3 w v nacl was demonstrated for the first time by sbr inoculated with activated sludge under oxygen limiting conditions soluble se removal above 96 and total se removal above 80 were achieved in most batches biologically reduced se was accumulated mainly as large rods in the sludge which contributed to good sludge settleability in contrast the considerable remaining doc concentrations following treatment even at the lowest acetate donation suggested the requirement of residual doc post treatment

18991,cost effective pretreatment of the highly concentrated and biorefractory coking wastewater to improve biodegradability is of significant importance while green electrochemical technologies without external chemicals addition are charming but still challenging due to its high energy consumption in this work a novel multi stages flow through peroxi coagulation pc was for the first time developed with graphite felt cathode modified by graphene showing an excellent performance in removal of 71 5 cod 72 3 phenol and 59 4 nh3 n and significant biodegradability enhancement with a low energy consumption as 1 2 kwh m3 compared with conventional flow pc this process was more cost effective due to more intensive oh production and higher utilization of generated active species through uv spectrophotometry and gc ms analysis the improvement of biodegradability was attributed to the reduction of both low and high molecular weight compounds content in the coking wastewater comparing to the electro fenton electrocoagulation and ozonation process the proposed pc process was highly cost effective providing a promising and new alternative for pretreatment of coking wastewater keywords peroxi coagulation coking wastewater biodegradability graphene modified cathode flow through 1 introduction coal is the main energy resource in china at present approximately 0 3 billion tons coking wastewater which are generated from coal gas purification coal coking and by product refinement are produced in china every year lai et al 2007 na et al 2017 the discharged cod of coking wastewater accounted for 1 3 of the total wastewater in 2009 based on the chinese environmental statistics chu et al 2012 moreover since the composition of coking wastewater is very complex highly concentrated and toxic it has become a serious environmental problem and is urgently needed to deal with kim et al 2008 lai et al 2007 liu et al 2012 many previous studies report that the biodegradability of coking wastewater is extremely low indicating the conventional biological methods such as sequencing batch reactor sbr anoxic oxic a o and anaerobic anoxic oxic a1 a2 o are not effective for the treatment of this kind of wastewater zhang et al 1998 bai et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to improve the biodegradability and reduce the organic load of coking wastewater before its discharge into the municipal wastewater treatment plants in order to achieve this objective various pretreatment methods have been attempted such as adsorption zhang et al 2010 membrane filtration mf salehi et al 2014 ultrasonic irradiation ning et al 2005 and catalytic wet oxidation cwo chen et al 2012 however the harsh operating conditions and requirements on equipment used for processes like cwo and mf have brought heavy economic burden and impediments to practical application therefore development of an efficient economical and practical pretreatment method is of significant importance advanced oxidation processes aops have witnessed a remarkable development for the degradation of biorefractory and toxic organics during the last fifteen years brillas et al 2009 steter et al 2018 among various aops fenton process has attracted great interests due to the generation of hydroxyl radical oh via classic fenton reaction eq 1 oh represents a strong oxidant with high standard redox potential able to mineralize most of organic contaminants in situ electro generation of h2o2 at cathode via oxygen reduction reaction eq 2 gives rise to the electro fenton ef process in the presence of ferrous ion it can avoid the risks and costs in the transport and storage of h2o2 and thus largely reduce the adding amount of fe2 comparing to the traditional fenton process due to its electrochemical regeneration reaction eq 3 ridruejo et al 2018 thiam et al 2015 1 h 2 o 2 f e 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 3 f e 3 e f e 2 for most of the ef system using boron doped diamond bdd pt and sno2 anode ridruejo et al 2018 thiam et al 2014 2015 catalyst such as fe2 is externally added to the system in this regards this in situ electro generation of catalyst in ef process is of a significant interest from the practical application point of view simplifying process control and saving operational costs moreover the peroxi coagulation pc process represents an enhanced ef utilizing sacrificial anode which simultaneously generate in situ h2o2 eq 2 on the cathode and fe2 by dissolving iron anode by reaction 4 brillas et al 2003 besides the excessive fe3 present in the solution after reaction 1 precipitates in the form of fe oh 3 thus organic pollutants can be removed by the combined action of oxidation eq 1 and coagulation ren et al 2018 4 f e f e 2 2 e until now quite a few works focusing on pc process have been reported showing effectiveness in the removal of various pollutants such as aniline brillas and juan 2002 acrylonitrile ren et al 2018 2 4 5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid boye et al 2003a b and chlorophenoxy brillas et al 2003 in the electrolyte with high conductivity unfortunately pc treatment of the coking wastewater one of the highly concentrated and biorefractory wastewaters has so far never been reported in addition the previous pc works mainly focused on 1 the development of cathodes for high performance in h2o2 production such as carbon sponge graphite felt carbon nanotubes gas diffusion electrode and activated carbon fiber 2 the removal of various pollutants and their removal mechanism moreover most of pc studies were conducted in an undivided cell brillas et al 2003 salari et al 2009 and not much attention has been paid to the continuous flow pc reactor design and operation though it represents an important topic and is closely related to the process efficiency and costs from viewpoint of practical application accelerated reaction rate and improved efficiency can be obtained in flow through system owing to the enhanced mass transfer ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a so that efficiency of the pollutants degradation was further increased ren et al 2016 vecitis et al 2011 therefore flow through cells have been used in studying of electro oxidation gao and vecitis 2011 electrodialysis vaselbehagh et al 2015 electro fenton ren et al 2016 and electro peroxone zhang et al 2018b processes however to the authors best knowledge no systematic study of the flow through pc reactor for real wastewater treatment was undertaken so far moreover most of the previous intermittent and circulating flow pc experiments were conducted in the simulated wastewater with high conductivity 0 05 m na2so4 or 7280 us cm using a high current densities 33 33 ma cm2 to obtain the favorable efficiency boye et al 2003a b brillas et al 2003 unfortunately the conductivity of the real coking wastewater is relatively low 2000 3000 μs cm lai et al 2007 zhu et al 2009 and the electric energy consumption would sharply increase if a high current density was applied therefore in order to achieve the purpose of low energy consumption and high efficiency a multi stages flow through pc system was firstly established to pretreat coking wastewater at low current density 1 42 8 57 ma cm2 and compared with that of the single stage one using chemical oxygen demand cod nh3 n phenols and bod5 cod as indicators the objectives of this study are 1 to characterize flow through single stage pc and multi stages pc process and compare its performance with the traditional cells 2 to investigate the effect of various construction and operational parameters on the treatment performance e g cod removal biodegradability enhancement 3 to explore the possible degradation mechanism of the main pollutants including the fate of n this works would shed light on the efficient pretreatment of coking wastewater by multi stages flow through pc process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and real wastewater used the graphene was synthesized by the electrochemical exfoliation method yang et al 2017 the commercial carbon black and graphite felt were received from shanghai hesen electric company the graphene modified cathode was prepared as described in details in our previous study ren et al 2016 the holes with a diameter of 2 mm was evenly distributed on the perforated iron plate and dsa which were used as the anodes in the pc and ef process respectively and purchased from baoji changli company the raw coking wastewater was collected from a coking factory located in henan province china the quality of the wastewater is

conductivity is 3210 μs cm this wastewater was directly used by the pc process without addition of any electrolytes e g sodium sulfate 2 2 experimental procedure the perforated iron plates and graphene based graphite felt were used as the anode and cathode in a multi stages pc reactor 2 or 3 stages and the cathode was positioned below the anode fig 1 the electrode area of anode and cathode was the same with the value of about 7 0 cm2 the distance between the anode and cathode was 8 mm in each stage the pollutants firstly penetrated the cathode and then flowed through the anode the wastewater and pumped air flowed through the multi stages reactor in sequence in other words the effluent from the previous stage could be seen as the influent of the following stage in contrast the pollutants flow parallel with the electrodes surface in the conventional flow pc and the schematic diagram of the conventional pc process was shown in fig s1 in flow through ef process the perforated dsa and graphene based graphite felt were used as the anode and cathode respectively in flow through electrocoagulation ec process the perforated iron and stainless plate were used as the anode and

single stage flow through pc and conventional flow pc at ph 8 74 flow rate of 3 5 ml min and current density of 8 6 ma cm2 the effluent cod in flow through pc system was reduced to 1389 1532 mg l which was significantly lower than that by the conventional flow pc system 1712 1987 mg l fig 2a similar enhancement in phenol and ammonia n removal efficiency was observed in fig 2b in which they were 51 8 and 41 8 in flow through cell much higher than that in the conventional flow pc system 38 8 and 27 6 besides the biodegradability of the coking wastewater was clearly improved after the treatment by these two processes while the bod5 cod b c increased more obviously from 0 09 to 0 28 by the flow through pc system the aforementioned results indicated that flow through pc system had the better performance in the removal of cod phenol ammonia n and enhancement in biodegradability further calculation demonstrated the eec of flow through pc system was 0 90 kwh m3 which was only 63 0 of that in conventional flow pc indicating it was more cost effective for the treatment of coking wastewater table 1 this effect would be explained by two factors on one hand the higher current efficiency was obtained in the flow through pc reactor with the value of 86 9 compared with the corresponding value of 72 1 in the conventional flow pc reactor resulting in the higher presence of fe2 in the former system 258 6 mg l this effect could be explained by the electrode passivation as a consequence of accumulation of the anode dissolution products ren et al 2018 which was largely reduced in flow through system due to the reduced prandtl hydrodynamic layer at the anode surface in other words the passivation of anode in the conventional flow pc reactor resulted in the reduced current efficiency on the other hand a higher h2o2 production was achieved in flow through system compared with the conventional flow this results was in agreement with our previous works ma et al 2016 therefore the higher h2o2 and fe2 resulted in a higher amount of oh 21 7 μm in flow through pc system than that in conventional flow 17 4 μm table 1 leading to a higher removal performance these advantages of the flow through pc system were further mechanistically explored through lsv and eis analysis lsv showed that an improved current response was obtained by flow through process compared with the conventional flow one fig 2c thus it could be concluded that the electron transfer was accelerated in the former process yu et al 2015 simulated eis resistance and capacitance values were fitted by equivalent circuit model fig s2 chen et al 2014 and listed in table 1 the rs of flow through and conventional flow was 14 7 and 15 3 ω respectively the lower rs facilitated the increased current response in the region of high current loads which was in agreement with the lsv analysis the charger and mass transfer of oxygen and organic molecules to electrode surface were obviously improved in flow through since the rct and wmt were 2 3 and 4 8 times smaller compared with the conventional one with the values of 94 81 and 0 51 ω respectively moreover the cpedl of the flow through and conventional pc process were 203 8 and 1128 μf respectively the lower cpedl was conducive to the rapid replenishment of the organic molecules due the reduced debye length liu et al 2014 consequently the better performance of flow through pc process could be attributed to the accelerated mass and electron transfer as proved by eis and lsv analysis 3 2 advantages of the multi stages flow through pc process advantages of the multi stages flow through pc process were illustrated by a comparison between the three stages each of 20 ma and the single stage 60 ma flow through pc system under the conditions of the same total current charged as shown in fig 3 after three stages of pc process the effluent cod was 1216 mg l which was clearly lower than that in the single stage process 1563 mg l fig 3a besides the removal efficiency of phenol and nh3 n were 58 4 and 51 5 respectively both higher than those in single stage system 51 8 and 41 6 fig 3b in terms of the biodegradability although the biodegradability of the effluent in single stage pc system was greatly improved compared with the raw coking wastewater b c still did not reach 0 30 suggesting that the effluent was still non biodegradable in contrast b c of the effluent in three stages system increased with the increase of stage numbers fig 3c and the effluent of the third stage was biodegradable b c reached value of 0 31 each stage in the three stages pc was performed at much lower current compared with the single stage system which could effectively avoid the occurrence of parasitic reactions such as o2 evolution resulting in the higher production of active species ren et al 2018 salazar et al 2017 for example the iron dissolution at 20 ma was 95 0 mg l with a corresponding current efficiency of 95 7 while the current efficiency at 60 ma was only 86 9 fig s5 besides fig 3d shows that the higher total generated oh was obtained by three stages 22 6 μm using the lower current of 20 ma the applied current of each stage is 20 ma compared with single stage system 21 5 μm using the higher current of 60 ma due to the higher h2o2 production fig s3 and current efficiency in former system most importantly the higher utilization of active species was achieved using the lower current in the pc process in single stage system 21 5 μm oh was generated at 60 ma of which only 63 7 oh was consumed meaning 36 3 oh had not been effectively utilized before they reacted with the target molecules although only 7 9 μm oh was generated at 20 ma in the first stage pc system the consumed oh accounted for 78 6 of the total generated oh indicating the utilization of oh at low current was higher than that at high current condition in summary 77 7 oh 17 5 μm was consumed in three stages system which was clearly higher than that in single stage system with the value of 63 7 13 8 μm the higher utilization of oh indicated that more oh were involved in oxidation reaction resulting in the better performance in three stages pc system in addition as for the energy consumption the eec of the single stage pc system performed at high current of 60 ma was 1 0 kwh m3 which was 2 2 times of that of three stages system 0 48 kwh m3 fig 3b therefore the above analysis suggested that this multi stages pc system performed at low current is a promising and cost effective method for the pre treatment of the coking wastewater 3 3 the important parameters in the multi stages pc system 3 3 1 impact of solution ph the ph of the coking wastewater is in the range of 7 2 11 chu et al 2012 lai et al 2007 yu et al 2016 zhu et al 2009 thus the impact of ph on this pc process was investigated since the ph of effluent from coke plant can vary within a certain range after adjustment the initial ph of raw wastewater to 5 7 and 11 respectively a portion of cod was removed and the corresponding b c slightly increased fig 4 a and fig 4b this was because the formation of a large amount of precipitates in the process of acidification and alkalization resulting in the reduction of suspended matters and pollutants the precipitation phenomenon might be related to the addition of h or oh into the coking wastewater causing the grafting copolymerization destabilization and electric charge neutralization between colloidal particles due to the compression of electric double layer or destruction potential of the colloid liu et al 2012 fig 4 shows that a comparable cod phenol and nh3 n removal was obtained at ph 7 and 8 74 without adjustment of ph but the b c of effluent at ph 8 74 was largely increased compared to that at ph 7 in comparison the removal performance became poorer at lower and higher ph of 5 and 11 even though a portion of cod have been removed through the adjustment of ph for example the removal efficiency of cod phenol and nh3 n were 55 5 57 9 and 48 7 respectively at ph 11 this is much lower than that at ph 7 with the corresponding value of 75 2 74 0 and 62 3 meanwhile the b c of effluent at ph 7 0 38 was clearly higher than that at ph of 5 0 34 and 11 0 31 this effect could be attributed to the fact that fe oh 3 precipitates were hardly generated since the iron ions were stable in the solution at ph 5 and oh was poorly produced through the fenton reaction eq 1 at ph 11 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 besides the above results suggested that the synergistic effect of fe oh 3 precipitates and oh was most significant at ph 7 which was in agreement with the reported work ren et al 2018 moreover it was observed form fig 4d that the ph of the effluent increased at initial ph 7 and 5 and it decreased at initial ph 8 74 and 11 this was explained by the h2 and o2 evolution becoming dominant at ph 7 and ph 7 respectively it could be inferred that the effective performance at the wide ph ranges of 5 11 was closely related to the above ph change trend therefore this pc process was resistant to the ph variation of the coking wastewater and has great potential for the practical application 3 3 2 impact of the applied current load as shown in fig 5 although the amount of removed cod decreased from stage to stage in a consecutive order in multi stages pc reactor the relative removal efficiency of each pc stage was at the same level fig 5a for example about 829 5 mg l cod was removed by the first pc stage at 40 ma which was much higher than that in the second stage 631 7 mg l and the third stage 406 5 mg l however the cod removal efficiency in the first second and third pc stage was 37 2 36 7 and 34 5 respectively when the effluent of the previous stage was chosen as the influent of this stage this documents that the removal ability of each stage was approximately same in the multi stages pc system it can be concluded that in the system under investigation the removal of cod phenol and nh3 n increased as the current increased from 10 to 60 ma the larger amount of precipitates fe oh 3 and higher generation of oh could be obtained at higher current brillas et al 2003 ren et al 2018 resulting in the following sequence by taking the phenol removal as an example 10 ma 26 7 20 ma 59 2 30 ma 63 6 40 ma 78 2 50 ma 83 7 60 ma 86 3 however it was worth noting that cod phenol and nh3 n removal only increased by 263 3 mg l 8 1 and 9 4 respectively when the current improved from 40 to 60 ma whereas the corresponding value was 482 6 mg l 19 0 and 19 4 respectively when the current improved from 20 to 40 ma the above phenomenon could be explained by the h2o2 being consumed by excessive fe3 produced via reaction 4 and 7 leading to generation of a much weaker oxidant ho2 rather than oh eq 8 at higher current ridruejo et al 2018 besides some competitive reactions such as h2 and o2 evolution reaction become intensified when the applied current increase they compete with formation of the fe oh 3 and active species such as oh in the pc process 10 f e 2 o h f e 3 o h 11 f e 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 f e 2 h also biodegradability of the coking wastewater gradually improved with the number of stages increasing fig 5c when the current was higher than 40 ma the effluents of the second pc stage had met requirement of biodegradability b c 0 3 for example the b c of the first pc stage was only 0 24 at 60 ma this value increased to 0 48 and 0 65 during the second and third step respectively thus the above analysis indicates the multi stages pc system to be an ideal treatment of the coking wastewater with varying organic loading the number of stage has to be adjusted according the concrete situation in order to obtain optimal performance for the practical application in addition as for the electrochemical treatment technologies energy consumption is one of the major concerns as shown in fig 5d the eec in the latter pc stage was higher than that in the previous stages for example the eec of each pc stage at 50 ma was ranked as follows the first 0 8 kwh kg cod the second 0 9 kwh kg cod the third stage 1 8 kwh kg cod as expected the eec increased together with the increasing current load fig 5d consequently the current efficiency decreased as the current load increased from 10 ma to 60 ma insert fig 5d the ace of pc system under all current conditions exceeded 100 and the maximum efficiencies could reach 3165 9 for instance about 594 5 mg l cod was removed by the first stage pc system under the condition of 20 ma 3 5 ml min the corresponding current efficiency was 2091 3 according to eq 7 such amazing current efficiency has never been reported so far it has to be attributed to the significant advantages of this multi stages flow through pc system as discussed above the reason why the ace exceeded 100 was closely related to the calculation of ace the direct anodic oxidation was considered to be an exclusive mechanism of the cod removal from eq 7 ye et al 2016 however majority of cod was removed by the coupled actions such as sorption on precipitates and oxidation by oh rather than only direct anodic oxidation account for a high removal improvement of biodegradability high current efficiency and relative low eec 40 ma was regarded as the best current load in presently used setup 3 3 3 impact of the treated water flow rate and stage numbers water flux and removal performance which determines the application prospects of the treatment method are equally important for continuous flow systems thus the influence of flow rate was studied in the range of 3 5 ml min to 7 0 ml min the lower removal of cod phenol and nh3 n were obtained at higher flow rate as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b for example 50 4 cod 48 8 phenol and 34 7 nh3 n were removed at high flow rate of 7 0 ml min whereas the corresponding value were 74 5 78 0 and 62 4 respectively at low flow rate of 3 5 ml min the above results could be related to the hydraulic retention time hrt which decreased as the flow rate increased resulting in the lower dosage of precipitates fe oh 3 and oh this subsequently caused lower cod removal and the biodegradability improvement fig 6c on the other hand however it is observed in fig 6d that the cod removal flux increases with increasing flow rate for the flow rate of 3 5 4 5 6 0 and 7 0 ml min the corresponding removal flux has reached 3135 9 3817 4 4294 4 and 4443 0 mg min 1m 2 respectively in contrast the lower eec was obtained at higher flow rate for example the eec at high flow rate of 6 0 ml min 0 9 kwh m3 was lower than that at 3 5 ml min 1 5 kwh m3 fig 6d suggests that 7 0 ml min would be the best condition based on the removal flux and eec however the removal performance was very poor and the effluents of the third stage was still non biodegradable b c was only 0 24 fig 6c besides although the high removal performance was obtained at 3 5 ml min and the b c of the effluents in the second stage could reach 0 44 fig 6c the removal flux was much low and the eec was pretty high compared with others consequently the flow rate of 4 5 6 0 ml min would be optimum flow rate in addition this work demonstrated that a much better performance in removal and energy consumption were obtained by multi stages pc compared with single stage pc system thus the impact of stage number was further investigated as shown in fig s4 the effluent cod continued to decrease in the first three stages and then gradually reached steady state in the last two stages the removed cod in each pc stage was 715 3 607 4 426 5 166 8 and 54 1 mg l respectively in the five stages pc system compared to three stages pc only 220 9 mg l cod was further removed by five stages pc system however the energy consumption is 7 54 times that of the former the eec of the three stages pc was 0 9 kwh kg cod whereas the ecc sharply increased to 6 9 kwh kg cod in the five stages pc system fig s4 therefore the three stages pc system was a better choice based on the comprehensive consideration of removal performance and the energy consumption and this study also indicated that the number of stages can be adjusted according to the treated wastewater to achieve the ideal performance 3 4 degradation mechanism analysis 3 4 1 uv vis spectrophotometry fig 7 a shows the uv vis spectrum of the raw wastewater and effluent of each pc stage the similar trend in the absorption peaks of raw wastewater and effluents between 220 and 600 nm was observed but the intensity of peaks clearly decreased with the increase of pc stages besides there were two major and distinct absorption peaks at 270 and 310 nm in each sample which were ascribed to the light absorption by low molecular weight lmw compounds such as phenols and high molecular weight compounds hmw such as dimethyl phthalate respectively yu et al 2016 helms et al 2008 thus the apparent decrease of the peaks at 270 and 310 nm indicated that both the low and high molecular weight organics were largely removed by pc process moreover the variation in the relative size of molecules is closely related with the ratio of absorption at 250 365 nm e2 e3 john et al 2008 yu et al 2016 it can be seen form fig 7b that e2 e3 increased with the increase of pc stage suggesting the decrease of the molecular size of contaminants in the effluent these results were supported by the removal efficiency of phenol one of lmw organics in each pc stage fig 7b and the almost complete removal of dimethyl phthalate one of hmw organics through the gc ms analysis in addition the uv absorption at 254 nm is normalized to the dissolved organic carbon which can be seen as an indicator called the specific uv aromaticity suva254 strongly related to the aromaticity of the dissolved organic matters weishaar et al 2003 yu et al 2016 helms et al 2008 it was observed that the suva254 decreased with the increase of pc stages fig 7b suggesting a decrease of the effluent s aromaticity 3 4 2 the fate of n in the wastewater fig 7c shows the fate of n in the coking wastewater for this multi stages pc process the tn contained in the coking wastewater consists of ammonia nitrogen nh3 nitrate ion no3 nitrite ion no2 and organic nitrogen such as isoquinoline and indole see the gc ms analysis the concentration of tn continuously decreased from 371 3 to 286 7 mg l with the number of pc stage increasing fig 7c the loss of n in the wastewater could be explained by the generation of volatile intermediates such as nxoy and n2 which could be generated through the oxidation reaction between nh3 and formed oh in the pc process ridruejo et al 2018 this explanation was supported by the large reduction of nh3 in the wastewater from 285 6 to 113 8 mg l following the similar trend as tn fig 7c in contrast the content of no3 in the system constantly increased from 10 5 to 17 6 mg l as the number of stage increasing this was attributed to the nh3 oxidation or conversion of organic nitrogen compounds in the process lai et al 2009 the concentration of no2 in the effluents remained stable at a very low level ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 mg l nevertheless the difference between the initial tn and inorganic nitrogen nh3 no3 and no2 content in the solution was 75 0 mg l after three stages pc treatment this difference was doubled to 155 1 mg l the organic nitrogen content became larger because of the removal of the inorganic nitrogen and the formation of organic n derivatives such as metacetamol and 3 aminophenol at the same time see the gc ms analysis 3 4 3 reaction mechanism for pollutant removal in order to explore the cod removal mechanism the following experiments were performed fig 8 a shows that cod was hardly removed by adsorption without electric charge passing and without air aeration in the multi stages pc process in the first 30 min obtaining the cod removal in the first second and third pc stage of 1 1 1 2 and 1 5 respectively purging with n2 was used to inhibit the generation of h2o2 under electric charge passing in which cod can be removed by ec with the action of formed precipitate of fe oh 3 and adsorption on its surface from 40 to 70 min ma et al 2016 ren et al 2018 the removal of cod by ec in the first second and third pc stage reached 17 0 23 8 and 31 0 respectively next o2 pumped into pc system rather than n2 under continuous operation from 80 to 110 min the pollutants was removed by the combined action of ec and ef the difference between the standard pc system and that purging with n2 showed the contribution of oh to the cod removal the corresponding value are 13 3 28 5 and 39 2 for the first second and third stage respectively in summary it could be concluded that cod in the coking wastewater was removed by the action of pc but negligible adsorption to further explore the mechanism of biodegradability improvement gc ms analysis of the treated wastewater samples was conducted the dominant organic compounds of the raw wastewater were phenols esters and nitrogen containing organic which accounting for about 97 0 of the total compounds table s2 the degradation pathway of five representative substances with high relative contents was analyzed based on the detected intermediates as shown in fig 8b phenol and 2 methyl phenol were converted to hydroquinone and 2 methylbenzoquinone by hydroxylation respectively the transformation route of dimethyl phthalate was initiated by the generation of phthalic acid and then further sequentially oxidized to phthalic anhydride phthalan and 2 methylbenzoic acid by the reaction with oh besides metacetamol mat and 1 2h isoquinolinone iql was formed from indole and isoquinoline due to the cleavage of nitrogen heterocycle under the attack of oh then combined action of hydroxylation and hydrogenation in pc process ren et al 2018 mat and iql were converted to 3 aminophenol and p hydroxyphenylacetoaldoxime which was further converted to phenol by deamination next these aromatic rings were broken to form some short chain carboxylic acids such as maleic acid 2 heptenoic acid oxalic acid acetic acid and formic acid finally they were mineralized to co2 and h2o in addition the removal of toc phenol 2 methyl phenol dimethyl phthalate indole and isoquinoline reached 48 0 75 8 94 6 86 7 74 6 and 62 6 respectively after three stages pc treatment according to gc ms analysis fig s6 in summary it can be concluded that the improvement of the biodegradability was attributed to the mineralization of the significant portion of the phenolic esters and nitrogen containing organic contaminants content and due to the complete removal of the recalcitrant pollutants such as pyrene fig s6 3 5 stability assessment of the multi stages flow through pc system the stability of this multi stages flow through pc system was further investigated since the stable operation was rather critical for practical applications six times consecutive pc process using this multi stages flow through reactor were performed fig 9 a indicated that the cod removal were almost stable during the 6 times runs although the cod removal efficiency in the sixth run slightly decreased to 66 6 compared with the first time 72 3 besides a stable and efficient cathode is of significant importance to the stable operation of the pc process thus the h2o2 production of graphite felt cathode was evaluated after each pc experiment as shown in fig 9b the performance in h2o2 production of this modified graphite felt cathode was very stable in the range of 156 2 168 7 mg l after 6 continuous pc runs moreover this multi stages flow through pc system was operated over 5 h to evaluate its stability of effluent quality after long term running the h2o2 production of the first second and third stage remained stable and kept around 62 117 and 169 mg l respectively in the long term operation suggesting this modified graphite felt cathode was very stable which was in agreement with our previous works yang et al 2017 ma et al 2016 fig 9c indicated that effluent of this multi stages flow through pc system kept almost stable after 5 h running although there were slight fluctuations in the effluent cod of each pc stage this would reduce the cathode regeneration or replacing cost the above results demonstrated that both modified cathode and operational system were stable which ensured that this work had good potential application for the pretreatment of the coking wastewater 3 6 performance comparison of multi stages flow through pc with other pretreatment technologies various technologies have been used to pretreat the coking wastewater such as electrocoagulation ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 electro fenton zhu et al 2011 and ozonation zhang et al 2014 to evaluate the performance of different technologies for pretreatment of coking wastewater the flow through pc ec ef and ozonation in this multi stages system was comparably performed as shown in fig 10 although the b c of the coking wastewater treated by pc and ozonation exceeded 0 3 meaning the both effluent were biodegradable the lower removal of cod 41 2 phenol 43 2 and nh3 n 35 4 and higher eec 7 6 kwh kg cod were obtained by ozonation compared with the pc process with the corresponding value of 72 5 71 4 and 58 3 and 2 1 kwh kg cod it was observed that the cod phenol and nh3 n removal the b c of the effluent and the eec by the ef process were 19 6 15 2 and 9 8 0 2 and 6 8 kwh kg cod which indicated that ef was not suitable for the pretreatment of the coking wastewater due to the poor performance and high eec performance of ec was found to be significantly better than ef but the pc process combining the action of ec and ef showed clearly superior performance based on the electrical energy price in china 0 066 kwh the treatment cost of pc 0 14 kg cod was clearly lower than that in ec 0 23 kg cod ef 0 45 kg cod and ozonation 0 50 kg cod process besides this pc process showed better performance in removal improvement of biodegradability and treatment cost energy compared with the peer works table s3 all the results suggested that pc process was the best choice for the pretreatment of the coking wastewater 4 conclusions in this work cod phenol and nh3 n contained in the coking wastewater were effectively removed by a novel multi stages flow through pc system with graphene modified cathode and the biodegradability of the treated wastewater was largely increased with a low eec of 1 2 kwh m3 compared with conventional pc process the higher production of oh and increased anodic iron dissolution were induced by the flow through arrangement the utilization of generated active species was improved and energy consumption was decreased in the multi stages pc system at low current 2 6 ma cm2 compared to that in the single stage system at higher current 8 6 ma cm2 the effluent became biodegradable and 71 5 cod 72 3 phenol and 59 4 nh3 n were removed at the current density of 5 7 ma cm2 and flow rate of 4 5 ml min without adjustment of ph the improvement of its biodegradability could be attributed to the reduction of low and high molecular weight compounds in the coking wastewater which was supported by the uv vis and gc ms analysis the above results suggested that flow through pc was a promising method to pretreat the coking wastewater with high concentration and low conductivity acknowledgments the authors thank natural science foundation of china nos 21773129 21811530274 and 21273120 key project of

18991,cost effective pretreatment of the highly concentrated and biorefractory coking wastewater to improve biodegradability is of significant importance while green electrochemical technologies without external chemicals addition are charming but still challenging due to its high energy consumption in this work a novel multi stages flow through peroxi coagulation pc was for the first time developed with graphite felt cathode modified by graphene showing an excellent performance in removal of 71 5 cod 72 3 phenol and 59 4 nh3 n and significant biodegradability enhancement with a low energy consumption as 1 2 kwh m3 compared with conventional flow pc this process was more cost effective due to more intensive oh production and higher utilization of generated active species through uv spectrophotometry and gc ms analysis the improvement of biodegradability was attributed to the reduction of both low and high molecular weight compounds content in the coking wastewater comparing to the electro fenton electrocoagulation and ozonation process the proposed pc process was highly cost effective providing a promising and new alternative for pretreatment of coking wastewater keywords peroxi coagulation coking wastewater biodegradability graphene modified cathode flow through 1 introduction coal is the main energy resource in china at present approximately 0 3 billion tons coking wastewater which are generated from coal gas purification coal coking and by product refinement are produced in china every year lai et al 2007 na et al 2017 the discharged cod of coking wastewater accounted for 1 3 of the total wastewater in 2009 based on the chinese environmental statistics chu et al 2012 moreover since the composition of coking wastewater is very complex highly concentrated and toxic it has become a serious environmental problem and is urgently needed to deal with kim et al 2008 lai et al 2007 liu et al 2012 many previous studies report that the biodegradability of coking wastewater is extremely low indicating the conventional biological methods such as sequencing batch reactor sbr anoxic oxic a o and anaerobic anoxic oxic a1 a2 o are not effective for the treatment of this kind of wastewater zhang et al 1998 bai et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to improve the biodegradability and reduce the organic load of coking wastewater before its discharge into the municipal wastewater treatment plants in order to achieve this objective various pretreatment methods have been attempted such as adsorption zhang et al 2010 membrane filtration mf salehi et al 2014 ultrasonic irradiation ning et al 2005 and catalytic wet oxidation cwo chen et al 2012 however the harsh operating conditions and requirements on equipment used for processes like cwo and mf have brought heavy economic burden and impediments to practical application therefore development of an efficient economical and practical pretreatment method is of significant importance advanced oxidation processes aops have witnessed a remarkable development for the degradation of biorefractory and toxic organics during the last fifteen years brillas et al 2009 steter et al 2018 among various aops fenton process has attracted great interests due to the generation of hydroxyl radical oh via classic fenton reaction eq 1 oh represents a strong oxidant with high standard redox potential able to mineralize most of organic contaminants in situ electro generation of h2o2 at cathode via oxygen reduction reaction eq 2 gives rise to the electro fenton ef process in the presence of ferrous ion it can avoid the risks and costs in the transport and storage of h2o2 and thus largely reduce the adding amount of fe2 comparing to the traditional fenton process due to its electrochemical regeneration reaction eq 3 ridruejo et al 2018 thiam et al 2015 1 h 2 o 2 f e 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 3 f e 3 e f e 2 for most of the ef system using boron doped diamond bdd pt and sno2 anode ridruejo et al 2018 thiam et al 2014 2015 catalyst such as fe2 is externally added to the system in this regards this in situ electro generation of catalyst in ef process is of a significant interest from the practical application point of view simplifying process control and saving operational costs moreover the peroxi coagulation pc process represents an enhanced ef utilizing sacrificial anode which simultaneously generate in situ h2o2 eq 2 on the cathode and fe2 by dissolving iron anode by reaction 4 brillas et al 2003 besides the excessive fe3 present in the solution after reaction 1 precipitates in the form of fe oh 3 thus organic pollutants can be removed by the combined action of oxidation eq 1 and coagulation ren et al 2018 4 f e f e 2 2 e until now quite a few works focusing on pc process have been reported showing effectiveness in the removal of various pollutants such as aniline brillas and juan 2002 acrylonitrile ren et al 2018 2 4 5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid boye et al 2003a b and chlorophenoxy brillas et al 2003 in the electrolyte with high conductivity unfortunately pc treatment of the coking wastewater one of the highly concentrated and biorefractory wastewaters has so far never been reported in addition the previous pc works mainly focused on 1 the development of cathodes for high performance in h2o2 production such as carbon sponge graphite felt carbon nanotubes gas diffusion electrode and activated carbon fiber 2 the removal of various pollutants and their removal mechanism moreover most of pc studies were conducted in an undivided cell brillas et al 2003 salari et al 2009 and not much attention has been paid to the continuous flow pc reactor design and operation though it represents an important topic and is closely related to the process efficiency and costs from viewpoint of practical application accelerated reaction rate and improved efficiency can be obtained in flow through system owing to the enhanced mass transfer ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a so that efficiency of the pollutants degradation was further increased ren et al 2016 vecitis et al 2011 therefore flow through cells have been used in studying of electro oxidation gao and vecitis 2011 electrodialysis vaselbehagh et al 2015 electro fenton ren et al 2016 and electro peroxone zhang et al 2018b processes however to the authors best knowledge no systematic study of the flow through pc reactor for real wastewater treatment was undertaken so far moreover most of the previous intermittent and circulating flow pc experiments were conducted in the simulated wastewater with high conductivity 0 05 m na2so4 or 7280 us cm using a high current densities 33 33 ma cm2 to obtain the favorable efficiency boye et al 2003a b brillas et al 2003 unfortunately the conductivity of the real coking wastewater is relatively low 2000 3000 μs cm lai et al 2007 zhu et al 2009 and the electric energy consumption would sharply increase if a high current density was applied therefore in order to achieve the purpose of low energy consumption and high efficiency a multi stages flow through pc system was firstly established to pretreat

pc and ef process respectively and purchased from baoji changli company the raw coking wastewater was collected from a coking factory located in henan province china the quality of the wastewater is

conductivity is 3210 μs cm this wastewater was directly used by the pc process without addition of any electrolytes e g sodium sulfate 2 2 experimental procedure the perforated iron plates and graphene based graphite felt were used as the anode and cathode in a multi stages pc reactor 2 or 3 stages and the cathode was positioned below the anode fig 1 the electrode area of anode and cathode was the same with the value of about 7 0 cm2 the distance between the anode and cathode was 8 mm in each stage the pollutants firstly penetrated the cathode and then flowed through the anode the wastewater and pumped air flowed through the multi stages reactor in sequence in other words the effluent from the previous stage could be seen as the influent of the following stage in contrast the pollutants flow parallel with the electrodes surface in the conventional flow pc and the schematic diagram of the conventional pc process was shown in fig s1 in flow through ef process the perforated dsa and graphene based graphite felt were used as the anode and cathode respectively in flow through electrocoagulation ec process the perforated iron and stainless plate were used as the anode and cathode respectively in order to compare individual technologies the flow through pc ef and ec were performed under the same condition raw wastewater without adjustment of ph i 40 ma vair 80 ml min

conductivity detector liner sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were conducted by chi660d potentiostat ch instruments shanghai in a three electrode system using the graphene modified cathode as working electrode saturated calomel electrode and iron plates as the reference and counter electrode respectively lsv and eis were performed in the raw coking wastewater solution without aeration and the detail information of raw coking wastewater was shown in table s1 the lsv experiment was recorded at a scan rate of 10 mv s the eis analysis was performed in the above three electrode system at the open circuit potential with the potential amplitude of 10 mv in a frequency range of 105 to 0 1 hz the obtained results was simulated by nyquist plots and analyzed

zhang et al 2015 and then determined by hplc ultimate 3000 equipped with the acquity uplc beh c18 column 21 100 mm 0 17 μm the main compounds in the coking wastewater were identified by the gc ms analysis agilent 7890 5975c the sample was extracted using ch2cl2 before the gc ms analysis and then the extract was filtered through a 0 45 μm solid phase extraction column the gc ms analysis was performed with a hpms 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the programmed temperature was firstly operated at 70 c for 3 min subsequently raised at a rate of 3 c min until 280 c by product identification was undertaken with reference to the nist 05 mass spectral library database 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of flow through pc process performance fig 2 summarizes the performance comparisons by single stage flow through pc and conventional flow pc at ph 8 74 flow rate of 3 5 ml min and current density of 8 6 ma cm2 the effluent cod in flow through pc system was reduced to 1389 1532 mg l which was significantly lower than that by the conventional flow pc system 1712 1987 mg l fig 2a similar enhancement in phenol and ammonia n removal efficiency was observed in fig 2b in which they were 51 8 and 41 8 in flow through cell much higher than that in the conventional flow pc system 38 8 and 27 6 besides the biodegradability of the coking wastewater was clearly improved after the treatment by these two processes while the bod5 cod b c increased more obviously from 0 09 to 0 28 by the flow through pc system the aforementioned results indicated that flow through pc system had the better performance in the removal of cod phenol ammonia n and enhancement in biodegradability further calculation demonstrated the eec of flow through pc system was 0 90 kwh m3 which was only 63 0 of that in conventional flow pc indicating it was more cost effective for the treatment of coking wastewater table 1 this effect would be explained by two factors on one hand the higher current efficiency was obtained in the flow through pc reactor with the value of 86 9 compared with the corresponding value of 72 1 in the conventional flow pc reactor resulting in the higher presence of fe2 in the former system 258 6 mg l this effect could be explained by the electrode passivation as a consequence of accumulation of the anode dissolution products ren et al 2018 which was largely reduced in flow through system due to the reduced prandtl hydrodynamic layer at the anode surface in other words the passivation of anode in the conventional flow pc reactor resulted in the reduced current efficiency on the other hand a higher h2o2 production was achieved in flow through system compared with the conventional flow this results was in agreement with our previous works ma et al 2016 therefore the higher h2o2 and fe2 resulted in a higher amount of oh 21 7 μm in flow through pc system than that in conventional flow 17 4 μm table 1 leading to a higher removal performance these advantages of the flow through pc system were further mechanistically explored through lsv and eis analysis lsv showed that an improved current response was obtained by flow through process compared with the conventional flow one fig 2c thus it could be concluded that the electron transfer was accelerated in the former process yu et al 2015 simulated eis resistance and capacitance values were fitted by equivalent circuit model fig s2 chen et al 2014 and listed in table 1 the rs of flow through and conventional flow was 14 7 and 15 3 ω respectively the lower rs facilitated the increased current response in the region of high current loads which was in agreement with the lsv analysis the charger and mass transfer of oxygen and organic molecules to electrode surface were obviously improved in flow through since the rct and wmt were 2 3 and 4 8 times smaller compared with the conventional one with the values of 94 81 and 0 51 ω respectively moreover the cpedl of the flow through and conventional pc process were 203 8 and 1128 μf respectively the lower cpedl was conducive to the rapid replenishment of the organic molecules due the reduced debye length liu et al 2014 consequently the better performance of flow through pc process could be attributed to the accelerated mass and electron transfer as proved by eis and lsv analysis 3 2 advantages of the multi stages flow through pc process advantages of the multi stages flow through pc process were illustrated by a comparison between the three stages each of 20 ma and the single stage 60 ma flow through pc system under the conditions of the same total current charged as shown in fig 3 after three stages of pc process the effluent cod was 1216 mg l which was clearly lower than that in the single stage process 1563 mg l fig 3a besides the removal efficiency of phenol and nh3 n were 58 4 and 51 5 respectively both higher than those in single stage system 51 8 and 41 6 fig 3b in terms of the biodegradability although the biodegradability of the effluent in single stage pc system was greatly improved compared with the raw coking wastewater b c still did not reach 0 30 suggesting that the effluent was still non biodegradable in contrast b c of the effluent in three stages system increased with the increase of stage numbers fig 3c and the effluent of the third stage was biodegradable b c reached value of 0 31 each stage in the three stages pc was performed at much lower current compared with the single stage system which could effectively avoid the occurrence of parasitic reactions such as o2 evolution resulting in the higher production of active species ren et al 2018 salazar et al 2017 for example the iron dissolution at 20 ma was 95 0 mg l with a corresponding current efficiency of 95 7 while the current efficiency at 60 ma was only 86 9 fig s5 besides fig 3d shows that the higher total generated oh was obtained by three stages 22 6 μm using the lower current of 20 ma the applied current of each stage is 20 ma compared with single stage system 21 5 μm using the higher current of 60 ma due to the higher h2o2 production fig s3 and current efficiency in former system most importantly the higher utilization of active species was achieved using the lower current in the pc process in single stage system 21 5 μm oh was generated at 60 ma of which only 63 7 oh was consumed meaning 36 3 oh had not been effectively utilized before they reacted with the target molecules although only 7 9 μm oh was generated at 20 ma in the first stage pc system the consumed oh accounted for 78 6 of the total generated oh indicating the utilization of oh at low current was higher than that at high current condition in summary 77 7 oh 17 5 μm was consumed in three stages system which was clearly higher than that in single stage system with the value of 63 7 13 8 μm the higher utilization of oh indicated that more oh were involved in oxidation reaction resulting in the better performance in three stages pc system in addition as for the energy consumption the eec of the single stage pc system performed at high current of 60 ma was 1 0 kwh m3 which was 2 2 times of that of three stages system 0 48 kwh m3 fig 3b therefore the above analysis suggested that this multi stages pc system performed at low current is a promising and cost effective method for the pre treatment of the coking wastewater 3 3 the important parameters in the multi stages pc system 3 3 1 impact of solution ph the ph of the coking wastewater is in the range of 7 2 11 chu et al 2012 lai et al 2007 yu et al 2016 zhu et al 2009 thus the impact of ph on this pc process was investigated since the ph of effluent from coke plant can vary within a certain range after adjustment the initial ph of raw wastewater to 5 7 and 11 respectively a portion of cod was removed and the corresponding b c slightly increased fig 4 a and fig 4b this was because the formation of a large amount of precipitates in the process of acidification and alkalization resulting in the reduction of suspended matters and pollutants the precipitation phenomenon might be related to the addition of h or oh into the coking wastewater causing the grafting copolymerization destabilization and electric charge neutralization between colloidal particles due to the compression of electric double layer or destruction potential of the colloid liu et al 2012 fig 4 shows that a comparable cod phenol and nh3 n removal was obtained at ph 7 and 8 74 without adjustment of ph but the b c of effluent at ph 8 74 was largely increased compared to that at ph 7 in comparison the removal performance became poorer at lower and higher ph of 5 and 11 even though a portion of cod have been removed through the adjustment of ph for example the removal efficiency of cod phenol and nh3 n were 55 5 57 9 and 48 7 respectively at ph 11 this is much lower than that at ph 7 with the corresponding value of 75 2 74 0 and 62 3 meanwhile the b c of effluent at ph 7 0 38 was clearly higher than that at ph of 5 0 34 and 11 0 31 this effect could be attributed to the fact that fe oh 3 precipitates were hardly generated since the iron ions were stable in the solution at ph 5 and oh was poorly produced through the fenton reaction eq 1 at ph 11 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 besides the above results suggested that the synergistic effect of fe oh 3 precipitates and oh was most significant at ph 7 which was in agreement with the reported work ren et al 2018 moreover it was observed form fig 4d that the ph of the effluent increased at initial ph 7 and 5 and it decreased at initial ph 8 74 and 11 this was explained by the h2 and o2 evolution becoming dominant at ph 7 and ph 7 respectively it could be inferred that the effective performance at the wide ph ranges of 5 11 was closely related to the above ph change trend therefore this pc process was resistant to the ph variation of the coking wastewater and has great potential for the practical application 3 3 2 impact of the applied current load as shown in fig 5 although the amount of removed cod decreased from stage to stage in a consecutive order in multi stages pc reactor the relative removal efficiency of each pc stage was at the same level fig 5a for example about 829 5 mg l cod was removed by the first pc stage at 40 ma which was much higher than that in the second stage 631 7 mg l and the third stage 406 5 mg l however the cod removal efficiency in the first second and third pc stage was 37 2 36 7 and 34 5 respectively when the effluent of the previous stage was chosen as the influent of this stage this documents that the removal ability of each stage was approximately same in the multi stages pc system it can be concluded that in the system under investigation the removal of cod phenol and nh3 n increased as the current increased from 10 to 60 ma the larger amount of precipitates fe oh 3 and higher generation of oh could be obtained at higher current brillas et al 2003 ren et al 2018 resulting in the following sequence by taking the phenol removal as an example 10 ma 26 7 20 ma 59 2 30 ma 63 6 40 ma 78 2 50 ma 83 7 60 ma 86 3 however it was worth noting that cod phenol and nh3 n removal only increased by 263 3 mg l 8 1 and 9 4 respectively when the current improved from 40 to 60 ma whereas the corresponding value was 482 6 mg l 19 0 and 19 4 respectively when the current improved from 20 to 40 ma the above phenomenon could be explained by the h2o2 being consumed by excessive fe3 produced via reaction 4 and 7 leading to generation of a much weaker oxidant ho2 rather than oh eq 8 at higher current ridruejo et al 2018 besides some competitive reactions such as h2 and o2 evolution reaction become intensified when the applied current increase they compete with formation of the fe oh 3 and active species such as oh in the pc process 10 f e 2 o h f e 3 o h 11 f e 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 f e 2 h also biodegradability of the coking wastewater gradually improved with the number of stages increasing fig 5c when the current was higher than 40 ma the effluents of the second pc stage had met requirement of biodegradability b c 0 3 for example the b c of the first pc stage was only 0 24 at 60 ma this value increased to 0 48 and 0 65 during the second and third step respectively thus the above analysis indicates the multi stages pc system to be an ideal treatment of the coking wastewater with varying organic loading the number of stage has to be adjusted according the concrete situation in order to obtain optimal performance for the practical application in addition as for the electrochemical treatment technologies energy consumption is one of the major concerns as shown in fig 5d the eec in the latter pc stage was higher than that in the previous stages for example the eec of each pc stage at 50 ma was ranked as follows the first 0 8 kwh kg cod the second 0 9 kwh kg cod the third stage 1 8 kwh kg cod as expected the eec increased together with the increasing current load fig 5d consequently the current efficiency decreased as the current load increased from 10 ma to 60 ma insert fig 5d the ace of pc system under all current conditions exceeded 100 and the maximum efficiencies could reach 3165 9 for instance about 594 5 mg l cod was removed by the first stage pc system under the condition of 20 ma 3 5 ml min the corresponding current efficiency was 2091 3 according to eq 7 such amazing current efficiency has never been reported so far it has to be attributed to the significant advantages of this multi stages flow through pc system as discussed above the reason why the ace exceeded 100 was closely related to the calculation of ace the direct anodic oxidation was considered to be an exclusive mechanism of the cod removal from eq 7 ye et al 2016 however majority of cod was removed by the coupled actions such as sorption on precipitates and oxidation by oh rather than only direct anodic oxidation account for a high removal improvement of biodegradability high current efficiency and relative low eec 40 ma was regarded as the best current load in presently used setup 3 3 3 impact of the treated water flow rate and stage numbers water flux and removal performance which determines the application prospects of the treatment method are equally important for continuous flow systems thus the influence of flow rate was studied in the range of 3 5 ml min to 7 0 ml min the lower removal of cod phenol and nh3 n were obtained at higher flow rate as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b for example 50 4 cod 48 8 phenol and 34 7 nh3 n were removed at high flow rate of 7 0 ml min whereas the corresponding value were 74 5 78 0 and 62 4 respectively at low flow rate of 3 5 ml min the above results could be related to the hydraulic retention time hrt which decreased as the flow rate increased resulting in the lower dosage of precipitates fe oh 3 and oh this subsequently caused lower cod removal and the biodegradability improvement fig 6c on the other hand however it is observed in fig 6d that the cod removal flux increases with increasing flow rate for the flow rate of 3 5 4 5 6 0 and 7 0 ml min the corresponding removal flux has reached 3135 9 3817 4 4294 4 and 4443 0 mg min 1m 2 respectively in contrast the lower eec was obtained at higher flow rate for example the eec at high flow rate of 6 0 ml min 0 9 kwh m3 was lower than that at 3 5 ml min 1 5 kwh m3 fig 6d suggests that 7 0 ml min would be the best condition based on the removal flux and eec however the removal performance was very poor and the effluents of the third stage was still non biodegradable b c was only 0 24 fig 6c besides although the high removal performance was obtained at 3 5 ml min and the b c of the effluents in the second stage could reach 0 44 fig 6c the removal flux was much low and the eec was pretty high compared with others consequently the flow rate of 4 5 6 0 ml min would be optimum flow rate in addition this work demonstrated that a much better performance in removal and energy consumption were obtained by multi stages pc compared with single stage pc system thus the impact of stage number was further investigated as shown in fig s4 the effluent cod continued to decrease in the first three stages and then gradually reached steady state in the last two stages the removed cod in each pc stage was 715 3 607 4 426 5 166 8 and 54 1 mg l respectively in the five stages pc system compared to three stages pc only 220 9 mg l cod was further removed by five stages pc system however the energy consumption is 7 54 times that of the former the eec of the three stages pc was 0 9 kwh kg cod whereas the ecc sharply increased to 6 9 kwh kg cod in the five stages pc system fig s4 therefore the three stages pc system was a better choice based on the comprehensive consideration of removal performance and the energy consumption and this study also indicated that the number of stages can be adjusted according to the treated wastewater to achieve the ideal performance 3 4 degradation mechanism analysis 3 4 1 uv vis spectrophotometry fig 7 a shows the uv vis spectrum of the raw wastewater and effluent of each pc stage the similar trend in the absorption peaks of raw wastewater and effluents between 220 and 600 nm was observed but the intensity of peaks clearly decreased with the increase of pc stages besides there were two major and distinct absorption peaks at 270 and 310 nm in each sample which were ascribed to the light absorption by low molecular weight lmw compounds such as phenols and high molecular weight compounds hmw such as dimethyl phthalate respectively yu et al 2016 helms et al 2008 thus the apparent decrease of the peaks at 270 and 310 nm indicated that both the low and high molecular weight organics were largely removed by pc process moreover the variation in the relative size of molecules is closely related with the ratio of absorption at 250 365 nm e2 e3 john et al 2008 yu et al 2016 it can be seen form fig 7b that e2 e3 increased with the increase of pc stage suggesting the decrease of the molecular size of contaminants in the effluent these results were supported by the removal efficiency of phenol one of lmw organics in each pc stage fig 7b and the almost complete removal of dimethyl phthalate one of hmw organics through the gc ms analysis in addition the uv absorption at 254 nm is normalized to the dissolved organic carbon which can be seen as an indicator called the specific uv aromaticity suva254 strongly related to the aromaticity of the dissolved organic matters weishaar et al 2003 yu et al 2016 helms et al 2008 it was observed that the suva254 decreased with the increase of pc stages fig 7b suggesting a decrease of the effluent s aromaticity 3 4 2 the fate of n in the wastewater fig 7c shows the fate of n in the coking wastewater for this multi stages pc process the tn contained in the coking wastewater consists of ammonia nitrogen nh3 nitrate ion no3 nitrite ion no2 and organic nitrogen such as isoquinoline and indole see the gc ms analysis the concentration of tn continuously decreased from 371 3 to 286 7 mg l with the number of pc stage increasing fig 7c the loss of n in the wastewater could be explained by the generation of volatile intermediates such as nxoy and n2 which could be generated through the oxidation reaction between nh3 and formed oh in the pc process ridruejo et al 2018 this explanation was supported by the large reduction of nh3 in the wastewater from 285 6 to 113 8 mg l following the similar trend as tn fig 7c in contrast the content of no3 in the system constantly increased from 10 5 to 17 6 mg l as the number of stage increasing this was attributed to the nh3 oxidation or conversion of organic nitrogen compounds in the process lai et al 2009 the concentration of no2 in the effluents remained stable at a very low level ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 mg l nevertheless the difference between the initial tn and inorganic nitrogen nh3 no3 and no2 content in the solution was 75 0 mg l after three stages pc treatment this difference was doubled to 155 1 mg l the organic nitrogen content became larger because of the removal of the inorganic nitrogen and the formation of organic n derivatives such as metacetamol and 3 aminophenol at the same time see the gc ms analysis 3 4 3 reaction mechanism for pollutant removal in order to explore the cod removal mechanism the following experiments were performed fig 8 a shows that cod was hardly removed by adsorption without electric charge passing and without air aeration in the multi stages pc process in the first 30 min obtaining the cod removal in the first second and third pc stage of 1 1 1 2 and 1 5 respectively purging with n2 was used to inhibit the generation of h2o2 under electric charge passing in which cod can be removed by ec with the action of formed precipitate of fe oh 3 and adsorption on its surface from 40 to 70 min ma et al 2016 ren et al 2018 the removal of cod by ec in the first second and third pc stage reached 17 0 23 8 and 31 0 respectively next o2 pumped into pc system rather than n2 under continuous operation from 80 to 110 min the pollutants was removed by the combined action of ec and ef the difference between the standard pc system and that purging with n2 showed the contribution of oh to the cod removal the corresponding value are 13 3 28 5 and 39 2 for the first second and third stage respectively in summary it could be concluded that cod in the coking wastewater was removed by the action of pc but negligible adsorption to further explore the mechanism of biodegradability improvement gc ms analysis of the treated wastewater samples was conducted the dominant organic compounds of the raw wastewater were phenols esters and nitrogen containing organic which accounting for about 97 0 of the total compounds table s2 the degradation pathway of five representative substances with high relative contents was analyzed based on the detected intermediates as shown in fig 8b phenol and 2 methyl phenol were converted to hydroquinone and 2 methylbenzoquinone by hydroxylation respectively the transformation route of dimethyl phthalate was initiated by the generation of phthalic acid and then further sequentially oxidized to phthalic anhydride phthalan and 2 methylbenzoic acid by the reaction with oh besides metacetamol mat and 1 2h isoquinolinone iql was formed from indole and isoquinoline due to the cleavage of nitrogen heterocycle under the attack of oh then combined action of hydroxylation and hydrogenation in pc process ren et al 2018 mat and iql were converted to 3 aminophenol and p hydroxyphenylacetoaldoxime which was further converted to phenol by deamination next these aromatic rings were broken to form some short chain carboxylic acids such as maleic acid 2 heptenoic acid oxalic acid acetic acid and formic acid finally they were mineralized to co2 and h2o in addition the removal of toc phenol 2 methyl phenol dimethyl phthalate indole and isoquinoline reached 48 0 75 8 94 6 86 7 74 6 and 62 6 respectively after three stages pc treatment according to gc ms analysis fig s6 in summary it can be concluded that the improvement of the biodegradability was attributed to the mineralization of the significant portion of the phenolic esters and nitrogen containing organic contaminants content and due to the complete removal of the recalcitrant pollutants such as pyrene fig s6 3 5 stability assessment of the multi stages flow through pc system the stability of this multi stages flow through pc system was further investigated since the stable operation was rather critical for practical applications six times consecutive pc process using this multi stages flow through reactor were performed fig 9 a indicated that the cod removal were almost stable during the 6 times runs although the cod removal efficiency in the sixth run slightly decreased to 66 6 compared with the first time 72 3 besides a stable and efficient cathode is of significant importance to the stable operation of the pc process thus the h2o2 production of graphite felt cathode was evaluated after each pc experiment as shown in fig 9b the performance in h2o2 production of this modified graphite felt cathode was very stable in the range of 156 2 168 7 mg l after 6 continuous pc runs moreover this multi stages flow through pc system was operated over 5 h to evaluate its stability of effluent quality after long term running the h2o2 production of the first second and third stage remained stable and kept around 62 117 and 169 mg l respectively in the long term operation suggesting this modified graphite felt cathode was very stable which was in agreement with our previous works yang et al 2017 ma et al 2016 fig 9c indicated that effluent of this multi stages flow through pc system kept almost stable after 5 h running although there were slight fluctuations in the effluent cod of each pc stage this would reduce the cathode regeneration or replacing cost the above results demonstrated that both modified cathode and operational system were stable which ensured that this work had good potential application for the pretreatment of the coking wastewater 3 6 performance comparison of multi stages flow through pc with other pretreatment technologies various technologies have been used to pretreat the coking wastewater such as electrocoagulation ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 electro fenton zhu et al 2011 and ozonation zhang et al 2014 to evaluate the performance of different technologies for pretreatment of coking wastewater the flow through pc ec ef and ozonation in this multi stages system was comparably performed as shown in fig 10 although the b c of the coking wastewater treated by pc and ozonation exceeded 0 3 meaning the both effluent were biodegradable the lower removal of cod 41 2 phenol 43 2 and nh3 n 35 4 and higher eec 7 6 kwh kg cod were obtained by ozonation compared with the pc process with the corresponding value of 72 5 71 4 and 58 3 and 2 1 kwh kg cod it was observed that the cod phenol and nh3 n removal the b c of the effluent and the eec by the ef process were 19 6 15 2 and 9 8 0 2 and 6 8 kwh kg cod which indicated that ef was not suitable for the pretreatment of the coking wastewater due to the poor performance and high eec performance of ec was found to be significantly better than ef but the pc process combining the action of ec and ef showed clearly superior performance based on the electrical energy price in china 0 066 kwh the treatment cost of pc 0 14 kg cod was clearly lower than that in ec 0 23 kg cod ef 0 45 kg cod and ozonation 0 50 kg cod process besides this pc process showed better performance in removal improvement of biodegradability and treatment cost energy compared with the peer works table s3 all the results suggested that pc process was the best choice for the pretreatment of the coking wastewater 4 conclusions in this work cod phenol and nh3 n contained in the coking wastewater were effectively removed by a novel multi stages flow through pc system with graphene modified cathode and the biodegradability of the treated wastewater was largely increased with a low eec of 1 2 kwh m3 compared with conventional pc process the higher production of oh and increased anodic iron dissolution were induced by the flow through arrangement the utilization of generated active species was improved and energy consumption was decreased in the multi stages pc system at low current 2 6 ma cm2 compared to that in the single stage system at higher current 8 6 ma cm2 the effluent became biodegradable and 71 5 cod 72 3 phenol and 59 4 nh3 n were removed at the current density of 5 7 ma cm2 and flow rate of 4 5 ml min without adjustment of ph the improvement of its biodegradability could be attributed to the reduction of low and high molecular weight compounds in the coking wastewater which was supported by the uv vis and gc ms analysis the above results suggested that flow through pc was a promising method to

18992,the simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants in effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant mwtp of bogotá colombia was studied using high frequency ultrasound 375 khz the considered compounds in the effluent corresponded to pharmaceuticals diclofenac carbamazepine venlafaxine ciprofloxacin norfloxacin valsartan losartan irbesartan sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin azithromycin erythromycin metronidazole trimethoprim and clindamycin cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine due to limitation of the mwtp for the pollutants elimination ultrasound was applied to remove these compounds interestingly ultrasonic physical action led to releasing of ciprofloxacin norfloxacin diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from suspended solids whereas the chemical effects induced degradation of the rest of compounds for the latter ones an interesting correlation between the sonodegradation and arithmetic multiplication between hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was established afterwards the sonochemical process was complemented with ferrous ions sono fenton ferrous ions plus light sono photo fenton or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid sono photo fenton oxalic acid additionally to clarify fundamental aspects of the different systems individual treatments in distilled water of a model pollutant valsartan were performed the complemented processes significantly enhanced all compounds degradation following the order sono photo fenton oxalic acid sono photo fenton sono fenton sonochemistry the fe2 addition improved the pollutants elimination by generation of more hydroxyl radicals in the solution bulk meanwhile oxalic acid avoided fe3 precipitation favoring the iron catalytic cycle thus the work demonstrates the high potentiality of the sono photo fenton oxalic acid system for the pollutants elimination in real world wastewater matrices graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging pollutants high frequency ultrasound advanced oxidation processes wastewater treatment sono photo fenton sono photo fenton oxalic acid 1 introduction it is worldwide recognized that municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtp are not designed to deal with emerging concern pollutants verlicchi et al 2012 which are commonly at very low concentrations in these matrices nowadays both pharmaceuticals and illicit substances are considered as emerging concern pollutants they generally have cell membrane penetration easiness favoring their toxic effects brausch et al 2012 pharmaceuticals as analgesics psychiatric products antihypertensives and antibiotics are frequently found in wastewaters campanha et al 2015 fatta kassinos et al 2011 ghoshdastidar et al 2015 gracia lor et al 2012 gros et al 2010 hernández et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 and such substances reach the aquatic environment even in pristine areas as the antarctic gonzález alonso et al 2017 hernández et al 2018 also illicit substances are commonly measured in mwtp effluents as they are not completely removed with conventional treatments bijlsma et al 2014 parolini et al 2018 2017 hence due to the limitations of most treatments applied in mwtp alternative and or additional processes are required for the elimination of these problematic compounds and decrease their negative impact on the environment advanced oxidation processes aop which are characterized by the formation and utilization of radical species typically hydroxyl radical have been used as effective and alternative treatments for complex wastewater especially in the case of the non biodegradable compounds boczkaj and fernandes 2017 recently it is gaining attention the application of aop based on sulfate radical fernandes et al 2018b serna galvis et al 2017 shah et al 2018 aop at alkaline ph boczkaj and fernandes 2017 fernandes et al 2018a and treatments involving cavitation phenomena to degrade pollutants gągol et al 2018a there are diverse ways of cavitation e g hydrodynamic cavitation or vibrational cavitation also called acoustic cavitation or sonochemistry gągol et al 2018a the combination of cavitation hydrodynamic or acoustic with external oxidizing agents e g hydrogen peroxide ozone peroxone is a potent way to generate extra radicals gągol et al 2018b 2018c also the sonochemical process has been found to be efficient for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants in water serna galvis et al 2016 2015 torres palma and serna galvis 2018 villaroel et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 sonochemistry uses high frequency ultrasound waves to produce hydroxyl radical the process implies formation and growth of micro bubbles until reaching a critical size at which they violently collapse i e acoustic cavitation the collapse of the micro bubbles induces hot spots generation with singular conditions of pressure 1000 atm and temperature 5000 k adewuyi 2001 producing hydroxyl radicals from dissociation of water molecules and oxygen eqs 1 4 furthermore in sonochemistry hydrogen peroxide is formed through hydroxyl radicals combination eq 5 1 h2o h oh 2 o2 2 o 3 h2o o 2 oh 4 o2 h o oh 5 2 oh h2o2 the most works about sonochemical degradation of pollutants are typically focused on individual compounds in synthetic water serna galvis et al 2015 villaroel et al 2014 villegas guzman et al 2015 and only few papers deal with sono treatment of real world municipal wastewaters naddeo et al 2013 xiao et al 2014 even more scarce is the information regarding high frequency ultrasound improved with other aops for the treatment of wastewater containing pollutants at realistic low concentrations i e sub ppb i e μg l 1 to ng l 1 considering the absence of relevant studies on this issue the present work evaluates the simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants fifteen representative pharmaceuticals an illicit drug and its main metabolite at actual low concentrations μg l 1 to ng l 1 levels in real effluents from bogotá colombia by high frequency ultrasound and its complementation with iron and uva light after proving that most of the considered pollutants were not completely removed by the mwtp the ultrasonic system was applied to effluents from the plant sonochemical processes showed degrading action on the pollutants then a possible correlation of sono degradation rates with hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was studied afterwards the addition of iron uva light and oxalic acid to ultrasound i e sono fenton sono photo fenton and sono photo fenton oxalic acid to enhance the pollutants elimination was evaluated furthermore to better understand the fundamental aspects of these systems valsartan representative pollutant in the effluent was selected as model compound and treated in distilled water 2 experimental 2 1 reagents reference standards of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs for lc ms ms analysis were acquired from sigma aldrich lgc promochem and toronto research chemicals more details on reagents and chemicals used in analysis can be found in text sm1 supplementary material and the reference botero coy et al 2018 valsartan for individual experiments was purchased from tecnoquímicas s a oxalic acid and iron sulfate heptahydrate were obtained from panreac and merck respectively potassium iodide ammonium heptamolybdate acetonitrile and methanol were provided by merck formic acid was purchased from carlo erba 2 2 mwtp sampling and sonochemical reaction system wastewater effluent samples 24 h composite were taken from el salitre mwtp in bogotá colombia using a volume proportional sampling mode every 2500 m3 approximately every 10 min during seven days using an auto sampler endress hauser then the daily 24 h composites were mixed and such homogenized mixture was considered as the whole sample for the treatments the treatments were carried out in a meinhardt ultrasound batch reactor with capacity of 500 ml and 88 w l 1 of actual ultrasonic power density measured by calorimetric method kimura et al 1996 the reactor was operated at 375 khz of frequency the transduction efficiency of the reactor was 13 in each experiment a sample of 300 ml was treated reactor temperature was controlled at 20 c using a huber minichiller in the light complemented systems was used a sylvania uva lamp blb of 4 w placed on a quartz sleeve and submerged in the ultrasonic reactor figure sm1 in supplementary material all experiments were performed at least by duplicate 2 3 analyses the seventeen compounds were selected based on the previous studies on their occurrence in wastewaters from bogotá colombia bijlsma et al 2016 botero coy et al 2018 the determination of pharmaceuticals cocaine and benzoylecgonine in wastewater was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms with triple quadrupole analyses to obtain the concentration of pollutants in the sample were carried out before and during each experiment quantification of compounds was made using the quantification transition q external calibration with standards in solvent and relative peak areas with isotope labeled internal standard ilis up to 12 ilis were available for the compounds under study the reliable identification of compounds in the samples was ensured by the ion ratios between the quantification q and confirmation q1 and q2 transitions and by chromatographic retention time tolerance ranges 30 for ion ratio 0 1 min for retention time in comparison with the reference standards injected in the calibration quality control samples qcs were included in every sample sequence to ensure reliability of concentration data qcs consisted on real world wastewater samples spiked at two concentrations 0 1 and 1 0 μg l which were analyzed within the batch following the same analytical procedure than for the samples most of qcs recoveries were satisfactory with the wide majority within the range 70 120 at the two levels tested more details on the analytical methodology applied can be found in botero coy et al 2018 chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluent was established following to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 5220 according to the reported previously serna galvis et al 2015 the ph of the effluent was measured using a ph93 ph meter total organic carbon toc of the effluent was measured using a shimadzu lcsh toc analyzer this was determined by combustion with catalytic oxidation at 680 c using high purity oxygen gas at a flow rate of 190 ml min the apparatus had a non dispersive infrared detector calibration of the analyzer was attained with standard potassium hydrogen phthalate 99 5 solution the injection sample volume was 50 μl total suspended solids were determined by sewerage and sanitation company of bogotá eaab esp and taken from its monthly report of activities eab esp 2018 soluble iron was determined through the phenanthroline method by adding 80 μl of the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and 200 μl of the 1 10 phenanthroline solution were added to 1320 μl of the sample the ph of each cell was regulated with 400 μl of the sodium acetate solution the sample was homogenized and after 15 min of reaction in dark the absorbance reading at 510 nm was carried out the evolution of valsartan the model pollutant for the individual degradation in distilled water was followed using a uhplc thermoscientific dionex ultimate 3000 instrument equipped with an acclaim 120 rp c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm and a diode array detector the mobile phase was 10 46 44 v v v methanol acetonitrile formic acid 10 mm at ph 3 0 the chromatograph was run in isocratic mode at 0 4 ml min and the pollutant detected at 254 nm the accumulation of sonogenerated hydrogen peroxide was estimated by iodometry method text sm2 as reported by serna galvis et al 2015 the possible primary products of valsartan sonodegradation were identified by lc coupled to high resolution ms lc hrms using a hybrid quadrupole time of flight qtof analyzer for this purpose an approach based on common fragmentation pathway was applied assuming that most degradation products share the fragmentation pathway with the parent compound more details about the instrumental conditions as well as the elucidation strategy can be found in the following references ibáñez et al 2016 martínez pachón et al 2018 and supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 inability of the mwtp for complete pollutants removal el salitre mwtp has a pre treatment step screening unit and a primary treatment circuit coagulation flocculation and sedimentation units the pre treatment uses a bar to filter large solids and objects which are collected in dumpsters and disposed in landfills the primary treatment circuit conducts to removal of suspended solids and organic matter el salitre plant normally operates at 4 m3 s 350 000 m3 day with a removal efficiency of 40 biological oxygen demand and 60 of suspended solids eab esp 2018 table sm1 presents the basic global parameters of the considered effluent the mixture of seven days effluent samples it can be noted that the effluent has a medium organic charge due to the moderate removal efficiency of the plant as above reported meanwhile the target pollutants are contained at the concentrations reported in fig 1 in the effluent the valsartan and losartan antihypertensives are at the highest concentrations followed by benzoylecgonine cocaine metabolite the anti inflammatory diclofenac and the fluoroquinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin due to the very high consumption such substances or their parent compounds are vastly concentrated in wastewater and the treatment plant is unable to completely remove them botero coy et al 2018 for example losartan is an antihypertensive widely used in colombia indeed problems about its improper use related to over dose in daily practice have been found portilla et al 2017 ciprofloxacin is among the top 5 most common antibiotics in colombian hospitals of third generation alvarez et al 2016 and its presence in colombian hospital wastewater has been reported botero coy et al 2018 meanwhile cocaine is a highly consumed illicit drug in populated colombian cities such as bogotá consequently its main metabolite benzoylecgonine has a high prevalence in wastewaters bijlsma et al 2016 hernández et al 2015 in our previous work we studied the ability of conventional processes applied in el salitre mwtp to eliminate the emerging concern pollutants figure sm2 botero coy et al 2018 a limited efficiency of the treatment plant for the pollutants removal was observed in fact some pharmaceuticals concentration in the effluent were higher than in influent e g erythromycin metronidazole sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim which presented negative removal efficiencies in some cases mwtp can act as pollutants concentrators this situation is not exclusive for el salitre mwtp similar facts have been reported by lacey et al gros et al and jelic et al gros et al 2010 jelic et al 2010 thus the incomplete removals even the increasing of pollutants concentration by conventional processes in mwtp evidence the need of alternative complementary treatment technologies 3 2 degradation of the 17 emergent pollutants by ultrasound sonochemistry was applied to the effluent during 90 min to evaluate its degrading ability on the selected pollutants in the complex water therefore the evolution of each contaminant under study was followed fig 2 it is worthy to note that for a few compounds such as diclofenac sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin the ultrasound action increased their concentrations whereas for the rest of pollutants the concentration decreased with the treatment time due to the effluent contains suspended solids table sm1 some pollutants are sorbed on such solids it is reported that non ionic compounds tend to be highly sorbed onto organic matter through van der waals interactions whereas for those pollutants with polar and or charged functional groups their sorption is governed by the combination of electrostatic interactions and van der waals forces hyland et al 2012 in fact electrostatic interactions are determinant for the sorption of fluoroquinolone pharmaceuticals e g ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin on sewage solids ternes et al 2004 wu et al 2009 meanwhile diclofenac presents a medium affinity towards sewage solids berthod et al 2014 ternes et al 2004 in the case of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole although this pollutant has weak interactions it can experiment some sorption on such solids yang et al 2011 considering the sorption phenomena the results in fig 2 can be rationalized based on the physical and chemical effects of ultrasound the physical action of ultrasound i e turbulence and high shearing in the liquid medium by cavitation phenomena induces size reduction of solids and release sorbed pollutants gunduz 2009 torres palma et al 2017 zorba and sanin 2013 consequently the concentration of released substances i e ciprofloxacin norfloxacin diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole is increased it should be indicated that suspended solids can also induce the formation of cavitation bubbles mason and pétrier 2004 which can favor the sonochemical process application the removal of the pollutants can be associated to the chemical effects of the process as indicated in the introduction high frequency ultrasound produces radical species radicals can attack the pollutants decreasing their concentration fig 2 also it can be mentioned that the sorption on solids hiders the direct attack of radicals to sorbed compounds however when they are released such compounds are more available for sonodegradation in ultrasound degradation by pyrolysis as well as the interaction between pollutants and hydroxyl radical depends on their proximity to the cavitation bubbles such proximity is determined by the initial concentration and the hydrophobic character of the compounds torres palma and serna galvis 2018 then to evaluate the concentration feature the initial molarity of pollutants was calculated and the sonochemical degradation rate for each pollutant was measured table 1 interestingly upon ultrasound action the substances with the highest initial molar concentrations e g losartan valsartan and benzoylecgonine had faster degradation table 1 this is because a higher concentration favors the pollutant diffusion toward the cavitation bubble increasing the probability of contact with hydroxyl radicals torres palma and serna galvis 2018 for the evaluation of the hydrophobicity effect pairs of substances with close molar concentration valsartan benzoylecgonine clarithromycin irbesartan also azithromycin and carbamazepine cocaine were considered then their log kow values which are hydrophobicity indicators and degradation rates were compared table 1 from each pair the compound having the higher log kow i e the more hydrophobic presented larger degradation rate this means that the more hydrophobic pollutants in the effluent are faster degraded because they are nearer the cavitation bubbles and consequently more susceptible to experiment reaction with hydroxyl radicals a possible way to conjugate concentration and hydrophobicity is the arithmetic multiplication between these two factors which would denote the closeness to cavitation bubble in the sonochemical system indeed the plot of degradation rate vs c log kow i e concentration multiplied by hydrophobicity shows a very good correlation r 0 985 fig 3 this means that among a set of pollutants hydrophobic compounds and highly concentrated are faster degraded whereas the lowly concentrated and hydrophilic substances have very slow degradation rates additionally from groups of pollutants with similar hydrophobicity the more concentrated compounds will experiment high degradation rates meanwhile for compounds at similar concentration the degradation was higher with the increasing of the hydrophobic character of the substance regarding the pollutants released from solids by the physical action of ultrasound their degradation by hydroxyl radicals or pyrolysis could be plausible after a more prolonged action of the sonochemical process i e at treatment times higher than 90 min to better understand the chemical effects of ultrasonic process on pollutants the treatment of the model compound valsartan under controlled conditions was carried out such substance was selected considering its high hydrophobicity and concentration in the effluent sample table 1 furthermore valsartan represents a risk in the environment because it can be transformed into valsartan acid which is a very mobile and persistent compound berkner and thierbach 2014 thus valsartan degradation was initially performed in distilled water to avoid matrix interferences afterwards the role of suspended solids was also tested by means of valsartan spiking in effluent with and without solids text sm3 fig 4 presents the evolution of valsartan submitted to high frequency ultrasound in distilled water the process degraded 60 of the compound after 30 min of treatment in addition to the pollutant degradation the accumulation rate ra of hydrogen peroxide which is an indirect indicator of hydroxyl radical production ability of ultrasound eq 5 in both presence val and absence of valsartan bk was also measured fig 4 the ra in the presence of the pollutant is lower than in the absence indicating that the reaction of valsartan with sonogenerated radicals limits the h2o2 accumulation the structure of the degradation products elucidated by qtof ms indicates that they are formed from the attack of oh to tetrazole ring dp1 biphenyl moiety dp2 and pentanamide group dp3 dp4 and dp5 table 2 this indicates the high reactivity of such functional groups on valsartan toward the sonogenerated hydroxyl radical the attacks to tetrazole ring and biphenyl moiety are additions to π systems which are typical pathways of oh martínez pachón et al 2018 meanwhile the action on pentanamide can be described as an initial hydrogen abstraction by hydroxyl radical a common pathway reported for alkyl amides doan et al 2010 hayon et al 1970 and the posterior evolution to the oxidized forms of carbon on the alkyl chain consequently if valsartan a hydrophobic and highly concentrated pollutant in the mwtp is degraded by hydroxyl radical action it can be proposed that the other substances which are less concentrated and or more hydrophilic are also eliminated by the oh attacks regarding the role of suspended solids it must be indicated that they may have a dual effect extra cavitation bubbles can be formed thought trapped air inside of the solids mason and pétrier 2004 however solids can also provoke cavitation attenuation larrarte and françois 2012 then to evaluate the effect of suspended solids in the sonochemical process degradation of spiked valsartan in the effluent with and without solids was tested as seen in figure sm3 under work conditions the valsartan degradation is slightly favored in absence of solids nevertheless it is remarkable the ability of ultrasound to remove pollutants even in the presence of suspended solids fig 2 and figure sm3 on the other hand considering that the sonochemical reactor operation at 88 w l 1 represents high consumption of electrical energy degradation times longer than 90 min were not evaluated additionally taking into account that the hydrogen peroxide a sub product of ultrasonic process can be used to produce more radicals by addition of iron ions and light i e photo fenton based processes as an interesting option to achieve higher and faster elimination of pollutants and decrease the energy consumption respect to the sonochemical or photochemical processes acting alone torres et al 2007 2008a 2008b hence the addition of iron and light to the sonochemical process for the effluent treatment was evaluated 3 3 improvement of sonochemical degradation by addition of iron uva light and oxalic acid the pollutants removal by sonochemical process with addition of ferrous ions sono fenton ferrous ions plus light sono photo fenton or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid sono photo fenton oxalic acid was tested fig 5 shows the behavior of pollutants under the different systems it can be noted that in these processes the concentrations of diclofenac ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin the supposed sorbed compounds decreased as the treatment time increased under sono fenton and sono photo fenton treatments sulfamethoxazole concentration increased initially but it decreased as the processes was progressing remarkably in the sono photo fenton oxalic acid system after the first 30 min of treatment the concentration of sulfamethoxazole notably diminished from 0 37 to 0 14 μg l to determine the differences among the treatments the elimination of pollutants after 90 min was evaluated using two measures percentage of degradation pd and removed amount ra in ng table 3 thus three comparison criteria were applied total summation i e arithmetic addition of pd or ra values average i e arithmetic average of pd or ra and pondered elimination percentage calculated using eq 6 6 p o n d e r e d e l i m i n a t i o n i 1 17 c o x p d i i 1 17 c o i where co represents the initial concentration in μg l 1 table 3 shows that sonochemistry has negative values for the three criteria therefore from a general point of view such system had a predominance of the releasing effect over the degrading action in fact it has been reported that physical effects of ultrasound are able to break suspended solids from secondary effluents torres palma et al 2017 which is an advantage of ultrasound over other aops because it makes more available the released compounds for radicals attacks in contrast to ultrasound alone the other three systems exhibited positive values of the total summation average and pondered elimination percentage indicating the prevalence of degrading effects in these processes moreover for sono fenton and sono photo fenton the pollutant elimination criteria had close values whereas sono photo fenton oxalic acid exhibited higher numbers the addition of fe2 i e sono fenton improved the global pollutants elimination table 3 by the generation of more hydroxyl radicals mainly in the bulk of solution through the fenton reaction eq 7 ammar 2016 torres et al 2008b contributing to the elimination of both the released pollutants from solids and hydrophilic ones at the same time organic matter components in the effluent have carboxylic and polycarboxylate groups which can complex the produced fe3 eq 8 fujii et al 2014 hence a significant iron fraction can remain in a soluble form see figure sm4 soluble iron in the systems the uva light used for the sono photo fenton system had low interfering effects by the matrix components e g suspended solids as evidenced by the low absorbance of the water table sm1 and text sm4 thus the illumination of water with the uva lamp may photo regenerate fe2 eq 9 which in the oxidizing environment of ultrasound can be fastly returned to fe3 k 63 76 m 1s 1 eq 7 producing more radicals radical may also degrade the carboxylic moieties then the depletion of carboxylic groups by action of uva light eq 9 and radical plus the near neutral conditions i e ph 7 5 during process table sm2 lead to the formation of insoluble fe3 species eq 10 as evidenced by the decreasing of dissolved iron figure sm4 in the effluent case such blocking of the iron availability can limit the photo fenton process efficiency this would explain why sono photo fenton had no improvements respect to sono fenton system 7 fe2 h2o2 sonogenerated fe3 oh oh 8 fe3 rcoo organic matter fe rcoo 2 9 fe rcoo 2 uva fe2 r co2 10 fe3 3oh fe oh 3 s in the case of sono photo fenton oxalic acid process the iron iii precipitation is avoided by the carboxylic acid presence at considerable concentration 2 ppm oxalic acid is a strong complexing agent of iron keeping it in a soluble form as figure sm4 shown furthermore ferric oxalate complexes such as fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 are photoactive and promote the catalytic cycle of iron ammar 2016 pignatello et al 2006 this favors the generation of additional radicals for the pollutants degradation eq 11 and 12 also it is well known that the reaction constant k 3 1 104 m 1 s 1 of the ferrous oxalate complex with hydrogen peroxide eq 12 is higher than that reported for classical fenton reaction k 63 76 m 1 s 1 eq 7 pignatello et al 2006 prato garcia et al 2009 for these reasons the sono photo fenton oxalic acid presented the highest global removal of pollutants table 3 11 2fe c2o4 n 3 2n uva 2fe2 2n 1 c2o4 2 2co2 12 fe c2o4 h2o2 fe c2o4 oh oh to understand fundamental aspects of sono fenton sono photo fenton and sono photo fenton oxalic acid the treatment of valsartan in distilled water was also studied fig 6 a presents the comparison among the pseudo first order rate constant k1 for valsartan degradation by these processes figure sm5 depicts the control experiments from fig 6a it was evidenced an acceleration of the pollutant elimination by iron ii uva light and oxalic acid addition to ultrasound contrarily to the observed in wastewater in distilled water the degradation by sono photo fenton was higher than by sono fenton furthermore the ph of the solution during treatments reached values below 4 0 table sm2 at ph range 2 0 4 0 predominates the soluble iron form fe oh 2 eq 13 which has strong uv absorption facilitating the photo fenton reaction loures et al 2013 indeed when such iron iii form is irradiated by uva a ligand to metal charge transfer occurs involving the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and hydroxyl radical formation eq 14 the fe2 regenerated during irradiation interacts with sonogenerated hydrogen peroxide eq 7 producing more radicals which accelerate the valsartan degradation see sono photo fenton in fig 6a 13 fe3 h2o fe oh 2 h 14 fe oh 2 uva fe2 oh in the case of sono photo fenton oxalic acid system the k1 value was 40 higher than by sonolysis alone such result confirms the accelerating role of oxalic acid oxalate as iron ligand can increase the oh production in the bulk of solution according to eq 11 and 12 favoring in this way a faster and higher pollutant elimination besides the k1 determination during the treatments of valsartan the hydrogen peroxide accumulation rates ra for the different systems fig 6b were also established following the order sonochemistry sono fenton sono photo fenton sono photo fenton oxalic acid in sono fenton and sono photo fenton ra was lower than in sonochemistry indicating a higher feh2o2 interaction i e more production of oh and consequently an increasing in the valsartan degradation i e a higher k1 value fig 6a meanwhile the lowest hydrogen peroxide accumulation rate in the sono photo fenton oxalic acid system could be associated to the highest formation of additional oh eq 11 and 12 used to enhance the valsartan elimination and the possible reaction with oxalic acid finally it should be mentioned that the k1 and ra values in fig 6 are coherent with the results shown in table 3 for the whole set of pollutants confirming the improvement of degradation by the addition of iron ii uva light and oxalic acid to the sonochemical processes 4 conclusions this work showed that the conventional systems used in el salitre mwtp bogotá colombia partially removed the emerging contaminants under study in fact such systems can promote for some compounds a simple transference of pollutants from aqueous medium to other phase e g substances sorption on suspended solids on the contrary the sonochemical process led to the pollutants releasing from suspended solids additionally the interaction with the sonogenerated hydroxyl radical induced the degradation of both pharmaceuticals and illicit substances the ultrasonic elimination of pollutants seemed to be dependent on concentration and hydrophobicity parameters in fact the arithmetic multiplication between these two factors c log kow which was used to denote the closeness to cavitation bubble presented a good correlation with the contaminants degradation rate this means that those hydrophobic compounds found at high concentrations in the effluent e g losartan or valsartan are faster degraded whereas the low concentrated hydrophilic substances e g metronidazole or trimethoprim have very slow degradation rates the addition of iron ii uva light and oxalic acid to the sonochemical process significantly increased the pondered removal of the pollutants in the effluent thanks the production of extra hydroxyl radicals through reactions between iron and sonogenerated hydrogen peroxide the presence of oxalic acid or carboxylic groups in effluent organic matter makes iron more available for extra radicals formation in the bulk of solution with the subsequent improvement of pollutants elimination it can be pointed out that the ultrasonic system complemented with iron ii uva light and oxalic acid presented a strong potential for the pollutants elimination in real world wastewater matrices finally it is important to indicate that the feasibility of applying the high frequency ultrasound technique at wastewater treatment plant scale is hampered by its high electrical energy consumption and the low transduction efficiency however the fundamental aspects e g pollutants degradation enhancement by iron ii uva light and oxalic acid addition derived from sonochemistry are transferable to the other analogous systems based on the cavitation phenomena such as hydrodynamic cavitation which has lower costs for scaling up declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18992,the simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants in effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant mwtp of bogotá colombia was studied using high frequency

sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin azithromycin erythromycin metronidazole trimethoprim and clindamycin cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine due to limitation of the mwtp for the pollutants

pharmaceuticals and illicit substances are considered as emerging concern pollutants they generally have cell membrane penetration easiness favoring their toxic effects brausch et al 2012 pharmaceuticals as analgesics psychiatric products antihypertensives and antibiotics are frequently found in wastewaters campanha et al 2015 fatta kassinos et al 2011 ghoshdastidar et al 2015 gracia lor et al 2012 gros et al 2010 hernández et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 and such substances reach the aquatic environment even in pristine areas as the antarctic gonzález alonso et al 2017 hernández et al 2018 also illicit substances are commonly measured in mwtp effluents as they are not completely removed with conventional treatments bijlsma et al 2014 parolini et al 2018 2017 hence due to the limitations of most treatments applied in mwtp alternative and or additional processes are required for the elimination of these problematic compounds and decrease their negative impact on the environment advanced oxidation processes aop which are characterized by the formation and utilization of radical species typically hydroxyl radical have been used as effective and alternative treatments for complex wastewater especially in the case of the non biodegradable compounds boczkaj and fernandes 2017 recently it is gaining attention the application of aop based on sulfate radical fernandes et al 2018b serna galvis et al 2017 shah et al 2018 aop at alkaline ph boczkaj and fernandes 2017 fernandes et al 2018a and treatments involving cavitation phenomena to degrade pollutants gągol et al 2018a there are diverse ways of cavitation e g hydrodynamic cavitation or vibrational cavitation also called acoustic cavitation or sonochemistry gągol et al 2018a the combination of cavitation hydrodynamic or acoustic with external oxidizing agents e g hydrogen peroxide ozone peroxone is a potent way to generate extra radicals gągol et al 2018b 2018c also the sonochemical process has been found to be efficient for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants in water serna galvis et al 2016 2015 torres palma and serna galvis 2018 villaroel et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 sonochemistry uses high frequency ultrasound waves to produce hydroxyl radical the process implies formation and growth of micro bubbles until reaching a critical size at which they violently collapse i e acoustic cavitation the collapse of the micro bubbles induces hot spots generation with singular conditions of pressure 1000 atm and temperature 5000 k adewuyi 2001 producing hydroxyl radicals from dissociation of water molecules and oxygen eqs 1 4 furthermore in sonochemistry hydrogen peroxide is formed through hydroxyl radicals combination eq 5 1 h2o h oh 2 o2 2 o 3 h2o o 2 oh 4 o2 h o oh 5 2 oh h2o2 the most works about sonochemical degradation of pollutants are typically focused on individual compounds in synthetic water serna galvis et al 2015 villaroel et al 2014 villegas guzman et al 2015 and only few papers deal with sono treatment of real world municipal wastewaters naddeo et al 2013 xiao et al 2014 even more scarce is the information regarding high frequency ultrasound improved with other aops for the treatment of wastewater containing pollutants at realistic low concentrations i e sub ppb i e μg l 1 to ng l 1 considering the absence of relevant studies on this issue the present work evaluates the simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants fifteen representative pharmaceuticals an illicit drug and its main metabolite at actual low concentrations μg l 1 to ng l 1 levels in real effluents from bogotá colombia by high frequency ultrasound and its complementation with iron and uva light after proving that most of the considered pollutants were not completely removed by the mwtp the ultrasonic system was applied to effluents from the plant sonochemical processes showed degrading action on the pollutants then a possible correlation of sono degradation rates with hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was studied afterwards the addition of iron uva light and oxalic acid to ultrasound i e sono fenton sono photo fenton and sono photo fenton oxalic acid to enhance the pollutants elimination was evaluated furthermore to better understand the fundamental aspects of these systems valsartan representative pollutant in the effluent was selected as model compound and treated in distilled water 2 experimental 2 1 reagents reference standards of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs for lc ms ms analysis were acquired from sigma aldrich lgc promochem and toronto research chemicals more details on reagents and chemicals used in analysis can be found in text sm1 supplementary material and the reference botero coy et al 2018 valsartan for individual experiments was purchased from tecnoquímicas s a oxalic acid and iron sulfate heptahydrate were obtained from panreac and merck respectively potassium iodide ammonium heptamolybdate acetonitrile and methanol were provided by merck formic acid was purchased from carlo erba 2 2 mwtp sampling and sonochemical reaction system wastewater effluent samples 24 h composite were taken from el salitre mwtp in bogotá colombia using a volume proportional sampling mode every 2500 m3 approximately every 10 min during seven days using an auto sampler endress hauser then the daily 24 h composites were mixed and such homogenized mixture was considered as the whole sample for the treatments the treatments were carried out in a meinhardt ultrasound batch reactor with capacity of 500 ml and 88 w l 1 of actual ultrasonic power density measured by calorimetric method kimura et al 1996 the reactor was operated at 375 khz of frequency the transduction efficiency of the reactor was 13 in each experiment a sample of 300 ml was treated reactor temperature was controlled at 20 c using a huber minichiller in the light complemented systems was used a sylvania uva lamp blb of 4 w placed on a quartz sleeve and submerged in the ultrasonic reactor figure sm1 in supplementary material all experiments were performed at least by duplicate 2 3 analyses the seventeen compounds were selected based on the previous studies on their occurrence in wastewaters from bogotá colombia bijlsma et al 2016 botero coy et al 2018 the determination of pharmaceuticals cocaine and benzoylecgonine in wastewater was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms with triple quadrupole analyses to obtain the concentration of pollutants in the sample were carried out before and during each experiment quantification of compounds was made using the quantification transition q external calibration with standards in solvent and relative peak areas with isotope labeled internal standard ilis up to 12 ilis were available for the compounds under study the reliable identification of compounds in the samples was ensured by the ion ratios between the quantification q and confirmation q1 and q2 transitions and by chromatographic retention time tolerance ranges 30 for ion ratio 0 1 min for retention time in comparison with the reference standards injected in the calibration quality control samples qcs were included in every sample sequence to ensure reliability of concentration data qcs consisted on real world wastewater samples spiked at two concentrations 0 1 and 1 0 μg l which were analyzed within the batch following the same analytical procedure than for the samples most of qcs recoveries were satisfactory with the wide majority within the range 70 120 at the two levels tested more details on the analytical methodology applied can be found in botero coy et al 2018 chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluent was established following to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 5220 according to the reported previously serna galvis et al 2015 the ph of the effluent was measured using a ph93 ph meter total organic carbon toc of the effluent was measured using a shimadzu lcsh toc analyzer this was determined by combustion with catalytic oxidation at 680 c using high purity oxygen gas at a flow rate of 190 ml min the apparatus had a non dispersive infrared detector calibration of the analyzer was attained with standard potassium hydrogen phthalate 99 5 solution the injection sample volume was 50 μl total suspended solids were determined by sewerage and sanitation company of bogotá eaab esp and taken from its monthly report of activities eab esp 2018 soluble iron was determined through the phenanthroline method by adding 80 μl of the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and 200 μl of the 1 10 phenanthroline solution were added to 1320 μl of the sample the ph of each cell was regulated with 400 μl of the sodium acetate solution the sample was homogenized and after 15 min of reaction in dark the absorbance reading at 510 nm was carried out the evolution of valsartan the model pollutant for the individual degradation in distilled water was followed using a uhplc thermoscientific dionex ultimate 3000 instrument equipped with an acclaim 120 rp c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm and a diode array detector the mobile phase was 10 46 44 v v v methanol acetonitrile formic acid 10 mm at ph 3 0 the chromatograph was run in isocratic mode at 0 4 ml min and the pollutant detected at 254 nm the accumulation of sonogenerated hydrogen peroxide was estimated by iodometry method text sm2 as reported by serna galvis et al 2015 the possible primary products of valsartan sonodegradation were identified by lc coupled to high resolution ms lc hrms using a hybrid quadrupole time of flight qtof analyzer for this purpose an approach based on common fragmentation pathway was applied assuming that most degradation products share the fragmentation pathway with the parent compound more details about the instrumental conditions as well as the elucidation strategy can be found in the following references ibáñez et al 2016 martínez pachón et al 2018 and supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 inability of the mwtp for complete pollutants removal el salitre mwtp has a pre treatment step screening unit and a primary treatment circuit coagulation flocculation and sedimentation units the pre treatment uses a bar to filter large solids and objects which are collected in dumpsters and disposed in landfills the primary treatment circuit conducts to removal of suspended solids and organic matter el salitre plant normally operates at 4 m3 s 350 000 m3 day with a removal efficiency of 40 biological oxygen demand and 60 of suspended solids eab esp 2018 table sm1 presents the basic global parameters of the considered effluent the mixture of seven days effluent samples it can be noted that the effluent has a medium organic charge due to the moderate removal efficiency of the plant as above reported meanwhile the target pollutants are contained at the concentrations reported in fig 1 in the effluent the valsartan and losartan antihypertensives are at the highest concentrations followed by benzoylecgonine cocaine metabolite the anti inflammatory diclofenac and the fluoroquinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin due to the very high consumption such substances or their parent compounds are vastly concentrated in wastewater and the treatment plant is unable to completely remove them botero coy et al 2018 for example losartan is an antihypertensive widely used in colombia indeed problems about its improper use related to over dose in daily practice have been found portilla et al 2017 ciprofloxacin is among the top 5 most common antibiotics in colombian hospitals of third generation alvarez et al 2016 and its presence in colombian hospital wastewater has been reported botero coy et al 2018 meanwhile cocaine is a highly consumed illicit drug in populated colombian cities such as bogotá consequently its main metabolite benzoylecgonine has a high prevalence in wastewaters bijlsma et al 2016 hernández et al 2015 in our previous work we studied the ability of conventional processes applied in el salitre mwtp to eliminate the emerging concern pollutants figure sm2 botero coy et al 2018 a limited efficiency of the treatment plant for the pollutants removal was observed in fact some pharmaceuticals concentration in the effluent were higher than in influent e g erythromycin metronidazole sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim which presented negative removal efficiencies in some cases mwtp can act as pollutants concentrators this situation is not exclusive for el salitre mwtp similar facts have been reported by lacey et al gros et al and jelic et al gros et al 2010 jelic et al 2010 thus the incomplete removals even the increasing of pollutants concentration by conventional processes in mwtp evidence the need of alternative complementary treatment technologies 3 2 degradation of the 17 emergent pollutants by ultrasound sonochemistry was applied to the effluent during 90 min to evaluate its degrading ability on the selected pollutants in the complex water therefore the evolution of each contaminant under study was followed fig 2 it is worthy to note that for a few compounds such as diclofenac sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin the ultrasound action increased their concentrations whereas for the rest of pollutants the concentration decreased with the treatment time due to the effluent contains suspended solids table sm1 some pollutants are sorbed on such solids it is reported that non ionic compounds tend to be highly sorbed onto organic matter through van der waals interactions whereas for those pollutants with polar and or charged functional groups their sorption is governed by the combination of electrostatic interactions and van der waals forces hyland et al 2012 in fact electrostatic interactions are determinant for the sorption of fluoroquinolone pharmaceuticals e g ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin on sewage solids ternes et al 2004 wu et al 2009 meanwhile diclofenac presents a medium affinity towards sewage solids berthod et al 2014 ternes et al 2004 in the case of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole although this pollutant has weak interactions it can experiment some sorption on such solids yang et al 2011 considering the sorption phenomena the results in fig 2 can be rationalized based on the physical and chemical effects of ultrasound the physical action of ultrasound i e turbulence and high shearing in the liquid medium by cavitation phenomena induces size reduction of solids and release sorbed pollutants gunduz 2009 torres palma et al 2017 zorba and sanin 2013 consequently the concentration of released substances i e ciprofloxacin norfloxacin diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole is increased it should be indicated that suspended solids can also induce the formation of cavitation bubbles mason and pétrier 2004 which can favor the sonochemical process application the removal of the pollutants can be associated to the chemical effects of the process as indicated in the introduction high frequency ultrasound produces radical species radicals can attack the pollutants decreasing their concentration fig 2 also it can be mentioned that the sorption on solids hiders the direct attack of radicals to sorbed compounds however when they are released such compounds are more available for sonodegradation in ultrasound degradation by pyrolysis as well as the interaction between pollutants and hydroxyl radical depends on their proximity to the cavitation bubbles such proximity is determined by the initial concentration and the hydrophobic character of the compounds torres palma and serna galvis 2018 then to evaluate the concentration feature the initial molarity of pollutants was calculated and the sonochemical degradation rate for each pollutant was measured table 1 interestingly upon ultrasound action the substances with the highest initial molar concentrations e g losartan valsartan and benzoylecgonine had faster degradation table 1 this is because a higher concentration favors the pollutant diffusion toward the cavitation bubble increasing the probability of contact with hydroxyl radicals torres palma and serna galvis 2018 for the evaluation of the hydrophobicity effect pairs of substances with close molar concentration valsartan benzoylecgonine clarithromycin irbesartan also azithromycin and carbamazepine cocaine were considered then their log kow values which are hydrophobicity indicators and degradation rates were compared table 1 from each pair the compound having the higher log kow i e the more hydrophobic presented larger degradation rate this means that the more hydrophobic pollutants in the effluent are faster degraded because they are nearer the cavitation bubbles and consequently more susceptible to experiment reaction with hydroxyl radicals a possible way to conjugate concentration and hydrophobicity is the arithmetic multiplication between these two factors which would denote the closeness to cavitation bubble in the sonochemical system indeed the plot of degradation rate vs c log kow i e concentration multiplied by hydrophobicity shows a very good correlation r 0 985 fig 3 this means that among a set of pollutants hydrophobic compounds and highly concentrated are faster degraded whereas the lowly concentrated and hydrophilic substances have very slow degradation rates additionally from groups of pollutants with similar hydrophobicity the more concentrated compounds will experiment high degradation rates meanwhile for compounds at similar concentration the degradation was higher with the increasing of the hydrophobic character of the substance regarding the pollutants released from solids by the physical action of ultrasound their degradation by hydroxyl radicals or pyrolysis could be plausible after a more prolonged action of the sonochemical process i e at treatment times higher than 90 min to better understand the chemical effects of ultrasonic process on pollutants the treatment of the model compound valsartan under controlled conditions was carried out such substance was selected considering its high hydrophobicity and concentration in the effluent sample table 1 furthermore valsartan represents a risk in the environment because it can be transformed into valsartan acid which is a very mobile and persistent compound berkner and thierbach 2014 thus valsartan degradation was initially performed in distilled water to avoid matrix interferences afterwards the role of suspended solids was also tested by means of valsartan spiking in effluent with and without solids text sm3 fig 4 presents the evolution of valsartan submitted to high frequency ultrasound in distilled water the process degraded 60 of the compound after 30 min of treatment in addition to the pollutant degradation the accumulation rate ra of hydrogen peroxide which is an indirect indicator of hydroxyl radical production ability of ultrasound eq 5 in both presence val and absence of valsartan bk was also measured fig 4 the ra in the presence of the pollutant is lower than in the absence indicating that the reaction of valsartan with sonogenerated radicals limits the h2o2 accumulation the structure of the degradation products elucidated by qtof ms indicates that they are formed from the attack of oh to tetrazole ring dp1 biphenyl moiety dp2 and pentanamide group dp3 dp4 and dp5 table 2 this indicates the high reactivity of such functional groups on valsartan toward the sonogenerated hydroxyl radical the attacks to tetrazole ring and biphenyl moiety are additions to π systems which are typical pathways of oh martínez pachón et al 2018 meanwhile the action on pentanamide can be described as an initial hydrogen abstraction by hydroxyl radical a common pathway reported for alkyl amides doan et al 2010 hayon et al 1970 and the posterior evolution to the oxidized forms of carbon on the alkyl chain consequently if valsartan a hydrophobic and highly concentrated pollutant in the mwtp is degraded by hydroxyl radical action it can be proposed that the other substances which are less concentrated and or more hydrophilic are also eliminated by the oh attacks regarding the role of suspended solids it must be indicated that they may have a dual effect extra cavitation bubbles can be formed thought trapped air inside of the solids mason and pétrier 2004 however solids can also provoke cavitation attenuation larrarte and françois 2012 then to evaluate the effect of suspended solids in the sonochemical process degradation of spiked valsartan in the effluent with and without solids was tested as seen in figure sm3 under work conditions the valsartan degradation is slightly favored in absence of solids nevertheless it is remarkable the ability of ultrasound to remove pollutants even in the presence of suspended solids fig 2 and figure sm3 on the other hand considering that the sonochemical reactor operation at 88 w l 1 represents high consumption of electrical energy degradation times longer than 90 min were not evaluated additionally taking into account that the hydrogen peroxide a sub product of ultrasonic process can be used to produce more radicals by addition of iron ions and light i e photo fenton based processes as an interesting option to achieve higher and faster elimination of pollutants and decrease the energy consumption respect to the sonochemical or photochemical processes acting alone torres et al 2007 2008a 2008b hence the addition of iron and light to the sonochemical process for the effluent treatment was evaluated 3 3 improvement of sonochemical degradation by addition of iron uva light and oxalic acid the pollutants removal by sonochemical process with addition of ferrous ions sono fenton ferrous ions plus light sono photo fenton or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid sono photo fenton oxalic acid was tested fig 5 shows the behavior of pollutants under the different systems it can be noted that in these processes the concentrations of diclofenac ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin the supposed sorbed compounds decreased as the treatment time increased under sono fenton and sono photo fenton treatments sulfamethoxazole concentration increased initially but it decreased as the processes was progressing remarkably in the sono photo fenton oxalic acid system after the first 30 min of treatment the concentration of sulfamethoxazole notably diminished from 0 37 to 0 14 μg l to determine the differences among the treatments the elimination of pollutants after 90 min was evaluated using two measures percentage of degradation pd and removed amount ra in ng table 3 thus three comparison criteria were applied total summation i e arithmetic addition of pd or ra values average i e arithmetic average of pd or ra and pondered elimination percentage calculated using eq 6 6 p o n d e r e d e l i m i n a t i o n i 1 17 c o x p d i i 1 17 c o i where co represents the initial concentration in μg l 1 table 3 shows that sonochemistry has negative values for the three criteria therefore from a general point of view such system had a predominance of the releasing effect over the degrading action in fact it has been reported that physical effects of ultrasound are able to break suspended solids from secondary effluents torres palma et al 2017 which is an advantage of ultrasound over other aops because it makes more available the released compounds for radicals attacks in contrast to ultrasound alone the other three systems exhibited positive values of the total summation average and pondered elimination percentage indicating the prevalence of degrading effects in these processes moreover for sono fenton and sono photo fenton the pollutant elimination criteria had close values whereas sono photo fenton oxalic acid exhibited higher numbers the addition of fe2 i e sono fenton improved the global pollutants elimination table 3 by the generation of more hydroxyl radicals mainly in the bulk of solution through the fenton reaction eq 7 ammar 2016 torres et al 2008b contributing to the elimination of both the released pollutants from solids and hydrophilic ones at the same time organic matter components in the effluent have carboxylic and polycarboxylate groups which can complex the produced fe3 eq 8 fujii et al 2014 hence a significant iron fraction can remain in a soluble form see figure sm4 soluble iron in the systems the uva light used for the sono photo fenton system had low interfering effects by the matrix components e g suspended solids as evidenced by the low absorbance of the water table sm1 and text sm4 thus the illumination of water with the uva lamp may photo regenerate fe2 eq 9 which in the oxidizing environment of ultrasound can be fastly returned to fe3 k 63 76 m 1s 1 eq 7 producing more radicals radical may also degrade the carboxylic moieties then the depletion of carboxylic groups by action of uva light eq 9 and radical plus the near neutral conditions i e ph 7 5 during process table sm2 lead to the formation of insoluble fe3 species eq 10 as evidenced by the decreasing of dissolved iron figure sm4 in the effluent case such blocking of the iron availability can limit the photo fenton process efficiency this would explain why sono photo fenton had no improvements respect to sono fenton system 7 fe2 h2o2 sonogenerated fe3 oh oh 8 fe3 rcoo organic matter fe rcoo 2 9 fe rcoo 2 uva fe2 r co2 10 fe3 3oh fe oh 3 s in the case of sono photo fenton oxalic acid process the iron iii precipitation is avoided by the carboxylic acid presence at considerable concentration 2 ppm oxalic acid is a strong complexing agent of iron keeping it in a soluble form as figure sm4 shown furthermore ferric oxalate complexes such as fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 are photoactive and promote the catalytic cycle of iron ammar 2016 pignatello et al 2006 this favors the generation of additional radicals for the pollutants degradation eq 11 and 12 also it is well known that the reaction constant k 3 1 104 m 1 s 1 of the ferrous oxalate complex with hydrogen peroxide eq 12 is higher than that reported for classical fenton reaction k 63 76 m 1 s 1 eq 7 pignatello et al 2006 prato garcia et al 2009 for these reasons the sono photo fenton oxalic acid presented the highest global removal of pollutants table 3 11 2fe c2o4 n 3 2n uva 2fe2 2n 1 c2o4 2 2co2 12 fe c2o4 h2o2 fe c2o4 oh oh to understand fundamental aspects of sono fenton sono photo fenton and sono photo fenton oxalic acid the treatment of valsartan in distilled water was also studied fig 6 a presents the comparison among the pseudo first order rate constant k1 for valsartan degradation by these processes figure sm5 depicts the control experiments from fig 6a it was evidenced an acceleration of the pollutant elimination by iron ii uva light and oxalic acid addition to ultrasound contrarily to the observed in wastewater in distilled water the degradation by sono photo fenton was higher than by sono fenton furthermore the ph of the solution during treatments reached values below 4 0 table sm2 at ph range 2 0 4 0 predominates the soluble iron form fe oh 2 eq 13 which has strong uv absorption facilitating the photo fenton reaction loures et al 2013 indeed when such iron iii form is irradiated by uva a ligand to metal charge transfer occurs involving the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and hydroxyl radical formation eq 14 the fe2 regenerated during irradiation interacts with sonogenerated hydrogen peroxide eq 7 producing more radicals which accelerate the valsartan degradation see sono photo fenton in fig 6a 13 fe3 h2o fe oh 2 h 14 fe oh 2 uva fe2 oh in the case of sono photo fenton oxalic acid system the k1 value was 40 higher than by sonolysis alone such result confirms the accelerating role of oxalic acid oxalate as iron ligand can increase the oh production in the bulk of solution according to eq 11 and 12 favoring in this way a faster and higher pollutant elimination besides the k1 determination during the treatments of valsartan the hydrogen peroxide accumulation rates ra for the different systems fig 6b were also established following the order sonochemistry sono fenton sono photo fenton sono photo fenton oxalic acid in sono fenton and sono photo fenton ra was lower than in sonochemistry indicating a higher feh2o2 interaction i e more production of oh and consequently an increasing in the valsartan degradation i e a higher k1 value fig 6a meanwhile the lowest hydrogen peroxide accumulation rate in the sono photo fenton oxalic acid system could be associated to the highest formation of additional oh eq 11 and 12 used to enhance the valsartan elimination and the possible reaction with oxalic acid finally it should be mentioned that the k1 and ra values in fig 6 are coherent with the results shown in table 3 for the whole set of pollutants confirming the improvement of degradation by the addition of iron ii uva light and oxalic acid to the sonochemical processes 4 conclusions this work showed that the conventional systems used in el salitre mwtp bogotá colombia partially removed the emerging contaminants under study in fact such systems can promote for some compounds a simple transference of pollutants from aqueous medium to other phase e g substances sorption on suspended solids on the contrary the sonochemical process led to the pollutants releasing from suspended solids additionally the interaction with the sonogenerated hydroxyl radical induced the degradation of both pharmaceuticals and illicit substances the ultrasonic elimination of pollutants seemed to be dependent on concentration and hydrophobicity parameters in fact the arithmetic multiplication between these two factors c log kow which was used to denote the closeness to cavitation bubble presented a good correlation with the contaminants degradation rate this means that those hydrophobic compounds found at high concentrations in the effluent e g losartan or valsartan are faster degraded whereas the low concentrated hydrophilic substances e g metronidazole or trimethoprim have very slow degradation rates the addition of iron ii uva light and oxalic acid to the sonochemical process significantly increased the pondered removal of the pollutants in the effluent thanks the production of extra hydroxyl radicals through reactions between iron and sonogenerated hydrogen peroxide the presence of oxalic acid or carboxylic groups in effluent organic matter makes iron more available for extra radicals formation in the bulk of solution with the subsequent improvement of pollutants elimination it can be pointed out that the ultrasonic system complemented with iron ii uva light and oxalic acid presented a strong potential for the pollutants elimination in real world wastewater matrices finally it is important to indicate that the feasibility of applying the high frequency ultrasound technique at wastewater treatment plant scale is hampered by its high electrical energy consumption and the low transduction efficiency however the fundamental aspects e g pollutants degradation enhancement by iron ii uva light and oxalic acid addition derived from sonochemistry are transferable to the other analogous systems based on the cavitation phenomena such as hydrodynamic cavitation which has lower costs for scaling up declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18993,the extensive use of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles for groundwater treatment has been limited in part because of their non selective reactivity and low mobility in aquatic environments herein we describe and explore progressive changes in the reactivity and migration of aqueous dispersed nzvi particles under an applied dc electric field due to the applied electric field with an intensity of about 1 v cm 1 the solution oxidation reduction potential orp remained as low as 200 mv for at least 32 days which was in agreement with the persistence of the reduced iron species mainly fe ii and led to substantially prolonged reactivity of the original nzvi the treatment of chlorinated ethenes dce pce tce was markedly faster individual chc compounds were eliminated with the same kinetics and no lesser chlorinated intermediates were accumulated following thus the direct dechlorination scheme when nzvi dispersion flows towards the anode through vertical laboratory columns filled with quartz sand significant enhancement of nzvi migration was recorded because of lower extent of nanoparticle aggregation and increased repulsion forces between the nanoparticles and the surface of silica dioxide the results of this study have significant consequences for groundwater remediation mainly for the treatment of slowly degradable dce in real chc contaminated groundwater where it could improve the reactivity the longevity and the migration of nzvi particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords nzvi reactivity migration electric field direct dechlorination enhanced properties 1 introduction over the past two decades nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles have been increasingly tested for their effectiveness and utilized as part of in situ remediation technologies for groundwater treatment elliott and zhang 2001 quinn et al 2005 tratnyek and johnson 2006 zhang 2003 the target contaminants are relatively oxidized organic chlorinated hydrocarbons like pce and tce quinn et al 2005 pcbs lowry and johnson 2004 zhuang et al 2011 inorganic cations klimkova et al 2011 anions such as arsenites kanel et al 2005 park et al 2009 chromates li et al 2008 nitrates sohn et al 2006 or sulphates macé et al 2006 and many other harmful substances despite the well demonstrated reactivity of nzvi particles with a large number of organic and inorganic pollutants zhao et al 2016 their full scale application is usually suppressed by their relatively low rate of flux in aquifers bennett et al 2010 their limited mobility and longevity and cost benefit related concerns non stabilized nzvi nanoparticles typically tend to aggregate and adhere to the surface of mineral grains making their migration limited to a maximum of a few meters from the point of subsurface applications bennett et al 2010 johnson et al 2009 moreover nzvi particles often display unpredictable reactivity in complex real environments where the low degree of reaction selectivity limits their transformation efficiency of the target contaminants fan et al 2016 therefore various surface modification strategies for nzvi particles have been developed to lessen their aggregation potential in water reduce inter particle interactions avoid adhesion to the surface of mineral grains and improve reactivity e g through stabilization of nzvi dispersion by commercially available polymers or anionic polyelectrolytes kim et al 2009 phenrat et al 2008 soukupova et al 2015 in spite of the proliferation of the research interest in these surface modification strategies the limited migration of nzvi particles in actual groundwater environments remains a critical shortcoming of the technology and a major hurdle in wide spread application of this technology chowdhury et al 2012 lin et al 2010 rosická and šembera 2013 the combination of electrokinetics with nzvi based technology has been proposed as a possible approach lima et al 2017 to overcoming the above mentioned limitations of nzvi mainly in low permeability media jones et al 2011 such as e g clayed soils reddy et al 2011 however by applying an electric field in an aqueous system several other phenomena like reduction of the adhesion force between the nzvi particles with the surfaces of mineral grains of an aquifer can occur which otherwise would cause significant nzvi retardation the changes in the ph of the solution induced by applied electric field affect the surface properties of both the minerals and the nanoparticles with the increasing ph the surface charge of the nzvi particles changes from positive through neutral to negative the larger the magnitudes of the surface charge of the minerals and the nanoparticles the larger the repulsive forces will become and the smaller the adsorption between the nanoparticles on the negatively charged minerals will be appel et al 2003 sposito 1998 the ph where the net particle charge is equal to zero i e point of zero charge pzc is one of the most important parameters for the description of the variable charged surfaces morais et al 1976 other phenomena such as electroosmosis electrophoresis and electromigration could occur affecting positively the transport of nzvi particles chowdhury et al 2012 as well as the migration of substances in both ionic and colloidal forms ho et al 1999a however their contribution in the environments where advective flow dominates seems to be rather negligible therefore an electric field was previously used for the induced migration of contaminants from their source to the treatment zone in low permeability porous media ho et al 1999a in an environment with low hydraulic conductivity or high degree of heterogeneity the contaminants were transported in the electric field owing to electrokinetics ho et al 1999b another important aspect of the nzvi combination with the dc electric field is the possibility of improving the in situ chemical reduction of the contaminants in groundwater electrically induced reduction was proposed to rejuvenate zvi particles in permeable reactive barriers where the zvi was passivated during nitrate reduction without an applied electric field leading to a significant decrease in reactivity luo et al 2010 when used for elimination of tce such combination could eliminate the formation of less chlorinated byproducts through the process of direct dechlorination i e by participation of evolved hydrogen huang and cheng 2012 the aim of this work was two fold 1 to improve the nzvi reactivity and longevity in groundwater of complex chemistry with strong focus on understanding the evolution and the role of nzvi corrosion products and 2 to demonstrate an alternative way to enhance the flux of nzvi particles in aquifer represented here by quartz sand using an applied electric field therefore we have focused on the effect of the applied electric field on the changes in nzvi reactivity and on the formation of specific reaction products in real chc contaminated groundwater with dominating presence of slowly degradable dce furthermore the electric voltage was used to reduce the adhesion force between nzvi particles and the surfaces of sedimentary rocks as well as to enhance their reactivity longevity in contaminated groundwater environments our hypothesis that the flux of the nzvi particles in the dc field will increase was experimentally determined through the laboratory columns filled with quartz sand and run in field relevant conditions i e with domination of advective flux throughout the experiments we used low concentration of nzvi i e 0 5 g l 1 in order to better demonstrate the positive effect of the dc field on the nzvi performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoparticles of zero valent iron commercial nzvi particles type nanofer 25s manufactured by nanoiron s r o czech republic were used in all of the studies described herein the nanoparticles are produced by solid state reduction of iron oxide powder filip et al 2014 and are subsequently stabilized by a biodegradable organic compound sodium polyacrylate 3 wt in an aqueous suspension 200 g l 1 the nzvi particles type nanofer 25s were characterized by a narrow particle size distribution with a mean diameter of 68 5 nm and standard deviation 24 9 nm the nzvi exhibited a large specific surface area of 25 m2 g 1 and a high fe0 content minimum of 90 filip et al 2014 soukupova et al 2015 2 2 contaminated water for the experiments contaminated groundwater was obtained from a contaminated industrial site karbox hořice v podkrkonoší czech republic the site located in a town was contaminated in the 1970s and 1980s by chlorinated ethenes which were released from an industrial activity the total area of contamination is approx 120 m 60 m geologically the site is part of the czech cretaceous basin divided into cenominian and lower turonian layers the quaternary cover is formed by a 6 m thick layer of loess and secondary loess separated from turonian sediments by about a meter thick layer of silty clays the groups of strata are tectonically afflicted and vertically shifted the site consists of five contaminated spots elongated in the direction of the groundwater flow the chlorinated ethenes hereafter chc concentration in groundwater reached 60 mg l 1 groundwater samples table s1 for experiments were taken from a well containing mainly 1 2 cis dce 16 3 mg l 1 hereafter dce pce 5 3 mg l 1 tce 1 9 mg l 1 and vinyl chloride 1 4 mg l 1 table s2 moreover several additional experiments were performed with other samples of groundwater containing lower content and different composition of chc see e g table s3 2 3 determination of point of zero charge pzc by potentiometric titration pzc is an important parameter to estimate both colloidal stability aggregation and sorption of nanoparticles to soil matrix to determine the surface charge of the used nzvi particles a titration curve was developed for three different ionic strengths of the background nacl electrolyte 0 01 m 0 1 m and 0 5 m nzvi was added into the solution s of specific nacl concentrations in distilled water to attain the target nzvi concentration of 660 mg l 1 the dispersion was stepwise titrated by 5 m naoh to increase the ph from initial value around 7 depending on ionic strength up to 11 after every addition of 5 μl of naoh the ph was measured by a multi 350i instrument wtw gmbh germany with a sentix 41 3 wtw gmbh germany electrode until no significant fluctuations were observed for the equilibrated solution the zeta potential was measured with a zetasizer nano zs apparatus model zen3601 malvern united kingdom 2 4 batch experiments the reactivity tests were performed in closed reactors volume 2 5 l equipped with an agitator ph and orp electrodes wtw sentix 41 3 and wtw sentix orp both from wtw gmbh germany a sampling port and two dc electrodes in a form of steel bars with a diameter of 8 mm see fig s1 for additional details primarily three different experimental setups were investigated i the reactor with added nzvi only labelled fe ii the reactor with both added nzvi and applied direct electric current labelled fe dc and iii the control reactor with neither nzvi nor dc electric current labelled cont further to understand the effect of dc electric current without nzvi a fourth reactor labelled cont dc was run in parallel the reactors were filled with site groundwater and at the beginning of the experiments time t 0 the nzvi particles were added by injecting the stock dispersion 200 g l 1 to establish nzvi concentration of 0 5 g l 1 i e concentration typical for pilot full scale experiments soukupova et al 2015 the reactors were tightly closed and continuously stirred throughout the entire reaction time of 32 days at prescribed time aqueous samples 24 ml were collected by a syringe through the sampling port situated at the top of the reactor sealed by a teflon o ring the concentration of chc was measured by cg ms varian saturn 2200 for the fe dc reactor the dc voltage 10 v was supplied by the dc generator ningbo zhongce dftek electronics co china and the electric current flowing through the reactor was measured by an ammeter vc960 digital multimeter voltcraft united kingdom 2 5 determination of fe oxidation similar batch experiments were set for the determination of the nzvi oxidation products due to the necessity to extract a significant portion of fe solids for detailed phase analysis 0 2 g and the necessity to open the reactors during sampling separate reactors were run for each reaction time intervals of 1 4 6 and 8 days i e a set of four identical reactors for parallel experiments in order to avoid significant changes in water chemistry and reaction kinetics by reactor opening subsequently 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy was used to determine the fe0 oxidation products during the course of the reaction period transmission 57fe mössbauer spectra on frozen samples i e to eliminate iron oxidation during measurement were collected using ms96 instrument in constant acceleration mode at 150 k with a 57co rh source 1 85 gbq and fast scintillation detector with yalo3 ce crystal isomer shift values were calibrated against an α fe foil spectra were fitted by lorentz functions using the computer program confit2000 the effects of non ideal absorber thickness and variable recoil free fractions for iron atoms in non equivalent structural sites of different phases were expected to be within experimental error hyperfine parameters 0 02 mm s 1 relative spectral area 2 2 6 column experiments cylindrical glass columns with the interior diameter of 6 5 cm and the length of 34 cm were used for the migration experiments see figs s2 and s3 for details the columns were filled with natural inert quartz sand of grain size in a range of 0 5 2 mm which gives an average porosity of 39 and hydraulic conductivity of 1 10 3 m s 1 determined by the method of variable pressure gradient danielson and sutherland 1986 the pore volume v 0 of the individual columns was determined by a pulse tracer test step injection with a non retarded tracer nacl three different column set ups were prepared for the experiments evaluating the effect of different surface charge on the nzvi migration labelled as k0 k and k simultaneously for the columns k and k the electrodes were connected to a dc source fig s2 so that the column is labelled according to the electrode on the column outflow for example for the k column a positive electrode anode was placed on the column inlet and a negative electrode cathode on the outlet the k0 column was run without an electrical current for comparison the initial electric current flowing through the columns was 1 30 ma for k and 1 25 ma for k columns after the introduction of nzvi the measured amperage increased rapidly due to the increase of the conductivity to a value above 7 ma e g 7 6 ma for k and 7 3 ma for k columns these elevated amperages then remained constant throughout the experiment 0 2 ma and corresponded to a flow density of 0 23 ma cm 2 flow of the nzvi suspension in deionized water through the vertical columns was facilitated by a peristaltic circulation pumps pcd825 cerpadla kouril czech republic set to a flow of 66 ml min 1 measuring cells with a volume of 105 ml were placed on the outlet from the columns top end and were equipped with electrodes for measuring the ph sentix 41 3 wtw gmbh germany oxidation reduction potential sentix orp wtw gmbh germany and conductivity tetracon 325 wtw gmbh germany the values of the parameters were recorded continuously at intervals of 1 min using a multi 350i wtw gmbh germany instrument for the column experiments the nzvi suspension was dosed into the main flow from a stock suspension 4 5 g l 1 using the dosing pump the flow set to 6 ml min 1 so that the final concentration of nzvi in the column inlet was 0 375 g l 1 i e being close to concentration used in field scale experiments soukupova et al 2015 the stock nzvi suspension was kept under ar in order to minimize nzvi oxidation during experiment the electric field in the columns was created by a pair of stainless steel disk electrodes 6 cm in diameter placed at both ends of the columns the electrodes were energized with a dc voltage of 30 v ningbo zhongce dftek electronics co china and the current flowing through the column was measured by an ammeter vc960 digital multimeter voltcraft united kingdom eluate was collected every approx 900 ml from the columns outlet and was acidified and oxidized by combination of concentrated hcl and h2o2 prior analysis for the total concentration of fe by icp icp oes perkin elmer optima 2100 dv at the end of the column experiment the column saturated with water was frozen cut to 2 5 cm slices and samples analyzed for total fe content 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of nzvi in dc field batch experiments 3 1 1 changes in physicochemical parameters of water induced by using of electric field oxidation reduction potential is the basic parameter describing the ongoing oxidation reduction reactions linked to the transformations of both fe and the contaminants on the other hand at low concentrations of nzvi the measured orp can be affected by various factors like nzvi adsorption on electrode here significantly diminished by surface modification of nzvi and production of dissolved h2 and fe2 caused by nzvi corrosion shi et al 2011 fig 1 a shows orp curves for three different reactors fe fe dc and cont in the reactor without both nzvi and the applied dc field cont the initial orp value for the contaminated water of about 400 mv all values against the standard hydrogen electrode remained essentially unchanged during the whole course of the experiment fig 1a different trends were recorded for both reactors with nzvi fe and fe dc in the case of the fe reactor solution orp decreased rapidly after nzvi addition to approximately 0 mv before reaching a minimum value of about 100 mv after 4 days compared to majority of published studies shi et al 2011 shi et al 2015 such a small change of orp is given by complex character of real contaminated water and low concentration of applied nzvi klimkova et al 2011 the initial decrease was followed by a subsequent slow increase due to gradual nzvi oxidation and loss of its reactivity similar effect is typical for low nzvi concentration shi et al 2011 this interpretation of the orp versus time data is consistent with the measurement of fe0 content in iron nanoparticles see below and in fig s4 and comparable with previously published data for low nzvi dosage orp similar to the initial value was achieved within 30 days which indicated that the whole zero valent fe was oxidized in this particular contaminated water in case of the fe dc reactor significantly lower values of orp were observed initially in the presence of the applied dc field the orp decreased to a value below 200 mv and remained essentially constant during the whole experiment i e 32 days it suggests the persisting existence of the reductive species chowdhury et al 2012 which is again consistent with the measurement of the iron speciation in nzvi particles see below nevertheless such value of orp would not be sufficiently low for efficient reductive technologies of water treatment shi et al 2015 the effect of dc without nzvi on the contaminated water was tested in the cont dc experiment fig s5 dc alone caused a significant decrease of orp being comparable to the effect of nzvi in combination with dc i e the fe dc reactor in most cases a similar decrease in orp was observed for nzvi free solutions with dissolved h2 shi et al 2011 therefore having taken into account the electrolysis of water by the dc field eq 1 and eq 2 below we can conclude that the dc field has a primarily reductive effect on the contaminated water through the evolution of h2 h and thus can significantly participate in the process of reductive dechlorination of chc the other parameter describing the evolution of the reaction progress is the ph fig 1b in the case of the reactor with only nzvi fe a slight increase in the ph was observed compared to the cont experiment i e from 6 99 to 7 5 followed by a slow decrease over the whole duration of the experiment i e opposite trend as observed for orp fig 1a similarly as in the case of orp the negligible effect of the used nzvi on the ph is given by low nzvi concentration klimkova et al 2011 on the other hand the experiment in the fe dc reactor showed a significant increase of the ph to a value of 9 3 and the ph remained high but with a decreasing trend until the end of the experiment this is a direct result of the applied dc field see also an independent evaluation of the dc field alone in fig s5 being consistent with the electrolysis of water according to eq 1 and eq 2 below supporting the continued fe 0 mediated reduction of water to hydrogen gas and hydroxide the results of the ph and orp measurement are consistent with the expected evolution of the aqueous solution when the dc electric field is introduced leading to the electrolysis of water i e by combination of the two or three reactions below if no other ions are present in significant concentrations the oxidation of water occurs on the anode i e positive electrode according to the reaction 1 h2o 2h ½o2 2e leading to the acidification of the solution around anode in contrast chemical reduction of water occurs on the cathode according to the reaction 2 h2o e ½h2 oh which tends to an increase of the ph fig 1b obviously the amount of the released ions depends on the passing current faraday s law says that during the passing of a 1 ma s there is a release of 10 3 f 1 ions i e 10 8 mol of h or oh most of these ions reach the opposite electrode causing an increase in the conductivity of the solution even though there is a partial recombination of these ions along the way moreover if the water contains dissolved oxygen its reduction occurs on the cathode according to the equation 3 ½o2 2h 2e h2o which is the reverse process to the reaction 1 and thereby leading to a decrease of orp fig 1a 3 1 2 products of nzvi oxidation mössbauer spectroscopy fig s4 has been used as a unique tool to identify and quantify different oxidation states and speciation of fe namely fe 0 as the α fe bcc structure fe ii and fe iii as a green rust fe2 4fe3 2 oh 12 co3 3h2o fe iii as goethite feooh and a mixed fe ii fe iii as fe3o4 magnetite in the original nzvi particles and in the reaction products the original nzvi particles contained mainly fe 0 with about 12 fe iii fig s4 this portion of the oxidized fe was a residual from the nzvi manufacturing and or as an artifact from the preparation of an aqueous solution filip et al 2014 during the experiment content of fe 0 tended to a gradual decline due to its oxidation in the fe and fe dc reactors after approximately 4 6 days the fe 0 content decreased to zero i e below the detection limit in the reactor without dc from the observed decrease of fe 0 in both the fe and fe dc reactors which have highly comparable kinetics fig 1c d and s4 we can concluded that fe 0 oxidation kinetics are not significantly affected by the presence of the dc field but is faster than nzvi corrosion in distilled water filip et al 2014 however the principal difference inheres in the mechanism of fe 0 oxidation fe ii and partly fe iii in the form of green rust was the major product of fe 0 oxidation in the early stages of the experiment fig s4 which is in agreement with previously published studies for specific conditions hwang and shin 2013 but contrary to pure water where fe oh 2 was identified as a primary corrosion product filip et al 2014 after 4 days the fe ii content was 60 plus 26 as fe iii also in green rust phase and 14 of iron atoms remained in the form of α fe fig 1c and d and the kinetics of its formation was independent of the presence of the applied dc field however the subsequent oxidation transformation of green rust was observed to vary significantly with and without the applied dc field in case of the fe reactor fe ii was observed to be fully oxidized to fe iii in about 8 days which corresponded with the observed kinetics of the chc reduction and the changes in orp however in comparison the fe dc reactor showed a distinctively slower decrease of fe ii concentration and even after 8 days its content was still about 30 of all iron atoms in the reaction fig 1d this was accompanied by a significantly lower value of orp fig 1a the most significant difference between the two experiments was in the composition of the final oxidation products after 8 days in case of the fe reactor the end products were fe iii oxides and hydroxides represented mainly by goethite feooh as revealed by mössbauer spectroscopy fig s4 which is a typical product of nzvi corrosion in real contaminated water pullin et al 2017 for the fe dc reactor no fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides were formed and the final products were determined as magnetite and green rust fig 1d and fig s4 such dramatic changes in the iron speciation when the dc electric field is applied could elucidate the changes in the nzvi reactivity see below the persistence of iron in a low oxidation state can thus prolong the nzvi performance in groundwater as it is typical e g for combined nano biotechnological groundwater treatment němeček et al 2016 3 1 3 combined effect of nzvi with electric field on dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons the experimental set up for the slowly degradable dce in chc contaminated water was chosen deliberately in the presence of small nzvi concentration in order to better demonstrate the expected positive effect of the applied dc electric field see table s2 for details in changes of particular chc in all reactors for the fe reactor only a small decrease of chc occurred compared to the cont reactor fig 2 a given the low nzvi concentration initially a relatively fast but short lived decrease of orp see above was observed caused by a limited source of electrons from the nzvi oxidation representing conditions insufficient for the complete dechlorination of chc and consequently the extent of degradation was therefore low i e comparable to cont reactor a significantly different trend was observed for the fe dc reactor in this case a steady decrease in chc concentration was observed throughout the course of the experiment after 32 days the chc content was determined to be only 2 of the original value the rate constant of chc decrease over the first 20 days was determined to be 0 158 day 1 according to the first order kinetics fig 2b it is also important to note the development of particular chc compounds in the fe dc reactor see fig 2b and fig s5 for less contaminated water since their concentrations at the beginning of the reaction varied significantly table s2 the concentration trends were related to their initial amount at the beginning of the reaction a slightly lower efficiency for dce degradation was determined compared to tce which confirmed a well known effect of zvi mediated dechlorination being a function of the degree of chlorination e g pce tce dce vc vogel et al 1987 the calculated degradation rate constants were very similar from 0 116 pce through 0 130 tce and 0 163 dce to 0 184 vc day 1 however the results exhibited quite a different course from the fe reactor in which tce was temporarily produced and dce remained until the end of the experiment at a relative concentration c c0 of approximately 0 40 fig 2c in both the fe and the fe dc reactors the concentration of pce declined between 0 and 15 days but it was steady after day 15 which implied an apparent loss of the nzvi reactivity contrary to previously published studies elliott and zhang 2001 the pce dechlorination was slower than the dechlorination of dce with the application of the dc field i e in fe dc reactor cf fig 2b and c in such highly contaminated water with dominant dce for less contaminated water the higher rate of pce dce tce dechlorination was observed in fe dc reactor fig s5 the nearly identical rates observed for all chcs indicate a direct dechlorination scheme arnold and roberts 2000 which is characterized by highly comparable rate constants this is one of the main differences from other studies where nzvi was used for dechlorination of chc němeček et al 2016 in order to shed light on the mechanism of chc dechlorination we performed additional experiments applying dc alone to variously contaminated groundwater i e cont dc reactors the observed trends for particular chc compounds are nearly identical to those in the fe dc reactors see mainly fig s5c but the effect of dc alone is generally weaker than the combination of nzvi with the dc field compared to the effect of nzvi alone there was either no or only limited formation of less chlorinated compounds which is again similar to the fe dc reactor as a result the dc field obviously promotes direct dechlorination of all chc compounds present in the studied water by generated h2 i e following the direct dechlorination scheme the dechlorination of chc is supported by the observed increase of chloride concentrations in both fe and fe dc reactors table s1 and also by the significant increase of both ethane and ethene in the fe dc reactor see the results of additional experiment in table s3 the dechlorination is thus evidently driven by both nzvi feii oxidation huang and cheng 2012 i e under dc the surface of nzvi is obviously better protected against corrosion luo et al 2010 and the dissolved iron remains in the reduced form mainly as fe ii for longer time němeček et al 2016 and generated h2 on cathode see eq 2 above huang and cheng 2012 this was investigated by changing dc 5 and 10 v both being above stability of water fig s6 the concentration of pce was significantly reduced at both 5 and 10 v in the presence of nzvi with the same rate of pce reduction the nzvi alone was less efficient under the same experimental conditions further increase in the potential i e when above stability of water leads to the same reactivity in combination with nzvi but it could markedly decrease the lifetime of electrodes the role of other solid species namely magnetite seems to be rather negligible in the observed dechlorination mechanism as there is no evident change in the dechlorination kinetics when magnetite appears cf figs 1d and 2b which is supported by previously observed rather slow kinetics of abiotic reduction of chc by magnetite lee and batchelor 2002 3 2 migration of nzvi column experiments 3 2 1 breakthrough of fe in all of the column experiments water with an initial nzvi concentration of 0 375 g l 1 was passed through the column over a timeframe equivalent to 27 pore volumes v 0 lasting typically for 6 7 h the concentration of total fe at the column outlet was measured at regular intervals throughout the experiment the breakthrough curves for the fe concentration are shown in fig 3 in the case of nzvi migration without an applied dc field i e k0 column the output concentration of total fe was low with c c0 on the order of few percent i e up to 4 3 being consistent with other nzvi particles used in comparable experiments soukupova et al 2015 similarly for the k configuration a negative electrode was present on the outlet from the column and a positive electrode at the inlet the output concentration of total fe declined further with a maximum of only 0 2 the positive anode at the column inlet caused the ph decrease and the surface charge of nzvi turned to a positive value the positively charged nzvi particles were probably attracted to the negatively charged silica dioxide and tended to aggregate therefore their migration ability was significantly reduced compared to k0 configuration the course of fe migration through the column was markedly different when the electrodes were placed in the opposite configuration e g negative cathode at inlet and positive anode at outlet after 8 v 0 a linear increase in fe concentration in the output was observed which ultimately reached 60 of its input concentration by the end of the experiment evidently induced by the introduction of the negative cathode the negative charge of the nzvi particles increased the repulsion forces between the nanoparticles and the surface of silica dioxide which significantly enhanced the nzvi migration potential the distribution of fe within the particular columns is better demonstrated by fe concentration profile fig 3b and visualized for k column fig 3c more homogenous fe concentration profile was observed for k column compared to k0 and k columns where nearly no nzvi was detected close to the outlet because the migration experiments in the columns were carried out at ionic strength typical for common groundwater i e 0 01 m the surface charge of nzvi can be approximated by determined titration curve for 0 01 m fig s7 and text s1 this shows that the nanoparticle charge was negative if the ph at the column outflow exceeded 7 5 as it was for the vast majority of measured points and the tendency for the nanoparticles to adsorb on soil matrix which was also negatively charged sposito 2008 was reduced higher ph i e when negatively charged electrode is at the inlet to the column caused more negative surface charge and repulsion of the nanoparticles which decreased their tendency for agglomeration rosická and šembera 2013 and allowed their easy migration through the column this is further confirmed below by evaluation changes in the ph and orp nevertheless the electrokinetic mechanisms are orders of magnitude weaker than the used advective flux jones et al 2011 reddy et al 2011 3 2 2 induced changes in ph values significant differences in the trend of the measured ph breakthrough curve were observed depending on the applied electric field fig s8 in the case of the k0 column a slight increase in ph values from 7 8 to 8 0 standard units was observed after insertion of the nzvi particles subsequently over time the ph very slowly decreased back to its initial value of 7 8 for the k column the ph increased significantly at the beginning of the experiment because of the reduction of water and the formation of oh ions on the cathode soukupova et al 2015 which was located at the outlet of the column see eq 2 above after passing of about 2 v 0 the increasing trend of the ph gradually decreased back to its initial value this can be explained by flowing of low ph water i e generated on the vicinity of anode where formation of h ions take place to cathode by this process the initial ph decrease was neutralized at the column outflow an opposite trend was noted in the k column as a result of the anode being installed in the vicinity of the measuring cell a decrease in the ph to a value of 7 4 standard units was observed followed by a rise to 7 6 standard units owing to a neutralization effect similar to that observed for the k column since we determined the pzc to be close to 7 5 fig s7 it can be assumed that for the environmental conditions with the ph values below 7 5 the surface of the nzvi was positively charged or uncharged and migration to the anode occurred only when the ph reached 7 6 or higher i e approximately after passing of 4 v 0 the migration of nzvi to the anode occurred which was reflected in the increase of the total fe concentration at the column outlet fig 3a and the fe profile in the column fig 3b and c 3 2 3 induced changes in redox potential and conductivity the observed changes in the orp were comparable for both experimental columns k and k with an applied dc field and were significantly different from the column without the dc field k0 fig s9 because of the short experimental time the oxidation reduction processes of nzvi were negligible and the corresponding orp breakthrough curve for k0 was relatively constant application of the dc field decreased the orp by about 300 mv and reached the value approximately 50 mv identical for both k and k set ups the orp decrease was caused by the elimination of dissolved oxygen and the chemical reduction of water that occurred on the cathode see eq 2 and eq 3 immediately after commencing the application of the electrical current the initial density of the dc field was low and the oxygen reduction was insignificant however during the passage of the first pore volume the dc field intensity increased and the oxygen concentration was further reduced in the vicinity of the cathode for the k column where the cathode was placed on the outlet of the column this effect was observed at the end of the first v 0 passing through the column for the k column the lower orp solution generated at the cathode needed to pass through the column and reached the measuring cell after one additional v 0 a similar trend was observed for the electrical conductivity of the solution passing through the columns the initial solution had a conductivity of 200 μs cm 1 similarly to orp in the case of the k0 column no change in the conductivity was observed during the experiment in this case the interaction of nzvi was insignificant to elicit a noticeable influence on the water conductivity on the other hand a 6 fold increase in the conductivity was observed for the k and k columns with dc current applied fig s10 the electric current evidently led to ionization of the water inside the column and created a more conductive environment soukupova et al 2015 therefore changes in conductivity corresponded to the observed increase in electrical current passing through columns 4 conclusions the application of an electric field with an intensity of about 1 v cm 1 represents a unique and simple strategy for enhancing the reactivity and migration properties of nzvi although the electrophoresis enhanced transport of nzvi particles was previously described see e g chowdhury et al 2012 we demonstrated the validity and advantages of such an approach in field relevant conditions i e with advective flow and concentrations of commercial nzvi particles similar to conditions typical for pilot full scale applications of such technology due to the applied dc current the orp solution remained significantly lower and the nzvi reactivity was substantially prolonged such treatment of chlorinated solvents appeared to be markedly faster when individual chcs were eliminated with very similar kinetics and with no lesser chlorinated intermediates being accumulated this observation has significant consequences for groundwater remediation where it could improve the reactivity longevity as well as migration of nzvi particles off the application wells with the possibly enhanced mobility even through low permeable zones without the need for further stabilization of nzvi dispersion by surface active agents see e g phenrat et al 2008 therefore it could decrease the number of drilled wells needed for remediation and the applied nzvi particle concentration making the cost of the technology lower the future study based on the application of this technology on several contaminated sites will include the demonstration of using the dc electric field on enhanced nzvi particles action radius and length of reactivity in field conditions of pilot tests declarations of

18993,the extensive use of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles for groundwater treatment has been limited in part because of their non selective reactivity and low mobility in aquatic environments herein we describe and explore progressive changes in the reactivity and migration of aqueous dispersed nzvi particles under an applied dc electric field due to the applied electric field with an intensity of about 1 v cm 1 the solution oxidation reduction potential orp remained as low as 200 mv for at least 32 days which was in agreement with the persistence of the reduced iron species mainly fe ii and led to substantially prolonged reactivity of the original nzvi the treatment of chlorinated ethenes dce pce tce was markedly faster individual chc compounds were eliminated with the same kinetics and no lesser chlorinated intermediates were accumulated following thus the direct dechlorination scheme when nzvi dispersion flows towards the anode through vertical laboratory columns filled with quartz sand significant enhancement of nzvi migration was recorded because of lower extent of nanoparticle aggregation and increased repulsion forces between the nanoparticles and the surface of silica dioxide the results of this study have significant consequences for groundwater remediation mainly for the treatment of slowly degradable dce in real chc contaminated groundwater where it could improve the reactivity the longevity and the migration of nzvi particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords nzvi reactivity migration electric field direct dechlorination enhanced

pollutants zhao et al 2016 their full scale application is usually suppressed by their relatively low rate of flux in aquifers bennett et al 2010 their limited mobility and longevity and cost benefit related concerns non stabilized nzvi nanoparticles typically tend to aggregate and adhere to the surface of mineral grains making their migration limited to a maximum of a few meters from the point of subsurface applications bennett et al 2010 johnson et al 2009 moreover nzvi particles often display unpredictable reactivity in complex real environments where the low degree of reaction selectivity limits their transformation efficiency of the target contaminants fan et al 2016 therefore various surface modification strategies for nzvi particles have been developed to lessen their aggregation potential in water reduce inter particle interactions avoid adhesion to the surface of mineral grains and improve reactivity e g through stabilization of nzvi dispersion by commercially available polymers or anionic polyelectrolytes kim et al 2009 phenrat et al 2008 soukupova et al 2015 in spite of the proliferation of the research interest in these surface modification strategies the limited migration of nzvi particles in actual groundwater environments remains a critical shortcoming of the technology and a major hurdle in wide spread application of this technology chowdhury et al 2012 lin et al 2010 rosická and šembera 2013 the combination of electrokinetics with nzvi based technology has been proposed as a possible approach lima et al 2017 to overcoming the above mentioned limitations of nzvi mainly in low permeability media jones et al 2011 such as e g clayed soils reddy et al 2011 however by applying an electric field in an aqueous system several other phenomena like reduction of the adhesion force between the nzvi particles with the surfaces of mineral grains of an aquifer can occur which otherwise would cause significant nzvi retardation the changes in the ph of the solution induced by applied electric field affect the surface properties of both the minerals and the nanoparticles with the increasing ph the surface charge of the nzvi particles changes from positive through neutral to negative the larger the magnitudes of the surface charge of the minerals and the nanoparticles the larger the repulsive forces will become and the smaller the adsorption between the nanoparticles on the negatively charged minerals will be appel et al 2003 sposito 1998 the ph where the net particle charge is equal to zero i e point of zero charge pzc is one of the most important parameters for the description of the variable charged surfaces morais et al 1976 other phenomena such as electroosmosis electrophoresis and electromigration could occur affecting positively the transport of nzvi particles chowdhury et al 2012 as well as the migration of substances in both ionic and colloidal forms ho et al 1999a however their contribution in the environments where advective flow dominates seems to be rather negligible therefore an electric field was previously used for the induced migration of contaminants from their source to the treatment zone in low permeability porous media ho et al 1999a in an environment with low hydraulic conductivity or high degree of heterogeneity the contaminants were transported in the electric field owing to electrokinetics ho et al 1999b another important aspect of the nzvi combination with the dc electric field is the possibility of improving the in situ chemical reduction of the contaminants in groundwater electrically induced reduction was proposed to rejuvenate zvi particles in permeable reactive barriers where the zvi was passivated during nitrate reduction without an applied electric field leading to a significant decrease in reactivity luo et al 2010 when used for elimination of tce such combination could eliminate the formation of less chlorinated byproducts through the process of direct dechlorination i e by participation of evolved hydrogen huang and cheng 2012 the aim of this work was two fold 1 to improve the nzvi reactivity and longevity in groundwater of complex chemistry with strong focus on understanding the evolution and the role of nzvi corrosion products and 2 to demonstrate an alternative way to enhance the flux of nzvi particles in aquifer represented here by quartz sand using an applied electric field therefore we have focused on the effect of the applied electric field on the changes in nzvi reactivity and on the formation of specific reaction products in real chc contaminated groundwater with dominating presence of slowly degradable dce furthermore the electric voltage was used to reduce the adhesion force between nzvi particles and the surfaces of sedimentary rocks as well as to enhance their reactivity longevity in contaminated groundwater environments our hypothesis that the flux of the nzvi particles in the dc field will increase was experimentally determined through the laboratory columns filled with quartz sand and run in field relevant conditions i e with domination of advective flux throughout the experiments we used low concentration of nzvi i e 0 5 g l 1 in order to better demonstrate the positive effect of the dc field on the nzvi performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoparticles of zero valent iron commercial nzvi particles type nanofer 25s manufactured by nanoiron s r o czech republic were used in all of the studies described herein the nanoparticles are produced by solid state reduction of iron oxide powder filip et al 2014 and are subsequently stabilized by a biodegradable organic compound sodium polyacrylate 3 wt in an aqueous suspension 200 g l 1 the nzvi particles type nanofer 25s were characterized by a narrow particle size distribution with a mean diameter of 68 5 nm and standard deviation 24 9 nm the nzvi exhibited a large specific surface area of 25 m2 g 1 and a high fe0 content minimum of 90 filip et al 2014 soukupova et al 2015 2 2 contaminated water for the experiments contaminated groundwater was obtained from a contaminated industrial site karbox hořice v podkrkonoší czech republic the site located in a town was contaminated in the 1970s and 1980s by chlorinated ethenes which were released from an industrial activity the total area of contamination is approx 120 m 60 m geologically the site is part of the czech cretaceous basin divided into cenominian and lower turonian layers the quaternary cover is formed by a 6 m thick layer of loess and secondary loess separated from turonian sediments by about a meter thick layer of silty clays the groups of strata are tectonically afflicted and vertically shifted the site consists of five contaminated spots elongated in the direction of the groundwater flow the chlorinated ethenes hereafter chc concentration in groundwater reached 60 mg l 1 groundwater samples table s1 for experiments were taken from a well containing mainly 1 2 cis dce 16 3 mg l 1 hereafter dce pce 5 3 mg l 1 tce 1 9 mg l 1 and vinyl chloride 1 4 mg l 1 table s2 moreover several additional experiments were performed with other samples of groundwater containing lower content and different composition of chc see e g table s3 2 3 determination of point of zero charge pzc by potentiometric titration pzc is an important parameter to estimate both colloidal stability aggregation and sorption of nanoparticles to soil matrix to determine the surface charge of the used nzvi particles a titration curve was developed for three different ionic strengths of the background nacl electrolyte 0 01 m 0 1 m and 0 5 m nzvi was added into the solution s of specific nacl concentrations in distilled water to attain the target nzvi concentration of 660 mg l 1 the dispersion was stepwise titrated by 5 m naoh to increase the ph from initial value around 7 depending on ionic strength up to 11 after every addition of 5 μl of naoh the ph was measured by a multi 350i instrument wtw gmbh germany with a sentix 41 3 wtw gmbh germany electrode until no significant fluctuations were observed for the equilibrated solution the zeta potential was measured with a zetasizer nano zs apparatus model zen3601 malvern united kingdom 2 4 batch experiments the reactivity tests were performed in closed reactors volume 2 5 l equipped with an agitator ph and orp electrodes wtw sentix 41 3 and wtw sentix orp both from wtw gmbh germany a sampling port and two dc electrodes in a form of steel bars with a diameter of 8 mm see fig s1 for additional details primarily three different experimental setups were investigated i the reactor with added nzvi only labelled fe ii the reactor with both added nzvi and applied direct electric current labelled fe dc and iii the control reactor with neither nzvi nor dc electric current labelled cont further to understand the effect of dc electric current without nzvi a fourth reactor labelled cont dc was run in parallel the reactors were filled with site groundwater and at the beginning of the experiments time t 0 the nzvi particles were added by injecting the stock dispersion 200 g l 1 to establish nzvi concentration of 0 5 g l 1 i e concentration typical for pilot full scale experiments soukupova et al 2015 the reactors were tightly closed and continuously stirred throughout the entire reaction time of 32 days at prescribed time aqueous samples 24 ml were collected by a syringe through the sampling port situated at the top of the reactor sealed by a teflon o ring the concentration of chc was measured by cg ms varian saturn 2200 for the fe dc reactor the dc voltage 10 v was supplied by the dc generator ningbo zhongce dftek electronics co china and the electric current flowing through the reactor was measured by an ammeter vc960 digital multimeter voltcraft united kingdom 2 5 determination of fe oxidation similar batch experiments were set for the determination of the nzvi oxidation products due to the necessity to extract a significant portion of fe solids for detailed phase analysis 0 2 g and the necessity to open the reactors during sampling separate reactors were run for each reaction time intervals of 1 4 6 and 8 days i e a set of four identical reactors for parallel experiments in order to avoid significant changes in water chemistry and reaction kinetics by reactor opening subsequently 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy was used to determine the fe0 oxidation products during the course of the reaction period transmission 57fe mössbauer spectra on frozen samples i e to eliminate iron oxidation during measurement were collected using ms96 instrument in constant acceleration mode at 150 k with a 57co rh source 1 85 gbq and fast scintillation detector with yalo3 ce crystal isomer shift values were calibrated against an α fe foil spectra were fitted by lorentz functions using the computer program confit2000 the effects of non ideal absorber thickness and variable recoil free fractions for iron atoms in non equivalent structural sites of different phases were expected to be within experimental error hyperfine parameters 0 02 mm s 1 relative spectral area 2 2 6 column experiments cylindrical glass columns with the interior diameter of 6 5 cm and the length of 34 cm were used for the migration experiments see figs s2 and s3 for details the columns were filled with natural inert quartz sand of grain size in a range of 0 5 2 mm which gives an average porosity of 39 and hydraulic conductivity of 1 10 3 m s 1 determined by the method of variable pressure gradient danielson and sutherland 1986 the pore volume v 0 of the individual columns was determined by a pulse tracer test step injection with a non retarded tracer nacl three different column set ups were prepared for the experiments evaluating the effect of different surface charge on the nzvi migration labelled as k0 k and k simultaneously for the columns k and k the electrodes were connected to a dc source fig s2 so that the column is labelled according to the electrode on the column outflow for example for the k column a positive electrode anode was placed on the column inlet and a negative electrode cathode on the outlet the k0 column was run without an electrical current for comparison the initial electric current flowing through the columns was 1 30 ma for k and 1 25 ma for k columns after the introduction of nzvi the measured amperage increased rapidly due to the increase of the conductivity to a value above 7 ma e g 7 6 ma for k and 7 3 ma for k columns these elevated amperages then remained constant throughout the experiment 0 2 ma and corresponded to a flow density of 0 23 ma cm 2 flow of the nzvi suspension in deionized water through the vertical columns was facilitated by a peristaltic circulation pumps pcd825 cerpadla kouril czech republic set to a flow of 66 ml min 1 measuring cells with a volume of 105 ml were placed on the outlet from the columns top end and were equipped with electrodes for measuring the ph sentix 41 3 wtw gmbh germany oxidation reduction potential sentix orp wtw gmbh germany and conductivity tetracon 325 wtw gmbh germany the values of the parameters were recorded continuously at intervals of 1 min using a multi 350i wtw gmbh germany instrument for the column experiments the nzvi suspension was dosed into the main flow from a stock suspension 4 5 g l 1 using the dosing pump the flow set to 6 ml min 1 so that the final concentration of nzvi in the column inlet was 0 375 g l 1 i e being close to concentration used in field scale experiments soukupova et al 2015 the stock nzvi suspension was kept under ar in order to minimize nzvi oxidation during experiment the electric field in the columns was created by a pair of stainless steel disk electrodes 6 cm in diameter placed at both ends of the columns the electrodes were energized with a dc voltage of 30 v ningbo zhongce dftek electronics co china and the current flowing through the column was measured by an ammeter vc960 digital multimeter voltcraft united kingdom eluate was collected every approx 900 ml from the columns outlet and was acidified and oxidized by combination of concentrated hcl and h2o2 prior analysis for the total concentration of fe by icp icp oes perkin elmer optima 2100 dv at the end of the column experiment the column saturated with water was frozen cut to 2 5 cm slices and samples analyzed for total fe content 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of nzvi in dc field batch experiments 3 1 1 changes in physicochemical parameters of water induced by using of electric field oxidation reduction potential is the basic parameter describing the ongoing oxidation reduction reactions linked to the transformations of both fe and the contaminants on the other hand at low concentrations of nzvi the measured orp can be affected by various factors like nzvi adsorption on electrode here significantly diminished by surface modification of nzvi and production of dissolved h2 and fe2 caused by nzvi corrosion shi et al 2011 fig 1 a shows orp curves for three different reactors fe fe dc and cont in the reactor without both nzvi and the applied dc field cont the initial orp value for the contaminated water of about 400 mv all values against the standard hydrogen electrode remained essentially unchanged during the whole course of the experiment fig 1a different trends were recorded for both reactors with nzvi fe and fe dc in the case of the fe reactor solution orp decreased rapidly after nzvi addition to approximately 0 mv before reaching a minimum value of about 100 mv after 4 days compared to majority of published studies shi et al 2011 shi et al 2015 such a small change of orp is given by complex character of real contaminated water and low concentration of applied nzvi klimkova et al 2011 the initial decrease was followed by a subsequent slow increase due to gradual nzvi oxidation and loss of its reactivity similar effect is typical for low nzvi concentration shi et al 2011 this interpretation of the orp versus time data is consistent with the measurement of fe0 content in iron nanoparticles see below and in fig s4 and comparable with previously published data for low nzvi dosage orp similar to the initial value was achieved within 30 days which indicated that the whole zero valent fe was oxidized in this particular contaminated water in case of the fe dc reactor significantly lower values of orp were observed initially in the presence of the applied dc field the orp decreased to a value below 200 mv and remained essentially constant during the whole experiment i e 32 days it suggests the persisting existence of the reductive species chowdhury et al 2012 which is again consistent with the measurement of the iron speciation in nzvi particles see below nevertheless such value of orp would not be sufficiently low for efficient reductive technologies of water treatment shi et al 2015 the effect of dc without nzvi on the contaminated water was tested in the cont dc experiment fig s5 dc alone caused a significant decrease of orp being comparable to the effect of nzvi in combination with dc i e the fe dc reactor in most cases a similar decrease in orp was observed for nzvi free solutions with dissolved h2 shi et al 2011 therefore having taken into account the electrolysis of water by the dc field eq 1 and eq 2 below we can conclude that the dc field has a primarily reductive effect on the contaminated water through the evolution of h2 h and thus can significantly participate in the process of reductive dechlorination of chc the other parameter describing the evolution of the reaction progress is the ph fig 1b in the case of the reactor with only nzvi fe a slight increase in the ph was observed compared to the cont experiment i e from 6 99 to 7 5 followed by a slow decrease over the whole duration of the experiment i e opposite trend as observed for orp fig 1a similarly as in the case of orp the negligible effect of the used nzvi on the ph is given by low nzvi concentration klimkova et al 2011 on the other hand the experiment in the fe dc reactor showed a significant increase of the ph to a value of 9 3 and the ph remained high but with a decreasing trend until the end of the experiment this is a direct result of the applied dc field see also an independent evaluation of the dc field alone in fig s5 being consistent with the electrolysis of water according to eq 1 and eq 2 below supporting the continued fe 0 mediated reduction of water to hydrogen gas and hydroxide the results of the ph and orp measurement are consistent with the expected evolution of the aqueous solution when the dc electric field is introduced leading to the electrolysis of water i e by combination of the two or three reactions below if no other ions are present in significant concentrations the oxidation of water occurs on the anode i e positive electrode according to the reaction 1 h2o 2h ½o2 2e leading to the acidification of the solution around anode in contrast chemical reduction of water occurs on the cathode according to the reaction 2 h2o e ½h2 oh which tends to an increase of the ph fig 1b obviously the amount of the released ions depends on the passing current faraday s law says that during the passing of a 1 ma s there is a release of 10 3 f 1 ions i e 10 8 mol of h or oh most of these ions reach the opposite electrode causing an increase in the conductivity of the solution even though there is a partial recombination of these ions along the way moreover if the water contains dissolved oxygen its reduction occurs on the cathode according to the equation 3 ½o2 2h 2e h2o which is the reverse process to the reaction 1 and thereby leading to a decrease of orp fig 1a 3 1 2 products of nzvi oxidation mössbauer spectroscopy fig s4 has been used as a unique tool to identify and quantify different oxidation states and speciation of fe namely fe 0 as the α fe bcc structure fe ii and fe iii as a green rust fe2 4fe3 2 oh 12 co3 3h2o fe iii as goethite feooh and a mixed fe ii fe iii as fe3o4 magnetite in the original nzvi particles and in the reaction products the original nzvi particles contained mainly fe 0 with about 12 fe iii fig s4 this portion of the oxidized fe was a residual from the nzvi manufacturing and or as an artifact from the preparation of an aqueous solution filip et al 2014 during the experiment content of fe 0 tended to a gradual decline due to its oxidation in the fe and fe dc reactors after approximately 4 6 days the fe 0 content decreased to zero i e below the detection limit in the reactor without dc from the observed decrease of fe 0 in both the fe and fe dc reactors which have highly comparable kinetics fig 1c d and s4 we can concluded that fe 0 oxidation kinetics are not significantly affected by the presence of the dc field but is faster than nzvi corrosion in distilled water filip et al 2014 however the principal difference inheres in the mechanism of fe 0 oxidation fe ii and partly fe iii in the form of green rust was the major product of fe 0 oxidation in the early stages of the experiment fig s4 which is in agreement with previously published studies for specific conditions hwang and shin 2013 but contrary to pure water where fe oh 2 was identified as a primary corrosion product filip et al 2014 after 4 days the fe ii content was 60 plus 26 as fe iii also in green rust phase and 14 of iron atoms remained in the form of α fe fig 1c and d and the kinetics of its formation was independent of the presence of the applied dc field however the subsequent oxidation transformation of green rust was observed to vary significantly with and without the applied dc field in case of the fe reactor fe ii was observed to be fully oxidized to fe iii in about 8 days which corresponded with the observed kinetics of the chc reduction and the changes in orp however in comparison the fe dc reactor showed a distinctively slower decrease of fe ii concentration and even after 8 days its content was still about 30 of all iron atoms in the reaction fig 1d this was accompanied by a significantly lower value of orp fig 1a the most significant difference between the two experiments was in the composition of the final oxidation products after 8 days in case of the fe reactor the end products were fe iii oxides and hydroxides represented mainly by goethite feooh as revealed by mössbauer spectroscopy fig s4 which is a typical product of nzvi corrosion in real contaminated water pullin et al 2017 for the fe dc reactor no fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides were formed and the final products were determined as magnetite and green rust fig 1d and fig s4 such dramatic changes in the iron speciation when the dc electric field is applied could elucidate the changes in the nzvi reactivity see below the persistence of iron in a low oxidation state can thus prolong the nzvi performance in groundwater as it is typical e g for combined nano biotechnological groundwater treatment němeček et al 2016 3 1 3 combined effect of nzvi with electric field on dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons the experimental set up for the slowly degradable dce in chc contaminated water was chosen deliberately in the presence of small nzvi concentration in order to better demonstrate the expected positive effect of the applied dc electric field see table s2 for details in changes of particular chc in all reactors for the fe reactor only a small decrease of chc occurred compared to the cont reactor fig 2 a given the low nzvi concentration initially a relatively fast but short lived decrease of orp see above was observed caused by a limited source of electrons from the nzvi oxidation representing conditions insufficient for the complete dechlorination of chc and consequently the extent of degradation was therefore low i e comparable to cont reactor a significantly different trend was observed for the fe dc reactor in this case a steady decrease in chc concentration was observed throughout the course of the experiment after 32 days the chc content was determined to be only 2 of the original value the rate constant of chc decrease over the first 20 days was determined to be 0 158 day 1 according to the first order kinetics fig 2b it is also important to note the development of particular chc compounds in the fe dc reactor see fig 2b and fig s5 for less contaminated water since their concentrations at the beginning of the reaction varied significantly table s2 the concentration trends were related to their initial amount at the beginning of the reaction a slightly lower efficiency for dce degradation was determined compared to tce which confirmed a well known effect of zvi mediated dechlorination being a function of the degree of chlorination e g pce tce dce vc vogel et al 1987 the calculated degradation rate constants were very similar from 0 116 pce through 0 130 tce and 0 163 dce to 0 184 vc day 1 however the results exhibited quite a different course from the fe reactor in which tce was temporarily produced and dce remained until the end of the experiment at a relative concentration c c0 of approximately 0 40 fig 2c in both the fe and the fe dc reactors the concentration of pce declined between 0 and 15 days but it was steady after day 15 which implied an apparent loss of the nzvi reactivity contrary to previously published studies elliott and zhang 2001 the pce dechlorination was slower than the dechlorination of dce with the application of the dc field i e in fe dc reactor cf fig 2b and c in such highly contaminated water with dominant dce for less contaminated water the higher rate of pce dce tce dechlorination was observed in fe dc reactor fig s5 the nearly identical rates observed for all chcs indicate a direct dechlorination scheme arnold and roberts 2000 which is characterized by highly comparable rate constants this is one of the main differences from other studies where nzvi was used for dechlorination of chc němeček et al 2016 in order to shed light on the mechanism of chc dechlorination we performed additional experiments applying dc alone to variously contaminated groundwater i e cont dc reactors the observed trends for particular chc compounds are nearly identical to those in the fe dc reactors see mainly fig s5c but the effect of dc alone is generally weaker than the combination of nzvi with the dc field compared to the effect of nzvi alone there was either no or only limited formation of less chlorinated compounds which is again similar to the fe dc reactor as a result the dc field obviously promotes direct dechlorination of all chc compounds present in the studied water by generated h2 i e following the direct dechlorination scheme the dechlorination of chc is supported by the observed increase of chloride concentrations in both fe and fe dc reactors table s1 and also by the significant increase of both ethane and ethene in the fe dc reactor see the results of additional experiment in table s3 the dechlorination is thus evidently driven by both nzvi feii oxidation huang and cheng 2012 i e under dc the surface of nzvi is obviously better protected against corrosion luo et al 2010 and the dissolved iron remains in the reduced form mainly as fe ii for longer time němeček et al 2016 and generated h2 on cathode see eq 2 above huang and cheng 2012 this was investigated by changing dc 5 and 10 v both being above stability of water fig s6 the concentration of pce was significantly reduced at both 5 and 10 v in the presence of nzvi with the same rate of pce reduction the nzvi alone was less efficient under the same experimental conditions further increase in the potential i e when above stability of water leads to the same reactivity in combination with nzvi but it could markedly decrease the lifetime of electrodes the role of other solid species namely magnetite seems to be rather negligible in the observed dechlorination mechanism as there is no evident change in the dechlorination kinetics when magnetite appears cf figs 1d and 2b which is supported by previously observed rather slow kinetics of abiotic reduction of chc by magnetite lee and batchelor 2002 3 2 migration of nzvi column experiments 3 2 1 breakthrough of fe in all of the column experiments water with an initial nzvi concentration of 0 375 g l 1 was passed through the column over a timeframe equivalent to 27 pore volumes v 0 lasting typically for 6 7 h the concentration of total fe at the column outlet was measured at regular intervals throughout the experiment the breakthrough curves for the fe concentration are shown in fig 3 in the case of nzvi migration without an applied dc field i e k0 column the output concentration of total fe was low with c c0 on the order of few percent i e up to 4 3 being consistent with other nzvi particles used in comparable experiments soukupova et al 2015 similarly for the k configuration a negative electrode was present on the outlet from the column and a positive electrode at the inlet the output concentration of total fe declined further with a maximum of only 0 2 the positive anode at the column inlet caused the ph decrease and the surface charge of nzvi turned to a positive value the positively charged nzvi particles were probably attracted to the negatively charged silica dioxide and tended to aggregate therefore their migration ability was significantly reduced compared to k0 configuration the course of fe migration through the column was markedly different when the electrodes were placed in the opposite configuration e g negative cathode at inlet and positive anode at outlet after 8 v 0 a linear increase in fe concentration in the output was observed which ultimately reached 60 of its input concentration by the end of the experiment evidently induced by the introduction of the negative cathode the negative charge of the nzvi particles increased the repulsion forces between the nanoparticles and the surface of silica dioxide which significantly enhanced the nzvi migration potential the distribution of fe within the particular columns is better demonstrated by fe concentration profile fig 3b and visualized for k column fig 3c more homogenous fe concentration profile was observed for k column compared to k0 and k columns where nearly no nzvi was detected close to the outlet because the migration experiments in the columns were carried out at ionic strength typical for common groundwater i e 0 01 m the surface charge of nzvi can be approximated by determined titration curve for 0 01 m fig s7 and text s1 this shows that the nanoparticle charge was negative if the ph at the column outflow exceeded 7 5 as it was for the vast majority of measured points and the tendency for the nanoparticles to adsorb on soil matrix which was also negatively charged sposito 2008 was reduced higher ph i e when negatively charged electrode is at the inlet to the column caused more negative surface charge and repulsion of the nanoparticles which decreased their tendency for agglomeration rosická and šembera 2013 and allowed their easy migration through the column this is further confirmed below by evaluation changes in the ph and orp nevertheless the electrokinetic mechanisms are orders of magnitude weaker than the used advective flux jones et al 2011 reddy et al 2011 3 2 2 induced changes in ph values significant differences in the trend of the measured ph breakthrough curve were observed depending on the applied electric field fig s8 in the case of the k0 column a slight increase in ph values from 7 8 to 8 0 standard units was observed after insertion of the nzvi particles subsequently over time the ph very slowly decreased back to its initial value of 7 8 for the k column the ph increased significantly at the beginning of the experiment because of the reduction of water and the formation of oh ions on the cathode soukupova et al 2015 which was located at the outlet of the column see eq 2 above after passing of about 2 v 0 the increasing trend of the ph gradually decreased back to its initial value this can be explained by flowing of low ph water i e generated on the vicinity of anode where formation of h ions take place to cathode by this process the initial ph decrease was neutralized at the column outflow an opposite trend was noted in the k column as a result of the anode being installed in the vicinity of the measuring cell a decrease in the ph to a value of 7 4 standard units was observed followed by a rise to 7 6 standard units owing to a neutralization effect similar to that observed for the k column since we determined the pzc to be close to 7 5 fig s7 it can be assumed that for the environmental conditions with the ph values below 7 5 the surface of the nzvi was positively charged or uncharged and migration to the anode occurred only when the ph reached 7 6 or higher i e approximately after passing of 4 v 0 the migration of nzvi to the anode occurred which was reflected in the increase of the total fe concentration at the column outlet fig 3a and the fe profile in the column fig 3b and c 3 2 3 induced changes in redox potential and conductivity the observed changes in the orp were comparable for both experimental columns k and k with an applied dc field and were significantly different from the column without the dc field k0 fig s9 because of the short experimental time the oxidation reduction processes of nzvi were negligible and the corresponding orp breakthrough curve for k0 was relatively constant application of the dc field decreased the orp by about 300 mv and reached the value approximately 50 mv identical for both k and k set ups the orp decrease was caused by the elimination of dissolved oxygen and the chemical reduction of water that occurred on the cathode see eq 2 and eq 3 immediately after commencing the application of the electrical current the initial density of the dc field was low and the oxygen reduction was insignificant however during the passage of the first pore volume the dc field intensity increased and the oxygen concentration was further reduced in the vicinity of the cathode for the k column where the cathode was placed on the outlet of the column this effect was observed at the end of the first v 0 passing through the column for the k column the lower orp solution generated at the cathode needed to pass through the column and reached the measuring cell after one additional v 0 a similar trend was observed for the electrical conductivity of the solution passing through the columns the initial solution had a conductivity of 200 μs cm 1 similarly to orp in the case of the k0 column no change in the conductivity was observed during the experiment in this case the interaction of nzvi was insignificant to elicit a noticeable influence on the water conductivity on the other hand a 6 fold increase in the conductivity was observed for the k and k columns with dc current applied fig s10 the electric current evidently led to ionization of the water inside the column and created a more conductive environment soukupova et al 2015 therefore changes in conductivity corresponded to the observed increase in electrical current passing through columns 4 conclusions the application of an electric field with an intensity of about 1 v cm 1 represents a unique and simple strategy for enhancing the reactivity and migration properties of nzvi although the electrophoresis enhanced transport of nzvi particles was previously described see e g chowdhury et al 2012 we demonstrated the validity and advantages of such an approach in field relevant conditions i e with advective flow and concentrations of commercial nzvi particles similar to conditions typical for pilot full scale applications of such technology due to the applied dc current the orp solution remained significantly lower and the nzvi reactivity was substantially prolonged such treatment of chlorinated solvents appeared to be markedly faster when individual chcs were eliminated with very similar kinetics and with no lesser chlorinated intermediates being accumulated this observation has significant consequences for groundwater remediation where it could improve the reactivity longevity as well as migration of nzvi particles off the application wells with the possibly enhanced mobility even through low permeable zones without the need for further stabilization of nzvi dispersion by surface active agents see e g phenrat et al 2008 therefore it could decrease the number of drilled wells needed for remediation and the applied nzvi particle concentration making the cost of the technology lower the future study based on the application of this technology on several

18994,bivalve molluscan shellfish grown in areas impacted by human faecal pollution are at risk of being contaminated with multiple enteric viruses to minimise the public health risks associated with shellfish consumption determining the presence of faecal contamination in shellfish and their growing waters is crucial in this study we evaluated the use of pepper mild mottle virus pmmov as an indicator of human faecal contamination in oysters mussels cockles and shellfish growing waters in new zealand using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr the presence and where applicable the concentration of pmmov was determined in faeces from 11 different animal species influent untreated wastewater shellfish and shellfish growing waters non human faecal samples from seagull canada goose black swan and dog were rt qpcr positive for pmmov the faecal source specificity of pmmov was 0 83 maximum value of 1 when detected but not quantifiable dnq values were used however when lower limit of quantification lloq values were used the specificity increased to 0 92 the pmmov concentration in influent wastewater n 10 ranged from 6 3 to 7 7 log10 genome copies gc l with a mean standard deviation of 7 1 0 5 log10 gc l the overall occurrence of pmmov in shellfish and shellfish growing waters from four different areas was 46 51 90 and 29 52 56 respectively of the cockles collected from an area known to be impacted by effluent wastewater 14 14 100 contained pmmov concentrations above the lloq in contrast only 13 37 35 shellfish and 6 52 11 5 growing water samples collected from three areas with low anthropogenic impact contained pmmov concentrations above the lloq the high concentration of pmmov in influent wastewater indicates that pmmov may be a promising indicator of human faecal contamination the presence of pmmov in shellfish and growing waters with a low anthropogenic impact may be of avian origin and this needs to be considered if using

animal faeces such as geese chickens seagulls and cows hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2017 therefore validation of pmmov as an mst pcr marker is required prior to its application in a new geographical location due to differences in host carriage of the mst pcr markers between countries devane et al 2013 2018 stewart et al 2013 as identified in a review by symonds et al 2018 it is important to determine if the low level presence of pmmov in non human faecal sources affects its usefulness as an mst pcr marker for identifying human faecal contamination the symonds review 2018 also highlighted a need for additional studies on the usefulness of pmmov as an indicator for enteric viral contamination of shellfish the first objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and concentration of pmmov in influent wastewater and to evaluate the specificity of pmmov in different animal faecal sources from new zealand the second objective was to determine the occurrence and concentration of pmmov in shellfish and shellfish growing waters and evaluate its usefulness as a human faecal indicator for monitoring shellfish shellfish growing water quality in new zealand to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluated the usefulness of pmmov as an indicator of human faecal pollution in shellfish and shellfish growing waters in new zealand 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal bird faecal samples individual fresh faecal samples from 11 animal bird species were collected in 50 ml sterile tubes from different farms households and coastal beaches of new zealand a total of 104 faecal samples were collected for this study the samples were from black swan n 10 cat n 7 canada goose n 10 chicken n 10 cow n 10 dog n 10 duck n 10 horse n 10 rabbit n 7 seagull n 10 and sheep n 10 these animals were selected due to their potential to contaminate shellfish growing waters in new zealand black swan canada goose and duck faecal samples were collected around four different lakes from canterbury region of new zealand cat dog chicken and rabbit faecal samples were collected from 7 10 10 and 7 households respectively around the wellington region of new zealand cow and sheep faecal samples were collected from 10 farms in the wellington region seagull faecal samples were also collected from four wellington region coastal beaches all faecal samples were processed within 24 48 h of collection each sample 1 g was added to 1 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution ph 7 2 and homogenised by vortexing for 5 min the homogenised faecal slurries were centrifuged at 6 440 g for 5 min supernatant 1 ml was transferred into a 2 ml tube and retained at 4 c for less than 72 h until viral nucleic acid was extracted 2 2 wastewater archived 6 12 months old viral nucleic acid samples extracted from influent wastewater were used in this study influent wastewater 1 2 l n 10 had been previously collected from four different wastewater treatment plants across new zealand the influent wastewater samples were collected in plastic bottles transported to the laboratory and processed within 48 h of collection using beef extract elution and polyethylene glycol peg 6000 precipitation as described elsewhere hewitt et al 2011 in brief samples were first centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 c to obtain a pellet and supernatant the supernatant was transferred into a plastic container and stored at 4 c for later use to elute viruses from the pellet 0 05 m glycine 3 wt vol beef extract sigma aldrich australia solution ph 9 0 was added and continually mixed on a vertical shaker for 60 min at ambient room temperature following centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 c supernatant was recovered and added to the initial supernatant the ph was adjusted to 7 7 2 virus concentration was then performed by the addition of peg 6000 10 final concentration sigma aldrich australia and sodium chloride 2 final concentration thermo fisher scientific new zealand to each sample mixed to dissolve and incubated on a horizontal shaker 120 rpm for at least 2 h at 4 c each sample was further centrifuged at 10 000 g for 25 min to obtain a pellet the pellet was resuspended in 5 10 ml phosphate buffered saline ph 7 5 followed by virus elution and centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min the final concentrate was kept at 4 c for a maximum of 48 h until viral nucleic acid was extracted 2 3 shellfish and shellfish growing water archived 24 months old viral nucleic acid samples extracted from shellfish n 51 up to 10 shellfish per sample and or concentrated shellfish growing waters n 52 collected from four coastal locations designated as areas a d within new zealand were used for this study table 1 area a was located on the north island of new zealand areas b c and d were located in the south island of new zealand areas a b and c were surrounded by farmland with low impact from anthropogenic activities whereas area d was impacted by effluent wastewater among the 51 shellfish samples collected 32 were oysters 24 from area a and 8 from area b 5 were mussels collected from area c and 14 were cockles collected from area d among the 52 shellfish growing water samples collected 20 were from area a whereas 16 samples were collected from each area b and c shellfish and growing water samples were processed within 24 48 h of collection for shellfish digestive tissue of 5 10 individual shellfish depending on the size was pooled and processed as previously described greening and hewitt 2008 briefly each batch of shellfish digestive tissue was digested with proteinase k using a two step heat treatment 37 c for 60 min followed by 60 c for 15 min the resulting material was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant recovered each 10 l water sample was concentrated using the hemoflow ultrafiltration method as previously described hewitt et al 2007 briefly following a pre treatment of the filter with 0 01 sodium polyphosphate napo3 sigma aldrich australia solution for 15 min and water sample 30 min prior to the filtration each sample was pumped through the filter using a peristaltic pump at a permeate rate of 150 300 ml min each filter was back flushed with a solution containing 0 5 tween 80 koch light laboratories limited england and 0 01 napo3 the concentrate was further concentrated using peg 6000 precipitation method described in section 2 2 a 5 ml concentrate was obtained for each water sample shellfish homogenates and water concentrates were kept at 4 c for a maximum of 48 h until viral nucleic acid was extracted 2 4 nucleic acid extraction and qpcr inhibition assay the high pure viral nucleic acid extraction kit roche molecular biochemicals ltd mannheim germany was used to extract viral nucleic acid from 200 μl faecal slurry 200 μl influent wastewater concentrate 200 μl water concentrate and 500 μl shellfish homogenate according to the manufacturer s instructions a previously published sketa22 qpcr assay gyawali et al 2015 was used to determine the presence of qpcr inhibition in the nucleic acid extracted from animal faecal samples a specific armored rna rt qpcr assay hewitt et al 2007 was used to identify potential rt qpcr inhibition in the viral nucleic acid extracted from influent wastewater water and shellfish samples none of the nucleic acid samples demonstrated detectable pcr inhibition and were used as undiluted for the pmmov rt qpcr analysis 2 5 standards and lower limit of quantification for rt qpcr standards ranging from 106 100 gc μl were prepared from synthetic gene fragment gblocks integrated dna technologies coralville la usa using the pmmov rt qpcr assay section 2 6 standards log dilutions from 2 5 106 to 2 5 gc reaction were analysed in triplicate the standards were tested in two separate runs to confirm the initial results the rt qpcr lower limit of quantification lloq value was determined the lloq was defined as the lowest standard concentration detected in all three replicates in both rt qpcr runs and with an intra assay coefficient value of the rt qpcr quantification cycle cq value lower than 10 the rt qpcr detected but not quantifiable dnq was also determined the dnq was defined as the lowest standard concentration detected in at least one of the triplicate dna standard concentrations in both rt qpcr runs and with an intra assay coefficient value of the cq value greater than 10 2 6 rt qpcr assay previously published primers and probe were used for the quantitative detection of pmmov haramoto et al 2013 rt qpcr assay was performed using the superscript iii platinum one step qrt pcr kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca usa each 25 μl rt qpcr assay consisted of 2 5 μl sample nucleic acid or dna standard 400 nm each primer 125 nm probe 12 5 μl 2x reaction mix 0 5 μl rnaseout and 0 5 μl superscript iii rt platinum taqmix the rt qpcr parameters were as follows 50 c for 15 min 72 c for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 c for 30 s and 53 c for 1 min all the rt qpcr assays were performed using the bio rad cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system bio rad laboratories hercules ca usa viral nucleic acid from each sample was tested in triplicate to minimise rt qpcr contamination nucleic acid extractions rt qpcr mastermix preparation and rt qpcr assays were each performed in separate laboratories an extraction blank dnase rnase free water was included with each batch of nucleic acid extraction for each rt qpcr batch positive dna standard at 2 5 104 gc reaction and negative controls dnase rnase free water were included rt qpcr cq values were determined by the bio rad cfx manager software bio rad laboratories 2 7 data analysis faecal source specificity values of pmmov were determined using a mathematical formula as described elsewhere ahmed et al 2015 viral quantification gc reaction for the test samples was determined by calculating the mean rt qpcr cq value from the three replicates and comparing against the pmmov standard curve 2 5 106 to 25 gc reaction pmmov concentrations were calculated as gc g faeces gc l wastewater water and gc g shellfish digestive tissue and then log10 transformed for each sample type the mean concentration and standard deviation sd was calculated using excel microsoft redmond wa usa to determine the statistical significance differences in pmmov concentrations between animal faeces and shellfish collected from different areas i e areas a c and d t test two samples assuming equal variance was performed using excel microsoft significance was characterised at the α level of 0 05 samples with dnq values were excluded from the data analysis 3 results 3 1 rt qpcr standard lloq and reproducibility the rt qpcr assay had a linear range of quantification from 3 106 25 gc reaction the slope of the standard curve correlation coefficient r 2 and intercept were 3 39 0 993 and 40 51 respectively the rt qpcr lloq was 25 gc reaction and dnq was 3 gc reaction 3 2 source specificity of the 104 faecal samples from the 11 animal species tested 18 17 from four animal species black swan seagull dog and canada goose were positive for pmmov of these only eight were quantifiable table 2 the prevalence of pmmov was highest 9 10 90 in the faeces of black swan followed by seagull 5 10 50 dog 3 10 30 and canada goose 1 10

value and 0 92 using lloq value table 2 3 3 occurrence and concentration of pmmov in animal faecal and influent wastewater samples for samples where the concentrations were quantifiable the mean sd pmmov concentration in seagull faecal samples was higher n 3 4 8 1 2 log10 gc g than dog n 2 4 4 0 6 log10 gc g and black swan n 2 3 3 0 1 log10 gc g table 2 however there were no significant differences in the concentrations of pmmov between the faeces of seagull and dog p 0 746 seagull and black swan p 0 218 or dog and black swan p 0 113 all 10 influent wastewater samples were positive for pmmov with quantifiable levels i e above lloq the mean sd concentration was 7 1 0 5 log10 gc l table 2 3 4 occurrence and concentration of pmmov in shellfish and shellfish growing water for shellfish 46 51 90 samples were positive for pmmov occurrence of pmmov was highest based on dnq data in area a 24 24 100 and area d 14 14 100 compared to the other areas table 3 pmmov levels were quantifiable in shellfish samples collected from areas a c and d n 27 pmmov levels were not quantifiable in any shellfish collected from area b of the total of 28 pmmov positive samples from areas a

difference p 0 106 in the mean concentration between mussels collected from area c and cockles collected from area d for shellfish growing waters 29 52 56 samples from areas a b and c were positive for pmmov table 3 of which six were present at levels that were quantifiable the concentrations of quantifiable pmmov in water samples from area a n 3 3 9 0 1 log10 gc l and c n 2 3 9 0 1 log10 gc l were similar to each other table 3 for area b the only positive water sample with a concentration of pmmov above the lloq was 5 8 log10 gc l higher than samples collected from area a and c 4 discussion an ideal mst pcr marker should exhibit high test sensitivity and source specificity for specificity evaluation it is crucial to consider both lloq i e samples that are quantifiable and dnq i e samples that are positive but not quantifiable values for consistent determination schriewer et al 2013 using faecal samples from 11 different species of animals and birds the source specificity value of the pmmov was calculated as 0 83 when the dnq values were used however the source specificity value increased by 10 when only samples with lloq values were used factors including significant dilution and dispersion in receiving waters mean that a low pmmov concentration for example 2 3 log10 gc g in non human faeces may become undetectable or be present at levels below the lloq ahmed et al 2016 pmmov was detected in faecal samples from black swan canada goose dog and seagull among these the occurrence of pmmov was highest in black swans 90 and seagulls 50 previous studies have also reported the presence of pmmov in faeces from bird such as geese seagulls and chickens hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2017 to our knowledge this is the first study that reports the presence of pmmov in faecal samples from black swans while our results indicated that faeces from seagulls range 3 4 5 9 log10 gc g contained higher concentrations of pmmov than the other animal species tested this difference was not significant this may be due to the limited number of samples that contained levels above the lloq and so additional studies would be beneficial the source s of transmission of pmmov in black swan canada geese dogs and seagulls are unknown the specificity results indicated that pmmov is not absolutely specific to human faeces as noted for other markers such as hf183 and bachum ucd ahmed et al 2016 the lack of absolute human specificity of pmmov indicates that shellfish and shellfish growing water samples should be tested with multiple host associated markers such as crassphage human adenoviruses or human polyomaviruses in a toolbox format to achieve greater confidence in mst results ahmed et al 2016 feng et al 2018 harwood et al 2014 symonds et al 2018 further investigation is needed to determine if any correlations exist between pmmov and other human associated markers in shellfish and shellfish growing waters the concentrations of pmmov in influent wastewater shown in this study approx 107 gc l were similar to that reported from australia 5 7 107 gc l hughes et al 2017 germany 1 9 108 gc l hamza et al 2011 usa 2 1 108 gc l symonds et al 2017 and vietnam 5 5 106 gc l kuroda et al 2015 furthermore kitajima and colleagues also reported the consistent detection of high pmmov concentrations in influent 3 7 4 4 106 gc l and effluent 4 6 6 3 105 gc l wastewater throughout the year in southern arizona usa kitajima et al 2014 despite the lack of absolute specificity consistent occurrence and high concentrations in influent wastewater means that this virus is a potential candidate for tracking human faecal contamination especially in environmental waters with minimal avian in particular seagull activity araújo et al 2014 summa et al 2018 if high seagull populations are identified in the study area then additional human specific mst pcr markers and or mst pcr markers associated with seagulls green et al 2012 lee et al 2013 sinigalliano et al 2013 should be used to obtain confirmatory results in this study a high proportion of shellfish and shellfish growing water samples 90 and 56 respectively were positive for pmmov at the dnq level the high detection frequency of pmmov in shellfish and water may be attributed to the high stability of the pmmov in the environment hamza et al 2011 the greater occurrence of pmmov in shellfish compared to the growing waters could be due to the filter feeding mechanism of shellfish le guyader et al 2012 love et al 2010 enabling possible accumulation of pmmov in shellfish tissue further shellfish feeding studies using influent wastewater containing multiple host associated markers for example would be useful in understanding any selective mechanisms involved in pmmov accumulation in bivalve molluscan shellfish areas with low or no impact of human faecal contamination i e areas a to c most pmmov positive samples contained concentrations below the lloq indicating a low amount of faecal contamination from the specificity part of our study the pmmov detected in samples from these areas may at least in part have originated from birds i e black swan and seagulls an ongoing study of areas a b and c using faecal sterols as a source tracking tool indicated very low area a or no presence of human faecal contamination areas b and c yet indicated the presence of avian faecal contamination for almost one third of shellfish growing water samples data not shown this supports the hypothesis that birds could be an alternative source of pmmov albeit in low levels in shellfish and shellfish growing water conversely cockles collected from area d an area known to be subject to human faecal contamination were consistently positive for pmmov at high levels indicating its suitability for tracking the source of human faecal pollution however further studies would be required to investigate the potential contributions of avian sourced pmmov in shellfish and growing water based on the daily excretion rates of seagulls 50 g individual and black swans 418 g individual moriarty et al 2011 a review article includes unpublished data on pmmov in shellfish from a dutch study symonds et al 2018 according to the review pmmov was detected in 75 115 65 oysters and 64 86 74 mussels in the pmmov positive samples norovirus was detected in 24 18 75 of oysters and 52 33 64 mussels however of the norovirus positive shellfish pmmov co occurred in 18 21 86 oysters and 33 36 92 mussels symonds et al 2018 in the absence of plant source of pmmov in those study areas its presence in shellfish indicates human or animal bird faecal contamination with associated public health risks araújo et al 2014 for example norovirus outbreaks associated with the consumption of shellfish grown in faecally contaminated waters are frequently reported bellou et al 2013 simmons et al 2007 however direct monitoring of water and shellfish for norovirus is not always straightforward because its presence in the environment can be sporadic and varies depending upon the level of infection in the population zhang et al 2006 since pmmov is widely found in human wastewater at high concentrations it can be an alternative or additional option for monitoring faecal contamination in shellfish and growing waters however correlations between pmmov and infectious enteric viruses including norovirus need to be determined before incorporating the pmmov mst marker as a tool to identify human faecal contamination in shellfish and growing waters 5 conclusions this is the first study to report the presence of pmmov in faeces of black swan and also the first study in new zealand to report on the occurrence of pmmov in the aquatic environment and shellfish despite the occurrence of pmmov in certain animal bird faecal samples based on its high incidence and concentration in human wastewater pmmov may be a promising indicator of human faecal contamination further evaluation of pmmov will be required along with other human faecal associated markers such as bacteroides hf183 crassphage human adenovirus or human polyomavirus in shellfish and shellfish growing waters from different locations to determine the suitability of pmmov as a viral indicator of human faecal contamination or as an index virus for enteric viruses in waters and shellfish in addition correlations between pmmov and norovirus in shellfish and growing waters need to be determined prior to the implementation of this pcr marker for shellfish quality monitoring acknowledgments the

and effluent treated wastewater from different geographical locations betancourt et al 2014 hamza et al 2011 hughes et al 2017 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 lee et al 2017 rosario et al 2009 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 2016 2017 shrestha et al 2018 verbyla et al 2016 in addition studies have reported that pmmov concentrations in wastewater are reasonably constant over time i e several weeks months kitajima et al 2014 rosario et al 2009 pmmov was shown to have a greater resistance to wastewater treatment than other mst pcr markers and enteric viruses such as human adenovirus and norovirus hughes et al 2017 an approximate one log10 reduction in pmmov has been reported for wastewater treatments such as activated sludge sequential batch reactor biological trickling filter and pond stabilisation hughes et al 2017 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2014 higher reductions 4 5 log10 were only achieved using benchtop electrocoagulation and the 4 stage bardenpho process schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2015 using rt qpcr pmmov has also been reported to have greater persistence than human enteric viruses in environmental waters bofill mas et al 2006 calgua et al 2013 hamza et al 2009 2011 haramoto et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 rosario et al 2009 wong et al 2012 for example one study showed that after 21 days in river water at 25 c the reduction in pmmov concentration was 1 1 log10 gc lower than for human adenovirus 3 7 log10 gc human polyomavirus 4 2 log10 gc and torque teno virus 3 0 log10 gc hamza et al 2009 a field laboratory study from usa reported that pmmov was persistent in terms of its detectability by rt qpcr for a week at 31 33 c rosario et al 2009 an ideal mst pcr marker should exhibit high faecal source sensitivity and specificity schriewer et al 2013 despite being frequently present in influent and effluent wastewater pmmov has been reported to be present at low concentrations in animal faeces such as geese chickens seagulls and cows hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2017 therefore validation of pmmov as an mst pcr marker is required prior to its application in a new geographical location due to differences in host carriage of the mst pcr markers between countries devane et al 2013 2018 stewart et al 2013 as identified in a review by symonds et al 2018 it is important to determine if the low level presence of pmmov in non human faecal sources affects its usefulness as an mst pcr marker for identifying human faecal contamination the symonds review 2018 also highlighted a need for additional studies on the usefulness of pmmov as an indicator for enteric viral contamination of shellfish the first objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and concentration of pmmov in influent wastewater and to evaluate the specificity of pmmov in different animal faecal sources from new zealand the second objective was to determine the occurrence and concentration of pmmov in shellfish and shellfish growing waters and evaluate its usefulness as a human faecal indicator for monitoring shellfish shellfish growing water quality in new zealand to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluated the usefulness of pmmov as an indicator of human faecal pollution in shellfish and shellfish growing waters in new zealand 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal bird faecal samples individual fresh faecal samples from 11 animal bird species were collected in 50 ml sterile tubes from different farms households and coastal beaches of new zealand a total of 104 faecal samples were collected for this study the samples were from black swan n 10 cat n 7 canada goose n 10 chicken n 10 cow n 10 dog n 10 duck n 10 horse n 10 rabbit n 7 seagull n 10 and sheep n 10 these animals were selected due to their potential to contaminate shellfish growing waters in new zealand black swan canada goose and duck faecal samples were collected around four different lakes from canterbury region of new zealand cat dog chicken and rabbit faecal samples were collected from 7 10 10 and 7 households respectively around the wellington region of new zealand cow and sheep faecal samples were collected from 10 farms in the wellington region seagull faecal samples were also collected from four wellington region coastal beaches all faecal samples were processed within 24 48 h of collection each sample 1 g was added to 1 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution ph 7 2 and homogenised by vortexing for 5 min the homogenised faecal slurries were centrifuged at 6 440 g for 5 min supernatant 1 ml was transferred into a 2 ml tube and retained at 4 c for less than 72 h until viral nucleic acid was extracted 2 2 wastewater archived 6 12 months old viral nucleic acid samples extracted from influent wastewater were used in this study influent wastewater 1 2 l n 10 had been previously collected from four different wastewater treatment plants across new zealand the influent wastewater samples were collected in plastic bottles transported to the laboratory and processed within 48 h of collection using beef extract elution and polyethylene glycol peg 6000 precipitation as described elsewhere hewitt et al 2011 in brief samples were first centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 c to obtain a pellet and supernatant the supernatant was transferred into a plastic container and stored at 4 c for later use to elute viruses from the pellet 0 05 m glycine 3 wt vol beef extract sigma aldrich australia solution ph 9 0 was added and continually mixed on a vertical shaker for 60 min at ambient room temperature following centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 c supernatant was recovered and added to the initial supernatant the ph was adjusted to 7 7 2 virus concentration was then performed by the addition of peg 6000 10 final concentration sigma aldrich australia and sodium chloride 2 final concentration thermo fisher scientific new zealand to each sample mixed to dissolve and incubated on a horizontal shaker 120 rpm for at least 2 h at 4 c each sample was further centrifuged at 10 000 g for 25 min to obtain a pellet the pellet was resuspended in 5 10 ml phosphate buffered saline ph 7 5 followed by virus elution and centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min the final concentrate was kept at 4 c for a maximum of 48 h until viral nucleic acid was extracted 2 3 shellfish and shellfish growing water archived 24 months old viral nucleic acid samples extracted from shellfish n 51 up to 10 shellfish per sample and or concentrated shellfish growing waters n 52 collected from four coastal locations designated as areas a d within new zealand were used for this study table 1 area a was located on the north island of new zealand areas b c and d were located in the south island of new zealand areas a b and c were surrounded by farmland with low impact from anthropogenic activities whereas area d was impacted by effluent wastewater among the 51 shellfish samples collected 32 were oysters 24 from area a and 8 from area b 5 were mussels collected from area c and 14 were cockles collected from area d among the 52 shellfish growing water samples collected 20 were from area a whereas 16 samples were collected from each area b and c shellfish and growing water samples were processed within 24 48 h of collection for shellfish digestive tissue of 5 10 individual shellfish depending on the size was pooled and processed as previously described greening and hewitt 2008 briefly each batch of shellfish digestive tissue was digested with proteinase k using a two step heat treatment 37 c for 60 min followed by 60 c for 15 min the resulting material was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant recovered each 10 l water sample was concentrated using the hemoflow ultrafiltration method as previously described hewitt et al 2007 briefly following a pre treatment of the filter with 0 01 sodium polyphosphate napo3 sigma aldrich australia solution for 15 min and water sample 30 min prior to the filtration each sample was pumped through the filter using a peristaltic pump at a permeate rate of 150 300 ml min each filter was back flushed with a solution containing 0 5 tween 80 koch light laboratories limited england and 0 01 napo3 the concentrate was further concentrated using peg 6000 precipitation method described in section 2 2 a 5 ml concentrate was obtained for each water sample shellfish homogenates and water concentrates were kept at 4 c for a maximum of 48 h until viral nucleic acid was extracted 2 4 nucleic acid extraction and qpcr inhibition assay the high pure viral nucleic acid extraction kit roche molecular biochemicals ltd mannheim germany was used to extract viral nucleic acid from 200 μl faecal slurry 200 μl influent wastewater concentrate 200 μl water concentrate and 500 μl shellfish homogenate according to the manufacturer s instructions a previously published sketa22 qpcr assay gyawali et al 2015 was used to determine the presence of qpcr inhibition in the nucleic acid extracted from animal faecal samples a specific armored rna rt qpcr assay hewitt et al 2007 was used to identify potential rt qpcr inhibition in the viral nucleic acid extracted from influent wastewater water and shellfish samples none of the nucleic acid samples demonstrated detectable pcr inhibition and were used as undiluted for the pmmov rt qpcr analysis 2 5 standards and lower limit of quantification for rt qpcr standards ranging from 106 100 gc μl were prepared from synthetic gene fragment gblocks integrated dna technologies coralville la usa using the pmmov rt qpcr assay section 2 6 standards log dilutions from 2 5 106 to 2 5 gc reaction were analysed in triplicate the standards were tested in two separate runs to confirm the initial results the rt qpcr lower limit of quantification lloq value was determined the lloq was defined as the lowest standard concentration detected in all three replicates in both rt qpcr runs and with an intra assay coefficient value of the rt qpcr quantification cycle cq value lower than 10 the rt qpcr detected but not quantifiable dnq was also determined the dnq was defined as the lowest standard concentration detected in at least one of the triplicate dna standard concentrations in both rt qpcr runs and with an intra assay coefficient value of the cq value greater than 10 2 6 rt qpcr assay previously published primers and probe were used for the quantitative detection of pmmov haramoto et al 2013 rt qpcr assay was performed using the superscript iii platinum one step qrt pcr kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca usa each 25 μl rt qpcr assay consisted of 2 5 μl sample nucleic acid or dna standard 400 nm each primer 125 nm probe 12 5 μl 2x reaction mix 0 5 μl rnaseout and 0 5 μl superscript iii rt platinum taqmix the rt qpcr parameters were as follows 50 c for 15 min 72 c for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 c for 30 s and 53 c for 1 min all the rt qpcr assays were performed using the bio rad cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system bio rad laboratories hercules ca usa viral nucleic acid from each sample was tested in triplicate to minimise rt qpcr contamination nucleic acid extractions rt qpcr mastermix preparation and rt qpcr assays were each performed in separate laboratories an extraction blank dnase rnase free water was included with each batch of nucleic acid extraction for each rt qpcr batch positive dna standard at 2 5 104 gc reaction and negative controls dnase rnase free water were included rt qpcr cq values were determined by the bio rad cfx manager software bio rad laboratories 2 7 data analysis faecal source specificity values of pmmov were determined using a mathematical formula as described elsewhere ahmed et al 2015 viral quantification gc reaction for the test samples was determined by calculating the mean rt qpcr cq value from the three replicates and comparing against the pmmov standard curve 2 5 106 to 25 gc reaction pmmov concentrations were calculated as gc g faeces gc l wastewater water and gc g shellfish digestive tissue and then log10 transformed for each sample type the mean concentration and standard deviation sd was calculated using excel microsoft redmond wa usa to determine the statistical significance differences in pmmov concentrations between animal faeces and shellfish collected from different areas i e areas a c and d t test two samples assuming equal variance was performed using excel microsoft significance was characterised at the α level of 0 05 samples with dnq values were excluded from the data analysis 3 results 3 1 rt qpcr standard lloq and reproducibility the rt qpcr assay had a linear range of quantification from 3 106 25 gc reaction the slope of the standard curve correlation coefficient r 2 and intercept were 3 39 0 993 and 40 51 respectively the rt qpcr lloq was 25 gc reaction and dnq was 3 gc reaction 3 2 source specificity of the 104 faecal samples from the 11 animal species tested 18 17 from four animal species black swan seagull dog and canada goose were positive for pmmov of these only eight were quantifiable table 2 the prevalence of pmmov was highest 9 10 90 in the faeces of black swan followed by seagull 5 10 50 dog 3 10 30 and canada goose 1 10 10 however a large proportion 7 9 78 of pmmov positive samples for black swan contained a concentration of pmmov below the rt qpcr lloq the overall source specificity of the pmmov was 0 83 using dnq value and 0 92 using lloq value table 2 3 3 occurrence and concentration of pmmov in animal faecal and influent wastewater samples for samples where the concentrations were quantifiable the mean sd pmmov concentration in seagull faecal samples was higher n 3 4 8 1 2 log10 gc g than dog n 2 4 4 0 6 log10 gc g and black swan n 2 3 3 0 1 log10 gc g table 2 however there were no significant differences in the concentrations of pmmov between the faeces of seagull and dog p 0 746 seagull and black swan p 0 218 or dog and black swan p 0 113 all 10 influent wastewater samples were positive for pmmov with quantifiable levels i e above lloq the mean sd concentration was 7 1 0 5 log10 gc l table 2 3 4 occurrence and concentration of pmmov in shellfish and shellfish growing water for shellfish 46 51 90 samples were positive for pmmov occurrence of pmmov was highest based on dnq data in area a 24 24 100 and area d 14 14 100 compared to the other areas table 3 pmmov levels were quantifiable in shellfish samples collected from areas a c and d n 27 pmmov levels were not quantifiable in any shellfish collected from area b of the total of 28 pmmov positive samples from areas a and c only 13 46 contained quantifiable levels compared to 14 14 100 from shellfish cockles collected from area d the mean concentration of pmmov in oysters collected from area a n 10 3 1 0 2 log10 gc g was significantly lower p 0 05 than that of cockles collected from area d n 14 4 1 0 5 log10 gc g and also of mussels collected from area c n 3 3 6 0 4 log10 gc g table 3 there was no significant difference p 0 106 in the mean concentration between mussels collected from area c and cockles collected from area d for shellfish growing waters 29 52 56 samples from areas a b and c were positive for pmmov table 3 of which six were present at levels that were quantifiable the concentrations of quantifiable pmmov in water samples from area a n 3 3 9 0 1 log10 gc l and c n 2 3 9 0 1 log10 gc l were similar to each other table 3 for area b the only positive water sample with a concentration of pmmov above the lloq was 5 8 log10 gc l higher than samples collected from area a and c 4 discussion an ideal mst pcr marker should exhibit high test sensitivity and source specificity for specificity evaluation it is crucial to consider both lloq i e samples that are quantifiable and dnq i e samples that are positive but not quantifiable values for consistent determination schriewer et al 2013 using faecal samples from 11 different species of animals and birds the source specificity value of the pmmov was calculated as 0 83 when the dnq values were used however the source specificity value increased by 10 when only samples with lloq values were used factors including significant dilution and dispersion in receiving waters mean that a low pmmov concentration for example 2 3 log10 gc g in non human faeces may become undetectable or be present at levels below the lloq ahmed et al 2016 pmmov was detected in faecal samples from black swan canada goose dog and seagull among these the occurrence of pmmov was highest in black swans 90 and seagulls 50 previous studies have also reported the presence of pmmov in faeces from bird such as geese seagulls and chickens hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2017 to our knowledge this is the first study that reports the presence of pmmov in faecal samples from black swans while our results indicated that faeces from seagulls range 3 4 5 9 log10 gc g contained higher concentrations of pmmov than the other animal species tested this difference was not significant this may be due to the limited number of samples that contained levels above the lloq and so additional studies would be beneficial the source s of transmission of pmmov in black swan canada geese dogs and seagulls are unknown the specificity results indicated that pmmov is not absolutely specific to human faeces as noted for other markers such as hf183 and bachum ucd ahmed et al 2016 the lack of absolute human specificity of pmmov indicates that shellfish and shellfish growing water samples should be tested with multiple host associated markers such as crassphage human adenoviruses or human polyomaviruses in a toolbox format to achieve greater confidence in mst results ahmed et al 2016 feng et al 2018 harwood et al 2014 symonds et al 2018 further investigation is needed to determine if any correlations exist between pmmov and other human associated markers in shellfish and shellfish growing waters the concentrations of pmmov in influent wastewater shown in this study approx 107 gc l were similar to that reported from australia 5 7 107 gc l hughes et al 2017 germany 1 9 108 gc l hamza et al 2011 usa 2 1 108 gc l symonds et al 2017 and vietnam 5 5 106 gc l kuroda et al 2015 furthermore kitajima and colleagues also reported the consistent detection of high pmmov concentrations in influent 3 7 4 4 106 gc l and effluent 4 6 6 3 105 gc l wastewater throughout the year in southern arizona usa kitajima et al 2014 despite the lack of absolute specificity consistent occurrence and high concentrations in influent wastewater means that this virus is a potential candidate for tracking human faecal contamination especially in environmental waters with minimal avian in particular seagull activity araújo et al 2014 summa et al 2018 if high seagull populations are identified in the study area then additional human specific mst pcr markers and or mst pcr markers associated with seagulls green et al 2012 lee et al 2013 sinigalliano et al 2013 should be used to obtain confirmatory results in this study a high proportion of shellfish and shellfish growing water samples 90 and 56 respectively were positive for pmmov at the dnq level the high detection frequency of pmmov in shellfish and water may be attributed to the high stability of the pmmov in the environment hamza et al 2011 the greater occurrence of pmmov in shellfish compared to the growing waters could be due to the filter feeding mechanism of shellfish le guyader et al 2012 love et al 2010 enabling possible accumulation of pmmov in shellfish tissue further shellfish feeding studies using influent wastewater containing multiple host associated markers for example would be useful in understanding any selective mechanisms involved in pmmov accumulation in bivalve molluscan shellfish areas with low or no impact of human faecal contamination i e areas a to c most pmmov positive samples contained concentrations below the lloq indicating a low amount of faecal contamination from the specificity part of our study the pmmov detected in samples from these areas may at least in part have originated from birds i e black swan and seagulls an ongoing study of areas a b and c using faecal sterols as a source tracking tool indicated very low area a or no presence of human faecal contamination areas b and c yet indicated the presence of avian faecal contamination for almost one third of shellfish growing water samples data not shown this supports the hypothesis that birds could be an alternative source of pmmov albeit in low levels in shellfish and shellfish growing water conversely cockles collected from area d an area known to be subject to human faecal contamination were consistently positive for pmmov at high levels indicating its suitability for tracking the source of human faecal pollution however further studies would be required to investigate the potential contributions of avian sourced pmmov in shellfish and growing water based on the daily excretion rates of seagulls 50 g individual and black swans 418 g individual moriarty et al 2011 a review article includes unpublished data on pmmov in shellfish from a dutch study symonds et al 2018 according to the review pmmov was detected in 75 115 65 oysters and 64 86 74 mussels in the pmmov positive samples norovirus was detected in 24 18 75 of oysters and 52 33 64 mussels however of the norovirus positive shellfish pmmov co occurred in 18 21 86 oysters and 33 36 92 mussels symonds et al 2018 in the absence of plant source of pmmov in those study areas its presence in shellfish indicates human or animal bird faecal contamination with associated public health risks araújo et al 2014 for example norovirus outbreaks associated with the consumption of shellfish grown in faecally contaminated waters are frequently reported bellou et al 2013 simmons et al 2007 however direct monitoring of water and shellfish for norovirus is not always straightforward because its presence in the environment can be sporadic and varies depending upon the level of infection in the population zhang et al 2006 since pmmov is widely found in human wastewater at high concentrations it can be an alternative or additional option for monitoring faecal contamination in shellfish and growing waters however correlations between pmmov and infectious enteric viruses including norovirus need to be determined before incorporating the pmmov mst marker as a tool to identify human faecal contamination in shellfish and growing waters 5 conclusions this is the first study to report the presence of pmmov in faeces of black swan and also the first study in new zealand to report on the occurrence of pmmov in the aquatic environment and shellfish despite the occurrence of pmmov in certain animal bird faecal samples based on its high incidence and concentration in human wastewater pmmov may be a promising indicator of human faecal contamination further evaluation of pmmov will be required along with other human faecal associated markers such as bacteroides hf183 crassphage human adenovirus or human polyomavirus in shellfish and shellfish growing waters from different locations to determine the suitability of pmmov as a viral indicator of human faecal contamination or as an index virus for enteric viruses in waters and shellfish in addition correlations between pmmov and norovirus in shellfish and growing waters need to be determined prior to the implementation of this pcr marker for shellfish quality monitoring acknowledgments the
