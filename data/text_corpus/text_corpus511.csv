2555,intensity duration frequency idf curves sometimes also called precipitation frequency estimates are used to design urban drainage systems for stormwater control and when combined with hydrologic modeling to design flood control infrastructure and other structures however common approaches to estimating idf curves need to be revised to account for non stationarity from global climate change this review synthesizes the current knowledge and on going research regarding idf curves under non stationarity in particular this review briefly summarizes known and projected changes in extreme precipitation at the global scale describes approaches for idf curve estimation under non stationarity focusing on the covariate based approach and including a brief overview of the specific challenges facing snow dominated regions addresses the topic of regionalization under non stationarity which has been overlooked in previous reviews explores the challenges of design values and uncertainty in the context of non stationarity provides details on these topics in the context of the united states and finishes by enumerating needed avenues of future research keywords idf curves precipitation frequency non stationarity climate change regionalization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intensity duration frequency idf curves sometimes also called precipitation frequency estimates bonnin et al 2011a b provide estimates of the amount of rainfall intensity over a particular duration for a specified return period or probability of exceedance frequency idf curves are sometimes alternatively represented as depth duration frequency ddf curves where depth is simply the product of the intensity and the duration fig 1 shows examples of idf curves for boston massachusetts in the united states perica and pavlovic 2019 idf curves are developed via statistical frequency analysis as shown in fig 2 the analysis primarily consists of obtain observed precipitation data p obs process p obs into an annual maximum series ams or partial duration series pds p extreme for each duration of interest e g 24 hour storm an ams takes the maximum value of the timeseries in every water year thus it is a special form of block maxima where the block period is one year a pds also known as peaks over threshold sets a threshold and takes every independent event above that threshold fit an extreme value distribution evd to p extreme for each duration based on extreme value theory the generalized extreme value distribution gev is often used for ams and the generalized pareto distribution gp is often used for pds where the occurrence process follows the poisson distribution katz et al 2002 stedinger et al 1993 these distributions are not always the best choice e g alam et al 2018 fischer et al 2012 and there are a variety of other distributions that can be used instead such as the gamma and the log pearson type iii ouarda et al 2019 goodness of fit test statistics including information theory based statistics e g akaike or bayesian information criterion and statistical tests e g the anderson darling which emphasizes the tails of the distribution that describe the extremes farrel and stewart 2006 fischer et al 2012 can be used to select a distribution alternatively precipitation quantile estimates from all distributions that satisfy the goodness of fit criterion can be combined using the bayesian model averaging approach hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 use the quantiles of the evds to determine the intensity or depth associated with various frequencies or return periods e g 10 year for each duration correction factors may be applied to ensure that the intensity frequency curves for different durations do not cross which is physically implausible the resulting evds are assumed valid for the historical and future time periods idf curves can be site specific or regional a regional analysis consists of first identifying homogeneous regions and second fitting distributions to represent the at site and regional behavior homogeneous regions are typically identified via an iterative process of clustering stations based on at site characteristics e g elevation and precipitation characteristics e g the mean annual value and applying a homogeneity test idf curves are used by engineers to design urban drainage systems for stormwater control such systems comprise surface drainage i e pavement slope and roughness inlet spacing and capacity stormwater conveyance drain piping ditches and channels pumps and discharge facilities e g detention or retention basins brown et al 2013 when combined with hydrologic modeling idf curves are also used by engineers to design flood control infrastructure e g dams levees and other structures e g bridges in the absence of sufficient streamflow data brown et al 2013 idf curves are statistical models of precipitation which depends on weather and in turn depends on the climate since the late twentieth century climate scientists have observed that climate is not stationary but is subject to anthropogenic forcing for example in 1995 the ipcc claimed that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate ipcc 1995 and recently the attribution of anthropogenic climate change has been unequivocally confirmed ipcc 2021 it is helpful to note that climate change and also global warming are sometimes used as short hand for anthropogenic climate change but climate change is more general the american meteorological society definition of climate change is any systematic change in the long term statistics of climate elements such as temperature pressure or winds sustained over several decades or longer ams 2012 the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc uses climate change in reference to the anthropogenically forced changes of atmospheric composition in addition to natural climate variability over comparable time periods unfccc 1992 while anthropogenically forced changes are often the focus there are many other potential drivers of change such as solar variability orbital effects volcanism and land use changes which are independent of atmospheric composition however the timescale of these drivers is a key consideration in assessing stationarity thus forcings such as orbital changes over thousands of years are too small to identify in contemporary time series in this review the focus is on anthropogenic climate change while also acknowledging the importance of natural climate variability even though the climate is known to be non stationary idf curves have traditionally been developed assuming stationarity here defined as the assumption of a time invariant distribution following salas et al 2018 this is because the lack of predictability about the details of any future changes has often made stationarity the only practical assumption for infrastructure design recently however this assumption has been questioned and there is concern about non stationarity here defined as a distribution that changes in time again following salas et al 2018 as in hydrology idf curve non stationarity is often limited to a second order non stationarity which is when only the first and or second statistical moments of the underlying stochastic process change e g cunderlik and burn 2003 one reason for such a limitation is that hydro meteorological records are often short and do not allow a robust estimate of change in higher statistical moments e g salas et al 2018 as applied to idf curves the difference between stationarity and non stationarity can be aptly illustrated by considering the 10 year rainfall estimate from a statistical perspective the 10 year rainfall estimate is defined as the rainfall estimate that has a 10 chance of being exceeded in a given year while this statement is correct under both stationarity and non stationarity stationarity implies that the magnitude of the estimate remains constant regardless of the year while non stationarity implies that the magnitude of the estimate will change depending on the year often the 10 year rainfall estimate is colloquially described as occurring on average once every 10 years a statement which is only correct under stationarity an erroneous assumption about non stationarity can result in inadequate infrastructure that is vulnerable to failure under design or can lead to costly overdesign see rosner et al 2014 and salas et al 2018 for a discussion in the context of flooding thus there is an on going debate both in the academic literature and among practitioners regarding if and how non stationarity should be addressed in design for hydroclimatic extremes the debate centers on two key elements 1 the degree of consensus regarding the consequences of anthropogenic climate change and 2 uncertainty model complexity and data limitations these two key elements as relevant to idf curves are extensively discussed in subsequent sections for key advances in the debate not necessarily specific to idf curves see in order of publication date milly et al 2008 lins and cohn 2011 matalas 2012 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 milly et al 2015 and serinaldi et al 2018 the proliferation of academic literature and practitioner reports on potential non stationarity in idf curves and related topics has been summarized in several review papers and books for hydroclimatic extremes generally khaliq et al 2006 review approaches for frequency analysis of non stationary hydro meteorological observations aghakouchak et al 2013 compile a collection of articles on state of the art methods for all aspects of the analysis of climate extremes and is intended to be a primary reference on the topic slater et al 2021 review and synthesize methods over multiple spatial and temporal scales for what they call the entire nonstationary management process across all types of extremes rather than just one type such as precipitation for idf curves specifically willems et al 2012 review methodologies for assessing climate change impacts on urban rainfall extremes focusing on the use of general circulation model gcm projections of precipitation their findings are summarized in arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 yan et al 2021 review literature on updating idf curves under climate change focusing on covariate based distributions for non stationarity with some discussion of gcm projections of precipitation they also provide a summary of studies on rainfall trends martel et al 2021 summarize the science underlying changes in extreme precipitation and sources of uncertainty they also discuss current guidelines for adaptation and propose improvements for flood events specifically included here because of the frequent link between precipitation and flooding serinaldi and kilsby 2015 review and test the most prominent non stationary models to identify advantages and disadvantages salas et al 2018 review the recent literature on non stationary approaches and metrics for infrastructure investment françois et al 2019 review available design methods and guidelines under non stationarity wasko et al 2021 in addition to a brief review of methods compile governmental guidance that incorporates climate change this review builds on the previous reviews and current literature to synthesize the current knowledge and on going research regarding idf curves under non stationarity importantly this review covers the topic of regionalization which has not been addressed in previous reviews regionalization is a critical topic for two reasons first it is used in several government developed idf curves around the world svensson and jones 2010 second it is difficult to detect changes in extremes under climate change at point locations or very localized scales but the signal to noise ratio improves to detectable levels for regional scales wright et al 2019 other ways that this review is unique include providing the most comprehensive review to date of idf curve estimation following the covariate based approach in which the evd parameters depend on time varying covariates and briefly addressing the issue of snow dominated regions which at the intersection of multiple disciplines is overlooked in previous reviews we also note that this review supposes that the reader is familiar with commonly accepted methods for idf curve estimation under stationarity ample citations to previous literature are provided should more detail about particular methods be desired the motivation for this review grew out of the years long work of several research groups across the united states to address the issue of non stationarity in precipitation both rainfall and snow and floods broadly the groups work focused on the application of non stationarity in infrastructure design given that funding came from the strategic environmental research and development program within the united states department of defense we note that the views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding source since the author team is located within the united states and the research work motivating this review was focused on the united states we have included a section specifically addressing the united states context however the review overall is informed by studies around the globe 2 observed and projected changes in extreme precipitation observations show that by 2020 the global surface temperature land and ocean warmed by more than 1 c since the start of the 20th century and surface air temperatures continue to warm the ten highest temperatures all occurred since 2009 noaa ncei 2020 the global increase of temperature has led to other changes in the climate system in particular global observations of near surface atmospheric water vapor show that it has increased along with the observed warming seneviratne et al 2012 since the mid 20th century statistically significant increases in the percentage area frequency or intensity of extreme precipitation events have been found at global hemispheric continental including the united states and sub continental scales dittus et al 2015 huang et al 2017 kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 kunkel et al 2020a b olafsdottir et al 2021 papalexiou and montanari 2019 westra et al 2014 yan et al 2021 ye et al 2017 even though some regions show no change or even decreases hoerling et al 2016 see also yan et al 2021 for a table summarizing the results of multiple studies assessing trends in extreme precipitation additionally increases in precipitation extremes have been linked to increases in water vapor huang et al 2021 kunkel et al 2020a b concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves two points are of note in regards to observed changes in extreme precipitation first for regions with localized and inconsistent at site historical trends in extreme precipitation those trends may only minimally impact idf curve estimates obtained via large scale regionalization which could be a justification for assuming stationarity as in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 see bonnin et al 2011a b the counterpoint is that a lack of at site historical trends can be attributed to low signal to noise ratios that are typical in extreme event detection in contrast regional aggregation boosts the signal to noise ratio wright et al 2019 which could be a justification for assuming non stationarity second even when statistically significant trends in extreme precipitation are detected in the historical record some studies using the covariate based approach described in section 3 2 have found minimal impact on non stationary idf estimates or have found that the stationary model is statistically preferred however most studies using the covariate based approach have found that an assumption of non stationarity is justified based on statistical goodness of fit tests see table 1 climate model projections based on different scenarios of continued increases in greenhouse gases all show warming by the end of the 21st century projected globally averaged surface temperature warming ranges by scenario i e shared socioeconomic pathways ssp are estimated as 1 0 c to 1 8 c ssp1 1 9 1 3 c to 2 4 c ssp1 2 6 2 1 c to 3 5 c ssp2 4 5 2 8 c to 4 6 c ssp3 7 0 and 3 3 c to 5 7 c ssp5 8 5 ipcc 2021 a warming climate is expected to further increase the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events bador et al 2018 because warming causes an increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere via the clausius clapeyron relation which increases the moisture supply to storms thus producing more intense precipitation trenberth 2011 this expectation is reflected in model projections groisman et al 2012 kharin et al 2013 lehmann et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2018 pfahl et al 2017 sillmann et al 2013 xu et al 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc states it is very likely that heavy precipitation events will intensify and become more frequent in most regions with additional global warming at the global scale extreme daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 7 for each 1 c of global warming high confidence ipcc 2021 this 7 is a broad generalization and the exact value depends on the region the duration of the precipitation the precipitation rate and the temperature change martel et al 2021 yin et al 2018 it is well established that the change in future extreme precipitation is projected to be larger than the change in mean precipitation berg et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 swain et al 2018 westra et al 2014 for the annual global mean precipitation the ipcc 2021 projects that the change will very likely be only a 1 3 increase per1 c increase in the global mean temperature but there are likely to be decreases over the subtropics including the mediterranean southern africa and south west australia fig 3 shows projections from phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison projects cmip6 eyring et al 2016 models listed in table 2 which projects increases of annual maximum daily 2 m specific humidity everywhere and 30 year maximum daily precipitation almost everywhere globally under a high emissions scenario there are small areas of decreases in extreme precipitation in subtropical oceans the uncertainty in these projections as represented by the percentage of models agreeing on the sign of the change is higher for extreme precipitation than for specific humidity presumably due to the lower spatial coherence of extreme precipitation events compared to high humidity periods the highest agreement for extreme precipitation changes indicated by the absence of hatching in fig 3b is found along the pacific ocean intertropical convergence zone in the african sub saharan region eastern asia and at high latitude while model agreement is less than 80 for many mid latitude regions including parts of the contiguous united states and europe the spatial coherence of multi model mean increases in those areas supports a consistent climate system response to warming concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves one consideration is that it is challenging for climate models to simulate the observed local intensity and frequency of precipitation jones and randall 2011 o gorman 2015 in part due to coarse resolutions that require parameterizations of key mechanisms for extreme precipitation such as buoyancy driven convection while some modelling efforts are beginning to attain the level of complexity required to explicitly simulate deep convection prein et al 2017 and higher resolution models have lower precipitation bias cook et al 2020 schiemann et al 2018 there are still many precipitation related processes that occur where the chemistry and physics are on a spatial and temporal scale that is too small to explicitly model and thus have to be parameterized rummukainen 2015 additionally there are significant sematic differences between the climate and civil engineering communities regarding extreme events for the climate community extreme may be the upper 1 or 0 1 of daily precipitation events while for civil engineers extreme may be the 50 or 100 year event based on annual maxima consequently statements regarding future changes in precipitation from climate assessments e g those from the ipcc should not be used to justify non stationary idf curves bonnin et al 2011a b second also concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves it should be noted that the temporal scale of analysis is important at short future time horizons a decade or two natural climate variability often dominates as a driver of precipitation variability rather than longer term anthropogenically forced climate change easterling and wehner 2009 evin et al 2019 hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 yip et al 2011 cmip5 simulations show that a signal of anthropogenic forcing emerges in the 10 to 30 year timeframe stegall and kunkel 2019 also of note this anthropogenic forcing signal emerges earlier at the regional scale and may not be detected at the local scale until the end of the century martel et al 2018 3 idf curve estimation under non stationarity for previous reviews on incorporating non stationarity into idf curve estimation see willems et al 2012 yan et al 2021 and martel et al 2021 there are two primary approaches for incorporating non stationarity into idf curve estimation simulated precipitation in which the evd is fitted to simulated precipitation values or covariate based in which the evd parameters depend on time varying covariates both approaches are summarized in fig 2 and are discussed in depth in sections 3 1 and 3 2 fig 2 aims to capture the key elements of each approach regionalization techniques are discussed separately in section 4 since traditional stationary idf curves are the default approach possible rationale for choosing a non stationary approach are given caveats and reasons against choosing a non stationary approach are provided in the text there are of course many variations which are not all captured in fig 2 and there is a tension between how the approaches are implemented in various studies and what might be considered an ideal approach these issues are discussed in the sections below in regards to the naming of these approaches the review by yan et al 2021 use the names climate model based nonstationary idf curves and covariate based nonstationary idf curves since both approaches can use outputs from climate models we chose instead the name simulated precipitation for the former approach a third less common option is the scaling approach which applies a percentage increase to existing idf curves based on projected warming via relations such as the clausius clapeyron for a summary see martel et al 2021 for a discussion of various scaling relations see zhang et al 2017 and roderick et al 2020 for caveats associated with using simple scaling relationships see yin et al 2018 martel et al 2021 and schardong et al 2018 while martel et al 2021 document the use of the scaling approach in australia and canada it has in general been minimally applied as such and since martel et al 2021 provide a thorough overview we do not discuss it further several studies have begun to integrate methodologies between the simulated precipitation and covariate based approaches these studies obtain bias corrected and downscaled gcm precipitation simulations and then fit a distribution with time varying parameters to the simulations the second step may be quite simple a gev distribution with time as the covariate as in ganguli and coulibaly 2019 ragno et al 2018 thasneem and santosh 2021 um et al 2017 or more complex a four parameter beta distribution with a changing upper bound parameter conditioned on the rainfall timeseries as in lima et al 2016 other studies have modified or developed statistical downscaling methodologies to incorporate non stationarity for example agilan and umamahesh 2019 for weather generator silva et al 2021a 2021b for quantile matching and papalexiou et al 2018 for temporal disaggregation studies which compare multiple approaches are few and limited in spatial scope agilan and umamahesh 2016 analyzing a site in india recommend the covariate based approach because they found it was more conservative but their recommendation is case study specific e g at another location the simulated precipitation approach might be more conservative ren et al 2019 analyzing a catchment in the united states found that spatial heterogeneity causes as much variability in idf curve values as using different non stationary idf approaches and so they recommend using an ensemble of approaches 3 1 simulated precipitation approach the simulated precipitation approach fig 2 broadly consists of obtain simulated precipitation values p sim over historical and future time periods typically from an ensemble of gcms the simulated values usually require downscaling and bias correction the ensemble may be subset based on model skill process p sim into p extreme for each duration of interest and for each ensemble member fit an evd to p extreme for each duration and for each quasi stationary time period and for each ensemble member quasi stationary time periods are created by dividing the full analysis period into sub periods e g a historical and future period or consecutive periods several decades long that are assumed stationary even though the underlying premise is non stationarity use the quantiles of the evds to determine the intensity associated with various frequencies for each duration and for each quasi stationary time period and for each ensemble member create future projections either by using the fitted evds associated with the future time period or by using the ratio of the future to historical quantiles to adjust the traditional idf curve summarize the ensemble using a statistic such as the mean the simulated precipitation approach has been implemented in the united states in new york degaetano and castellano 2017 virginia miro et al 2021 and the pacific northwest mauger et al 2021 and has been recommended by the massachusetts executive office of energy and environmental affairs ma eea 2021 concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves it is notable that the simulated precipitation approach implicitly assumes non stationarity even though quasi stationary time periods may be used for fitting the distributions because anthropogenic climate change scenarios are used to force the gcms since willems et al 2012 summarized in arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 provide such a comprehensive review of the simulated precipitation approach here only a brief discussion of notable recent advances is given recent case study applications in the literature are too numerous to list the notable recent advances all apply to methods for bias correction and downscaling which can be achieved either statistically or dynamically within the category of statistical methods some recent studies have developed new quantile matching methods butcher et al 2021 simonovic et al 2017 srivastav et al 2014 within the category of dynamical methods which typically rely on regional climate models rcms recent advances have led to high resolution convection permitting models which provide better simulations of sub daily rainfall extremes but have high computational cost and their own uncertainties for a discussion of these models see westra et al 2014 and zhang et al 2017 comparisons of various methods for bias correction and downscaling are many see for example cannon et al 2015 manola et al 2018 and hassanzadeh et al 2019 to date there is no clearly superior method for bias correction and spatial downscaling and performance depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to spatial resolution geography and climatology of the region of interest and how calibration is performed cook et al 2020 gutiérrez et al 2019 lanzante et al 2018 3 2 covariate based approach the covariate based approach fig 2 broadly consists of obtain p obs process p obs into p extreme for each duration of interest determine suitable covariates based on causative mechanisms for p extreme fit an evd with parameters dependent on the covariates to p extreme for each duration use the quantiles of the evds to determine the intensity associated with various frequencies for each duration accounting for non stationarity create future projections by forcing the evds with projections of the covariates clearly identifying the presence of non stationarity and the underlying causes i e the attribution which allows identification of covariates is essential to the covariate based approach slater et al 2021 provide a comprehensive overview of the topic of attribution for hydroclimatic extremes in general noting that typically the first step is exploratory data analysis followed by empirical or simulation based analysis more details are provided below for the case of precipitation extremes studies using the covariate based approach for developing idf curves are detailed in table 1 this table was developed by a performing a google scholar search with the keywords idf non stationary climate change and limiting results to 2010 and onward b reviewing references cited by yan et al 2021 which is a review of the topic and c reviewing references that cite cannon 2010 and cheng and aghakouchack 2014 which are some of the early and formative studies on the topic to be included in this table studies needed to be written in english we did not have the capability to thoroughly review literature in other languages although we are sure relevant studies exist either peer reviewed journal articles or government related reports and not solely focused on identifying trends in observed data as can be seen from table 1 most of the studies are limited to the historical period many studies begin by using null hypothesis tests non parametric such as the mann kendall trend test or parametric such as the slope of a regression line to identify whether non stationarity is detected in the observed time series studies generally use the gev for ams and the gp for pds but vary widely regarding which subsets of parameters are modeled as non stationary for those studies using pds only two mondal and mujumdar 2015 wi et al 2015 allow the poisson distribution which models the occurrence rate to be non stationary in regards to distribution choice an interesting new development is the use of the metastatistical extreme value distribution which makes use of non asymptotic data i e ordinary not just extreme events marra et al 2019 vidrio sahagún and he 2022c only some studies analyze multiple durations and of those only ouarda et al 2019 employ a unified model that accounts for all durations simultaneously in contrast most studies choose separate models for each duration even at one location thus the issue of consistency across durations in particular that of intensity frequency curves crossing for different durations has not been addressed as seen in table 1 for covariates studies either use time or meteorological indices often large scale climate patterns but also sometimes regional or local data examples of large scale climate patterns are north atlantic oscillation nao in north america whan and zwiers 2017 and europe tabari and willems 2018 and the madden julian oscillation mjo in asia australia liang et al 2022 schreck 2021 among many others time as a covariate does not represent a mechanistic process i e a land surface atmospheric or oceanic phenomenon that is a driver of extreme precipitation importantly the first covariate based study applied to precipitation uses a climate covariate el adlouni et al 2007 and very recent studies follow this precedent while no studies have done so as of yet there is no reason that land surface changes could not be included as a covariate provided a strong relationship to extreme precipitation can be established covariates can be identified based on meteorological arguments i e understanding the drivers of p extreme for the region of interest and via statistical analysis e g correlation between p extreme and a potential covariate often covariates are then further vetted based on the performance of the non stationary distribution using those covariates agilan and umamahesh 2017 the parameter linking formulation i e mathematical form by which the parameters are dependent on the covariates is usually regression based and varies from a simple linear dependence to complex relationships for a long but non exhaustive list of possibilities see um et al 2017 when the mathematical form linking a known mechanistic process to precipitation e g a linear regression is hard to identify a non parametric approach such as conditional density networks cannon 2010 can be used the caveat is that non parametric approaches are highly sensitive to the sample data used for fitting and thus may not be appropriate for the purpose of out of sample projection in the studies in table 1 distributions are usually fit via maximum likelihood estimation or its generalized form sometimes in a bayesian context calculation of non stationary return periods is discussed in section 5 since most studies are limited to the historical period the challenge of developing future projections is generally not addressed the exception is demaria et al 2017 but since this study uses time as the covariate projections are simple to create relative to the case of a climate based covariate often studies conclude by justifying a stationary or non stationary model based on a goodness of fit metric using likelihood information there are caveats associated with using goodness of fit metrics to choose a model these issues are discussed and procedure to address them via decomposition of the nonstationary stochastic processes in vidrio sahagún and he 2022b it is worth noting that even though the covariate based approach aims to be non stationary whether or not the statistical model is actually non stationary depends on the statistical significance of the coefficients on the covariates graphical representation of covariate based idf curves is challenging due to the dependence on time whether via covariates or directly idf curves are already three dimensional and non stationarity adds a fourth dimension or more if there are multiple covariates that merit being displayed separately the challenge of graphical representation is discussed in ouarda et al 2019 the variety of different graphical representations employed by the studies in table 1 can be divided into two main categories various implementations of these categories are shown in fig 4 also of importance is how to graphically display the uncertainty one approach which mirrors a more standard idf curve representation is to represent the uncertainty as an interval or range around the idf curve as in cheng and aghakouchack 2014 the first category fig 4a appears to be a standard idf curve with intensity or depth on the y axis duration on the x axis and different return periods represented as separate lines alternatively duration can be on the x axis and different return periods represented by separate lines to generate this type of figure one set of distribution parameters must be chosen for example the chosen parameter set could correspond to a percentile of the parameters as in fig 1 of cheng and aghakouchack 2014 where the 95th percentile is used or could be the parameter set associated with the final year of analysis as in fig 10 of wi et al 2015 regardless of how the one parameter set is chosen in this first category the non stationary aspect is made implicit and the fact that the return periods are changing with time is masked in contrast the second category makes the non stationary aspect explicit by showing intensity on the y axis and either time or another covariate on the x axis fig 4c and 4d different return periods are represented as separate lines for a given duration as in fig 8 of vasiliades et al 2015 alternatively different durations could be shown for one return period if there is more than one covariate then a contour plot or three dimensional plot can be used as in fig 5 of cannon 2010 or figs 3 and 5 of ouarda et al 2019 fig 4e or time can be on the x axis since any covariate is time dependent by design fig 4d an alternative approach is to show the intensity as a probability density function for a given duration and return period as in fig 5 of lee et al 2020 fig 4b concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves some frameworks for the covariate based approach recommend only applying non stationary models when non stationarity is detected in the historical record cheng and aghakouchack 2014 the problem is that null hypothesis tests which are commonly used for detecting non stationarity are subjective i e dependent on the predetermined p value or type of test cheng and aghakouchack 2014 and are not suitable for this purpose as shown by serinaldi et al 2018 the alternative is to fit both stationary and non stationary models and allow a goodness of fit metric to choose e g lee et al 2020 seo et al 2021 vu and mishra 2019 the problem is that the additional parameters of a non stationary model compared to a stationary model can cause overfitting there are also the issues of equifinality i e two parameter sets showing similar performance for the training sample can provide significantly different prediction when used out of sample additionally different metrics may prefer different models to address these problems vidrio sahagún and he 2022a propose a procedure to decompose the mean and the variance of extreme precipitation into a stationary stochastic process and a deterministic trend then model them using a combination of stationary distributions and parsimonious models in regards to representing non stationarity in the probability distribution serinaldi and kilsby 2015 argue that in the absence of covariates and parameter linking formulations that represent mechanistic processes the more parsimonious stationary model should be assumed the reason for this is that statistical inference from observed temporal data is theoretically justifiable if the modeled process is ergodic an assumption that does not hold under non stationarity see koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 for a detailed explanation of ergodicity 3 3 snow dominated regions we define snow dominated regions as locations where snowmelt and rain on snow events are the dominant flood generating mechanisms wigmosta 2020 certainly then adequate treatment of snow dominant regions requires the consideration of runoff processes which are not addressed in this review however we thought it necessary to at least briefly address such regions here given that a a sizeable portion of northern hemisphere regions of the world fall into this category barnett et al 2005 b climate change has the potential to modify the dynamics of regions that are currently snow dominated potentially even transitioning them to rainfall dominated usgcrp 2018 zion klos et al 2014 and c previous idf curve and flood review articles have overlooked this topic given the brevity of research on the topic we hope this brief overview will motivate future work and analysis regardless of non stationarity there are multiple approaches to design in snow dominated regions which range from the blind approach of simply using conventional idf curves e g scdm 2016 to the tuning factor approach of adding a snowmelt factor to the conventional idf curves e g smmew 2004 to sophisticated physics based hydrologic modeling for large high cost and high risk infrastructure design e g ufc 2013 of note each approach has limitations both the blind and tuning factor approaches assume that precipitation is in the form of rainfall that is immediately subject to rainfall runoff processes this assumption would lead to over design if the precipitation is primarily snowfall and could lead to under design for a snowmelt or rain on snow event physics based modeling can be more accurate than the blind or tuning factor approaches but it is more analytically and computationally expensive recently a few studies have developed approaches that are more sophisticated than the blind or tuning factor approaches but less complex than a full physics based model specifically cho and jacobs 2020 apply traditional idf curve analysis to snow water equivalent and yan et al 2018 propose what they term next generation idf curves which are based on available water for runoff at the ground surface rather than precipitation for further discussion implementation and validation of next generation idf curves see hamlet 2018 yan et al 2019a b and yan et al 2020a b to the authors knowledge there are only two examples of non stationary idf curves for snow dominated regions both follow primarily the simulated precipitation approach but make use of a snowmelt or hydrologic model yan et al 2016 used dynamically downscaled and bias corrected gcm projections to obtain precipitation and to force a snowmelt model a non stationary statistical model with time as the covariate was then applied to the combined projections of precipitation and snowmelt to develop idf curves hou et al 2019 used dynamically downscaled gcm projections to force a hydrologic model the outputs of the hydrologic model were used to calculate available water for runoff i e the input for next generation idf curves and then stationary statistics were applied to develop idf curves 4 regionalization regionalization relies on the assumption that within a defined homogeneous region the underlying distribution of rainfall at all sites within the region is the same except for a scaling factor thereby enabling data to be pooled across different sites and inform a single frequency analysis regionalization is particularly useful for the frequency analysis of extreme events which are rare by definition because it improves quantile estimates at ungauged locations or sites with short record lengths fowler and kilsby 2003 hosking and wallis 1997 seidou et al 2006 regional frequency analysis consists of two primary steps first identifying homogeneous regions and second fitting distributions to represent the at site and regional behavior delineating homogeneous regions is difficult and often criticized for being based on subjective decision making and for lacking physical justification nguyen et al 2002 low levels of heterogeneity in a region can affect the frequency analysis halbert et al 2017 regardless of these issues regional frequency analysis has a long history and broad applications partially due to is ease of implementation renard 2011 studies on the topic of regionalization specific to precipitation extremes in the context of non stationarity are detailed in table 3 to be included in this table the study had to focus on precipitation extremes not streamflow and include an analysis of precipitation quantiles i e could not just be a clustering study additional studies on the topic in the context of non stationarity are available in the streamflow and flood literature basu and srinivas 2013 cunderlik and burn 2003 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 leclerc and ouarda 2007 markiewicz et al 2006 o brien and burn 2014 schlef et al 2018 studies comparing various non stationary regional approaches are limited to the index flood method specifically nam et al 2015 kim et al 2020 and for streamflow kalai et al 2020 kalai et al 2020 provide the most extensive comparison using flood data and found that of the six approaches tested on both synthetic and real data two performed best one allowed non stationarity in the growth curve the other applies a transformation to obtain stationary values as can be seen from table 3 most studies either assume a region a priori or identify and justify regions based on historical information the exception is hanel et al 2009 in which homogeneous regions are determined from both historical and future information an alternative is to divide the full time period into sub periods and identify regions separately for each sub period guntu et al 2020 mannan et al 2018 samantaray et al 2021 analogous to the quasi stationary time periods sometimes used with the simulated precipitation approach this alternative has been employed by clustering studies but not yet applied to idf curve estimation and hence is not included in table 3 there are regional versions discussed below of the simulated precipitation approach and the covariate based approach however sometimes the approaches are combined analogous to the tendency toward combination in recent at site studies one example is hanel et al 2009 who employ a covariate based approach with the index flood method where the model is fitted to precipitation values from an rcm over the historical and future periods other examples are lehmann et al 2016 and lima et al 2018 as can be seen from table 3 for regional simulated precipitation approach the simplest option is to apply conventional stationary regionalization techniques without modification to downscaled and bias corrected gcm precipitation projections e g forsee and ahmad 2011 lu et al 2015 mailhot et al 2007 in a more complex option lima et al 2018 propose a bayesian based model that addresses the high level of uncertainty associated with gcm representation of spatial variability for regional covariate based approach the methods are based on either modifying the index flood method or developing bayesian hierarchical models one study proposes an unusual method based on a max stable process model westra and sisson 2011 for the index flood method non stationarity is applied in either or both the growth curve the term for the regional distribution and the index flood the term for the scaling factor which translates the regional quantiles to site specific locations a non stationary index flood method was first demonstrated by cunderlik and burn 2003 for streamgage data and has since also been applied to precipitation data one study takes the unusual approach of detrending the data applying the conventional stationary index flood method then re introducing the trend sung et al 2018 for the bayesian hierarchical models a variety of forms are employed for the at site data layer which consists of an extreme value distribution applied to each location and the regional process layer which captures spatial dependence between locations via a distribution for the parameters of the extreme value distribution used in the at site layer 5 design values and uncertainty since non stationarity implies that the distribution parameters change over time it is challenging to calculate a traditional return period i e the inverse of the exceedance probability for use in design studies following the simulated precipitation approach often create quasi stationary time periods and calculate distinct return periods subsequently the ratio of the future to historical values is often used as a climate factor to adjust the historical idf curves see willems et al 2012 for more details quasi stationary time periods are created by dividing the full analysis period into sub periods e g a historical and future period or consecutive periods several decades long that are assumed stationary even though the underlying premise is non stationarity studies following the covariate based approach see table 1 may calculate a different return period in every year e g sugahara et al 2009 and many of the other studies in table 1 or calculate the return period based on a certain e g 95th percentile of the distribution parameters e g cheng and aghakouchack 2014 or based on a certain e g the most recent year of the analysis e g wi et al 2015 only one study uses a risk of failure metric demaria et al 2017 theoretically quasi stationary time periods could also be used with the covariate based approach for example the 100 year flood could be calculated in every year of the analysis and then averaged within each 30 year time period but this approach has not yet been applied see table 1 the return period can be mathematically reformulated for non stationarity by recognizing that an equivalent definition of the return period is the expected waiting time to an extreme event olsen et al 1998 or similarly the expected number of events parey et al 2007 using this equivalent definition a non stationary return period can be calculated with the binomial distribution olsen et al 1998 or the geometric distribution salas and obeysekera 2014 for extensions from one to multiple extreme events see obeysekera and salas 2016 and salas and obeysekera 2019 of note the expected waiting time requires extrapolation of the non stationary distribution beyond the design life of a project adding uncertainty to the return period and the risk estimates rootzén and katz 2013 salas et al 2018 even with reformulations for non stationarity the concept of return period is limited because it does not incorporate information about the infrastructure lifespan read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2018 serinaldi 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 an alternative is to base design values on both exceedance probability and infrastructure lifespan and studies have proposed various methods with a variety of names mailhot and duchesne 2010 no particular name is provided rootzén and katz 2013 design life level and relatedly minimax design life level salas and obeysekera 2014 risk of failure and reliability here risk is more akin probability and does not imply damages read and vogel 2015 reliability and read and vogel 2016 time of failure from hazard function analysis these concepts as well as reformulated return periods are described in depth in the review by salas et al 2018 notably salas et al 2018 found that the reliability and risk of failure estimations are similar even though the methods are different importantly these concepts require that a mathematical form for non stationarity e g a linear regression on a covariate be known limiting their applicability to the covariate based approach also of note even though including infrastructure lifespan more closely aligns with societal interests read and vogel 2015 serinaldi 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 many studies continue to employ simplistic adaptions of the traditional concept of return period see table 1 this is also noted by previous studies read and vogel 2015 and salas and obeysekera 2014 in conventional idf curves apart from considerations of non stationarity the primary sources of uncertainty are observational error and heterogenous spatial distribution of gages willems et al 2012 natural climate variability via short observational records bhatia and ganguly 2019 fadhel et al 2017 and the methodology for computing idf curves agilan et al 2021 lopez cantu and samaras 2018 underwood et al 2020 non stationarity adds additional sources of uncertainty in the sense that additional assumptions models and parameters are needed for the simulated precipitation approach these additional sources are greenhouse gas emissions scenarios climate model structure and parameters natural climate variability via initialization for climate models and methodology for bias correction and post processing for more details see reviews provided in martel et al 2021 and willems et al 2012 there are many case studies on this topic for a sampling see cook et al 2020 hassanzadeh et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 rupa et al 2015 switzman et al 2017 yang et al 2018 for the covariate based approach the additional sources of uncertainty stem from choice of covariate and additional parameters agilan and umamahesh 2018 ouarda et al 2020 notably the covariate based approach also has the sources of uncertainty associated with the simulated precipitation approach when projections of covariates are obtained from climate models the contribution of each source of uncertainty to the total uncertainty can be assessed via sensitivity analysis a common and relatively simple approach is analysis of variance anova hawkins and sutton 2009 however this assessment has only been applied to the simulated precipitation approach there have been recent methodological developments which allow missing information e g not all regional circulation models were forced by all gcms which has in the past been an obstacle in using anova specifically evin et al 2019 introduced the qualypso method an approach that merges the quasi ergodic anova method developed by hingray and said 2014 with bayesian data augmentation techniques an example of application for hydrological extremes is given in lemaitre basset et al 2021 the statistical approach to quantifying uncertainty regardless of non stationarity is to generate confidence intervals or in the bayesian case credible intervals methods for generating these intervals are well established obeysekera and salas 2014 while the profile likelihood method provides the most accurate estimate for the confidence intervals its use is limited because it is burdensome computationally and numerically unstable when only short records are available however an enhanced likelihood profile method that significantly reduces these burdens has recently been proposed vidrio sahagún and he 2022a for projections under non stationarity uncertainty is quantified via ensembles of greenhouse scenarios of initial states of gcms rcms of downscaling methods etc arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 willems et al 2012 ensembles can be improved by weighting or sub setting gcm rcm members based on performance agilan and umamahesh 2016 rupa et al 2015 for a review see raju and kumar 2020 although such efforts are complicated by interdependencies among gcms among other challenges knutti et al 2010 2013 for the covariate based approach metrics of uncertainty can also be used to decide between different candidate models lee et al 2020 seo et al 2021 regardless of non stationarity uncertainty may be incorporated into design via predetermined safety factors however there is no guidance for how to use the information contained in confidence or credible intervals leading users to often default to the median value in the context of non stationarity simple approaches to addressing uncertainty include a extending the safety factor idea to develop climate factors ragno et al 2018 willems et al 2012 which are recommended in design by hong kong and the united kingdom lopez cantu and samaras 2018 b reducing ensemble information to the value of the median or another quantile for example new york city uses the 90th percentile of the projected precipitation nyc 2020 although a caveat is that higher percentiles are more sensitive to sources of uncertainty such as model structure and parameters cook et al 2020 or c choosing the next highest return period cook et al 2020 more complex approaches to addressing uncertainty are robustness based decision methods which seek to identify a design that performs satisfactorily i e meets a threshold of performance similar to the performance based design used by earthquake engineering as described in simonovic 2020 over a wide range of plausible futures robustness based decision methods were explicitly developed to address the deep i e difficult to define and accurately quantify uncertainty associated with climate change kandlikar et al 2005 lempert 2002 robustness based decision methods include robust decision making lempert et al 2003 and its multi objective form kasprzyk et al 2013 info gap analysis ben haim 2006 and scenario neutral prudhomme et al 2010 or decision scaling brown et al 2011 2012 for a review of these methods see ray and brown 2015 although applications for idf curves are limited casal campos et al 2018 kirshen et al 2015 semadeni davies 2004 robustness based decision methods have been applied in multiple hydrologic studies see françois et al 2019 for a description of some a related concept is flexible or adaptive design in which the possibility of updating or adapting based on subsequent information is incorporated into the original design haasnoot et al 2013 hino and hall 2017 hui et al 2018 flexible or adaptive design has yet to be implemented for idf curves precedent for adoption of these methods has been set in the broader hydrologic community by the world bank ray and brown 2015 and the international hydropower association iha 2019 concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves three points are of note first in regards to the relative magnitude of various sources of uncertainty studies have shown that updates to idf curves with changes in methodology or longer observational records can result in uncertainty that is larger than that from gcm projections ganguli and coulibaly 2017 underwood et al 2020 second multiple studies have argued based on theoretical reasons and the results of case study applications that in some cases stationarity is preferred because non stationary models lead to uninformative increases in uncertainty due to added parameters model structures that are not determined deductively and additional covariates which are themselves uncertain and are likely not parsimonious lee et al 2020 mondal and daniel 2019 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 vogel and kroll 2020 additionally serinaldi and kilsby 2015 demonstrate how the estimation of additional model parameters can lead to an overwhelming uncertainty when extrapolating beyond the training sample with the caveat that non stationary models using only the time covariate were discussed which is tied to the issue of equifinality third the issue of incorporating uncertainty into design is not simply a statistical or engineering question but is closely tied to stakeholder engagement one study found that stakeholders preferred simplified results that minimized uncertainty information for idf curves under climate change sandink et al 2016 6 united states context in the united states idf curves were first developed at a national scale in 1935 by the department of agriculture many iterations later see lopez cantu and samaras 2018 for details idf curves are now provided in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 for all but the northwestern states wa or id mt and wy which are provided in the older noaa atlas 2 nws 2021 the atlases provide rainfall estimates for select durations between five minutes to 60 days and for select return periods between one to 1000 years atlas 14 is based on regional frequency analysis following the state of the practice hosking and wallis approach commonly called the index flood method bonnin et al 2011a b hosking and wallis 1997 2005 atlas 2 is based on annual maximum series from each location converted to partial duration statistics then fitted to the fisher tippett type 1 distribution using the method of moments miller et al 1973 some have noted that current united states infrastructure is being designed using idf curves that are outdated by as much as half a century rendering that infrastructure already inadequate fagnant et al 2020 wright et al 2019 currently there is impetus and on going work to update the atlas defazio 2021 hdsc 2022 concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves atlas 14 was developed assuming stationarity which was considered justified after an analysis found only localized instances of historical trend that would have minimally impacted the results bonnin et al 2011a b however noaa s hydrometeorological design studies center hdsc has conducted pilot projects to determine a suitable method for incorporating non stationary frequency analysis and climate projections into a future version of the atlas hdsc 2022 and are planning updates graziano 2022 somewhat relatedly it is noteworthy that seasonal predictions of precipitation from noaa include trending data based on the persistence of observed average anomalies for a given season during the last 15 years nws cpc 2021 6 1 observed and projected changes in extreme precipitation in the united states the observed signal of change in extreme precipitation depends on the spatial scale of the analysis while the general trend at the continental scale is an increase in extreme precipitation events at the regional scale there are sizeable variations in the magnitude and direction of change easterling et al 2017 kunkel et al 2020a b additionally when analyzing small regions or individual stations it is difficult to detect changes in extreme precipitation events because the small spatial scales leads to data with low signal to noise ratios wright et al 2019 increases in the northeast are non linear in time and appear to be characterized by step changes huang et al 2017 increases in the northern great plains are statistically significant when aggregated kunkel et al 2020a b while most individual stations are not statistically significant flanagan and mahmood 2021 the two most prominent changes observed in snow dominated regions across the united states are significant reductions in the fraction of winter precipitation falling as snow and a shift in the timing of snowmelt runoff to earlier in the year usgcrp 2018 see clow 2010 ford et al 2021 and wagner et al 2021 for studies specific to the rocky mountains the non alpine eastern united states and the pacific northwest respectively in the western united states the occurrence of rain on snow events has declined at low elevation sites but increased at high elevation sites mccabe et al 2007 in the northwestern united states an overall statistically significant increase in rain on snow events has been observed in mountainous regions yan et al 2019a water vapor is the most important modulator of extreme precipitation magnitude in the contiguous united states kunkel et al 2020a b changes in snow are clearly linked to warming from anthropogenic climate change and are influenced by interactions with regional humidity and solar radiation usgcrp 2018 yan et al 2019b additionally land cover characteristics impact snow accumulation and ablation in mountain forest environments broxton et al 2015 varhola et al 2010 in the contiguous united states models project increases of about 20 40 in extreme specific humidity fig 3a and 0 40 in extreme precipitation depending on the location fig 3b other studies also find an overall increasing trend in projected extreme precipitation janssen et al 2014 zobel et al 2018 the fourth united states national climate assessment showed that the number of extreme precipitation events exceeding a 5 year return period are projected to increase by two to three times the historical average by the end of the 21st century under the high rcp8 5 emissions scenario easterling et al 2017 in regards to snow projections show large declines in snowpack due to reduced snowfall and earlier onset of spring melt in the western united states and shifts to more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow in many parts of the central and eastern united states usgcrp 2018 as an example of how significant this change can be projections under high emissions scenarios show that mountain areas in california with winters currently dominated by snow would begin to receive more precipitation as rain and then only rain by 2050 usgcrp 2018 6 2 design values and uncertainty regardless of non stationarity design standards can vary significantly across regions of the united states because guidelines are not released at the same time leading to variations in record lengths and methodologies across guidelines lopez cantu and samaras 2018 underwood et al 2020 additionally after more than 100 years of its use the return period concept has significant limitations which are acknowledged by both academic and government entities usgs 2021 volpi et al 2015 in regards to quantifying uncertainty noaa atlas 14 was the first of the united states idf curve iterations to provide confidence interval information and did so for parameter uncertainty via monte carlo simulations lopez cantu and samaras 2018 perica et al 2013 while revision to united states design standards and noaa atlas 14 are massive undertakings that require leadership from the federal government wright et al 2021 revision may be possible while still preserving the considerable investment in collection quality control and regionalization of observed precipitation data that noaa atlas 14 represents for example butcher et al 2021 explicitly develops a simulated precipitation approach that fits within the broader noaa atlas 14 framework 7 future research needs based on our review of the literature here we compile a list of future research needs of note we do not address research needs surrounding observed and projected changes in precipitation since that is primarily the domain of climate modelers nor do we address research needs associated with the simulated precipitation approach since our review of that topic was limited instead we refer the reader to willems et al 2012 and yan et al 2021 in regards to idf curve estimation under non stationarity in general the key research needs are to evaluate the two approaches simulated precipitation and covariate based via thoughtful and thorough comparison studies under a variety of hydrometeorological contexts currently only two such comparison studies exist and both are limited in spatial scope for an example of a large scale comparison of methods under non stationarity but on the topic of flood frequency estimation see schlef et al 2021 develop innovative methods to combine the two approaches which accentuate the strengths and balance the weaknesses of each approach while maintaining physical plausibility current attempts at combining the two approaches focus on applying a non stationary distribution to gcm precipitation projections or incorporating non stationarity in statistical downscaling investigate the limitations and strengths of using a scaling factor as a possible third approach especially in contexts where approximations are still informative for decision making the academic literature which applies this technique is quite limited but scaling factor values are recommended by some governments highlighting the need for further investigation explore the feasibility and value of using an ensemble of approaches similar to the use of an ensemble of climate models for generating projections one of the comparison studies recommends the use of ensembles but there are numerous challenges e g additional analytical and computational costs that need to be overcome in regards to the covariate based approach the key research needs are to apply the covariate based approach to both historical and future periods the majority of covariate based studies focus on the historical period effectively reducing the study to a sophisticated check for non stationarity rather than a framework for projection of non stationary idf curves application to the future period can introduce many additional challenges such as obtaining projections of covariates and calculation of non stationary return periods or alternative design values determine an encompassing approach to identifying mechanistic covariates detecting appropriate covariates is a challenging task due to the lack of long term data the presence of several overlapping trends and the fact that the covariates may differ for different durations of rainfall extremes vu and mishra 2019 existing studies take a variety of approaches that have not been coalesced into a unifying and broadly applicable framework which inhibits the adoption of the covariate based approach a corollary to this is comparing the effect of using different covariate identifying approaches on the final design value for an example of guidance for identifying covariates but for flood frequency estimation see schlef et al 2018 a similar type of guidance needs to be developed for idf curves explicitly address various durations in the analysis and develop methods to ensure that non stationary intensity frequency curves do not cross for various durations ouarda et al 2019 provide one approach to modeling multiple durations simultaneously this is especially necessary given that short duration rainfall intensities are projected to change at different rates from longer duration events westra et al 2014 in regards to snow dominated regions the key research need is to apply the covariate based approach to snow dominated regions while at the same time improving and expanding on work using the simulated precipitation approach also as discussed below the issue of regionalization is particularly relevant for snow dominated regions at the intersection of many disciplines this topic seems to be relatively overlooked yet clearly it is critically important given that a sizeable portion of northern hemisphere regions of the world fall into the snow dominated category barnett et al 2005 in regards to regionalization the key research need is to develop methods for detecting non stationary regions the literature is currently extremely limited and to improve upon and compare approaches index flood and bayesian hierarchical for distribution fitting special attention should be given to the formation of homogeneous regions in zones which are currently snow dominated but are projected to transition to rainfall a starting point could be developing improved approaches for detecting spatially coherent trends an example of this but applied to peak river flows is given by prosdocimi et al 2019 these topics merit much more attention than they currently receive given that a regionalization is preferred over at site analysis since data across space can be a substitute for limited temporal records burn 2014 b regionalization is used in several government developed idf curves in multiple countries svensson and jones 2010 c the climate change signal emerges earlier at the regional level thus avoiding conflicting at site information martel et al 2018 stegall and kunkel 2019 and d climate change has the potential to transition snow dominated regions to rainfall dominated usgcrp 2018 zion klos et al 2014 in regards to design values and uncertainty the key research needs are to evaluate the contribution of different sources of uncertainty and their propagation the development of non stationary idf curves is subject to various uncertainties that stem from the data and modeling approaches for example the lack of long term and fine timescale rainfall data often results in less reliable idf curves regional frequency analysis can address the issue of short records but also introduces its own uncertainties moges et al 2021 projection of future rainfall has considerable uncertainty that could be dealt with using multiple climate models and projections and suitable downscaling techniques lopez cantu et al 2020 develop design metrics based on both exceedance probability and infrastructure lifespan which can be applied to non stationary outputs from both the simulated precipitation and covariate based approaches currently the simulated precipitation approach is dependent on quasi stationary time periods which not only require the re assumption of stationarity although there might be some justification for this if the underlying change is not very abrupt and the period length is short enough e g a couple of decades such that natural variability dominates and limit the amount of data thus increasing the uncertainty of extremes but also do not incorporate infrastructure lifespan a corollary research need is for such metrics to be more widely adapted in analysis currently many covariate based studies avoid this issue by only analyzing the historical period or by calculating non stationary return periods that are not useful for design e g calculating a different return period for each year apply and demonstrate robustness based decision methods to idf curve studies currently there are only three idf curve studies which use such methods efforts to this effect would be aided by guidebooks or toolkits to streamline the analysis complexity and tools for communicating uncertainty to broad audiences for an example and guidance work on this topic can reference the numerous examples in the flood frequency literature see françois et al 2019 for a list of some there is a gap between research and the implementation of non stationary idf curves for design purposes we believe that addressing the above research needs will not only result in an improved ability to estimate idf curves under non stationarity from global climate change but will also make research outcomes whether frameworks

2555,intensity duration frequency idf curves sometimes also called precipitation frequency estimates are used to design urban drainage systems for stormwater control and when combined with hydrologic modeling to design flood control infrastructure and other structures however common approaches to estimating idf curves need to be revised to account for non stationarity from global climate change this review synthesizes the current knowledge and on going research regarding idf curves under non stationarity in particular this review briefly summarizes known and projected changes in extreme precipitation at the global scale describes approaches for idf curve estimation under non stationarity focusing on the covariate based approach and including a brief overview of the specific challenges facing snow dominated regions addresses the topic of regionalization under non stationarity which has been overlooked in previous reviews explores the challenges of design values and uncertainty in the context of non stationarity provides details on these topics in the context of the united states and finishes by enumerating needed avenues of future research keywords idf curves precipitation frequency non stationarity climate change regionalization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intensity duration frequency idf curves sometimes also called precipitation frequency estimates bonnin et al 2011a b provide estimates of the amount of rainfall intensity over a particular duration for a specified return period or probability of exceedance frequency idf curves are sometimes alternatively represented as depth duration frequency ddf curves where depth is simply the product of the intensity and the duration fig 1 shows examples of idf curves for boston massachusetts in the united states perica and pavlovic 2019 idf curves are developed via statistical frequency analysis as shown in fig 2 the analysis primarily consists of obtain observed precipitation data p obs process p obs into an annual maximum series ams or partial duration series pds p extreme for each duration of interest e g 24 hour storm an ams takes the maximum value of the timeseries in every water year thus it is a special form of block maxima where the block period is one year a pds also known as peaks over threshold sets a threshold and takes every independent event above that threshold fit an extreme value distribution evd to p extreme for each duration based on extreme value theory the generalized extreme value distribution gev is often used for ams and the generalized pareto distribution gp is often used for pds where the occurrence process follows the poisson distribution katz et al 2002 stedinger et al 1993 these distributions are not always the best choice e g alam et al 2018 fischer et al 2012 and there are a variety of other distributions that can be used instead such as the gamma and the log pearson type iii ouarda et al 2019 goodness of fit test statistics including information theory based statistics e g akaike or bayesian information criterion and statistical tests e g the anderson darling which emphasizes the tails of the distribution that describe the extremes farrel and stewart 2006 fischer et al 2012 can be used to select a distribution alternatively precipitation quantile estimates from all distributions that satisfy the goodness of fit criterion can be combined using the bayesian model averaging approach hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 use the quantiles of the evds to determine the intensity or depth associated with various frequencies or return periods e g 10 year for each duration correction factors may be applied to ensure that the intensity frequency curves for different durations do not cross which is physically implausible the resulting evds are assumed valid for the historical and future time periods idf curves can be site specific or regional a regional analysis consists of first identifying homogeneous regions and second fitting distributions to represent the at site and regional behavior homogeneous regions are typically identified via an iterative process

infrastructure e g dams levees and other structures e g bridges in the absence of sufficient streamflow data brown et al 2013 idf curves are statistical models of precipitation which depends on weather and in turn depends on the climate since the late twentieth century climate scientists have observed that climate is not stationary but is subject to anthropogenic forcing for example in 1995 the ipcc claimed that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate ipcc 1995 and recently the attribution of anthropogenic climate change has been unequivocally confirmed ipcc 2021 it is helpful to note that climate change and also global warming are sometimes used as short hand for anthropogenic climate change but climate change is more general the american meteorological society definition of climate change is any systematic change in the long term statistics of climate elements such as temperature pressure or winds sustained over several decades or longer ams 2012 the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc uses climate change in reference to the anthropogenically forced changes of atmospheric composition in addition to natural climate variability over comparable time periods unfccc 1992 while anthropogenically forced changes are often the focus there are many other potential drivers of change such as solar variability orbital effects volcanism and land use changes which are independent of atmospheric composition however the timescale of these drivers is a key consideration in assessing stationarity thus forcings such as orbital changes over thousands of years are too small to identify in contemporary time series in this review the focus is on anthropogenic climate change while also acknowledging the importance of natural climate variability even though the climate is known to be non stationary idf curves have traditionally been developed assuming stationarity here defined as the assumption of a time invariant distribution following salas et al 2018 this is because the lack of predictability about the details of any future changes has often made stationarity the only practical assumption for infrastructure design recently however this assumption has been questioned and there is concern about non stationarity here defined as a distribution that changes in time again following salas et al 2018 as in hydrology idf curve non stationarity is often limited to a second order non stationarity which is when only the first and or second statistical moments of the underlying stochastic process change e g cunderlik and burn 2003 one reason for such a limitation is that hydro meteorological records are often short and do not allow a robust estimate of change in higher statistical moments e g salas et al 2018 as applied to idf curves the difference between stationarity and non stationarity can be aptly illustrated by considering the 10 year rainfall estimate from a statistical perspective the 10 year rainfall estimate is defined as the rainfall estimate that has a 10 chance of being exceeded in a given year while this statement is correct under both stationarity and non stationarity stationarity implies that the magnitude of the estimate remains constant regardless of the year while non stationarity implies that the magnitude of the estimate will change depending on the year often the 10 year rainfall estimate is colloquially described as occurring on average once every 10 years a statement which is only correct under stationarity an erroneous assumption about non stationarity can result in inadequate infrastructure that is vulnerable to failure under design or can lead to costly overdesign see rosner et al 2014 and salas et al 2018 for a discussion in the context of flooding thus there is an on going debate both in the academic literature and among practitioners regarding if and how non stationarity should be addressed in design for hydroclimatic extremes the debate centers on two key elements 1 the degree of consensus regarding the consequences of anthropogenic climate change and 2 uncertainty model complexity and data limitations these two key elements as relevant to idf curves are extensively discussed in subsequent sections for key advances in the debate not necessarily specific to idf curves see in order of publication date milly et al 2008 lins and cohn 2011 matalas 2012 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 milly et al 2015 and serinaldi et al 2018 the proliferation of academic literature and practitioner reports on potential non stationarity in idf curves and related topics has been summarized in several review papers and books for hydroclimatic extremes generally khaliq et al 2006 review approaches for frequency analysis of non stationary hydro meteorological observations aghakouchak et al 2013 compile a collection of articles on state of the art methods for all aspects of the analysis of climate extremes and is intended to be a primary reference on the topic slater et al 2021 review and synthesize methods over multiple spatial and temporal scales for what they call the entire nonstationary management process across all types of extremes rather than just one type such as precipitation for idf curves specifically willems et al 2012 review methodologies for assessing climate change impacts on urban rainfall extremes focusing on the use of general circulation model gcm projections of precipitation their findings are summarized in arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 yan et al 2021 review literature on updating idf curves under climate change focusing on covariate based distributions for non stationarity with some discussion of gcm projections of precipitation they also provide a summary of studies on rainfall trends martel et al 2021 summarize the science underlying changes in extreme precipitation and sources of uncertainty they also discuss current guidelines for adaptation and propose improvements for flood events specifically included here because of the frequent link between precipitation and flooding serinaldi and kilsby 2015 review and test the most prominent non stationary models to identify advantages and disadvantages salas et al 2018 review the recent literature on non stationary approaches and metrics for infrastructure investment françois et al 2019 review available design methods and guidelines under non stationarity wasko et al 2021 in addition to a brief review of methods compile governmental guidance that incorporates climate change this review builds on the previous reviews and current literature to synthesize the current knowledge and on going research regarding idf curves under non stationarity importantly this review covers the topic of regionalization which has not been addressed in previous reviews regionalization is a critical topic for two reasons first it is used in several government developed idf curves around the world svensson and jones 2010 second it is difficult to detect changes in extremes under climate change at point locations or very localized scales but the signal to noise ratio improves to detectable levels for regional scales wright et al 2019 other ways that this review is unique include providing the most comprehensive review to date of idf curve estimation following the covariate based approach in which the evd parameters depend on time varying covariates and briefly addressing the issue of snow dominated regions which at the intersection of multiple disciplines is overlooked in previous reviews we also note that this review supposes that the reader is familiar with commonly accepted methods for idf curve estimation under stationarity ample citations to previous literature are provided should more detail about particular methods be desired the motivation for this review grew out of the years long work of several research groups across the united states to address the issue of non stationarity in precipitation both rainfall and snow and floods broadly the groups work focused on the application of non stationarity in infrastructure design given that funding came from the strategic environmental research and development program within the united states department of defense we note that the views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding source since the author team is located within the united states and the research work motivating this review was focused on the united states we have included a section specifically addressing the united states context however the review overall is informed by studies around the globe 2 observed and projected changes in extreme precipitation observations show that by 2020 the global surface temperature land and ocean warmed by more than 1 c since the start of the 20th century and surface air temperatures continue to warm the ten highest temperatures all occurred since 2009 noaa ncei 2020 the global increase of temperature has led to other changes in the climate system in particular global observations of near surface atmospheric water vapor show that it has increased along with the observed warming seneviratne et al 2012 since the mid 20th century statistically significant increases in the percentage area frequency or intensity of extreme precipitation events have been found at global hemispheric continental including the united states and sub continental scales dittus et al 2015 huang et al 2017 kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 kunkel et al 2020a b olafsdottir et al 2021 papalexiou and montanari 2019 westra et al 2014 yan et al 2021 ye et al 2017 even though some regions show no change or even decreases hoerling et al 2016 see also yan et al 2021 for a table summarizing the results of multiple studies assessing trends in extreme precipitation additionally increases in precipitation extremes have been linked to increases in water vapor huang et al 2021 kunkel et al 2020a b concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves two points are of note in regards to observed changes in extreme precipitation first for regions with localized and inconsistent at site historical trends in extreme precipitation those trends may only minimally impact idf curve estimates obtained via large scale regionalization which could be a justification for assuming stationarity as in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 see bonnin et al 2011a b the counterpoint is that a lack of at site historical trends can be attributed to low signal to noise ratios that are typical in extreme event detection in contrast regional aggregation boosts the signal to noise ratio wright et al 2019 which could be a justification for assuming non stationarity second even when statistically significant trends in extreme precipitation are detected in the historical record some studies using the covariate based approach described in section 3 2 have found minimal impact on non stationary idf estimates or have found that the stationary model is statistically preferred however most studies using the covariate based approach have found that an assumption of non stationarity is justified based on statistical goodness of fit tests see table 1 climate model projections based on different scenarios of continued increases in greenhouse gases all show warming by the end of the 21st century projected globally averaged surface temperature warming ranges by scenario i e shared socioeconomic pathways ssp are estimated as 1 0 c to 1 8 c ssp1 1 9 1 3 c to 2 4 c ssp1 2 6 2 1 c to 3 5 c ssp2 4 5 2 8 c to 4 6 c ssp3 7 0 and 3 3 c to 5 7 c ssp5 8 5 ipcc 2021 a warming climate is expected to further increase the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events bador et al 2018 because warming causes an increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere via the clausius clapeyron relation which increases the moisture supply to storms thus producing more intense precipitation trenberth 2011 this expectation is reflected in model projections groisman et al 2012 kharin et al 2013 lehmann et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2018 pfahl et al 2017 sillmann et al 2013 xu et al 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc states it is very likely that heavy precipitation events will intensify and become more frequent in most regions with additional global warming at the global scale extreme daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 7 for each 1 c of global warming high confidence ipcc 2021 this 7 is a broad generalization and the exact value depends on the region the duration of the precipitation the precipitation rate and the temperature change martel et al 2021 yin et al 2018 it is well established that the change in future extreme precipitation is projected to be larger than the change in mean precipitation berg et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 swain et al 2018 westra et al 2014 for the annual global mean precipitation the ipcc 2021 projects that the change will very likely be only a 1 3 increase per1 c increase in the global mean temperature but there are likely to be decreases over the subtropics including the mediterranean southern africa and south west australia fig 3 shows projections from phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison projects cmip6 eyring et al 2016 models listed in table 2 which projects increases of annual maximum daily 2 m specific humidity everywhere and 30 year maximum daily precipitation almost everywhere globally under a high emissions scenario there are small areas of decreases in extreme precipitation in subtropical oceans the uncertainty in these projections as represented by the percentage of models agreeing on the sign of the change is higher for extreme precipitation than for specific humidity presumably due to the lower spatial coherence of extreme precipitation events compared to high humidity periods the highest agreement for extreme precipitation changes indicated by the absence of hatching in fig 3b is found along the pacific ocean intertropical convergence zone in the african sub saharan region eastern asia and at high latitude while model agreement is less than 80 for many mid latitude regions including parts of the contiguous united states and europe the spatial coherence of multi model mean increases in those areas supports a consistent climate system response to warming concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves one consideration is that it is challenging for climate models to simulate the observed local intensity and frequency of precipitation jones and randall 2011 o gorman 2015 in part due to coarse resolutions that require parameterizations of key mechanisms for extreme precipitation such as buoyancy driven convection while some modelling efforts are beginning to attain the level of complexity required to explicitly simulate deep convection prein et al 2017 and higher resolution models have lower precipitation bias cook et al 2020 schiemann et al 2018 there are still many precipitation related processes that occur where the chemistry and physics are on a spatial and temporal scale that is too small to explicitly model and thus have to be parameterized rummukainen 2015 additionally there are significant sematic differences between the climate and civil engineering communities regarding extreme events for the climate community extreme may be the upper 1 or 0 1 of daily precipitation events while for civil engineers extreme may be the 50 or 100 year event based on annual maxima consequently statements regarding future changes in precipitation from climate assessments e g those from the ipcc should not be used to justify non stationary idf curves bonnin et al 2011a b second also concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves it should be noted that the temporal scale of analysis is important at short future time horizons a decade or two natural climate variability often dominates as a driver of precipitation variability rather than longer term anthropogenically forced climate change easterling and wehner 2009 evin et al 2019 hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 yip et al 2011 cmip5 simulations show that a signal of anthropogenic forcing emerges in the 10 to 30 year timeframe stegall and kunkel 2019 also of note this anthropogenic forcing signal emerges earlier at the regional scale and may not be detected at the local scale until the end of the century martel et al 2018 3 idf curve estimation under non stationarity for previous reviews on incorporating non stationarity into idf curve estimation see willems et al 2012 yan et al 2021 and martel et al 2021 there are two primary approaches for incorporating non stationarity into idf curve estimation simulated precipitation in which the evd is fitted to simulated precipitation values or covariate based in which the evd parameters depend on time varying covariates both approaches are summarized in fig 2 and are discussed in depth in sections 3 1 and 3 2 fig 2 aims to capture the key elements of each approach regionalization techniques are discussed separately in section 4 since traditional stationary idf curves are the default approach possible rationale for choosing a non stationary approach are given caveats and reasons against choosing a non stationary approach are provided in the text there are of course many variations which are not all captured in fig 2 and there is a tension between how the approaches are implemented in various studies and what might be considered an ideal approach these issues are discussed in the sections below in regards to the naming of these approaches the review by yan et al 2021 use the names climate model based nonstationary idf curves and covariate based nonstationary idf curves since both approaches can use outputs from climate models we chose instead the name simulated precipitation for the former approach a third less common option is the scaling approach which applies a percentage increase to existing idf curves based on projected warming via relations such as the clausius clapeyron for a summary see martel et al 2021 for a discussion of various scaling relations see zhang et al 2017 and roderick et al 2020 for caveats associated with using simple scaling relationships see yin et al 2018 martel et al 2021 and schardong et al 2018 while martel et al 2021 document the use of the scaling approach in australia and canada it has in general been minimally applied as such and since martel et al 2021 provide a thorough overview we do not discuss it further several studies have begun to integrate methodologies between the simulated precipitation and covariate based approaches these studies obtain bias corrected and downscaled gcm precipitation simulations and then fit a distribution with time varying parameters to the simulations the second step may be quite simple a gev distribution with time as the covariate as in ganguli and coulibaly 2019 ragno et al 2018 thasneem and santosh 2021 um et al 2017 or more complex a four parameter beta distribution with a changing upper bound parameter conditioned on the rainfall timeseries as in lima et al 2016 other studies have modified or developed statistical downscaling methodologies to incorporate non stationarity for example agilan and umamahesh 2019 for weather generator silva et al 2021a 2021b for quantile matching and papalexiou et al 2018 for temporal disaggregation studies which compare multiple approaches are few and limited in spatial scope agilan and umamahesh 2016 analyzing a site in india recommend the covariate based approach because they found it was more conservative but their recommendation is case study specific e g at another location the simulated precipitation approach might be more conservative ren et al 2019 analyzing a catchment in the united states found that spatial heterogeneity causes as much variability in idf curve values as using different non stationary idf approaches and so they recommend using an ensemble of approaches 3 1 simulated precipitation approach the simulated precipitation approach fig 2 broadly consists of obtain simulated precipitation values p sim over historical and future time periods typically from an ensemble of gcms the simulated values usually require downscaling and bias correction the ensemble may be subset based on model skill process p sim into p extreme for each duration of interest and for each ensemble member fit an evd to p extreme for each duration and for each quasi stationary time period and for each ensemble member quasi stationary time periods are created by dividing the full analysis period into sub periods e g a historical and future period or consecutive periods several decades long that are assumed stationary even though the underlying premise is non stationarity use the quantiles of the evds to determine the intensity associated with various frequencies for each duration and for each quasi stationary time period and for each ensemble member create future projections either by using the fitted evds associated with the future time period or by using the ratio of the future to historical quantiles to adjust the traditional idf curve summarize the ensemble using a statistic such as the mean the simulated precipitation approach has been implemented in the united states in new york degaetano and castellano 2017 virginia miro et al 2021 and the pacific northwest mauger et al 2021 and has been recommended by the massachusetts executive office of energy and environmental affairs ma eea 2021 concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves it is notable that the simulated precipitation approach implicitly assumes non stationarity even though quasi stationary time periods may be used for fitting the distributions because anthropogenic climate change scenarios are used to force the gcms since willems et al 2012 summarized in arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 provide such a comprehensive review of the simulated precipitation approach here only a brief discussion of notable recent advances is given recent case study applications in the literature are too numerous to list the notable recent advances all apply to methods for bias correction and downscaling which can be achieved either statistically or dynamically within the category of statistical methods some recent studies have developed new quantile matching methods butcher et al 2021 simonovic et al 2017 srivastav et al 2014 within the category of dynamical methods which typically rely on regional climate models rcms recent advances have led to high resolution convection permitting models which provide better simulations of sub daily rainfall extremes but have high computational cost and their own uncertainties for a discussion of these models see westra et al 2014 and zhang et al 2017 comparisons of various methods for bias correction and downscaling are many see for example cannon et al 2015 manola et al 2018 and hassanzadeh et al 2019 to date there is no clearly superior method for bias correction and spatial downscaling and performance depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to spatial resolution geography and climatology of the region of interest and how calibration is performed cook et al 2020 gutiérrez et al 2019 lanzante et al 2018 3 2 covariate based approach the covariate based approach fig 2 broadly consists of obtain p obs process p obs into p extreme for each duration of interest determine suitable covariates based on causative mechanisms for p extreme fit an evd with parameters dependent on the covariates to p extreme for each duration use the quantiles of the evds to determine the intensity associated with various frequencies for each duration accounting for non stationarity create future projections by forcing the evds with projections of the covariates clearly identifying the presence of non stationarity and the underlying causes i e the attribution which allows identification of covariates is essential to the covariate based approach slater et al 2021 provide a comprehensive overview of the topic of attribution for hydroclimatic extremes in general noting that typically the first step is exploratory data analysis followed by empirical or simulation based analysis more details are provided below for the case of precipitation extremes studies using the covariate based approach for developing idf curves are detailed in table 1 this table was developed by a performing a google scholar search with the keywords idf non stationary climate change and limiting results to 2010 and onward b reviewing references cited by yan et al 2021 which is a review of the topic and c reviewing references that cite cannon 2010 and cheng and aghakouchack 2014 which are some of the early and formative studies on the topic to be included in this table studies needed to be written in english we did not have the capability to thoroughly review literature in other languages although we are sure relevant studies exist either peer reviewed journal articles or government related reports and not solely focused on identifying trends in observed data as can be seen from table 1 most of the studies are limited to the historical period many studies begin by using null hypothesis tests non parametric such as the mann kendall trend test or parametric such as the slope of a regression line to identify whether non stationarity is detected in the observed time series studies generally use the gev for ams and the gp for pds but vary widely regarding which subsets of parameters are modeled as non stationary for those studies using pds only two mondal and mujumdar 2015 wi et al 2015 allow the poisson distribution which models the occurrence rate to be non stationary in regards to distribution choice an interesting new development is the use of the metastatistical extreme value distribution which makes use of non asymptotic data i e ordinary not just extreme events marra et al 2019 vidrio sahagún and he 2022c only some studies analyze multiple durations and of those only ouarda et al 2019 employ a unified model that accounts for all durations simultaneously in contrast most studies choose separate models for each duration even at one location thus the issue of consistency across durations in particular that of intensity frequency curves crossing for different durations has not been addressed as seen in table 1 for covariates studies either use time or meteorological indices often large scale climate patterns but also sometimes regional or local data examples of large scale climate patterns are north atlantic oscillation nao in north america whan and zwiers 2017 and europe tabari and willems 2018 and the madden julian oscillation mjo in asia australia liang et al 2022 schreck 2021 among many others time as a covariate does not represent a mechanistic process i e a land surface atmospheric or oceanic phenomenon that is a driver of extreme precipitation importantly the first covariate based study applied to precipitation uses a climate covariate el adlouni et al 2007 and very recent studies follow this precedent while no studies have done so as of yet there is no reason that land surface changes could not be included as a covariate provided a strong relationship to extreme precipitation can be established covariates can be identified based on meteorological arguments i e understanding the drivers of p extreme for the region of interest and via statistical analysis e g correlation between p extreme and a potential covariate often covariates are then further vetted based on the performance of the non stationary distribution using those covariates agilan and umamahesh 2017 the parameter linking formulation i e mathematical form by which the parameters are dependent on the covariates is usually regression based and varies from a simple linear dependence to complex relationships for a long but non exhaustive list of possibilities see um et al 2017 when the mathematical form linking a known mechanistic process to precipitation e g a linear regression is hard to identify a non parametric approach such as conditional density networks cannon 2010 can be used the caveat is that non parametric approaches are highly sensitive to the sample data used for fitting and thus may not be appropriate for the purpose of out of sample projection in the studies in table 1 distributions are usually fit via maximum likelihood estimation or its generalized form sometimes in a bayesian context calculation of non stationary return periods is discussed in section 5 since most studies are limited to the historical period the challenge of developing future projections is generally not addressed the exception is demaria et al 2017 but since this study uses time as the covariate projections are simple to create relative to the case of a climate based covariate often studies conclude by justifying a stationary or non stationary model based on a goodness of fit metric using likelihood information there are caveats associated with using goodness of fit metrics to choose a model these issues are discussed and procedure to address them via decomposition of the nonstationary stochastic processes in vidrio sahagún and he 2022b it is worth noting that even though the covariate based approach aims to be non stationary whether or not the statistical model is actually non stationary depends on the statistical significance of the coefficients on the covariates graphical representation of covariate based idf curves is challenging due to the dependence on time whether via covariates or directly idf curves are already three dimensional and non stationarity adds a fourth dimension or more if there are multiple covariates that merit being displayed separately the challenge of graphical representation is discussed in ouarda et al 2019 the variety of different graphical representations employed by the studies in table 1 can be divided into two main categories various implementations of these categories are shown in fig 4 also of importance is how to graphically display the uncertainty one approach which mirrors a more standard idf curve representation is to represent the uncertainty as an interval or range around the idf curve as in cheng and aghakouchack 2014 the first category fig 4a appears to be a standard idf curve with intensity or depth on the y axis duration on the x axis and different return periods represented as separate lines alternatively duration can be on the x axis and different return periods represented by separate lines to generate this type of figure one set of distribution parameters must be chosen for example the chosen parameter set could correspond to a percentile of the parameters as in fig 1 of cheng and aghakouchack 2014 where the 95th percentile is used or could be the parameter set associated with the final year of analysis as in fig 10 of wi et al 2015 regardless of how the one parameter set is chosen in this first category the non stationary aspect is made implicit and the fact that the return periods are changing with time is masked in contrast the second category makes the non stationary aspect explicit by showing intensity on the y axis and either time or another covariate on the x axis fig 4c and 4d different return periods are represented as separate lines for a given duration as in fig 8 of vasiliades et al 2015 alternatively different durations could be shown for one return period if there is more than one covariate then a contour plot or three dimensional plot can be used as in fig 5 of cannon 2010 or figs 3 and 5 of ouarda et al 2019 fig 4e or time can be on the x axis since any covariate is time dependent by design fig 4d an alternative approach is to show the intensity as a probability density function for a given duration and return period as in fig 5 of lee et al 2020 fig 4b concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves some frameworks for the covariate based approach recommend only applying non stationary models when non stationarity is detected in the historical record cheng and aghakouchack 2014 the problem is that null hypothesis tests which are commonly used for detecting non stationarity are subjective i e dependent on the predetermined p value or type of test cheng and aghakouchack 2014 and are not suitable for this purpose as shown by serinaldi et al 2018 the alternative is to fit both stationary and non stationary models and allow a goodness of fit metric to choose e g lee et al 2020 seo et al 2021 vu and mishra 2019 the problem is that the additional parameters of a non stationary model compared to a stationary model can cause overfitting there are also the issues of equifinality i e two parameter sets showing similar performance for the training sample can provide significantly different prediction when used out of sample additionally different metrics may prefer different models to address these problems vidrio sahagún and he 2022a propose a procedure to decompose the mean and the variance of extreme precipitation into a stationary stochastic process and a deterministic trend then model them using a combination of stationary distributions and parsimonious models in regards to representing non stationarity in the probability distribution serinaldi and kilsby 2015 argue that in the absence of covariates and parameter linking formulations that represent mechanistic processes the more parsimonious stationary model should be assumed the reason for this is that statistical inference from observed temporal data is theoretically justifiable if the modeled process is ergodic an assumption that does not hold under non stationarity see koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 for a detailed explanation of ergodicity 3 3 snow dominated regions we define snow dominated regions as locations where snowmelt and rain on snow events are the dominant flood generating mechanisms wigmosta 2020 certainly then adequate treatment of snow dominant regions requires the consideration of runoff processes which are not addressed in this review however we thought it necessary to at least briefly address such regions here given that a a sizeable portion of northern hemisphere regions of the world fall into this category barnett et al 2005 b climate change has the potential to modify the dynamics of regions that are currently snow dominated potentially even transitioning them to rainfall dominated usgcrp 2018 zion klos et al 2014 and c previous idf curve and flood review articles have overlooked this topic given the brevity of research on the topic we hope this brief overview will motivate future work and analysis regardless of non stationarity there are multiple approaches to design in snow dominated regions which range from the blind approach of simply using conventional idf curves e g scdm 2016 to the tuning factor approach of adding a snowmelt factor to the conventional idf curves e g smmew 2004 to sophisticated physics based hydrologic modeling for large high cost and high risk infrastructure design e g ufc 2013 of note each approach has limitations both the blind and tuning factor approaches assume that precipitation is in the form of rainfall that is immediately subject to rainfall runoff processes this assumption would lead to over design if the precipitation is primarily snowfall and could lead to under design for a snowmelt or rain on snow event physics based modeling can be more accurate than the blind or tuning factor approaches but it is more analytically and computationally expensive recently a few studies have developed approaches that are more sophisticated than the blind or tuning factor approaches but less complex than a full physics based model specifically cho and jacobs 2020 apply traditional idf curve analysis to snow water equivalent and yan et al 2018 propose what they term next generation idf curves which are based on available water for runoff at the ground surface rather than precipitation for further discussion implementation and validation of next generation idf curves see hamlet 2018 yan et al 2019a b and yan et al 2020a b to the authors knowledge there are only two examples of non stationary idf curves for snow dominated regions both follow primarily the simulated precipitation approach but make use of a snowmelt or hydrologic model yan et al 2016 used dynamically downscaled and bias corrected gcm projections to obtain precipitation and to force a snowmelt model a non stationary statistical model with time as the covariate was then applied to the combined projections of precipitation and snowmelt to develop idf curves hou et al 2019 used dynamically downscaled gcm projections to force a hydrologic model the outputs of the hydrologic model were used to calculate available water for runoff i e the input for next generation idf curves and then stationary statistics were applied to develop idf curves 4 regionalization regionalization relies on the assumption that within a defined homogeneous region the underlying distribution of rainfall at all sites within the region is the same except for a scaling factor thereby enabling data to be pooled across different sites and inform a single frequency analysis regionalization is particularly useful for the frequency analysis of extreme events which are rare by definition because it improves quantile estimates at ungauged locations or sites with short record lengths fowler and kilsby 2003 hosking and wallis 1997 seidou et al 2006 regional frequency analysis consists of two primary steps first identifying homogeneous regions and second fitting distributions to represent the at site and regional behavior delineating homogeneous regions is difficult and often criticized for being based on subjective decision making and for lacking physical justification nguyen et al 2002 low levels of heterogeneity in a region can affect the frequency analysis halbert et al 2017 regardless of these issues regional frequency analysis has a long history and broad applications partially due to is ease of implementation renard 2011 studies on the topic of regionalization specific to precipitation extremes in the context of non stationarity are detailed in table 3 to be included in this table the study had to focus on precipitation extremes not streamflow and include an analysis of precipitation quantiles i e could not just be a clustering study additional studies on the topic in the context of non stationarity are available in the streamflow and flood literature basu and srinivas 2013 cunderlik and burn 2003 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 leclerc and ouarda 2007 markiewicz et al 2006 o brien and burn 2014 schlef et al 2018 studies comparing various non stationary regional approaches are limited to the index flood method specifically nam et al 2015 kim et al 2020 and for streamflow kalai et al 2020 kalai et al 2020 provide the most extensive comparison using flood data and found that of the six approaches tested on both synthetic and real data two performed best one allowed non stationarity in the growth curve the other applies a transformation to obtain stationary values as can be seen from table 3 most studies either assume a region a priori or identify and justify regions based on historical information the exception is hanel et al 2009 in which homogeneous regions are determined from both historical and future information an alternative is to divide the full time period into sub periods and identify regions separately for each sub period guntu et al 2020 mannan et al 2018 samantaray et al 2021 analogous to the quasi stationary time periods sometimes used with the simulated precipitation approach this alternative has been employed by clustering studies but not yet applied to idf curve estimation and hence is not included in table 3 there are regional versions discussed below of the simulated precipitation approach and the covariate based approach however sometimes the approaches are combined analogous to the tendency toward combination in recent at site studies one example is hanel et al 2009 who employ a covariate based approach with the index flood method where the model is fitted to precipitation values from an rcm over the historical and future periods other examples are lehmann et al 2016 and lima et al 2018 as can be seen from table 3 for regional simulated precipitation approach the simplest option is to apply conventional stationary regionalization techniques without modification to downscaled and bias corrected gcm precipitation projections e g forsee and ahmad 2011 lu et al 2015 mailhot et al 2007 in a more complex option lima et al 2018 propose a bayesian based model that addresses the high level of uncertainty associated with gcm representation of spatial variability for regional covariate based approach the methods are based on either modifying the index flood method or developing bayesian hierarchical models one study proposes an unusual method based on a max stable process model westra and sisson 2011 for the index flood method non stationarity is applied in either or both the growth curve the term for the regional distribution and the index flood the term for the scaling factor which translates the regional quantiles to site specific locations a non stationary index flood method was first demonstrated by cunderlik and burn 2003 for streamgage data and has since also been applied to precipitation data one study takes the unusual approach of detrending the data applying the conventional stationary index flood method then re introducing the trend sung et al 2018 for the bayesian hierarchical models a variety of forms are employed for the at site data layer which consists of an extreme value distribution applied to each location and the regional process layer which captures spatial dependence between locations via a distribution for the parameters of the extreme value distribution used in the at site layer 5 design values and uncertainty since non stationarity implies that the distribution parameters change over time it is challenging to calculate a traditional return period i e the inverse of the exceedance probability for use in design studies following the simulated precipitation approach often create quasi stationary time periods and calculate distinct return periods subsequently the ratio of the future to historical values is often used as a climate factor to adjust the historical idf curves see willems et al 2012 for more details quasi stationary time periods are created by dividing the full analysis period into sub periods e g a historical and future period or consecutive periods several decades long that are assumed stationary even though the underlying premise is non stationarity studies following the covariate based approach see table 1 may calculate a different return period in every year e g sugahara et al 2009 and many of the other studies in table 1 or calculate the return period based on a certain e g 95th percentile of the distribution parameters e g cheng and aghakouchack 2014 or based on a certain e g the most recent year of the analysis e g wi et al 2015 only one study uses a risk of failure metric demaria et al 2017 theoretically quasi stationary time periods could also be used with the covariate based approach for example the 100 year flood could be calculated in every year of the analysis and then averaged within each 30 year time period but this approach has not yet been applied see table 1 the return period can be mathematically reformulated for non stationarity by recognizing that an equivalent definition of the return period is the expected waiting time to an extreme event olsen et al 1998 or similarly the expected number of events parey et al 2007 using this equivalent definition a non stationary return period can be calculated with the binomial distribution olsen et al 1998 or the geometric distribution salas and obeysekera 2014 for extensions from one to multiple extreme events see obeysekera and salas 2016 and salas and obeysekera 2019 of note the expected waiting time requires extrapolation of the non stationary distribution beyond the design life of a project adding uncertainty to the return period and the risk estimates rootzén and katz 2013 salas et al 2018 even with reformulations for non stationarity the concept of return period is limited because it does not incorporate information about the infrastructure lifespan read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2018 serinaldi 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 an alternative is to base design values on both exceedance probability and infrastructure lifespan and studies have proposed various methods with a variety of names mailhot and duchesne 2010 no particular name is provided rootzén and katz 2013 design life level and relatedly minimax design life level salas and obeysekera 2014 risk of failure and reliability here risk is more akin probability and does not imply damages read and vogel 2015 reliability and read and vogel 2016 time of failure from hazard function analysis these concepts as well as reformulated return periods are described in depth in the review by salas et al 2018 notably salas et al 2018 found that the reliability and risk of failure estimations are similar even though the methods are different importantly these concepts require that a mathematical form for non stationarity e g a linear regression on a covariate be known limiting their applicability to the covariate based approach also of note even though including infrastructure lifespan more closely aligns with societal interests read and vogel 2015 serinaldi 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 many studies continue to employ simplistic adaptions of the traditional concept of return period see table 1 this is also noted by previous studies read and vogel 2015 and salas and obeysekera 2014 in conventional idf curves apart from considerations of non stationarity the primary sources of uncertainty are observational error and heterogenous spatial distribution of gages willems et al 2012 natural climate variability via short observational records bhatia and ganguly 2019 fadhel et al 2017 and the methodology for computing idf curves agilan et al 2021 lopez cantu and samaras 2018 underwood et al 2020 non stationarity adds additional sources of uncertainty in the sense that additional assumptions models and parameters are needed for the simulated precipitation approach these additional sources are greenhouse gas emissions scenarios climate model structure and parameters natural climate variability via initialization for climate models and methodology for bias correction and post processing for more details see reviews provided in martel et al 2021 and willems et al 2012 there are many case studies on this topic for a sampling see cook et al 2020 hassanzadeh et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 rupa et al 2015 switzman et al 2017 yang et al 2018 for the covariate based approach the additional sources of uncertainty stem from choice of covariate and additional parameters agilan and umamahesh 2018 ouarda et al 2020 notably the covariate based approach also has the sources of uncertainty associated with the simulated precipitation approach when projections of covariates are obtained from climate models the contribution of each source of uncertainty to the total uncertainty can be assessed via sensitivity analysis a common and relatively simple approach is analysis of variance anova hawkins and sutton 2009 however this assessment has only been applied to the simulated precipitation approach there have been recent methodological developments which allow missing information e g not all regional circulation models were forced by all gcms which has in the past been an obstacle in using anova specifically evin et al 2019 introduced the qualypso method an approach that merges the quasi ergodic anova method developed by hingray and said 2014 with bayesian data augmentation techniques an example of application for hydrological extremes is given in lemaitre basset et al 2021 the statistical approach to quantifying uncertainty regardless of non stationarity is to generate confidence intervals or in the bayesian case credible intervals methods for generating these intervals are well established obeysekera and salas 2014 while the profile likelihood method provides the most accurate estimate for the confidence intervals its use is limited because it is burdensome computationally and numerically unstable when only short records are available however an enhanced likelihood profile method that significantly reduces these burdens has recently been proposed vidrio sahagún and he 2022a for projections under non stationarity uncertainty is quantified via ensembles of greenhouse scenarios of initial states of gcms rcms of downscaling methods etc arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 willems et al 2012 ensembles can be improved by weighting or sub setting gcm rcm members based on performance agilan and umamahesh 2016 rupa et al 2015 for a review see raju and kumar 2020 although such efforts are complicated by interdependencies among gcms among other challenges knutti et al 2010 2013 for the covariate based approach metrics of uncertainty can also be used to decide between different candidate models lee et al 2020 seo et al 2021 regardless of non stationarity uncertainty may be incorporated into design via predetermined safety factors however there is no guidance for how to use the information contained in confidence or credible intervals leading users to often default to the median value in the context of non stationarity simple approaches to addressing uncertainty include a extending the safety factor idea to develop climate factors ragno et al 2018 willems et al 2012 which are recommended in design by hong kong and the united kingdom lopez cantu and samaras 2018 b reducing ensemble information to the value of the median or another quantile for example new york city uses the 90th percentile of the projected precipitation nyc 2020 although a caveat is that higher percentiles are more sensitive to sources of uncertainty such as model structure and parameters cook et al 2020 or c choosing the next highest return period cook et al 2020 more complex approaches to addressing uncertainty are robustness based decision methods which seek to identify a design that performs satisfactorily i e meets a threshold of performance similar to the performance based design used by earthquake engineering as described in simonovic 2020 over a wide range of plausible futures robustness based decision methods were explicitly developed to address the deep i e difficult to define and accurately quantify uncertainty associated with climate change kandlikar et al 2005 lempert 2002 robustness based decision methods include robust decision making lempert et al 2003 and its multi objective form kasprzyk et al 2013 info gap analysis ben haim 2006 and scenario neutral prudhomme et al 2010 or decision scaling brown et al 2011 2012 for a review of these methods see ray and brown 2015 although applications for idf curves are limited casal campos et al 2018 kirshen et al 2015 semadeni davies 2004 robustness based decision methods have been applied in multiple hydrologic studies see françois et al 2019 for a description of some a related concept is flexible or adaptive design in which the possibility of updating or adapting based on subsequent information is incorporated into the original design haasnoot et al 2013 hino and hall 2017 hui et al 2018 flexible or adaptive design has yet to be implemented for idf curves precedent for adoption of these methods has been set in the broader hydrologic community by the world bank ray and brown 2015 and the international hydropower association iha 2019 concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves three points are of note first in regards to the relative magnitude of various sources of uncertainty studies have shown that updates to idf curves with changes in methodology or longer observational records can result in uncertainty that is larger than that from gcm projections ganguli and coulibaly 2017 underwood et al 2020 second multiple studies have argued based on theoretical reasons and the results of case study applications that in some cases stationarity is preferred because non stationary models lead to uninformative increases in uncertainty due to added parameters model structures that are not determined deductively and additional covariates which are themselves uncertain and are likely not parsimonious lee et al 2020 mondal and daniel 2019 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 vogel and kroll 2020 additionally serinaldi and kilsby 2015 demonstrate how the estimation of additional model parameters can lead to an overwhelming uncertainty when extrapolating beyond the training sample with the caveat that non stationary models using only the time covariate were discussed which is tied to the issue of equifinality third the issue of incorporating uncertainty into design is not simply a statistical or engineering question but is closely tied to stakeholder engagement one study found that stakeholders preferred simplified results that minimized uncertainty information for idf curves under climate change sandink et al 2016 6 united states context in the united states idf curves were first developed at a national scale in 1935 by the department of agriculture many iterations later see lopez cantu and samaras 2018 for details idf curves are now provided in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 for all but the northwestern states wa or id mt and wy which are provided in the older noaa atlas 2 nws 2021 the atlases provide rainfall estimates for select durations between five minutes to 60 days and for select return periods between one to 1000 years atlas 14 is based on regional frequency analysis following the state of the practice hosking and wallis approach commonly called the index flood method bonnin et al 2011a b hosking and wallis 1997 2005 atlas 2 is based on annual maximum series from each location converted to partial duration statistics then fitted to the fisher tippett type 1 distribution using the method of moments miller et al 1973 some have noted that current united states infrastructure is being designed using idf curves that are outdated by as much as half a century rendering that infrastructure already inadequate fagnant et al 2020 wright et al 2019 currently there is impetus and on going work to update the atlas defazio 2021 hdsc 2022 concerning the debate over whether non stationarity should be incorporated into idf curves atlas 14 was developed assuming stationarity which was considered justified after an analysis found only localized instances of historical trend that would have minimally impacted the results bonnin et al 2011a b however noaa s hydrometeorological design studies center hdsc has conducted pilot projects to determine a suitable method for incorporating non stationary frequency analysis and climate projections into a future version of the atlas hdsc 2022 and are planning updates graziano 2022 somewhat relatedly it is noteworthy that seasonal predictions of precipitation from noaa include trending data based on the persistence of observed average anomalies for a given season during the last 15 years nws cpc 2021 6 1 observed and projected changes in extreme precipitation in the united states the observed signal of change in extreme precipitation depends on the spatial scale of the analysis while the general trend at the continental scale is an increase in extreme precipitation events at the regional scale there are sizeable variations in the magnitude and direction of change easterling et al 2017 kunkel et al 2020a b additionally when analyzing small regions or individual stations it is difficult to detect changes in extreme precipitation events because the small spatial scales leads to data with low signal to noise ratios wright et al 2019 increases in the northeast are non linear in time and appear to be characterized by step changes huang et al 2017 increases in the northern great plains are statistically significant when aggregated kunkel et al 2020a b while most individual stations are not statistically significant flanagan and mahmood 2021 the two most prominent changes observed in snow dominated regions across the united states are significant reductions in the fraction of winter precipitation falling as snow and a shift in the timing of snowmelt runoff to earlier in the year usgcrp 2018 see clow 2010 ford et al 2021 and wagner et al 2021 for studies specific to the rocky mountains the non alpine eastern united states and the pacific northwest respectively in the western united states the occurrence of rain on snow events has declined at low elevation sites but increased at high elevation sites mccabe et al 2007 in the northwestern united states an overall statistically significant increase in rain on snow events has been observed in mountainous regions yan et al 2019a water vapor is the most important modulator of extreme precipitation magnitude in the contiguous united states kunkel et al 2020a b changes in snow are clearly linked to warming from anthropogenic climate change and are influenced by interactions with regional humidity and solar radiation usgcrp 2018 yan et al 2019b additionally land cover characteristics impact snow accumulation and ablation in mountain forest environments broxton et al 2015 varhola et al 2010 in the contiguous united states models project increases of about 20 40 in extreme specific humidity fig 3a and 0 40 in extreme precipitation depending on the location fig 3b other studies also find an overall increasing trend in projected extreme precipitation janssen et al 2014 zobel et al 2018 the fourth united states national climate assessment showed that the number of extreme precipitation events exceeding a 5 year return period are projected to increase by two to three times the historical average by the end of the 21st century under the high rcp8 5 emissions scenario easterling et al 2017 in regards to snow projections show large declines in snowpack due to reduced snowfall and earlier onset of spring melt in the western united states and shifts to more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow in many parts of the central and eastern united states usgcrp 2018 as an example of how significant this change can be projections under high emissions scenarios show that mountain areas in california with winters currently dominated by snow would begin to receive more precipitation as rain and then only rain by 2050 usgcrp 2018 6 2 design values and uncertainty regardless of non stationarity design standards can vary significantly across regions of the united states because guidelines are not released at the same time leading to variations in record lengths and methodologies across guidelines lopez cantu and samaras 2018 underwood et al 2020 additionally after more than 100 years of its use the return period concept has significant limitations which are acknowledged by both academic and government entities usgs 2021 volpi et al 2015 in regards to quantifying uncertainty noaa atlas 14 was the first of the united states idf curve iterations to provide confidence interval information and did so for parameter uncertainty via monte carlo simulations lopez cantu and samaras 2018 perica et al 2013 while revision to united states design standards and noaa atlas 14 are massive undertakings that require leadership from the federal government wright et al 2021 revision may be possible while still preserving the considerable investment in collection quality control and regionalization of observed precipitation data that noaa atlas 14 represents for example butcher et al 2021 explicitly develops a simulated precipitation approach that fits within the broader noaa atlas 14 framework 7 future research needs based on our review of the literature here we compile a list of future research needs of note we do not address research needs surrounding observed and projected changes in precipitation since that is primarily the domain of climate modelers nor do we address research needs associated with the simulated precipitation approach since our review of that topic was limited instead we refer the reader to willems et al 2012 and yan et al 2021 in regards to idf curve estimation under non stationarity in general the key research needs are to evaluate the two approaches simulated precipitation and covariate based via thoughtful and thorough comparison studies under a variety of hydrometeorological contexts currently only two such comparison studies exist and both are limited in spatial scope for an example of a large scale comparison of methods under non stationarity but on the topic of flood frequency estimation see schlef et al 2021 develop innovative methods to combine the two approaches which accentuate the strengths and balance the weaknesses of each approach while maintaining physical plausibility current attempts at combining the two approaches focus on applying a non stationary distribution to gcm precipitation projections or incorporating non stationarity in statistical downscaling investigate the limitations and strengths of using a scaling factor as a possible third approach especially in contexts where approximations are still informative for decision making the academic literature which applies this technique is quite limited but scaling factor values are recommended by some governments highlighting the need for further investigation explore the feasibility and value of using an ensemble of approaches similar to the use of an ensemble of climate models for generating projections one of the comparison studies recommends the use of ensembles but there are numerous challenges e g additional analytical and computational costs that need to be overcome in regards to the covariate based approach the key research needs are to apply the covariate based approach to both historical and future periods the majority of covariate based studies focus on the historical period effectively reducing the study to a sophisticated check for non stationarity rather than a framework for projection of non stationary idf curves application to the future period can introduce many additional challenges such as obtaining projections of covariates and calculation of non stationary return periods or alternative design values determine an encompassing approach to identifying mechanistic covariates detecting appropriate covariates is a challenging task due to the lack of long term data the presence of several overlapping trends and the fact that the covariates may differ for different durations of rainfall extremes vu and mishra 2019 existing studies take a variety of approaches that have not been coalesced into a unifying and broadly applicable framework which inhibits the adoption of the covariate based approach a corollary to this is comparing the effect of using different covariate identifying approaches on the final design value for an example of guidance for identifying covariates but for flood frequency estimation see schlef et al 2018 a similar type of guidance needs to be developed for idf curves explicitly address various durations in the analysis and develop methods to ensure that non stationary intensity frequency curves do not cross for various durations ouarda et al 2019 provide one approach to modeling multiple durations simultaneously this is especially necessary given that short duration rainfall intensities are projected to change at different rates from longer duration events westra et al 2014 in regards to snow dominated regions the key research need is to apply the covariate based approach to snow dominated regions while at the same time improving and expanding on work using the simulated precipitation approach also as discussed below the issue of regionalization is particularly relevant for snow dominated regions at the intersection of many disciplines this topic seems to be relatively overlooked yet clearly it is critically important given that a sizeable portion of northern hemisphere regions of the world fall into the snow dominated category barnett et al 2005 in regards to regionalization the key research need is to develop methods for detecting non stationary regions the literature is currently extremely limited and to improve upon and compare approaches index flood and bayesian hierarchical for distribution fitting special attention should be given to the formation of homogeneous regions in zones which are currently snow dominated but are projected to transition to rainfall a starting point could be developing improved approaches for detecting spatially coherent trends an example of this but applied to peak river flows is given by prosdocimi et al 2019 these topics merit much more attention than they currently receive given that a regionalization is preferred over at site analysis since data across space can be a substitute for limited temporal records burn 2014 b regionalization is used in several government developed idf curves in multiple countries svensson and jones 2010 c the climate change signal emerges earlier at the regional level thus avoiding conflicting at site information martel et al 2018 stegall and kunkel 2019 and d climate change has the potential to transition snow dominated regions to rainfall dominated usgcrp 2018 zion klos et al 2014 in regards to design values and uncertainty the key research needs are to evaluate the contribution of different sources of uncertainty and their propagation the development of non stationary idf curves is subject to various uncertainties that stem from the data and modeling approaches for example the lack of long term and fine timescale rainfall data often results in less reliable idf curves regional frequency analysis can address the issue of short records but also introduces its own uncertainties moges et al 2021 projection of future rainfall has considerable uncertainty that could be dealt with using multiple climate models and projections and suitable downscaling techniques lopez cantu et al 2020 develop design metrics based on both exceedance probability and infrastructure lifespan which can be applied to non stationary outputs from both the simulated precipitation and covariate based approaches currently the simulated precipitation approach is dependent on quasi stationary time periods which not only require the re assumption of stationarity although there might be some justification for this if the underlying change is not very abrupt and the period length is short enough e g a couple of decades such that natural variability dominates and limit the amount of data thus increasing the uncertainty of extremes but also do not incorporate infrastructure lifespan a corollary research need is for such metrics to be more widely adapted in analysis currently many covariate based studies avoid this issue by only analyzing the historical period or by calculating non stationary return periods that are not useful for design e g calculating a different return period for each year apply and demonstrate robustness based decision methods to idf curve studies currently there are only three idf curve studies which use such methods efforts to this effect would be aided by guidebooks or toolkits to streamline the analysis complexity and tools for communicating uncertainty to broad audiences for an example and guidance work on this topic can reference the numerous examples in the flood frequency literature see françois et al 2019 for a list of some there is a gap between research and the implementation of non stationary idf curves for design purposes we believe that addressing the above research needs will not only result in an improved ability to estimate idf curves under non stationarity from global climate change but will also make research outcomes whether frameworks

2556,accurate estimates of reservoir outflow are important for simulating runoff of watersheds regulated by large reservoirs using hydrological models the target release reservoir module widely used in the soil and water assessment tool swat shows poor performance in simulating the outflow and water level of large multipurpose reservoirs in this study a generalized reservoir operation chart based reservoir module is developed as an alternative to the original reservoir module in swat swat or the proposed reservoir module includes a dynamic decision based outflow framework integrated into the operation chart the modified version of swat with the new reservoir module swat m is not only suite for small reservoir with flood control function but also more applicable to large multipurpose reservoir the predictions obtained from the original and new reservoir modules are compared with measured data from the three largest reservoirs in the dongjiang river basin south china the performance of swat m and swat or for daily and monthly runoff simulations of four hydrological stations in the basin are compared the results shows that the proposed module produces results closer to the field measurements and has fewer errors than the original module which predicts inappropriate low reservoir outflow during dry periods in addition the runoff simulation by swat m shows a significant improvement in particular for stations directly influenced by large reservoirs the monthly daily scale r 2 of swat m is 0 02 to 0 21 0 14 to 0 44 higher and the nse is 0 11 to 0 30 0 12 to 7 16 higher than that of swat or the proposed reservoir operation chart based module significantly improves the applicability of swat to simulate runoff in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs keywords swat reservoir module reservoir operation chart simulating runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is a basic natural resource and an essential resource for ecosystems and human development however water resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to the rapidly developing economy and fast growing global population liu et al 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 howells et al 2013 moreover climate change has significantly affected water consumption in china lu et al 2019 while human activities have intensified the uneven distribution of finite water resources albert et al 2021 dubois et al 2018 water security faces substantial challenges in the changing environment as the impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources are increasing haddeland et al 2014 hydrological numerical simulations comprehensively consider exogenous hydroclimate change and endogenous human environmental dynamics via hydrological models thus they provide a solid foundation for dynamic water resources planning and management flood control and drought relief in watersheds under uncertainty serving as adaptive measures for water security zhang and al asadi 2019 accurate hydrological simulations under a changing environment are crucial for terrestrial hydrological process analysis reservoir regulation and the evaluation and management of water resources xiang et al 2021 guan et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed watershed model particularly useful for watershed scale water resource applications and watershed management bhatta et al 2019 priya and manjula 2021 swat consists of multiple modules with different functions resulting in high flexibility and universality to adjust to different hydrological components and different states the original swat provides four different reservoir outflow estimation methods measured daily outflow measured monthly outflow and average annual outflow for uncontrolled reservoirs and target release for controlled reservoir kim and parajuli 2014 neitsch 2005 in the absence of long time series observation data the target release method is typically used to simulate reservoir outflows under human control shrestha et al 2020 the target release method in swat sets the target storage for a reservoir each month the reservoir starts filling or releasing water when the water level falls below or exceeds the target storage capacity the outflow of large reservoirs is usually dependent on the reservoir s operating scheme loucks and van beek 2017 mentioned two types of operating schemes the first scheme distinguishes the target water storage for a specific time and the second one categorizes the reservoir s storage zones using curves with various rules correlated to specific distributions the latter is typically used in large multipurpose reservoirs however the target release method is only suitable for the former scheme and there is no suitable solution in swat to handle the latter scenario therefore significant bias occurs when swat is used to simulate runoffs in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs ferijal et al 2015 kim and parajuli 2014 due to an increasing number of reservoirs and large multipurpose reservoirs the reduction in the runoff variation and uniformity of flow has intensified because of a decrease in the peak flow and an enhancement in the minimum flow caused by the temporal mismatch between water supply and demand döll et al 2009 flörke et al 2010 however the original reservoir module in swat is only applicable to small reservoirs with flood control function and shows poor performance in simulating outflow of large reservoir with multi purposes which are shown in the reservoir operation chart thus it is necessary to improve the original reservoir module via integrating the reservoir operation chart and enhance its applicability the reservoir operation chart consists of different curves and corresponding operation zones for different water levels jiang et al 2014 the outflows of large multipurpose reservoirs are determined by creating a reservoir operation chart according to the downstream requirement including the storage of drinking water for humans livestock agriculture irrigation transportation flood control and other purposes anand et al 2018 numerous researchers attempted to integrate outflow rules with hydrologic models from different aspects wang et al 2021 li et al 2020 jia et al 2020 in recent years more reservoir parameterizations researches have been conducted to develop optimal reservoir operation schemes with either data driven or conceptual approaches for applications on either data rich or data scarce reservoirs and from local to national scales which aids optimal reservoir operation and contributes to practical water management for example coerver et al 2018 applied inflow into the reservoir and storage levels to derive fuzzy rules for reservoir operation via the anfis i e artificial neural network of capable of mimicking fuzzy logic adaptive network based fuzzy inference system and the fuzzy rules link inflow and storage with reservoir release shin et al 2019 presented a continental scale reservoir storage dynamics and release scheme by enhancing existing schemes and adding critical novel parameterizations to improve reservoir storage and release simulations and the reservoir dynamics were better simulated via a new calibration scheme yang et al 2019 applied three recurrent neural networks rnn to simulate the operation of three multi purpose reservoirs with multiannual flow regulation under different flow regimes especially under extreme floods and drought dong et al 2019 employed a generalized release scheme to determine the outflow of both large and small reservoirs and fully integrated into the coupled land surface and distributed hydrologic model system clhms after that dong et al 2022 further developed a continental scale land surface hydrologic model for mainland china based on the clhms model in which 3 547 reservoirs were explicitly represented and a scale free conceptual operating scheme with a hydrodynamic based bidirectional coupling scheme was used for the ungauged reservoirs the previous studies have developed their own reservoir modules and achieved ample application examples which makes reservoir schemes commensurate with regional social and economic development and promotes a lot for river basin water management under the changing environment nevertheless the previous studies did not focus on improving the original reservoir module in swat and lack adequate integration with the reservoir operation chart hanasaki et al 2006 categorized reservoirs into irrigation and non irrigation purposes and simulated the reservoir outflow using the inflow dependent method however this approach did not reflect the complexity of large multipurpose reservoirs i e it considered only one or two reservoir functions moreover the period of most studies was monthly wu and chen 2012 developed an operation based scheme to simulate daily outflows of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs using the swat model in combination with a reservoir operation chart that categorized the water level into four grades the outflow and storage of the multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs were simulated using decision based parameters and purpose based outflow variations however the new scheme required laborious calibration of the allocation factors between power generation water supply and impound water increasing the model s uncertainty to deal with these parameter uncertainties wang et al 2019 integrated the global river discharge equation presented by döll et al 2003 and empirical parameter simplified by meigh et al 1999 to simulate the outflow and water level of the xfj reservoir yet wang et al 2019 also indicated that the empirical coefficients were used to describe the functional connections between reservoir outflow and storage which could be the reason for the biases observed in the reservoir outflow furthermore these studies focused more on solving the uncertainty of the reservoir outflow equation than on refining the outflow requirement given by the reservoir operation chart shrestha et al 2020 developed a new hydropower reservoir operation routine hydror and integrated it into swat however the reservoir in hydror is specifically used to generate hydropower and hydror might not be applicable to the reservoir with other multi purposes e g flood control water supply and navigation moreover in shrestha et al 2020 the original reservoir module in swat was replaced with hydror which might make swat less suitable for simulating small reservoirs than the original reservoir module based on the original reservoir module and the reservoir operation chart how to develop a reservoir module in swat that is suite for both small and large reservoirs remain unsolved the dongjiang river basin in south china is a rapidly developing watershed that is significantly regulated by three large reservoirs i e xfj fsb and bpz 97 of the basin is located in guangdong province since 2012 the guangdong hydrographic bureau has developed a joint optimal scheduling scheme for the dongjiang three reservoirs with flood control water supply and power generation as the main functions of the three reservoirs the new scheme has implemented reservoir outflow requirements to generate electricity under different water levels as well as other downstream water demands hence the reservoir module of swat can be integrated with the reservoir operation chart we use the dongjiang river basin as a case study and improve the original reservoir outflow module in swat and enhance its applicability in watersheds significantly regulated by large reservoirs the objectives of this study are to i develop a reservoir operation chart based reservoir module in swat that is not only suite for small reservoir with flood control function but also more applicable to large multipurpose reservoir ii assess the performance of the new reservoir module for reservoir outflow and water storage level simulations by comparing it with the original reservoir module iii assess the improvement of the modified version of swat for runoff prediction this study provides new insights into reservoir outflow simulations in swat and improves the application of swat in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs 2 background 2 1 study area the dongjiang river basin in south china has a 562 km long main stem and encompasses a drainage area of 27 040 km2 fig 1 critical controlled reservoirs are the fengshuba fsb baipenzhu bpz and xinfengjiang xfj reservoirs the total area of the basin controlled by these three reservoirs is 11 740 km2 with a total storage capacity of 18 billion m3 thus these reservoirs control the hydrological regime in the study area the basin is a crucial source for irrigation and potable water for hong kong shenzhen guangzhou and other parts of the pearl river delta the dongjiang river basin is also the water supply source for nearly 40 million people in the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba the three large reservoirs play a vital role in flood management power generation and water supply security during dry periods the basin s main hydrological station is boluo and three other upstream sub basin outlets longchuang heyuan and linxia are located in the watershed from upstream to downstream the runoff of the four hydrological stations is significantly impacted by the three large reservoirs and runoff prediction is crucial for water resources planning and management of the whole basin 2 2 reservoir operation chart the reservoir operation chart is an important tool to guide reservoir operation jiang et al 2018 ding et al 2020 in the absence of medium and long term hydrological and meteorological forecasts reservoirs make storage and discharge decisions based on the operation chart in general the reservoir storage level can be categorized into four main levels fig 2 the dead storage water level h d critical water level h c flood control water level h fc and emergency water level h e various rules apply to different storage levels without the reservoir operation chart complicated parameter calibration between flood control and the dead level is required to determine the water allocation for power generation downstream water supply and water impoundment the dynamic adjustment increases the uncertainty of reservoir outflow the water output of the three reservoirs depends on the reservoir operation chart which is designed to match the downstream water demand and the power generation requirements of the hydropower plants the reservoir operation chart divides the storage level from flood control to dead storage level according to the water release target in the operation chart the upper and lower envelopes of all water level lines are derived as the basic guiding curves upper basic guiding curve and lower basic guiding curve ding et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 these guiding curves are preventing power generation damage curve h pp limiting power generation curve h lp reduced power generation curve h rp and preventing ecological damage curve h ped the operation chart mainly consists of different guide curves and corresponding operation zones and the release target of the reservoir at the beginning of each month can be defined based on the respective zone in which the water level is located for instance when the reservoir water level falls in the reduced output zone zone ⅱ or increased output zone zone ⅳ then the reservoir should correspondingly reduce or increase the output in the guaranteed output zone zone iii the reservoir should be running maintaining the firm capacity jiang et al 2014 2 3 data description a digital elevation model dem soil types

shenzhen wuhua in the dongjiang river basin were obtained from the meteorological data center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn the data were used for calibration and validation measured daily runoff data of four hydrological monitoring stations longchuan lingxia heyuan and boluo from 1997 to 2013 were provided by the guangdong hydrographic bureau the measured reservoir outflow and water level data were collected from the dongjiang river basin administration bureau several design parameters of the reservoir and the reservoir operation chart were used to develop the new swat reservoir module the reservoir operation charts were obtained from the dongjiang three reservoirs water supply dispatch scheme the dongjiang river basin was categorized into 28 subbasins and 408 hydrological response units hrus using the spatial analysis module in swat with the 90 m dem data fig 1 3 methods the swat was select as a platform to establish the proposed reservoir operation chart based reservoir module the objective was to optimize the applicability and flexibility of the swat in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs evaluations and calibrations of the swat model with the proposed reservoir operation chart based reservoir module and the original swat with the target release method were conducted the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 4 3 1 swat model the swat model is a semi distributed physical watershed model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda it can be traced to earlier usda ars field scale models the groundwater loading effect of agricultural management systems gleams model the chemical runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model and the environmental policy integrated climate model williams et al 1985 established the simulator for water resources in rural basins swrrb model by modifying the daily precipitation module in creams and combining the vegetation module from epic the pesticide module from gleams and the soil conservation service scs method since its first application swat has undergone nine improvements and has become a widespread open source hydrological model the evapotranspiration water movement in the soil lateral subsurface flow and groundwater flow are simulated based on several empirical equations and the principle of water balance the modeling process in swat can be divided into surface and confluence sections a basin is divided into several subbasins which can be further separated into hrus each hru has the same land use soil type watershed management and hydrologic processes the water infiltration and surface runoff are calculated independently in each hru during the surface process using the scs method and the water yield is calculated at the subbasin outlet subsequently a confluence process is performed with analog computation including flood sediment etc during the confluence process the reservoir is considered the outlet of the subbasin the water collected from upstream is used as the inflow to the reservoir and the outflow from the reservoir is determined the water balance of the reservoir including inflow outflow precipitation evaporation seepage from the reservoir bottom and diversion is defined using eq 1 1 v t 1 v t v flowin v pcp v flowout v e v s where v t 1 is the volume of water in the reservoir at the end of the day m3 d v t is the storage volume at the beginning of the day m3 d v flowin is the volume of water entering the reservoir during the day m3 d v pcp is the precipitation falling on the reservoir during the day m3 d v flowout is the volume of water the reservoir releases during the day m3 d v e is the volume of evaporation from the reservoir during the day v s is the volume of water lost by seepage m3 d eq 1 provides the volume of the reservoir in the storage state however the water level is the main variable for decision making to develop a reservoir outflow framework that satisfies the multiple objectives of reservoir regulation thus eq 2 is used to describe the relationship between the water level and the storage volume 2 h α jres v β jres where h is the water level m v is the reservoir storage volume m3 α jres and β jres is the regression coefficient between the water level and the storage capacity of the jres reservoir if β jres 1 the curve between the water level and storage volume is convex if β jres 1 the curve between the water level and storage volume is concave if β jres 1 the relationship between the water level and storage volume is linear 3 2 the target release method in swat the target release method is one of the reservoir outflow schemes in swat it is designed for small reservoirs with only a flood control function thus it has limitations the reservoir outflow is calculated as follows neitsch et al 2011 if mon mon fld b e g and mon mon fld e n d then 3 v trag v em else 4 v trag v pr 1 m i n sw fc 1 2 v em v pr 5 v flowout v v targ nd targ where mon is the month of the year mon fld b e g is the beginning month of the flood season mon fld e n d is the ending month of the flood season v trag is the target volume of water in the reservoir at the end of the day m3 v em is the volume of water in the reservoir when the storage level reaches the emergency spillway m3 v pr is the volume of water in the reservoir when storage level reaches the normal spillway m3 sw is the average soil water content mm on that day fc is the field capacity mm nd targ is the number of days to reach the target storage since the target release method is only used to simulate the reservoir release of floodwater eqs 3 and 4 should be modified when applying in large multiyear reservoir with multipurpose otherwise the simulated reservoir water level would not below h e thus this study adopts the following equation instead of eqs 3 and 4 to compute the target storage 6 v trag v m 1 m i n sw fc 1 2 v fl v m where v m is the minimum storage in the modified target release scheme m3 v fl is the flood control storage m3 v m and v fl are the design parameters of reservoir v trag is obtained through the calibration of sw and fc the related reservoir outflow can be calculated using eq 5 the nd targ of different reservoirs also need to be calibrated 3 3 reservoir operation chart based reservoir module the proposed reservoir operation chart based module is an alternative module to improve the adaptability of swat to watersheds with large reservoirs in the operation chart the upper and lower envelopes of all water level lines are derived as the basic guiding curves upper basic guiding curve and lower basic guiding curve ding et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 these guiding curves are preventing power generation damage curve h pp limiting power generation curve h lp reduced power generation curve h rp and preventing ecological damage curve h ped the operation chart mainly consists of different guide curves and corresponding operation zones and the release target of the reservoir at the beginning of each month can be defined based on the respective zone in which the water level is located for instance when the reservoir water level falls in the reduced output zone zone ⅰ or increased output zone zone ⅴ then the reservoir should correspondingly reduce or increase the output in the guaranteed output zone zone ⅳ the reservoir should be running maintaining the firm capacity jiang et al 2014 the reservoir operation chart has a specific outflow target for different output zones the guaranteed output n p and different output coefficients in corresponding output zones are provided by the operation chart therefore according to the operation chart the reservoir outflow scheme is formulated as follows 1 if the reservoir water level is below the dead water level the sluice is closed and no water is released 2 if the reservoir water level is between the dead water level and the flood limit water level the larger reservoir outflow is chosen from the outflow calculated by the target release method and the outflow determined by the reservoir operation chart the minimum outflow needs to meet the requirement of the basic ecological flow 3 if the reservoir water level exceeds the flood limit water level but below the upper water level for flood control the target release method is applied the reservoir outflow should be no less than the maximum output and should be no greater than the maximum flow of the control section in the downstream 4 if the reservoir water level reaches the upper water level for flood control all sluices are opened to release water the calculation formulas are as follows 7 q out 0 h t h d m a x f h t v v targ nd targ 86400 h d h t h fc v v targ nd targ 86400 h fc h t where q out m is the reservoir outflow m3 s h t is the real time water level on day t f h t is the function of the reservoir release for utilizable capacity h d t o h fc which is calculated according to the reservoir water level as defined in eq 8 when h t is in the range of h d h fc the reservoir outflow depends on the operation chart and the actual water level on day t based on the water level and its range in the reservoir operation chart the reservoir outflow is calculated as follows ye 2013 8 q out n t i h t i k i 9 n t i η h n p i where n t i kw is the dynamic power generation capacity of reservoir i on day t h t i m is the difference between the actual water level and the tail level in reservoir i on day t h t i h t h out η h is the power generating coefficient corresponding to different sections n p i is the fixed power generation capacity of reservoir i which is defined in the reservoir operation chart constraints are implemented to ensure that q out does not exceed the maximum quantity or is below the minimum quantity of the control section fig 5 meanwhile a minimum value of 1 5 times the water release required for power generation is implemented to ensure stable flood discharge and power generation while the reservoir water level exceeds the flood control level where q min q max are the minimum and maximum control flow values in the control station q 1 5 p denotes 1 5 times the water release required for power generation to ensure stable flood discharge and power generation 3 4 calibration validation and evaluation the performance of the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module is compared with that of the target release method in swat using the observed flow data from four hydrological stations in the dongjiang river basin the target release approach is the existing module in swat denoted as swat or and the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module denoted as swat m has been programmed and integrated into swat calibration and validation are required to improve the accuracy of swat simulation since numerous empirical equations are used for physical modeling li et al 2012 parameters related to the runoff and reservoir simulation were selected and a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted in swat cup the sufi 2 algorithm was used to calibrate and validate the module s accuracy it is an auto calibration and uncertainty analysis module that can deal with several input parameters in swat cup two metrics were used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed values the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r 2 10 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 11 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where n is the number of observations o i is the observed value at time i p i is the simulated value at time i o and p are the means of the observed and simulated values respectively the nse reflects the performance of the model output based on the comparison of the means of the observed and simulated values the r 2 is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables the closer the two nse and r 2 are to 1 the better the model performance is following existing studies arnold et al 2012 ma et al 2019 we use the following applicable standard on the monthly scale it is required that the r 2 0 60 and nse 0 50 on the daily scale it is required that the r 2 0 30 and nse 0 30 the p value and the t stat were used as statistical measurements in the sensitivity analysis the t stat is the ratio of the coefficients of the parameters to their standard error which is an indicator of the accuracy of the measured regression coefficient malik et al 2021 hence as the modulus of the t stat increases the parameter becomes more sensitive the p value refers to the metric of the t stat where a p value 0 05 indicates statistical significance thavhana et al 2018 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis results the monthly and daily runoff of the four hydrological stations were simulated from 2002 to 2013 in swat for two reservoir schemes 1 the modified swat swat m with the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module 2 the original swat swat or with the target release method the calibration and validation periods were 2002 2007 and 2008 2013 respectively the parameter calibration was performed using the sufi 2 algorithm according to arnold et al 2012 27 parameters related to the soil groundwater main cannel subbasin hru management and reservoir input file were selected for the sensitivity analysis we classified the 28 subbasins of the dongjiang river basin into 4 regions according to the location of the 4 hydrological stations and conducted a sensitivity analysis for each of the 4 regions fig 6 shows the sensitivity analysis results for both versions of swat on the monthly scale the 11 sensitive parameters with p values 0 05 were selected the top 11 sensitive parameters for swat or ranked from the highest to the lowest are alpha bnk cn2 ch k1 sol k ch k2 ndtarg of the xfj reservoir rchrg dp gw revap esco ndtarg of the fsb reservoir and alpha bf for swat m the top 11 sensitive parameters are cn2 alpha bnk ch k1 esco rchrg dp sol k ch k2 gw delay ndtarg of the xfj reservoir gw revap and alpha bf table 1 lists the definitions of those parameters and the range as shown in fig 6 more sensitive parameters are related to groundwater properties such as rchrg dp gw dela etc some parameters are related to the main channel alpha bnk and ch k2 however it is noteworthy that the ndtarg of both fsb and xfj reservoir are sensitive parameters in swat or while only the ndtarg of xfj reservoir is a sensitive parameter in swat m this suggests on the one hand that the dongjiang basin is highly influenced by the large reservoir on the other hand since swat or is more sensitive to the reservoir properties it is possible that the deviation of the calibration determined reservoir parameters from the actual situation will aggravate the uncertainty during the validation period 4 2 improvement in reservoir outflow and level simulation due to the absence of measured water levels in the bpz and fsb reservoirs only the water level of the xfj reservoir was investigated fig 7 shows that the simulated water level from january 1 2008 to december 31 2009 of the xfj reservoir swat m simulates the reservoir water level variation more accurately than swat or the water level of xfj reservoir simulated by swat or is significantly lower than the observed value and the water level of xfj reservoir simulated by swat m is closer to the observed value the r 2 value of the simulated xfj water level with the observed data was 0 56 for swat or while it was 0 69 for swat m the correlation between the simulated water level and the observed value was improved after the model modification swat m enhances the stability of simulated reservoir outflows fig 8 shows the observed and simulated outflows of the three reservoirs from january 1 2008 to december 2009 obtained from swat m and swat or in the actual situation reservoirs require a more stable outflow with few peaks and valleys it requires a more consistent outflow to meet the downstream water demand however fig 8 shows that the simulated reservoir outflow by swat or fluctuates frequently with larger magnitude and it is impossible to meet a stable power generation water demand in particular the simulated outflow of the xfj reservoir even appears discontinuous during certain periods of the dry season fig 8 b which not only fails to meet the water demand for power generation but also fails to meet the ecological water demand these can be solved in swat m which provides a stable simulated outflow for the three reservoirs 4 3 improvement in runoff simulation table 2 lists the nse and r 2 values of swat or and swat m for the runoff simulations of the four hydrological stations the underlined values did not meet the model s qualification criteria apparently swat or s runoff simulations on the daily scale are poor the runoff simulations for longchuan heyuan and lingxia stations during the validation period failed to satisfy the applicable standard both swat m and swat or have appropriate simulation results during the calibration period however the accuracy of swat or is severely degraded during the validation period especially on the daily scale swat m simulated runoff is significantly improved compared with that of swat or with the most obvious improvement at longchuan and heyuan stations longchuan and heyuan stations are located downstream of the fsb and xfj reservoirs respectively the runoff at these two stations is directly and significantly affected by the outflow of the two reservoirs therefore the more appropriate the reservoir simulation is the more the accuracy of simulating runoff from these two stations can be improved the monthly scale simulation results are as follow 1 during the calibration period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 66 0 79 0 86 and 0 86 respectively the calculated nse are 0 61 0 75 0 85 and 0 83 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 74 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively the calculated nse are 0 72 0 81 0 87 and 0 85 respectively 2 during the validation period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 63 0 51 0 71 and 0 81 respectively the calculated nse are 0 51 0 37 0 70 and 0 71 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 65 0 72 0 84 and 0 85 respectively the calculated nse are 0 64 0 67 0 84 and 0 82 respectively for longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations the r 2 of swat m is 0 08 0 02 0 02 and 0 05 higher than swat or on the monthly simulation during the calibration period while the nse is 0 11 0 06 0 02 and 0 02 higher respectively on the monthly runoff simulations for the validation period the r 2 of swat m is 0 02 0 21 0 13 and 0 04 higher than that of swat or the nse is 0 13 0 30 0 14 and 0 11 higher respectively during the validation period the monthly runoff simulated by swat or at the heyuan station failed to satisfy the applicable standard the enhancement of simulated daily runoff is much more pronounced the daily scale simulation results are as follow 1 during the calibration period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 35 0 57 0 68 and 0 69 respectively the calculated nse are 0 23 0 54 0 68 and 0 64 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 61 0 63 0 72 and 0 75 respectively the calculated nse are 0 59 0 69 0 70 and 0 69 respectively 2 during the validation period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 14 0 13 0 45 and 0 51 respectively the calculated nse are 1 69 6 64 0 22 and 0 49 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 41 0 57 0 63 and 0 65 respectively the calculated nse are 0 40 0 52 0 62 and 0 61 respectively for longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations the r 2 of swat m is 0 26 0 06 0 04 and 0 06 higher than swat or on the daily simulation during the calibration period while the nse is 0 36 0 09 0 02 and 0 05 higher respectively on the daily runoff simulations for the validation period the r 2 of swat m is 0 27 0 44 0 18 and 0 14 higher than that of swat or the nse is 2 09 7 16 0 40 and 0 12 higher respectively on the daily scale simulation the runoff of longchuan station simulated by swat or during the calibration period could not satisfy the applicable standard during the validation period runoff simulations at three stations failed to satisfy the applicable standard longchuan heyuan and lingxia the runoff simulation curves for the stations obtained by both versions of swat are shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the simulate monthly runoff both swat or and swat m provide an appropriate result however some problems can be found in swat or first of all the simulated runoff fluctuations are sharp secondly the simulated runoff during dry season at longchuan and heyuan stations appear to be underestimated see fig 9 a and b swat or can neither provide a stable outflow pattern that can meet the requirements of the reservoirs nor can it accurately simulate the runoff downstream of the reservoir at the same time the daily runoff results of the four stations obtained by swat m and swat or are shown in fig 10 during the calibration period the daily runoff during the dry season period simulated by swat or is overestimated at longchuan station fig 10 a however those value are underestimated at heyuan lingxia and boluo see fig 10 b c and d the reservoir outflow pattern provided by swat or makes it difficult to find the appropriate basin parameters during the calibration exercise which is a problem that manifests itself in the validation period during the validation period the daily runoff series provided by swat or fluctuate frequently with larger magnitude thus seriously affecting the accuracy of swat or model as mentioned in section 4 2 the longchuan and heyuan stations are heavily influenced by reservoirs but during the dry period the runoff simulated by swat or even appears discontinuous fig 10 a and b nevertheless swat m solves these problems above swat m can provide a suitable reservoir outflow pattern which allows the model parameters to be accurately calibrated therefore swat m provides appropriate runoff series during the validation period which makes the model accuracy improved compared to swat or swat m provides appropriate flood flows and stable transitional runoff series during the dry season in general swat m is more appropriate than swat or in simulation performance swat m mainly reduces the excessive large oscillations of the runoff series in swat or and provides a suitable stable flow during the dry season 5 discussion the operational purposes of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs depend on the water storage level and the season hence simulating reservoir storage and outflows using a fixed set of target storage values e g the specific storage method in the original swat model which simulates human control in the absence of measurement data is challenging therefore we proposed a new reservoir module based on the reservoir operation chart and applied the method to the three largest reservoirs in the dongjiang basin changes in the downstream runoff occur because reservoir outflows vary for different reservoir modules as a result the sensitivity of the model parameters may change requiring a sensitivity analysis of swat or and swat m model parameters daily and monthly runoff simulations were conducted for four hydrological stations on the mainstream using swat or and swat m to evaluate the performance of the proposed reservoir module there are three main parameters that affect the reservoir outflow curve res psa res k and ndtarg the meaning of the ndtarg is the same as the nd targ in eq 5 since it directly affects eq 5 and according to the sensitivity analysis the ndtarg affects the reservoir curve the most to better fit the reservoir outflow curve the ndtarg was calibrated in the swat cup on the monthly scale the nd targ of the fsb xfj and bpz reservoirs are 51 6 and 34 using swat or 85 93 and 99 using swat m on the daily scale the nd targ for the three reservoirs above are 20 81 and 117 using swat or 109 105 and 136 using swat m respectively the difference in nd targ between the same model at the daily and monthly scales is due to the fact that the nd targ has no longer physically meaningful in the calibration work wu and chen 2012 moreover this value can vary with season year and operational purpose the nse obtained from the target release method table 2 shows that swat or did not provide accurate estimates on the monthly and daily scale for hydrological stations directly influenced by large reservoirs suggesting this method is unsuitable for large reservoirs with multiple regulations swat or amplifies the sensitivity of the nd targ to simulated watershed runoff making its simulated runoff series inappropriately deviated during the validation period swat m serves to provide a suitable reservoir outflow pattern making the sensitivity of nd targ to simulated watershed runoff reach an appropriate position the model stands up to the examination and the applicability is ensured a major advantage of the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module in swat m is that no additional indeterminate parameters are required eq 5 was used to calculate the reservoir outflow for the other storage levels the minimum outflows of the fsb xfj and bpz reservoirs were 30 m3 s 60 m3 s and 10 m3 s according to the dongjiang three reservoirs water supply dispatch scheme those reservoir outflows ensured that the minimum water supply was maintained downstream the new reservoir module provides more realistic runoff values in the flood period and ensures consistent reservoir outflow during the dry season however the model lacks flexibility because the reservoir outflow equation adopted in this study uses a fixed power generation coefficient within a given storage range whereas the actual power generation coefficient may fluctuate it remains a challenge to describe the dynamics of regulated runoff due to the rapid development of joint operations in reservoir systems uncertainties arise from various datasets operating platforms and the limitations of the reservoir outflow model ma et al 2022 liu et al 2019 6 conclusion the target release reservoir module in the original swat model has limitations for simulating large reservoir outflow due to diverse scheduling objectives in the operation of large reservoirs we proposed a reservoir operation chart based reservoir module for swat and used it to simulate the reservoir outflow of the three largest reservoirs in the dongjiang river basin the primary conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 swat m has higher reliability in application the implementation of the calibrated watershed related parameters in the simulation prediction work is trustworthy the improved model is more consistent with reality in terms of parameter sensitivity analysis 2 swat m exhibited better performance than swat or for simulating the reservoir level and outflow the water level of the xfj reservoir predicted by swat m was closer to the measured water level than that of swat or the simulated outflow of the three large reservoirs was more stable and accurate 3 swat m achieved higher runoff simulation accuracy than swat or for the four hydrological stations particularly for stations directly influenced by large reservoirs the improved accuracy of the runoff predicted downstream of the reservoirs indicates the superiority of the proposed new reservoir module swat m was less prone than swat or to runoff underestimation in dry periods and runoff simulated by swat or fluctuate frequently with larger magnitude the reservoir operation chart based reservoir scheme considers multiple objectives of large reservoirs so that a dynamic decision based outflow framework can be established the new reservoir module substantially improved the ability of swat to predict the outflow and water level of multipurpose reservoirs thus the proposed method has the potential to improve the applicability of swat in large reservoir regulation areas

2556,accurate estimates of reservoir outflow are important for simulating runoff of watersheds regulated by large reservoirs using hydrological models the target release reservoir module widely used in the soil and water assessment tool swat shows poor performance in simulating the outflow and water level of large multipurpose reservoirs in this study a generalized reservoir operation chart based reservoir module is developed as an alternative to the original reservoir module in swat swat or the proposed reservoir module includes a dynamic decision based outflow framework integrated into the operation chart the modified version of swat with the new reservoir module swat m is not only suite for small reservoir with flood control function but also more applicable to large multipurpose reservoir the predictions obtained from the original and new reservoir modules are compared with measured data from the three largest reservoirs in the dongjiang river basin south china the performance of swat m and swat or for daily and monthly runoff simulations of four hydrological stations in the basin are compared the results shows that the proposed module produces results closer to the field measurements and has fewer errors than the original module which predicts inappropriate low reservoir outflow during dry periods in addition the runoff simulation by swat m shows a significant improvement in particular for stations directly influenced by large reservoirs the monthly daily scale r 2 of swat m is 0 02 to 0 21 0 14 to 0 44 higher and the nse is 0 11 to 0 30 0 12 to 7 16 higher than that of swat or the proposed reservoir operation chart based module significantly improves the applicability of swat to simulate runoff in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs keywords swat reservoir module reservoir operation chart simulating runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is a basic natural resource and an essential resource for ecosystems and human development however water resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to the rapidly developing economy and fast growing global population liu et al 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 howells et al 2013 moreover climate change has significantly affected water consumption in china lu et al 2019 while human activities have intensified the uneven distribution of finite water resources albert et al 2021 dubois et al 2018 water security faces substantial challenges in the changing environment as the impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources are increasing haddeland et al 2014 hydrological numerical simulations comprehensively consider exogenous hydroclimate change and endogenous human environmental dynamics via hydrological models thus they provide a solid foundation for dynamic water resources planning and management flood control and drought relief in watersheds under uncertainty serving as adaptive measures for water security zhang and al asadi 2019 accurate hydrological simulations under a changing environment are crucial for terrestrial hydrological process analysis reservoir regulation and the evaluation and management of water resources xiang et al 2021 guan et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed watershed model particularly useful for watershed scale water resource applications and watershed management bhatta et al 2019 priya and manjula 2021 swat consists of multiple modules with different functions resulting in high flexibility and universality to adjust to different hydrological components and different states the original swat provides four different reservoir outflow estimation methods measured daily outflow measured monthly outflow and average annual outflow for uncontrolled reservoirs and target release for controlled reservoir kim and parajuli 2014 neitsch 2005 in the absence of long time series observation data the target release method is typically used to simulate reservoir outflows under human control shrestha et al 2020 the target release method in swat sets the target storage for a reservoir each month the reservoir starts filling or releasing water when the water level falls below or exceeds the target storage capacity the outflow of large reservoirs is usually dependent on the reservoir s operating scheme loucks and van beek 2017 mentioned two types of operating schemes the first scheme distinguishes the target water storage for a specific time and the second one categorizes the reservoir s storage zones using curves with various rules correlated to specific distributions the latter is typically used in large multipurpose reservoirs however the target release method is only suitable for the former scheme and there is no suitable solution in swat to handle the latter scenario therefore significant bias occurs when swat is used to simulate runoffs in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs ferijal et al 2015 kim and parajuli 2014 due to an increasing number of reservoirs and large multipurpose reservoirs the reduction in the runoff variation and uniformity of flow has intensified because of a decrease in the peak flow and an enhancement in the minimum flow caused by the temporal mismatch between water supply and demand döll et al 2009 flörke et al 2010 however the original reservoir module in swat is only applicable to small reservoirs with flood control function and shows poor performance in simulating outflow of large reservoir with multi purposes which are shown in the reservoir operation chart thus it is necessary to improve the original reservoir module via integrating the reservoir operation chart and enhance its applicability the reservoir operation chart consists of different curves and corresponding operation zones for different water levels jiang et al 2014 the outflows of large multipurpose reservoirs are determined by creating a reservoir operation chart according to the downstream requirement including the storage of drinking water for humans livestock agriculture irrigation transportation flood control and other purposes anand et al 2018 numerous researchers attempted to integrate outflow rules with hydrologic models from different aspects wang et al 2021 li et al 2020 jia et al 2020 in recent years more reservoir parameterizations researches have been conducted to develop optimal reservoir operation schemes with either data driven or conceptual approaches for applications on either data rich or data scarce reservoirs and from local to national scales which aids optimal reservoir operation and contributes to practical water management for example coerver et al 2018 applied inflow into the reservoir and storage levels to derive fuzzy rules for reservoir operation via the anfis i e artificial neural network of capable of mimicking fuzzy logic adaptive network based fuzzy inference system and the fuzzy rules link inflow and storage with reservoir release shin et al 2019 presented a continental scale reservoir storage dynamics and release scheme by enhancing existing schemes and adding critical novel parameterizations to improve reservoir storage and release simulations and the reservoir dynamics were better simulated via a new calibration scheme yang et al 2019 applied three recurrent neural networks rnn to simulate the operation of three multi purpose reservoirs with multiannual flow regulation under different flow regimes especially under extreme floods and drought dong et al 2019 employed a generalized release scheme to determine the outflow of both large and small reservoirs and fully integrated into the coupled land surface and distributed hydrologic model system clhms after that dong et al 2022 further developed a continental scale land surface hydrologic model for mainland china based on the clhms model in which 3 547 reservoirs were explicitly represented and a scale free conceptual operating scheme with a hydrodynamic based bidirectional coupling scheme was used for the ungauged reservoirs the previous studies have developed their own reservoir modules and achieved ample application examples which makes reservoir schemes commensurate with regional social and economic development and promotes a lot for river basin water management under the changing environment nevertheless the previous studies did not focus on improving the original reservoir module in swat and lack adequate integration with the reservoir operation chart hanasaki et al 2006 categorized reservoirs into irrigation and non irrigation purposes and simulated the reservoir outflow using the inflow dependent method however this approach did not reflect the complexity of large multipurpose reservoirs i e it considered only one or two reservoir functions moreover the period of most studies was monthly wu and chen 2012 developed an operation based scheme to simulate daily outflows of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs using the swat model in combination with a reservoir operation chart that categorized the water level into four grades the outflow and storage of the multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs were simulated using decision based parameters and purpose based outflow variations however the new scheme required laborious calibration of the allocation factors between power generation water supply and impound water increasing the model s uncertainty to deal with these parameter uncertainties wang et al 2019 integrated the global river discharge equation presented by döll et al 2003 and empirical parameter simplified by meigh et al 1999 to simulate the outflow and water level of the xfj reservoir yet wang et al 2019 also indicated that the empirical coefficients were used to describe the functional connections between reservoir outflow and storage which could be the reason for the biases observed in the reservoir outflow furthermore these studies focused more on solving the uncertainty of the reservoir outflow equation than on refining the outflow requirement given by the reservoir operation chart shrestha et al 2020 developed a new hydropower reservoir operation routine hydror and integrated it into swat however the reservoir in hydror is specifically used to generate hydropower and hydror might not be applicable to the reservoir with other multi purposes e g flood control water supply and navigation moreover in shrestha et al 2020 the original reservoir module in swat was replaced with hydror which might make swat less suitable for simulating small reservoirs than the original reservoir module based on the original reservoir module and the reservoir operation chart how to develop a reservoir module in swat that is suite for both small and large reservoirs remain unsolved the dongjiang river basin in south china is a rapidly developing watershed that is significantly regulated by three large reservoirs i e xfj fsb and bpz 97 of the basin is located in guangdong province since 2012 the guangdong hydrographic bureau has developed a joint optimal scheduling scheme for the dongjiang three reservoirs with flood control water supply and power generation as the main functions of the three reservoirs the new scheme has implemented reservoir outflow requirements to generate electricity under different water levels as well as other downstream water demands hence the reservoir module of swat can be integrated with the reservoir operation chart we use the dongjiang river basin as a case study and improve the original reservoir outflow module in swat and enhance its applicability in watersheds significantly regulated by large reservoirs the objectives of this study are to i develop a reservoir operation chart based reservoir module in swat that is not only suite for small reservoir with flood control function but also more applicable to large multipurpose reservoir ii assess the performance of the new reservoir module for reservoir outflow and water storage level simulations by comparing it with the original reservoir module iii assess the improvement of the modified version of swat for runoff prediction this study provides new insights into reservoir outflow simulations in swat and improves the application of swat in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs 2 background 2 1 study area the dongjiang river basin in south china has a 562 km long main stem and encompasses a drainage area of 27 040 km2 fig 1 critical controlled reservoirs are the fengshuba fsb baipenzhu bpz and xinfengjiang xfj reservoirs the total area of the basin controlled by these three reservoirs is 11 740 km2 with a total storage capacity of 18 billion m3 thus these reservoirs control the hydrological regime in the study area the basin is a crucial source for irrigation and potable water for hong kong shenzhen guangzhou and other parts of the pearl river delta the dongjiang river basin is also the water supply source for nearly 40 million people in the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba the three large reservoirs play a vital role in flood management power generation and water supply security during dry periods the basin s main hydrological station is boluo and three other upstream sub basin outlets longchuang heyuan and linxia are located in the watershed from upstream to downstream the runoff of the four hydrological stations is significantly impacted by the three large reservoirs and runoff prediction is crucial for water resources planning and management of the whole basin 2 2 reservoir operation chart the reservoir operation chart is an important tool to guide reservoir operation jiang et al 2018 ding et al 2020 in the absence of medium and long term hydrological and meteorological forecasts reservoirs make storage and discharge decisions based on the operation chart in general the reservoir storage level can be categorized into four main levels fig 2 the dead storage water level h d critical water level h c flood control water level h fc and emergency water level h e various rules apply to different storage levels without the reservoir operation chart complicated parameter calibration between flood control and the dead level is required to determine the water allocation for power generation downstream water supply and water impoundment the dynamic adjustment increases the uncertainty of reservoir outflow the water output of the three reservoirs depends on the reservoir operation chart which is designed to match the downstream water demand and the power generation requirements of the hydropower plants the reservoir operation chart divides the storage level from flood control to dead storage level according to the water release target in the operation chart the upper and lower envelopes of all water level lines are derived as the basic guiding curves upper basic guiding curve and lower basic guiding curve ding et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 these guiding curves are preventing power generation damage curve h pp limiting power generation curve h lp reduced power generation curve h rp and preventing ecological damage curve h ped the operation chart mainly consists of different guide curves and corresponding operation zones and the release target of the reservoir at the beginning of each month can be defined based on the respective zone in which the water level is located for instance when the reservoir water level falls in the reduced output zone zone ⅱ or increased output zone zone ⅳ then the reservoir should correspondingly reduce or increase the output in the guaranteed output zone zone iii the reservoir should be running maintaining the firm capacity jiang et al 2014 2 3 data description a digital elevation model dem soil types meteorological information and land use data are required to model a watershed in swat in this study the 90 m 90 m dem from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm was used the dem was downloaded

http www resdc cn daily weather data including precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunlight hours from 1950 to 2015 at 7 weather stations lianping xunwu huiyang heyuan zengcheng shenzhen wuhua in the dongjiang river basin were obtained from the meteorological data center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn the data were used for calibration and validation measured daily runoff data of four hydrological monitoring stations longchuan lingxia heyuan and boluo from 1997 to 2013 were provided by the guangdong hydrographic bureau the measured reservoir outflow and water level data were collected from the dongjiang river basin administration bureau several design parameters of the reservoir and the reservoir operation chart were used to develop the new swat reservoir module the reservoir operation charts were obtained from the dongjiang three reservoirs water supply dispatch scheme the dongjiang river basin was categorized into 28 subbasins and 408 hydrological response units hrus using the spatial analysis module in swat with the 90 m dem data fig 1 3 methods the swat was select as a platform to establish the proposed reservoir operation chart based reservoir module the objective was to optimize the applicability and flexibility of the swat in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs evaluations and calibrations of the swat model with the proposed reservoir operation chart based reservoir module and the original swat with the target release method were conducted the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 4 3 1 swat model the swat model is a semi distributed physical watershed model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda it can be traced to earlier usda ars field scale models the groundwater loading effect of agricultural management systems gleams model the chemical runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model and the environmental policy integrated climate model williams et al 1985 established the simulator for water resources in rural basins swrrb model by modifying the daily precipitation module in creams and combining the vegetation module from epic the pesticide module from gleams and the soil conservation service scs method since its first application swat has undergone nine improvements and has become a widespread open source hydrological model the evapotranspiration water movement in the soil lateral subsurface flow and groundwater flow are simulated based on several empirical equations and the principle of water balance the modeling process in swat can be divided into surface and confluence sections a basin is divided into several subbasins which can be further separated into hrus each hru has the same land use soil type watershed management and hydrologic processes the water infiltration and surface runoff are calculated independently in each hru during the surface process using the scs method and the water yield is calculated at the subbasin outlet subsequently a confluence process is performed with analog computation including flood sediment etc during the confluence process the reservoir is considered the outlet of the subbasin the water collected from upstream is used as the inflow to the reservoir and the outflow from the reservoir is determined the water balance of the reservoir including inflow outflow precipitation evaporation seepage from the reservoir bottom and diversion is defined using eq 1 1 v t 1 v t v flowin v pcp v flowout v e v s where v t 1 is the volume of water in the reservoir at the end of the day m3 d v t is the storage volume at the beginning of the day m3 d v flowin is the volume of water entering the reservoir during the day m3 d v pcp is the precipitation falling on the reservoir during the day m3 d v flowout is the volume of water the reservoir releases during the day m3 d v e is the volume of evaporation from the reservoir during the day v s is the volume of water lost by seepage m3 d eq 1 provides the volume of the reservoir in the storage state however the water level is the main variable for decision making to develop a reservoir outflow framework that satisfies the multiple objectives of reservoir regulation thus eq 2 is used to describe the relationship between the water level and the storage volume 2 h α jres v β jres where h is the water level m v is the reservoir storage volume m3 α jres and β jres is the regression coefficient between the water level and the storage capacity of the jres reservoir if β jres 1 the curve between the water level and storage volume is convex if β jres 1 the curve between the water level and storage volume is concave if β jres 1 the relationship between the water level and storage volume is linear 3 2 the target release method in swat the target release method is one of the reservoir outflow schemes in swat it is designed for small reservoirs with only a flood control function thus it has limitations the reservoir outflow is calculated as follows neitsch et al 2011 if mon mon fld b e g and mon mon fld e n d then 3 v trag v em else 4 v trag v pr 1 m i n sw fc 1 2 v em v pr 5 v flowout v v targ nd targ where mon is the month of the year mon fld b e g is the beginning month of the flood season mon fld e n d is the ending month of the flood season v trag is the target volume of water in the reservoir at the end of the day m3 v em is the volume of water in the reservoir when the storage level reaches the emergency spillway m3 v pr is the volume of water in the reservoir when storage level reaches the normal spillway m3 sw is the average soil water content mm on that day fc is the field capacity mm nd targ is the number of days to reach the target storage since the target release method is only used to simulate the reservoir release of floodwater eqs 3 and 4 should be modified when applying in large multiyear reservoir with multipurpose otherwise the simulated reservoir water level would not below h e thus this study adopts the following equation instead of eqs 3 and 4 to compute the target storage 6 v trag v m 1 m i n sw fc 1 2 v fl v m where v m is the minimum storage in the modified target release scheme m3 v fl is the flood control storage m3 v m and v fl are the design parameters of reservoir v trag is obtained through the calibration of sw and fc the related reservoir outflow can be calculated using eq 5 the nd targ of different reservoirs also need to be calibrated 3 3 reservoir operation chart based reservoir module the proposed reservoir operation chart based module is an alternative module to improve the adaptability of swat to watersheds with large reservoirs in the operation chart the upper and lower envelopes of all water level lines are derived as the basic guiding curves upper basic guiding curve and lower basic guiding curve ding et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 these guiding curves are preventing power generation damage curve h pp limiting power generation curve h lp reduced power generation curve h rp and preventing ecological damage curve h ped the operation chart mainly consists of different guide curves and corresponding operation zones and the release target of the reservoir at the beginning of each month can be defined based on the respective zone in which the water level is located for instance when the reservoir water level falls in the reduced output zone zone ⅰ or increased output zone zone ⅴ then the reservoir should correspondingly reduce or increase the output in the guaranteed output zone zone ⅳ the reservoir should be running maintaining the firm capacity jiang et al 2014 the reservoir operation chart has a specific outflow target for different output zones the guaranteed output n p and different output coefficients in corresponding output zones are provided by the operation chart therefore according to the operation chart the reservoir outflow scheme is formulated as follows 1 if the reservoir water level is below the dead water level the sluice is closed and no water is released 2 if the reservoir water level is between the dead water level and the flood limit water level the larger reservoir outflow is chosen from the outflow calculated by the target release method and the outflow determined by the reservoir operation chart the minimum outflow needs to meet the requirement of the basic ecological flow 3 if the reservoir water level exceeds the flood limit water level but below the upper water level for flood control the target release method is applied the reservoir outflow should be no less than the maximum output and should be no greater than the maximum flow of the control section in the downstream 4 if the reservoir water level reaches the upper water level for flood control all sluices are opened to release water the calculation formulas are as follows 7 q out 0 h t h d m a x f h t v v targ nd targ 86400 h d h t h fc v v targ nd targ 86400 h fc h t where q out m is the reservoir outflow m3 s h t is the real time water level on day t f h t is the function of the reservoir release for utilizable capacity h d t o h fc which is calculated according to the reservoir water level as defined in eq 8 when h t is in the range of h d h fc the reservoir outflow depends on the operation chart and the actual water level on day t based on the water level and its range in the reservoir operation chart the reservoir outflow is calculated as follows ye 2013 8 q out n t i h t i k i 9 n t i η h n p i where n t i kw is the dynamic power generation capacity of reservoir i on day t h t i m is the difference between the actual water level and the tail level in reservoir i on day t h t i h t h out η h is the power generating coefficient corresponding to different sections n p i is the fixed power generation capacity of reservoir i which is defined in the reservoir operation chart constraints are implemented to ensure that q out does not exceed the maximum quantity or is below the minimum quantity of the control section fig 5 meanwhile a minimum value of 1 5 times the water release required for power generation is implemented to ensure stable flood discharge and power generation while the reservoir water level exceeds the flood control level where q min q max are the minimum and maximum control flow values in the control station q 1 5 p denotes 1 5 times the water release required for power generation to ensure stable flood discharge and power generation 3 4 calibration validation and evaluation the performance of the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module is compared with that of the target release method in swat using the observed flow data from four hydrological stations in the dongjiang river basin the target release approach is the existing module in swat denoted as swat or and the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module denoted as swat m has been programmed and integrated into swat calibration and validation are required to improve the accuracy of swat simulation since numerous empirical equations are used for physical modeling li et al 2012 parameters related to the runoff and reservoir simulation were selected and a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted in swat cup the sufi 2 algorithm was used to calibrate and validate the module s accuracy it is an auto calibration and uncertainty analysis module that can deal with several input parameters in swat cup two metrics were used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed values the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r 2 10 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 11 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where n is the number of observations o i is the observed value at time i p i is the simulated value at time i o and p are the means of the observed and simulated values respectively the nse reflects the performance of the model output based on the comparison of the means of the observed and simulated values the r 2 is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables the closer the two nse and r 2 are to 1 the better the model performance is following existing studies arnold et al 2012 ma et al 2019 we use the following applicable standard on the monthly scale it is required that the r 2 0 60 and nse 0 50 on the daily scale it is required that the r 2 0 30 and nse 0 30 the p value and the t stat were used as statistical measurements in the sensitivity analysis the t stat is the ratio of the coefficients of the parameters to their standard error which is an indicator of the accuracy of the measured regression coefficient malik et al 2021 hence as the modulus of the t stat increases the parameter becomes more sensitive the p value refers to the metric of the t stat where a p value 0 05 indicates statistical significance thavhana et al 2018 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis results the monthly and daily runoff of the four hydrological stations were simulated from 2002 to 2013 in swat for two reservoir schemes 1 the modified swat swat m with the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module 2 the original swat swat or with the target release method the calibration and validation periods were 2002 2007 and 2008 2013 respectively the parameter calibration was performed using the sufi 2 algorithm according to arnold et al 2012 27 parameters related to the soil groundwater main cannel subbasin hru management and reservoir input file were selected for the sensitivity analysis we classified the 28 subbasins of the dongjiang river basin into 4 regions according to the location of the 4 hydrological stations and conducted a sensitivity analysis for each of the 4 regions fig 6 shows the sensitivity analysis results for both versions of swat on the monthly scale the 11 sensitive parameters with p values 0 05 were selected the top 11 sensitive parameters for swat or ranked from the highest to the lowest are alpha bnk cn2 ch k1 sol k ch k2 ndtarg of the xfj reservoir rchrg dp gw revap esco ndtarg of the fsb reservoir and alpha bf for swat m the top 11 sensitive parameters are cn2 alpha bnk ch k1 esco rchrg dp sol k ch k2 gw delay ndtarg of the xfj reservoir gw revap and alpha bf table 1 lists the definitions of those parameters and the range as shown in fig 6 more sensitive parameters are related to groundwater properties such as rchrg dp gw dela etc some parameters are related to the main channel alpha bnk and ch k2 however it is noteworthy that the ndtarg of both fsb and xfj reservoir are sensitive parameters in swat or while only the ndtarg of xfj reservoir is a sensitive parameter in swat m this suggests on the one hand that the dongjiang basin is highly influenced by the large reservoir on the other hand since swat or is more sensitive to the reservoir properties it is possible that the deviation of the calibration determined reservoir parameters from the actual situation will aggravate the uncertainty during the validation period 4 2 improvement in reservoir outflow and level simulation due to the absence of measured water levels in the bpz and fsb reservoirs only the water level of the xfj reservoir was investigated fig 7 shows that the simulated water level from january 1 2008 to december 31 2009 of the xfj reservoir swat m simulates the reservoir water level variation more accurately than swat or the water level of xfj reservoir simulated by swat or is significantly lower than the observed value and the water level of xfj reservoir simulated by swat m is closer to the observed value the r 2 value of the simulated xfj water level with the observed data was 0 56 for swat or while it was 0 69 for swat m the correlation between the simulated water level and the observed value was improved after the model modification swat m enhances the stability of simulated reservoir outflows fig 8 shows the observed and simulated outflows of the three reservoirs from january 1 2008 to december 2009 obtained from swat m and swat or in the actual situation reservoirs require a more stable outflow with few peaks and valleys it requires a more consistent outflow to meet the downstream water demand however fig 8 shows that the simulated reservoir outflow by swat or fluctuates frequently with larger magnitude and it is impossible to meet a stable power generation water demand in particular the simulated outflow of the xfj reservoir even appears discontinuous during certain periods of the dry season fig 8 b which not only fails to meet the water demand for power generation but also fails to meet the ecological water demand these can be solved in swat m which provides a stable simulated outflow for the three reservoirs 4 3 improvement in runoff simulation table 2 lists the nse and r 2 values of swat or and swat m for the runoff simulations of the four hydrological stations the underlined values did not meet the model s qualification criteria apparently swat or s runoff simulations on the daily scale are poor the runoff simulations for longchuan heyuan and lingxia stations during the validation period failed to satisfy the applicable standard both swat m and swat or have appropriate simulation results during the calibration period however the accuracy of swat or is severely degraded during the validation period especially on the daily scale swat m simulated runoff is significantly improved compared with that of swat or with the most obvious improvement at longchuan and heyuan stations longchuan and heyuan stations are located downstream of the fsb and xfj reservoirs respectively the runoff at these two stations is directly and significantly affected by the outflow of the two reservoirs therefore the more appropriate the reservoir simulation is the more the accuracy of simulating runoff from these two stations can be improved the monthly scale simulation results are as follow 1 during the calibration period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 66 0 79 0 86 and 0 86 respectively the calculated nse are 0 61 0 75 0 85 and 0 83 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 74 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively the calculated nse are 0 72 0 81 0 87 and 0 85 respectively 2 during the validation period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 63 0 51 0 71 and 0 81 respectively the calculated nse are 0 51 0 37 0 70 and 0 71 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 65 0 72 0 84 and 0 85 respectively the calculated nse are 0 64 0 67 0 84 and 0 82 respectively for longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations the r 2 of swat m is 0 08 0 02 0 02 and 0 05 higher than swat or on the monthly simulation during the calibration period while the nse is 0 11 0 06 0 02 and 0 02 higher respectively on the monthly runoff simulations for the validation period the r 2 of swat m is 0 02 0 21 0 13 and 0 04 higher than that of swat or the nse is 0 13 0 30 0 14 and 0 11 higher respectively during the validation period the monthly runoff simulated by swat or at the heyuan station failed to satisfy the applicable standard the enhancement of simulated daily runoff is much more pronounced the daily scale simulation results are as follow 1 during the calibration period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 35 0 57 0 68 and 0 69 respectively the calculated nse are 0 23 0 54 0 68 and 0 64 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 61 0 63 0 72 and 0 75 respectively the calculated nse are 0 59 0 69 0 70 and 0 69 respectively 2 during the validation period the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat or are 0 14 0 13 0 45 and 0 51 respectively the calculated nse are 1 69 6 64 0 22 and 0 49 respectively the calculated r 2 when simulating the runoff of longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations using swat m are 0 41 0 57 0 63 and 0 65 respectively the calculated nse are 0 40 0 52 0 62 and 0 61 respectively for longchuan heyuan lingxia and boluo stations the r 2 of swat m is 0 26 0 06 0 04 and 0 06 higher than swat or on the daily simulation during the calibration period while the nse is 0 36 0 09 0 02 and 0 05 higher respectively on the daily runoff simulations for the validation period the r 2 of swat m is 0 27 0 44 0 18 and 0 14 higher than that of swat or the nse is 2 09 7 16 0 40 and 0 12 higher respectively on the daily scale simulation the runoff of longchuan station simulated by swat or during the calibration period could not satisfy the applicable standard during the validation period runoff simulations at three stations failed to satisfy the applicable standard longchuan heyuan and lingxia the runoff simulation curves for the stations obtained by both versions of swat are shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the simulate monthly runoff both swat or and swat m provide an appropriate result however some problems can be found in swat or first of all the simulated runoff fluctuations are sharp secondly the simulated runoff during dry season at longchuan and heyuan stations appear to be underestimated see fig 9 a and b swat or can neither provide a stable outflow pattern that can meet the requirements of the reservoirs nor can it accurately simulate the runoff downstream of the reservoir at the same time the daily runoff results of the four stations obtained by swat m and swat or are shown in fig 10 during the calibration period the daily runoff during the dry season period simulated by swat or is overestimated at longchuan station fig 10 a however those value are underestimated at heyuan lingxia and boluo see fig 10 b c and d the reservoir outflow pattern provided by swat or makes it difficult to find the appropriate basin parameters during the calibration exercise which is a problem that manifests itself in the validation period during the validation period the daily runoff series provided by swat or fluctuate frequently with larger magnitude thus seriously affecting the accuracy of swat or model as mentioned in section 4 2 the longchuan and heyuan stations are heavily influenced by reservoirs but during the dry period the runoff simulated by swat or even appears discontinuous fig 10 a and b nevertheless swat m solves these problems above swat m can provide a suitable reservoir outflow pattern which allows the model parameters to be accurately calibrated therefore swat m provides appropriate runoff series during the validation period which makes the model accuracy improved compared to swat or swat m provides appropriate flood flows and stable transitional runoff series during the dry season in general swat m is more appropriate than swat or in simulation performance swat m mainly reduces the excessive large oscillations of the runoff series in swat or and provides a suitable stable flow during the dry season 5 discussion the operational purposes of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs depend on the water storage level and the season hence simulating reservoir storage and outflows using a fixed set of target storage values e g the specific storage method in the original swat model which simulates human control in the absence of measurement data is challenging therefore we proposed a new reservoir module based on the reservoir operation chart and applied the method to the three largest reservoirs in the dongjiang basin changes in the downstream runoff occur because reservoir outflows vary for different reservoir modules as a result the sensitivity of the model parameters may change requiring a sensitivity analysis of swat or and swat m model parameters daily and monthly runoff simulations were conducted for four hydrological stations on the mainstream using swat or and swat m to evaluate the performance of the proposed reservoir module there are three main parameters that affect the reservoir outflow curve res psa res k and ndtarg the meaning of the ndtarg is the same as the nd targ in eq 5 since it directly affects eq 5 and according to the sensitivity analysis the ndtarg affects the reservoir curve the most to better fit the reservoir outflow curve the ndtarg was calibrated in the swat cup on the monthly scale the nd targ of the fsb xfj and bpz reservoirs are 51 6 and 34 using swat or 85 93 and 99 using swat m on the daily scale the nd targ for the three reservoirs above are 20 81 and 117 using swat or 109 105 and 136 using swat m respectively the difference in nd targ between the same model at the daily and monthly scales is due to the fact that the nd targ has no longer physically meaningful in the calibration work wu and chen 2012 moreover this value can vary with season year and operational purpose the nse obtained from the target release method table 2 shows that swat or did not provide accurate estimates on the monthly and daily scale for hydrological stations directly influenced by large reservoirs suggesting this method is unsuitable for large reservoirs with multiple regulations swat or amplifies the sensitivity of the nd targ to simulated watershed runoff making its simulated runoff series inappropriately deviated during the validation period swat m serves to provide a suitable reservoir outflow pattern making the sensitivity of nd targ to simulated watershed runoff reach an appropriate position the model stands up to the examination and the applicability is ensured a major advantage of the reservoir operation chart based reservoir module in swat m is that no additional indeterminate parameters are required eq 5 was used to calculate the reservoir outflow for the other storage levels the minimum outflows of the fsb xfj and bpz reservoirs were 30 m3 s 60 m3 s and 10 m3 s according to the dongjiang three reservoirs water supply dispatch scheme those reservoir outflows ensured that the minimum water supply was maintained downstream the new reservoir module provides more realistic runoff values in the flood period and ensures consistent reservoir outflow during the dry season however the model lacks flexibility because the reservoir outflow equation adopted in this study uses a fixed power generation coefficient within a given storage range whereas the actual power generation coefficient may fluctuate it remains a challenge to describe the dynamics of regulated runoff due to the rapid development of joint operations in reservoir systems uncertainties arise from various datasets operating platforms and the limitations of the reservoir outflow model ma et al 2022 liu et al 2019 6 conclusion the target release reservoir module in the original swat model has limitations for simulating large reservoir outflow due to diverse scheduling objectives in the operation of large reservoirs we proposed a reservoir operation chart based reservoir module for swat and used it to simulate the reservoir outflow of the three largest reservoirs in the dongjiang river basin the primary conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 swat m has higher reliability in application the implementation of the calibrated watershed related parameters in the simulation prediction work is trustworthy the improved model is more consistent with reality in terms of parameter sensitivity analysis 2 swat m exhibited better performance than swat or for simulating the reservoir level and outflow the water level of the xfj reservoir predicted by swat m was closer to the measured water level than that of swat or the simulated outflow of the three large reservoirs was more stable and accurate 3 swat m achieved higher runoff simulation accuracy than swat or for the four hydrological stations particularly for stations directly influenced by large reservoirs the improved accuracy of the runoff predicted downstream of the reservoirs indicates the superiority of the proposed new reservoir module swat m was less prone than swat or to runoff underestimation in dry periods and runoff simulated by swat or fluctuate frequently with larger magnitude the reservoir operation chart based reservoir scheme considers multiple objectives of large reservoirs so that a dynamic decision based outflow framework can be established the new reservoir module substantially improved the ability of swat to predict the outflow and water level of multipurpose reservoirs thus the proposed method has the potential to improve the applicability of swat in large reservoir regulation areas

2557,the accurate representation of the load of water quality constituents transported by rivers and streams is crucial to understand the impact on the quality of the lakes the behavior of the rivers and streams statistical models have been developed to predict the water quality constituent loads from the available data of sampled concentration low frequency grab chemistry data and continuous discharge high frequency at a particular sampled location and to further analyze trends and changes in water quality however the performance of statistical models to estimate water quality constituent loads depends on many aspects including the type of water quality constituent sampling strategy and frequency and the land use and areas of the watershed this study evaluates the performance of a wide range of statistical models for the estimation of total suspended solids tss and total phosphorus tp loads under various sampling scenarios and monitoring stations in southern ontario canada trends in tss and tp concentrations and loads were further analyzed in major tributaries the weighted regression on time discharge and season kalman filter wrtds k model was found to be the most suitable model p 0 05 and percentage difference pdiff between 20 for predicting tss loads at most sampling stations and under most sampling scenarios while the weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds model was found to be the most suitable model p 0 05 and flux bias statistics fbs between 0 1 for predicting tp loads the applied statistical models loadest simple and curvilinear models wrtds wrtds k beale s estimator composite and interpolation models have shown a limited potential to estimate load accurately at monitoring stations covering small drainage areas keywords total suspended solids total phosphorus regression load estimation discharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction degraded water quality is of growing concern worldwide with major implications on the health of rivers and downstream water bodies such as estuaries and lakes zhang et al 2019 in particular excess water quality constituents e g phosphorus nitrogen loading from upland watersheds to lakes dynamically from sources such as agricultural fields septic systems acts as one of the reasons for the eutrophication nutrient enrichment which is the point of concern schindler 1977 michalak et al 2013 estepp and reavie 2015 munawar and fitzpatrick 2018 malone and newton 2020 because eutrophication can influence the level of algal blooms that are considered to be very harmful michalak et al 2013 steffen et al 2014 higgins et al 2008 and can further lead to hypoxic conditions in lakes scavia et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 excessive phosphorus inputs from point sources i e wastewater treatment plants and industries and non point sources i e runoff from urban and agricultural areas to streams rivers and lakes are the main drivers to eutrophication carpenter 1998 sharpley and tunney 2000 meanwhile phosphorus p sometimes referred to as total phosphorus tp is primarily available in two forms particulate and soluble forms particulate phosphorus is usually tied to soil particles and is conveyed with soil particles to the rivers by soil and wind erosion soluble or dissolved phosphorus dp soluble reactive phosphorus is a subset of dp is largely bioavailable depends on its relative availability to particulate phosphorus to plants that may accelerate algae growth omecc 2018 in addition to phosphorus sediments also affect water quality total suspended solids tss and suspended sediment concentration ssc are the most commonly used terms in the literatures describing the solid portions of the concentration suspended in a mixture of water it is also very common for sediment in the water to be assessed based on water clarity using measures such as turbidity sediment generation is significantly influenced by the land use type and is conveyed majorly from agricultural landscapes through soil and wind erosion alike phosphorus therefore analysis of the concentration of phosphorus and sediments in water bodies e g streams lakes is considered to be vital to evaluate the overall water quality to be precise this information is essential in understandingthe quality of lakes the behavior of upstream water bodies e g streams rivers and the role of different sourceareas i e point and non point sources zhang et al 2019 moreover correct load predictions are usually required for cost effective progress and assessment of water quality monitoring projects ator et al 2011 bowes et al 2008 linker et al 2013 shenk and linker 2013 zhang et al 2015 so we need a tool to estimate the loads from the available data of sampled concentration and continuous discharge at a particular sampled location severalstatistical models can serve the purpose simple models include uncomplicated aggregation interpolation among the sampled concentrations and ratio estimators with time or flow based stratification to obtain total loads in addition there are various regression models i e simple and multiple linear regression which are intended to mainly focus on the patterns of correlation between discharge and concentration cohn et al 1989 ferguson 1987 the weighted regression model is also a type of regression model but is projected to be a flexible and robust model compared to simple and multiple linear regression that considers many strict assumptions for model formation hirsch et al 2010 in particular several advancements have been made concerning the regression models with the development of more robust models based on the adjustments for local deviations from the residuals including the composite model and the weighted regression in time discharge and season kalman filter model wrtds k aulenbach and hooper 2006 verma et al 2012 zhang and hirsch 2019 however the estimation bias systematic error of these models depends on many aspects including the type of nutrients e g sediment and phosphorus and form of constituent dissolved or total record period length the correlation between discharge and concentration watershed area and the sampling type and frequency worrall et al 2013 littlewood and marsh 2005 williams et al 2015 moatar et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 robertson 1999a b keeping these points in mind various statistical models have been used to estimate water quality loads sediment phosphorus nitrogen and other nutrients across southern ontario conditions in the past few decades a few selected studies are listed below in table 1 however since the performance of statistical models to estimate water quality loads depends on many aspects including the type of water quality constituent the sampling type and frequency considered and the watershed area it is very tough to make a choice of a particular statistical model among all for accurate load estimation this study therefore evaluates statistical models for predicting tss and tp loads considering various sampling scenarios and sampling stations with variable drainage areas therefore the specific objectives of the study are 1 1 objectives to estimate the total suspended solids and total phosphorus load using widely used statistical models to evaluate the performance of various statistical models to predict loads under widely ranged aspects including 1 sampling scenarios and low sampling frequencies 2 sampling stations with variable drainage areas thus the novelty or significance of this manuscript within the existing literature is the assessing of the differences in the used models due to sampling scenarios and drainage areas 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area included three dominant basins located in southern ontario canada the basins are northern lake erie eastern lake huron and lake ontario and niagara peninsula northern lake erie basin is located in southern ontario and is mainly dominated by agricultural row crops land use comprising 60 8 of total land use table 2 with a drainage area of around 22 647 km2 a major portion of the northern lake erie basin drains into lake erie while some portion along thames river within the basin drains into lake st clair and then to lake erie eastern lake huron basin is located in south western ontario and covers a drainage area of around 15 000 km2 and drains majorly into lake huron and some parts of georgian bay eastern lake huron basin is also an agriculture dominated watershed with 42 8 of the total land use for agricultural activities lake ontario and niagara peninsula basin is located in south east ontario and comprised mainly of forests covering 40 of the total land use lake ontario and niagara peninsula watershed has the largest drainage area among the selected basins covering a drainage area of around 28 500 km2 and draining into lake ontario 2 2 data this study mainly focused on analyzing two water quality constituents that have a considerable relationship with streamflow i e total suspended solids and total phosphorus as well as with each other flow and total suspended solids data were obtained from the hydrometric database hydat operated by the water survey of canada under the environment and climate change canada the data is published in hydat https wateroffice ec gc ca search historical e html database and includes daily and monthly mean streamflow water level and tss concentration for over 2500 active and 5500 discontinued monitoring stations for a period between 1965 and 2018 across ontario fourteen tss sampling stations were selected for the study based on spatio temporal coverage and available dataset the tss dataset contains a maximum monitoring duration of 29 years humber river at elder mills and a minimum monitoring duration of three years south maitland river at summerhill with an average monitoring duration of ten years table 4 tp data were obtained from the provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn database https www ontario ca environment and energy map provincial stream water quality monitoring network ten tp stations were selected for the study based on the availability of the dataset table 4 and fig 1 the monitoring stations are distributed across all three watersheds with variable drainage areas fig 1 streamflow and tss were monitored at the same location for all fourteen sampling stations both the water quality constituents were analyzed using two different sampling approaches tss monitoring includes samples collected daily while tp monitoring was not daily but was done more frequently https uwaterloo ca water institute research issue 2 feature long term phosphorus concentration trends ontario streams more frequently means an irregular monitoring frequency that is more than monthly but less than daily as two different authorities monitored streamflow and water quality constituents distinctly monitoring of streamflow and water quality were not measured at the same location for many monitoring stations in ontario as four tp stations humber river at old mill road grand river at bridge port ausable river near park hill and thames river at jacobs road did not have concurrent streamflow stations streamflow for these stations was estimated from the nearest streamflow monitoring stations using a drainage area weightage method developed by hirsch 1979 the details have been provided in supplementary section s1 1 see table 3 3 materials and method supplementary section 1 describes the flow estimation for the ungauged sites coefficient of variation cv and richards baker r b flashiness index statistics for all tss tp monitoring stations the rest of the methodology has been presented below 3 1 statistical models formation 3 1 1 beale s ratio estimator interpolation and composite models 3 1 1 1 beale s ratio estimator beale 1962 first introduced this class of mathematical load estimation model the ratio based load estimation model beale s ratio estimator has been used primarily for load estimation at the great lakes contributing sites the ratio estimator model is an effective mathematical tool for calculating pollutant load from continuous flow data and infrequent concentration data meals et al 2013 ratio estimators consider that a positive correlation exists between the concentration and the flow on sampled days the daily load is measured as the sum of the sampled concentration and the daily mean streamflow on sampled days and the mean load is also computed over the year the average daily load is further multiplied by a flow ratio determined by dividing the average flow over the entire duration by the average flow over the sampled days the equation further incorporates a bias correction factor to take into account the effects of the association between load and discharge the daily mean load is then multiplied by the number of days in a year to get the annual load if there is a great deal of variability in flow levels over the monitoring period accuracy can be improved by stratifying the full data set based on discharge in the case of estimating loads based on a stratified model i e for distinct seasons and months ratio estimators are generally applied by dividing the sampled concentration data into multiple strata strata can be characterized based on time or discharge conditions upon selection of strata the beale ratio estimator of a selected stratum is obtained by 1 l a l o q a q o 1 1 n 1 n s l q l o q o 1 1 n 1 n s q q q o 2 where l a total load of the stratum l o sample mean load of the stratum q o sample mean streamflow of the stratum q a mean streamflow of the stratum n number of sampled days in the stratum n total number of days in the stratum including sampled and unsampled days slq covariance between sample load and sample streamflow of the stratum i o q o product of sample mean load and sample mean streamflow of the stratum sqq sample variance of streamflow within the stratum q o 2 square of the sample mean streamflow of the stratum an estimate of the total load of the strata is obtained as the product of beale s ratio estimate for the stratum multiplied by the total number of days within the stratum the sum of load estimates for all strata gives the estimate of the total load over the predictive period of all days beale s ratio estimator normally employs discrete samples and streamflow data solely from the year for which the loads are to be estimated lee et al 2016 ratio estimators usually use the average daily flow to calculate loads and are thus better suited to monitoring programs with adequate flow information but with relatively minimal concentration information dolan et al 1981 3 1 1 2 interpolation models the interpolation model included in the study was one of the simplest models for water quality load sediment phosphorus nitrogen and other nutrients estimation interpolation can be called a simple model as it requires only a dependent variable i e water quality concentration for the load computations unlike regression models that require one or more independent variables e g streamflow and time the first and simplest model demonstrated here is the interpolation model the interpolation model predicts daily missing concentration values by performing a simple interpolation among the series of sampled concentrations the interpolated daily concentration value is further multiplied by the daily streamflow for that particular day and a unit conversion factor to generate a unit daily load unit daily loads are generated for a series of interpolated concentration values and then summed to obtain annual loads lee et al 2016 interpolation models have been used in different ways in several studies of solute and sediment fluxes buso et al 2000 vanni et al 2001 interpolation models are usually recommended when regression models are unacceptable i e owing to a shortage of data or because the correlation between independent variables and the concentrations is very weak in particular an interpolation model might be appropriate if the measured concentrations are sufficiently available at frequent intervals that each set of subsequent concentrations is indicative of the concentrations in the time between them webb et al 1997 robertson 1999a b 3 1 1 3 composite models the composite model is another model based on the error correction of load estimates using residual departures the composite model generates residuals using one of the nine regression models from the loadest models the composite model further uses a piecewise interpolation among these residuals based on the trends and patterns the composite model was built using the loadflex package in r appling et al 2015 for this study residuals from loadest model 9 seven parameter model were used for the development of a composite model as the seven parameter model has been extensively implemented in literature for tss and tp load estimates 3 1 2 loadest models simple and multiple linear regression the process of load estimation is aggravated by non normality retransformation bias and data censoring instantaneous load estimates using the ordinary least squares regression ols model are generally biased load predictions might underestimate true loads by 50 percent ferguson 1986 retransformation bias is taken into account by incorporating a bias correction factor to estimate load data censoring arises when many samples included in the model formation possess constituent concentrations below the laboratory detection level gilbert 1987 the assumption that the model residuals are normally distributed is another complication of the ols regression loadest uses three different models for the load estimation due to these complications maximum likelihood estimate mle least absolute deviation lad and adjusted maximum likelihood estimate amle the model coefficients can be determined using the maximum likelihood test as a substitute to ols regression when censored data is used in the calibration data mle implementation is also classified as tobit regression with an assumption that residuals are normally distributed and constant variance helsel and hirsch 1992 if the calibration data is uncensored bradu and mundlak 1970 bias correction factor generates loads using a minimum variance unbiased estimate mvue cohn et al 1989 2 l lad exp a 0 j 1 m a j x j g m m s 2 v where l muve is the instantaneous load generated using mle s2 is the residual variance m is the degrees of freedom and v is an independent variable function cohn et al 1989 adjusted maximum likelihood estimation eliminates the first order bias in the model which generally occurs in the mle load estimation for censored data using the calculation specified in shenton and bowman 1977 when calibration data has uncensored observations the amle load predictions are the same as mle load predictions cohn et al 1992 an estimate of instantaneous load for censored data using amle approach is given by 3 l lad exp a 0 j 1 m a j x j h a b s 2 α κ where l amle is the instantaneous load generated using amle s2 is the residual variance a and b are independent variables function cohn et al 1992 and α and κ are the parameters of the gamma distribution all of the previously described approaches to regression ols amle and mle consider that the residuals are distributed normally and that they vary constantly if model residuals are not in agreement with the above assumption alternative strategies can be applied loadest considers such models as the least absolute deviation lad model lad model coefficients are established using powell 1984 regression model as introduced by buchinsky 1998 given the coefficients of the model predictions of instantaneous load are formed using duan 1983 smearing approach 4 l lad exp a 0 j 1 m a j x j k 1 n e x p e k n where l lad is the lad instantaneous load e is the model error a0 and aj are the model coefficients and n is the total number of uncensored observations loadest model provides 11 regression models eqs 5 to 15 and one of the models that hold a strong correlation between streamflow and concentration can be applied to predict instantaneous constituent loads models 1 to 9 eqs 5 to 13 are applicable to predict pollutant loads for unsampled dates missing data and models 10 and 11 are applicable to predict pollutant loads for specific intervals model 1 and 2 eqs 5 and 6 are regression equations that take into consideration only discharge as the explanatory variable that can be relevant to the high correlation between discharge and water quality constituent kim et al 2018 model 3 9 eqs 7 to 13 includes time seasonal and

season wrtds is an improvised regression model that is based on weighted regression over time discharge and season wrtds model was formed using the exploration and graphics for river trends egret

the time domain σi is denoted as the conditional standard deviation of model error zi is denoted as standardized residual on the ith day zhang and hirsch 2019 structurally wrtds constructs one regression model that predicts concentration and load on every single day of the record for the defined date season and discharge of the prediction wrtds screens the complete concentration data record and chooses concentration samples that are fairly near to the predicted day related to the date streamflow and season the selected samples are further used to construct a weighted regression model using eq 16 and it creates a series of model coefficients computed model coefficients are then used to predict the logarithm of concentration for the prediction day by using values of time and streamflow logarithms of concentration are further transformed into arithmetic space by incorporating a bias correction factor as mentioned in zhang and hirsch 2019 17 e c i exp β 0 i β 1 i ln q i β 2

season with kalman filtering wrtds k is one of the error correction models based on residual departures wrtds k model generates standardized residuals using the load predictions from the developed wrtds model wrtds k model considers these standardized residuals to have an ar1 serial correlation structure with a lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ ranging between 0 1 based on the study done by zhang and hirsch 2019 they found the optimal lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ between 0 85 and 0 95 for total suspended solids and total phosphorus over various sampling scenarios based on this consideration lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ of 0 90 was used in this study for the development of wrtds k model the number of monte carlo replicate was kept to 50 numbers for the development of wrtds k model considering the computational timing load estimates using wrtds k model were done using the extended code for wrtds k model developed by zhang and hirsch 2019 wrtds k is a modification of the standard wrtds model to predict concentration based on time streamflow and season first the model uses the observed concentration record to create a standard wrtds model second the model further computes the residuals in the log space on sampled observations 19 r i ln c i β 0 i β 1 i ln q i β 2 i t i β 3 i sin 2 π t i β 4 i cos 2 π t i these residuals are considered as model error and they are interpreted as the difference between observed ln c and estimated ln c finally standardized residuals are generated by dividing the residuals to the standard deviation specific for the day zhang and hirsch 2019 20 z i r i σ i wrtds k model considers that these standardized residuals possess an ar1 serial correlation structure that has a lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ ranging between 0 1 wrtds k splits the entire dataset into non overlapping gap intervals depending on the days of observation for a gap time say that day 1 is the last observation before the gap and day n is the first observation after the gap so for this gap interval there are n 2 days that wrtds k will estimate for owing to the complication of the model e g log transformed data and timely changing model coefficients the predicted value for each of the unsampled day is calculated using a monte carlo simulation using many replicates user defined with each replication the model produces a missing time series it produces values c2 c3 c4 cn 3 cn 2 cn 1 based on predetermined values of c1 and cn the coefficients of the eq 19 and the estimation of σ at each time step of the gap period the key equation for generating standardized residuals is centered on the ar1 recursive relationship procedure using the wrtds k model 21 z k 1 ρ z k 1 ρ 2 e k where ek is denoted as independent standard normal random variable on estimation day z1 n is the standardized residuals on the estimation day when the value ρ is near to 0 the predicted values are built solely on ek the predicted values are entirely based on zk i e standardized residuals when the value of ρ in near to 1 the above procedure is repeated for each gap in the dataset the above procedure is designed in such a manner that all the z values that will include all values generated by the data and all values produced in between has a lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ generated z values for estimation days are again transformed into real space as 22 e c i exp β 0 i β 1 i ln q i β 2 i t i β 3 i sin 2 π t i β 4 i cos 2 π t i σ i z i the process referred to above is replicated m number of times and the expected concentration value for each ith day is calculated using the average of the m replicates of ci which would be the expected concentration value for ith day c i on the sampled days the concentration estimates are the same as the observed value to test the accuracy and precision of various statistical models and to further analyze the performance of statistical models under various sampling frequencies and sampling stations a design of a subsampling approach was developed for the tss and tp monitoring data at all monitoring stations and sampling scenarios fig 2 provides an overview of the design of the sub sampling approach for both water quality constituents i e tss and tp and they are also discussed in the following section 3 2 sampling and subsampling experiment three sampling scenarios were developed for all tss sampling stations as a sufficient dataset in the case of tss were available at a daily time step for longer monitoring periods sampling types included systematic random and stratified sampling systematic subsampling includes taking a dense dataset and separating it into subsamples of the same length systematic subsampling scenarios included in this study were weekly bi weekly monthly and bi monthly table 5 the weekly subsampling strategy refers to taking a sample every consecutive week from the dataset weekly subsampling is designed in such a way that there exists a gap of at least seven days from the successive sample to meet the assumptions of systematic sampling for this subsampling experiment seven subsets were created under weekly subsampling to test the accuracy and precision over repetitive subsets and which could include higher variability and temporal coverage from the whole dataset table 5 the bi weekly subsampling scenario includes taking a sample every two weeks from the dataset similar to the weekly subsampling strategy there exists a gap of at least 14 days from the successive sample for the bi weekly sampling strategy for this subsampling experiment 14 subsets were created under a bi weekly subsampling strategy table 5 the monthly sampling strategy includes taking a sample each month from the dataset similar to the bi weekly subsampling strategy there exists a gap of at least 30 days from the successive sample for the monthly sampling strategy for this subsampling experiment 29 subsets were created under the monthly subsampling strategy table 5 bi monthly sampling strategy includes taking a sample every two months from the dataset under the monthly subsampling strategy there exists a gap of at least 60 days from the successive sample for bi monthly sampling strategy for this subsampling experiment 16 subsets were created table 5 in the case of the random subsampling scenario 12 subsamples were randomly selected per calendar year within the monitoring window to form a single subset this procedure was repeated ten times to generate 10 subsets for the analysis however it is important to elucidate that 12 subsamples drawn from each calendar year were equally weighted across the months this states that each month had an equal probability of being subsampled however the subsample within each month was selected on a random basis such a subsampling scenario would better represent the actual sampling conditions currently being implemented by many of the conservation authorities under the pwqmn while in the case of the stratified subsampling approach three high flow samples were drawn in addition to the random subsampling scenario which resulted in 15 samples per calendar year high flow subsamples were drawn based on the consideration of richards 1998 for separating the storm events above 80 percentile streamflow values for the tributaries of great lakes a stratified sampling strategy helps to assess whether the accuracy of load estimates is improved by purposely targeting high flow conditions for the water quality constituents however it is vital to know that this type of sampling is only feasible when the timing and extent of high streamflow occurrences are priorly understood and so is an idealized situation that is difficult to mimic in reality in the case of tp monitoring stations systematic subsampling was not possible as tp datasets were not available at frequent intervals such as a daily time step supplementary section 7 2 for example the number of tp samples per month on average for all sampling stations ranged between 2 and 30 based on the available tp dataset a random subsampling experiment can be developed four scenarios were developed for the random subsampling experiment scenario 1 4 samples per month scenario 2 2 samples per month scenario 3 1 sample per month and scenario 4 1 sample per two months these scenarios were slightly comparable to all four systematic subsampling scenarios i e weekly bi weekly monthly and bi monthly based on the number of samples drawn from each month however the samples drawn from the month were based on a random basis as samples were taken at irregular intervals for all sampling stations most of the random sampling subsets were easily subsampled as enough sampled observations were available to meet the criteria however in the case of random scenario 1 when the number of sampled observations in a month was not enough to meet the criteria of four samples per month all sampled observations were drawn for that particular month five subsets were developed for each random scenario generating a total of 20 subsets all four random scenarios will be referred to as the four systematic scenarios to better interpret the results for tss and tp random scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 will be referred to as weekly bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios respectively 3 3 evaluation of statistical models the annual load was considered for the evaluation of statistical models at all sampling stations and sampling scenarios the annual load is a summation of multiple unit loads over a year a unit daily load was selected in this study as observations of streamflow and tss were frequently available at a daily timestep so the annual load is a summation of all n daily unit loads and is equated as 23 a n n u a l l o a d i 1 n k c i q i where ci is the tss concentration in mg l of the ith observation qi is the daily streamflow in m3 s of the ith observation k is the unit conversion factor to loads n is the total number of days in a year the value of k is taken as 86 40 unit conversion factor when the concentration unit is mg l and the streamflow unit is m3 s and the load unit is kg day 4 evaluation criteria 4 1 evaluation criteria for tss load estimates the accuracy and precision of various statistical models were evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and modified percentage bias pbias as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 the modified percentage bias was considered as a primary evaluator and nse was considered a secondary evaluator in this study the details of nse and modified percentage bias has been presented in supplementary section 2 accuracy and precision in load estimates of all the statistical models are shown using box plots accuracy was tested using the percentage difference pdiff values based on the central tendency using the median value on the boxplot a median value near zero suggests good enough accuracy in load estimates similarly precision was tested for the pdiff values ranging between the first quartile q1 and the third quartile q3 of the boxplot the first quartile and third quartile range together will be referred to hereby as an inter quartile range in the case of pdiff values inter quartile range values of the boxplot between 20 were considered acceptable precision for statistical models acceptable pdiff values are further shown in fig 3 a 4 2 evaluation criteria for tp load estimates tp load estimates for all the statistical models were evaluated based on the total load over the sampling window for all sampled observations as the number of samples was not available at the daily time step as in the case of tss samples hence generating annual loads was not feasible in this case total load over a whole monitoring period was considered in this study the total load over a given monitoring window is the summation of individual unit loads on sampled days the total tp load calculation is described in supplementary section 2 two performance evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the load estimates for all the statistical models nse and flux bias statistics fbs the description and acceptance criteria of nse is explained in supplementary section 2 fbs is a dimensionless depiction of the relative difference between the summation of the estimated loads including all sampled days and the summation of the loads including all sampled days hirsch 2014 fbs is computed as 24 f b s p m o p m where 25 o i 1 n l i i 1 n k c i q i 26 p m i 1 n l i i 1 n k c i q i where li is the observed load in kg day on the ith sampled day ci is observed concentration in mg l on ith sampled day qi is observed streamflow in m3 s on the ith sampled day l i is the estimated load in kg day on the ith sampled day ĉi is estimated concentration in mg l on the ith sampled day k is the unit conversion factor to loads n is the total number of samples in the sampling window the value of k is taken as 86 40 the unit conversion factor when the concentration unit is mg l and streamflow unit is m3 s and the load unit is kg day hirsch 2014 developed a monte carlo subsampling approach to analyze if the fbs was a good indicator of the true bias which is only possible when samples are taken every day he described that fbs can be a good indicator to analyze the potential bias problem when the true load for all days in the sampling window is not available the values of fbs near zero signify that the model is showing unbiased load estimates while a positive fbs value shows a positive bias and a negative fbs value shows a negative bias the author suggested the acceptable range of fbs to be between 0 1 to 0 1 which is generally equivalent to 10 of the true bias hirsch 2014 computations of the fbs values were generated with a substantial number of observations ranging between 400 and 1500 samples over 10 to 20 years of monitoring window across all selected tp sampling stations accuracy and precision in load estimates of all the statistical models are shown using box plots accuracy was tested using the fbs values based on the central tendency using the median value on the boxplot a median value near zero suggests good enough accuracy in load estimates similarly precision was tested for the fbs values ranging between the first quartile q1 and the third quartile q3 of the boxplot the first quartile and third quartile range together will be referred to hereby as an inter quartile range in the case of fbs inter quartile range values of the boxplot between 0 1 were considered as acceptable precision for statistical models acceptable fbs values are further shown in fig 3 b 4 3 t test for load estimates a t test on independent groups was further performed to analyze the load estimates among the statistical models for both tss and tp kim 2015 a t test was performed to compare the results of load estimates from statistical models to that of observed loads comparison of load estimates between the statistical models and comparison of load estimates of statistical models under all sampling scenarios the significance level α was selected as 0 05 27 μ 1 μ 2 0 h 0 28 μ 1 μ 2 0 h a where h0 represents the null hypothesis and ha represents the alternate hypothesis the difference between the individual groups was considered to be statistically significant when the computed p value was smaller than the significance level α similarly the difference between the individual groups was considered to be statistically not significant when the computed p value was greater than the significance level α 4 4 uncertainty analysis of water quality load estimation the codes of statistical models provide standard error se estimates on prediction supplementary section 5 these measures help in getting a qualitative and quantitative idea of the uncertainties however the assumptions for se are not uniform for the models hirsch 2014 for example se remains virtually constant across all the days on the other hand se varies as a function of discharge year and seasons in wrtds model hirsch 2014 therefore it is not possible to compare the uncertainties of the models in the same platform using se estimates therefore to have a clear idea about prediction uncertainties we analyze uncertainties from all sources collectively using the quantile regression technique a stochastic approach koenker and bassett 1978 the statistical models simulations have been considered for uncertainty analysis the details of the process have been discussed in supplementary section 6 5 results and discussion we have provided the details of the selected models structure with benchmark references in the methodology section section 3 the models are well known and widely used all over the world in spite of that we did the validity check of the models with leave one out cross validation approach supplementary section 4 the leave one out cross validation results figs s3 a f and s4 a d show the validity of the models up to a satisfactory level with cross validation error rate cver closer to zero avila et al 2018 besides we have mentioned and discussed the accuracy and precision of the results in the following sections as these are critical in the evaluation of regression models and the effect of sampling scenarios because accuracy indicates the degree of systematic error and precision indicates the degree of dispersion the details of the results and related discussion on analysis are provided below 5 1 total suspended solid tss 5 1 1 evaluation of the performance of the models in all cases under all sampling scenarios and sampling stations with different drainage areas wrtds k wrtds linear loadest models i e l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 and the composite models displayed satisfactory tss load estimates fig 4 and table 6 while simple models i e interpolation and beale ratio model and curved linear loadest models i e l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed unsatisfactory tss load estimates fig 4 and table 6 over many instances based on evaluation criteria i e pdiff statistics and nse statistics section 4 1 and statistical analysis section 4 3 these results are not surprising given differences among the sampling scenarios poor sampling coverage fig s9 drainage areas and the large number of model configurations that were considered despite this there were some clear patterns in the results to be precise load estimates of the wrtds k model were within 20 of the observed loads for most instances i e good accuracy and precision an inter quartile range of pdiff values ranging between 19 21 to 19 57 with a median pdiff value of 2 79 and highest median nse value of 0 64 among all statistical models fig 4 furthermore statistical analysis results were also confirming that wrtds k model displayed significantly different load estimates over fewer instances around 31 table 6 in contrast wrtds model showed better accuracy with a median pdiff value of 2 43 but it also showed low precision with inter quartile pdiff values ranging from 27 72 to 16 07 which indicated that the model tended to overestimate the observed loads for some instances fig 4 statistical analysis further revealed wrtds model as the second lowest significantly different load estimates of around 33 table 6 meanwhile loadest models that included linear streamflow terms i e l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 displayed similar patterns in load estimates this was evident with the statistical analysis with statistically not significant p 0 05 load estimates supplementary section 3 table s5 the models displayed modest variability in load estimates satisfactory accuracy with median pdiff values ranging between 7 14 to 10 61 while displaying low precision with an inter quartile range of pdiff values ranging between 12 82 to 29 16 and median nse values ranging from 0 60 to 0 62 fig 4 similarly loadest models that included additional quadratic streamflow terms i e l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed similar patterns in load estimates while statistical analysis exhibited that l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 models displayed no significant differences p 0 05 in load estimates supplementary section 3 table s5 the models displayed significant variability in load estimates with potential overestimation of observed loads for most instances good accuracy with median pdiff values ranging between 1 96 and 6 71 unsatisfactory precision with an inter quartile range pdiff values ranging between 41 86 to 18 53 and median nse values ranging from 0 55 to 0 58 fig 4 moreover the composite model showed low precision i e it underestimated the observed loads over many instances satisfactory accuracy with a median pdiff value of 10 47 an inter quartile pdiff values ranging between 14 49 to 28 89 and highly variable nse values ranging from 0 29 to 0 74 fig 4 these findings were quite consistent based on statistical analysis as load estimates were substantially different over 44 of instances for the composite model table 6 on the other hand simple statistical models i e beale ratio median pdiff value of 22 35 and an inter quartile range pdiff values ranging between 14 01 to 51 84 and interpolation median pdiff value of 36 and an inter quartile range pdiff values ranging between 11 8 to 59 01 showed unsatisfactory load estimates based on accuracy and precision fig 4 statistical analysis also displayed that load estimates of the interpolation model were significantly different from that of other statistical models p 0 05 for all instances supplementary section 3 table s5 5 1 2 effect of sampling coverage sampling scenarios and drainage area of monitoring stations an evaluation of sampling coverage over the entire range of the probability of exceedance of the flow duration curve was conducted the results indicate there was poor sampling coverage for the high flow at all the gauging stations fig s9 a n though ausable river near springbank big creek near walsingham and big otter creek near calton have better sampling coverage for high flow figs s9 a c as a consequence loading estimate gets hampered as high flows can potentially deliver substantial loads walling and webb 1981 ferguson 1987 preston et al 1989 kuhnert et al 2012 lee et al 2016 in addition sampling coverage is poor for all flow types at saugeen river near port elgin south maitland river at summerhill and thames river at thamesville therefore we have delved deeply to evaluate the models at different gauging stations in advance of analysis for different sampling scenarios fig 5 results at each sampling station are shown using the threshold percentage fig 6 and statistical analysis table s3 threshold percentage refers to the number of times the load estimates of the statistical models were within 20 of the observed loads at a particular station statistical analysis refers to the t test to compare the mean observed load to the mean estimated loads of statistical models it is evident that there was significant variability in the results based on the load estimates among the sampling stations in particular the performance of all models was unsatisfactory at sturgeon creek and south maitland river stations with a threshold percentage below 30 fig 6 this was consistent with the statistical analysis which indicated that load estimates of most statistical models were significantly different p 0 05 compared to the observed loads at these two stations table s3 wrtds k performed slightly better than other statistical models at canagagigue creek and humber river stations with a threshold percentage of around 45 and the statistical analysis further indicated that load estimates were statistically not significant p 0 05 table s3 however based on the findings load estimates of l 2 and l 5 wrtds and wrtds k models at ausable river station were satisfactory as load estimates were not statistically different p 0 05 table s3 and these models showed a threshold percentage of about 40 60 fig 6 similarly load estimates of the most statistical models were not statistically significant p 0 05 at saugeen river thames river maitland river stations thames river at ingersoll humber river at weston big creek and big otter creek stations table s3 with high threshold percentage between 20 and 85 fig 6 hence were satisfactory in fact wrtds k was the best performing model at saugeen river thames river and maitland river stations with a threshold percentage above 50 p 0 05 on the other hand linear loadest models and wrtds k performed better than most models at credit river and big otter creek at calton stations with an overall threshold percentage of around 40 to 60 fig 6 unsatisfactory performance of all the statistical models at sturgeon creek south maitland river canagagigue creek and to some extent at humber river stations was likely due to two reasons lack of fit in the relationship of tss and streamflow and variable loading conditions while most of the sampling stations selected in this study had large drainage areas the drainage areas of sturgeon creek south maitland river canagagigue creek and humber river were relatively small ranging between 14 2 km2 to 296 km2 with a relatively smaller drainage area these stations exhibited the most variability in streamflow sturgeon creek and canagagigue creek displayed the highest streamflow variability with a cv of 2 11 and 2 07 and an r b flashiness index of 0 47 and 0 38 respectively supplementary section 1 table s1 this is evident that all the statistical models failed to capture the variability in streamflow considering the daily time step which would further lead to high variability in loads at these four sampling stations meanwhile the lack of fit in the linear relationship between streamflow and sediments at ausable river r 0 03 and south maitland river r 0 0003 stations leads to unsatisfactory performance of linear loadest models fig 6 wrtds model that does not necessarily rely on the relationship between streamflow and concentration showed less biased results as compared to loadest models particularly at ausable river station in general the performance of statistical models at saugeen river and thames river stations was majorly influenced by the sampling window while most of the sampling stations selected for this study had a long sampling window of more than 10 years these three stations had a short sampling window of fewer than five years using a frequent sampling approach at a relatively shorter time step as in the case of the weekly sampling scenario showed good results at these two stations despite a very small sampling window of fewer than five years as seen from the results the use of more frequent samples for a small sampling window generally allowed these statistical models to better understand the pattern and behavior of the tss concentration across variable streamflow conditions throughout the sampling window and with further increase in sampling interval under bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios the predictive power of these statistical models decreased as relatively fewer samples with infrequent sampling for a very small sampling window did not allow the models to understand the pattern and behavior of tss concentration across streamflow conditions in addition low to moderate variability in streamflow conditions flashiness index ranging between 0 1 and 0 3 and moderate to a high correlation between streamflow and total suspended solids correlation ranging between 0 5 and 0 72 with a longer monitoring window 10 20 years better allowed the statistical models to accurately predict the tss loads at big otter creek big creek big otter creek at calton thames river at ingersoll credit river and humber river at weston stations in general accuracy and precision in load estimates among most statistical models were heavily influenced by sampling scenarios littlewood 1995 kronvang and bruhn 1996 letcher et al 1999 lee et al 2016 in this junction fig 5 depicts the performance of all statistical models with pdiff and nse values under all six sampling scenarios thus table 7 serves as a guide to understanding how well the statistical models performed under various sampling scenarios through statistical comparison of load estimates furthermore a comparison of load estimates of statistical models under various sampling scenarios is shown in table s6 precisely the interpolation model does not take into account any relationship with streamflow and beale ratio model considers all sampled observations to generate average load so both of these models depend largely on the number of sampling observations used to construct the model lee et al 2016 when more samples were available at frequent intervals as in the case of the weekly sampling scenario both models performed better as a short interval between the observations would better allow the model to predict the load estimates by increasing the probability of including more samples that are influenced by streamflow hirsch 2014 in fact beale ratio model displayed good enough accuracy and precision in load estimates under the weekly sampling scenario however efficiency in load estimates further declined with an increase in sampling interval as it was observed that there was a monotonic decline in the precision of load estimates with pdiff values extending up to 50 of the observed loads however the interpolation model displayed unsatisfactory load estimates under all sampling scenarios and further displayed that predictive power in load estimates declined with an increase in the sampling interval these findings were consistent with the statistical analysis and nse statistics as load estimates of the interpolation model were significantly different over more than 50 of instances under all sampling scenarios table 7 and showed a consistent decrease in nse values with an increase in the sampling interval fig 5 statistical comparison for these two models showed similarities with both the models showing significant differences in load estimates when compared under most of the sampling scenarios p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s6 to be precise loadest models were less influenced by the type of sampling scenarios considered particularly for longer sampling periods these considerations were evident from the results as l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 models that included linear streamflow terms performed better under all sampling scenarios fig 5 supplementary section 3 table s6 unsatisfactory performance of curved linear loadest l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 models was primarily due to no apparent curvature in the relationship between streamflow and tss for various scenarios which limited the potential to predict accurate and precise load estimates in quadratic models fritz 2014 on the other hand the wrtds k model displayed accurate and precise load estimates under weekly bi weekly and stratified sampling scenarios with pdiff values between 20 of the observed loads for most instances while under bi monthly and random sampling scenarios the wrtds k model showed a modest decrease in precision with pdiff values exceeding the acceptable 20 percent criteria these findings were very consistent based on nse values and statistical analysis which indicated that the wrtds k model displayed higher median nse value under weekly bi weekly and stratified sampling and further load estimates under these three sampling scenarios were significantly different over less than 25 instances table 7 statistical analysis also showed that the load estimates of the wrtds k model were significantly different among the sampling scenarios with a p value less than 0 05 for most instances supplementary section 3 table s6 the wrtds model showed a marked decrease in precision with an increase in the sampling interval as in the case of bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios compared to weekly sampling indicating the general tendency to overestimate the observed loads with pdiff values above 20 of the observed loads statistical analysis showed that load estimates of the wrtds model under weekly bi weekly and stratified sampling scenarios were significantly different for less than 30 of instances table 7 whereas the precision of the load estimates of the wrtds model showed a marginal increase under the stratified sampling method compared to the random sampling approach unlike loadest models that build a single regression model across whole monitoring duration based on the relationship between streamflow and tss the wrtds model uses weighted regressions based on time discharge and season and thus develops an individual regression model for each sampling observation when more samples were available at frequent intervals to build the wrtds model as in the case with weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios accuracy and to some extent precision improved as more frequent samples at weekly and bi weekly time steps better allowing the model to predict load estimates sharifi et al 2017 under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios where samples were not frequently available wrtds model showed weak precision as using fewer samples and samples not covering extreme streamflow conditions in model formation generally limited the potential to generate precise load estimates aulenbach 2013 wrtds k model constructs an autoregressive lag 1 model using the standardized residuals generated from the wrtds model at shorter intervals as in the case of weekly and bi weekly and to some extent under monthly sampling scenario the wrtds k model showed good enough accuracy and precision as more observations at frequent intervals allowed the model to predict loads better near the observation points however wrtds k showed low accuracy and similar results to the wrtds model under bi monthly sampling scenarios which was evidently due to samples taken at sporadic intervals and consisting of longer gaps resulting in no possible load computations using the wrtds k model and the results were mainly based on wrtds estimates the composite model showed the second best accurate and precise results after wrtds k under weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios more observations at frequent intervals allowed the model to interpolate better between the residuals to predict accurate and precise load estimates appling et al 2015 however an increase in sampling interval in the case of monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios decreased the precision in load estimates as interpolating over longer gaps generally hindered accurate load prediction ferrant et al 2013 appling et al 2015 however the composite model showed better accuracy and precision in load estimates under weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios with pdiff values between 20 of the observed loads and statistical analysis further revealed that load estimates under these two scenarios were significantly different for less than 35 of instances on the contrary it was found that the precision further decreased with an increase in the sampling interval as under the monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios with pdiff values extending below 20 implying that the composite model seemed to underestimate the observed loads at a longer interval between the samples and statistical analysis and nse statistics showed similar results as the load estimates under these two sampling scenarios were significantly different for more than 45 instances table 7 and there was observed to be high variability in nse values based on the inter quartile range fig 5 statistical analysis further demonstrated that load estimates of the composite model were significantly different under weekly sampling scenarios compared to other sampling scenarios p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s6 5 1 3 uncertainty analysis of sediment load estimation in the process of quantification of uncertainty using the quantile regression technique we have focused on p and r factors supplementary section 6 1 fig s7 presents the p factor and r factor during models simulation of tp for different monitoring stations and sampling scenarios p factor equal to 1 and r factor equal to 0 representing the best model simulations with no uncertainty the figure clearly shows that the uncertainty is the least in case of wrtds and wrtds k in comparison to other models for weekly p factor 0 34 0 79 r factor 0 22 0 57 bi weekly p factor 0 3 0 68 r factor 0 2 0 57 and monthly p factor 0 27 0 7 r factor 0 2 0 53 sampling scenarios fig s7 a c however for bi monthly p factor 0 47 0 79 r factor 0 22 0 52 random p factor 0 44 0 75 r factor 0 29 0 53 and stratified p factor 0 39 0 70 r factor 0 37 0 65 scenarios uncertainties increase for all the models irrespective of gauging stations although uncertainties are comparatively high in the gauging stations other than ausable river near springbank and big creek near walsingham for all models and sampling scenarios fig s7 a c fig s9 a n this may be due to poor sampling coverage of the grab sample fig s9 besides the large variation in r value is due to higher standard deviations in model simulation fig s7 meanwhile the results are supported by standard error estimation in section 5 1 the results are also in agreement with the discussion in previous sub sections however the uncertainty needs to be further analyzed with a longer period data set for becoming very sure about the applicability of the technique of predicting load data because unavailable datasets render many processes unidentifiable therefore this lack of knowledge should be accounted for during the uncertainty analysis for better environmental decision support making 5 2 total phosphorus tp 5 2 1 evaluation of the performance of the models overall the wrtds k wrtds composite and to some extent curved linear loadest models i e l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed satisfactory load estimates while interpolation and linear loadest models i e l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 displayed unsatisfactory load estimates over many instances based on fbs statistics nse statistics and statistical analysis fig 8 and table 8 for different sampling scenarios and monitoring stations covering variable drainage areas in particular wrtds k model showed satisfactory precision with a median fbs value of 0 01 and an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 04 to 0 09 fig 7 besides the wrtds model also displayed acceptable accuracy with a median fbs value of 0 01 and an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 06 to 0 08 the composite model displayed good accuracy with a median fbs value of 0 03 and displayed satisfactory precision with an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 04 to 0 11 statistical analysis and nse statistics further presented that load estimates of these three models were significantly different over fewer instances for about 10 table 8 and a median nse value greater than 0 7 for these models fig 7 load estimates among loadest models in the case of tp displayed opposite patterns in comparison to tss i e curved linear loadest models l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 performed better than linear loadest models l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 the influence of drainage area and in stream processes may be the reason behind this instance lee et al 2016 curved linear models l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed good accuracy with median fbs values ranging between 0 04 and 0 07 and showed satisfactory precision with inter quartile range fbs values ranging between 0 14 to 0 02 indicating that these models displayed modest variability in load estimates with a modest overestimation bias over some instances fig 7 statistical analysis displayed that load estimates of curved linear loadest models were significantly different over less than 35 of instances table 8 statistical analysis further indicated that load estimates using the curved linear loadest models were not significantly different p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s7 in contrast linear loadest models l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 displayed unsatisfactory accuracy and precision in load estimates with median fbs values ranging between 0 18 to 0 24 and inter quartile range fbs values ranging between 0 09 to 0 38 fig 7 linear loadest models tended to underestimate the observed loads for most instances statistical analysis revealed that load estimates of linear laodest models were significantly different over the range of 62 to 85 instances table 8 unsatisfactory performance of linear l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 loadest models for tp load estimates was mainly influenced by the lack of fit between streamflow and tp concentration at high streamflow conditions in the case of simple models the beale ratio model was not evaluated for tp load estimates as this model computes loads over the entire sampling window the interpolation model displayed unsatisfactory accuracy and precision in load estimates with a median fbs value of 0 14 and an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 03 to 0 33 fig 7 statistical analysis for comparison among the models indicated the load estimates of the interpolation model were statistically different compared to other models p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s7 5 2 2 effect of sampling coverage sampling scenarios and drainage area of monitoring stations an evaluation of sampling coverage over the entire range of the probability of exceedance of the flow duration curve was conducted and indicated there was poor sampling coverage for all types of flows and especially for the high flow at all the gauging stations fig s10 moreover it is even poor in saugeen river near port elgin fig s10 g therefore we have delved deeply to evaluate the models at different gauging stations in advance of analysis for different sampling scenarios fig 8 the performance of statistical models at all tp sampling stations is shown in fig 9 the comparison of statistical models using statistical analysis at all tp sampling stations is shown in table s4 the performance of statistical models across most of the sampling locations had significant differences loadest models showed the most site specific variability in load estimates compared to other statistical models performance of most statistical models except linear loadest l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 models were consistently better at thames river at byron grand river at centre wellington and thames river at jacobs road stations for wrtds wrtds k composite interpolation and curved linear loadest l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 models the threshold percentage at these three stations ranged between 65 and 100 percent furthermore statistical analysis showed that the load estimates of all statistical models at grand river at centre wellington and thames river at byron stations were not significantly different p 0 05 table s4 whereas load estimates of only linear loadest models were significantly different p 0 05 at the thames river at jacobs road station among all statistical models table s4 l 8 l 9 composite wrtds and wrtds k models displayed better results at sydenham river and don river stations with a threshold percentage ranging between 55 and 90 fig 9 the statistical analysis further showed that load estimates of all the statistical models were statistically not significant p 0 05 table s4 linear loadest models performed better at saugeen river and humber river stations with a threshold percentage ranging between 55 and 90 and statistical analysis further confirmed that load estimates were not significantly different p 0 05 at these two stations table s4 the wrtds wrtds k and composite models displayed better results at ausable river near parkhill station with a threshold percentage between 60 and 75 fig 9 the performance of most statistical models at credit river and grand river at bridge port was unsatisfactory however interpolation and wrtds k displayed better results than other models at station credit river with threshold percentages ranging between 50 and 56 with a threshold percentage of about five percent regression models were less accurate at this location credit river and statistical analysis further showed that load estimates of regression models were significantly different compared to observed loads p 0 05 table s4 the performance of models at thames river at byron and grand river at centre wellington stations was mainly governed by the overall fit between streamflow and tp concentration over the entire sampling window these two stations showed the least association between streamflow and tp unsatisfactory performance of linear l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 loadest models at these two stations was mainly due to no linear relationship between streamflow and tp on the contrary this streamflow tp relation was better captured by curved linear l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 loadest models especially during high streamflow conditions supplementary section 1 fig s2 and fig s10 on the other hand the wrtds model which is generally less influenced by the overall fit between streamflow and tp showed the most accurate and precise load estimates under all sampling scenarios the composite and wrtds k model further improved the accuracy and precision of load estimates compared to l 9 and wrtds models which accounted for the correction in load estimates based on residual departures there was high variability in the accuracy and precision of load estimates among statistical models at thames river at jacobs road sydenham river don river and ausable river near parkhill stations these four stations demonstrated a moderate to strong positive correlation between streamflow and tp supplementary section 1 and fig s2 despite showing a moderate to strong correlation at these four stations linear l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 loadest models showed unsatisfactory load estimates with likely underestimation bias under all sampling scenarios at these stations the underestimation bias of linear loadest models was typically due to a lack of linearity over high streamflow conditions while the better performance of curved linear l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 loadest models was mainly due to better fit in streamflow and tp concentration throughout high streamflow conditions it is particularly important to understand the performance of these statistical models throughout high streamflow conditions because the total load is mainly influenced by the period of high streamflows fig s10 this was clear with the results for these four stations as linear loadest generally displayed the tendency to underestimate over high flows which impacted the overall load estimates of these models despite showing accurate load estimates over the moderate and low streamflow conditions meanwhile saugeen river and humber stations displayed a good correlation between streamflow and tp concentration across the sampling interval with a correlation coefficient value of above 0 60 supplementary section 1 and fig s2 unlike the performance of linear loadest models at the thames river at jacobs road and sydenham river stations displaying modest underestimation bias the performance of these models improved considerably at saugeen river and humber river stations compared to curved linear loadest models better performance of linear loadest models than curved linear loadest models was due to better linear fit between streamflow and tp concentration especially over moderate to high flow conditions while curved linear loadest models tended to overestimate the observed loads mainly due to overprediction across moderate to high flow conditions moreover wrtds wrtds k and composite models showed good performance over these two stations however there was a significant influence of sampling scenarios on the precision of load estimates among these models as there exists a positive serial correlation between streamflow and tp sampling during moderate to high streamflow conditions is of paramount importance this condition would be generally satisfied under weekly and bi weekly scenarios as sampling at short time intervals would increase the probability of capturing more samples across moderate to high streamflow conditions however the probability of collecting samples during wide ranging streamflow conditions would decrease under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios with samples taken at longer time intervals which was evident in the results as these models showed moderate underestimation and overestimation bias under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios statistical models displayed the least accurate and precise load estimates at credit river and grand river at bridge port stations these two stations displayed no substantial correlation between streamflow and tp concentration with no meaningful correlation it was obvious that linear loadest models would possibly display unsatisfactory load estimates however no model showed load estimates within the acceptance requirements wrtds k composite and interpolation models to some extent performed better at these stations and displayed high accuracy and precision in load estimates using frequent sampling approaches under weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios this is mainly because short gaps between the subsequent samples better allowed these models to predict accurate load estimates however under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios these models showed unsatisfactory load estimates suggesting that longer gaps of more than 30 days were not suitable for predicting accurate load estimates using these models at credit river station while the performance of the wrtds and loadest models was consistently unsatisfactory under all sampling scenarios at credit river the unsatisfactory performance of these models was primarily due to the overall lack of fit between stream flow and tp concentration and variable loading conditions supplementary section 1 fig s2 and table s2 there existed a high variability in tp concentration across the moderate to high streamflow conditions in addition to that tp concentrations were highest during the period of low streamflow conditions fig s10 with evident variation in tp concentrations across the range of streamflow conditions these models would not be capable to capture such variations in tp concentration with respect to streamflow which was quite clear with results as these models showed unsatisfactory load estimates with significant underestimation bias under all sampling scenarios however the performance of curved linear loadest models was better at grand river at bridge port as including the curvature in the relationship of streamflow and tp better explained the overall fit across the sampling window especially in case of moderate to high streamflow conditions for further investigation we consider fig 8 which shows the performance of all statistical models using pdiff values under four sampling scenarios table 9 serves as a guide to understanding how well the statistical models performed under various sampling scenarios through statistical analysis for the comparison of load estimates of statistical models furthermore a comparison of load estimates of statistical models under various sampling scenarios is shown in supplementary section 3 and table s8 under different sampling scenarios and monitoring stations with variable areas the interpolation model showed the highest variability in tp load estimates p 0 05 the interpolation model showed good accuracy and precision in load estimates under the weekly sampling scenario compared to other sampling scenarios sharifi et al 2017 however the interpolation model showed a substantial decrease in the precision and accuracy of load estimates with a further increase in sampling interval as in the case of bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios p 0 05 hirsch 2014 appling et al 2015 lee et al 2016 sharifi et al 2017 the interpolation model does not take into account any relationship with streamflow and is therefore largely dependent on the number of sampling observations used to construct the model preston et al 1989 littlewood 1995 hirsch 2014 lee et al 2016 of all the statistical models considered linear loadest models displayed unsatisfactory accuracy and precision in load estimates with fbs values outside the acceptance criteria of 0 1 for most cases statistical analysis showed that load estimates of linear loadest models were significantly different over many instances ranging from 26 to 52 table 9 statistical analysis further indicated that load estimates of linear loadest models under all sampling scenarios were statistically not significant p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s8 compared to linear loadest models curved linear loadest models l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 demonstrated greater precision and accuracy in load estimates table 9 and table s8 furthermore it was observed that the wrtds wrtds k and composite model displayed accurate and precise load estimates under weekly bi weekly and monthly sampling scenarios with fbs values within 0 1 of the acceptance criteria fig 8 over most instances and a high median nse value ranging from 0 51 to 0 90 this finding is supported by hirsch 2014 appling et al 2015 lee et al 2016 sharifi et al 2017 however it was found that with an increase in the sampling interval these models showed a modest decrease in precision hirsch 2014 zhang and hirsch 2019 the decrease in precision of load estimates among these models was mainly due to long gaps in the sampling interval zhang and hirsch 2019 it suggests that most of the subsets designed at all sampling stations successfully captured high and low flow periods the decrease in precision of load estimates among these models may be due to some of the subsets that would have significantly under sampled high and low flow periods due to longer gaps in the sampling appling et al 2015 sharifi et al 2017 5 2 3 uncertainty analysis of phosphorous load estimation in the process of quantification of uncertainty using the quantile regression technique we have focused on p and r factors supplementary section 6 1 fig s8 presents the p factor and r factor during models simulation of tp for different monitoring stations and sampling scenarios p factor equal to 1 and r factor equal to 0 representing the best model simulations with no uncertainty the figure clearly shows that the uncertainty is the least in case of wrtds and wrtds k in comparison to other models for weekly p factor 0 3 0 7 r factor 0 15 0 4 and and bi weekly p factor 0 28 0 7 r factor 0 16 0 4 sampling scenarios fig s8 a b however for monthly p factor 0 38 0 6 r factor 0 26 0 4 and bi monthly p factor 0 61 0 79 r factor 0 32 0 43 scenarios uncertainties increase for all the models irrespective of gauging stations although uncertainties are comparatively high in don river at pottery road humber river at old mill road grand river at bridge port ausable river near park hill thames river at jacobs road and saugeen river near port elgin gauging stations for all models and sampling scenarios fig s8 a b the results are supported by standard error estimation in section 5 2 the results are also in agreement with the discussion in previous sub sections the probable reason may be the poor sampling coverage of grab samples for the gauging stations fig s10 a j however uncertainty in humber river at old mill road grand river at bridge port ausable river near park hill thames river at jacobs road may get affected by the estimated streamflow as mentioned in section 2 2 in this junction we want to argue particularly with frequent sampling and similar efforts between years that may be the only way to confirm such an outcome relying on the method therefore the use of methods that fully account for uncertainty is recommended to obtain statistically valid results in a wider range of conditions however if sampling is so irregular that important fluctuations are missed entirely in some years the uncertainty analysis could become dubious in interpretation and usefulness therefore the uncertainty needs to be further analyzed with a longer period data set for becoming very sure about the applicability of the technique of predicting load data 6 conclusion in this study tss and tp loads from various tributaries in southern ontario canada were computed using wide ranging statistical models statistical models including simple models i e interpolation and beale ratio estimator simple and multiple linear regression i e loadest models weighted regression i e wrtds and error correction models i e wrtds k and composite model were evaluated the performance of statistical models to estimate tss and tp loads were further evaluated under various sampling scenarios and sampling stations with variable watershed drainage areas the precise conclusions of this study are listed below the wrtds k and wrtds models showed the most accurate and precise estimates over most sampling scenarios and sampling stations for tss load and tp load respectively while simple models interpolation and beale ratio model did not do well for most possible cases furthermore the performances of wrtds wrtds k and the composite model were generally better under weekly bi weekly and monthly sampling scenarios but were less consistent under the bi monthly sampling scenario while other models were statistically non significant over the most possible sampling scenarios in addition most statistical models showed satisfactory load estimates at sampling stations with large drainage areas although no statistical models showed the potential to accurately predict tp and tss loads at sampling stations with small drainage areas credit authorship contribution

2557,the accurate representation of the load of water quality constituents transported by rivers and streams is crucial to understand the impact on the quality of the lakes the behavior of the rivers and streams statistical models have been developed to predict the water quality constituent loads from the available data of sampled concentration low frequency grab chemistry data and continuous discharge high frequency at a particular sampled location and to further analyze trends and changes in water quality however the performance of statistical models to estimate water quality constituent loads depends on many aspects including the type of water quality constituent sampling strategy and frequency and the land use and areas of the watershed this study evaluates the performance of a wide range of statistical models for the estimation of total suspended solids tss and total phosphorus tp loads under various sampling scenarios and monitoring stations in southern ontario canada trends in tss and tp concentrations and loads were further analyzed in major tributaries the weighted regression on time discharge and season kalman filter wrtds k model was found to be the most suitable model p 0 05 and percentage difference pdiff between 20 for predicting tss loads at most sampling stations and under most sampling scenarios while the weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds model was found to be the most suitable model p 0 05 and flux bias statistics fbs between 0 1 for predicting tp loads the applied statistical models loadest simple and curvilinear models wrtds wrtds k beale s estimator composite and interpolation models have shown a limited potential to estimate load accurately at monitoring stations covering small drainage areas keywords total suspended solids total phosphorus regression load estimation discharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction degraded water quality is of growing concern worldwide with major implications on the health of rivers and downstream water bodies such as estuaries and lakes zhang et al 2019 in particular excess water quality constituents e g phosphorus nitrogen loading from upland watersheds to lakes dynamically from sources such as agricultural fields septic systems acts as one of the reasons for the eutrophication nutrient enrichment which is the point of concern schindler 1977 michalak et al 2013 estepp and reavie 2015 munawar and fitzpatrick 2018 malone and newton 2020 because eutrophication can influence the level of algal blooms that are considered to be very harmful michalak et al 2013 steffen et al 2014 higgins et al 2008 and can further lead to hypoxic conditions in lakes scavia et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 excessive phosphorus inputs from point sources i e wastewater treatment plants and industries and non point sources i e runoff from urban and agricultural areas to streams rivers and lakes are the main drivers to eutrophication carpenter 1998 sharpley and tunney 2000 meanwhile phosphorus p sometimes referred to as total phosphorus tp is primarily available in two forms particulate and soluble forms particulate phosphorus is usually tied to soil particles and is conveyed with soil particles to the rivers by soil and wind erosion soluble or dissolved phosphorus dp soluble reactive phosphorus is a subset of dp is largely bioavailable depends on its relative availability to particulate phosphorus to plants that may accelerate algae growth omecc 2018 in addition to phosphorus sediments also affect water quality total suspended solids tss and suspended sediment concentration ssc are the most commonly used terms in the literatures describing the solid portions of the concentration suspended in a mixture of water it is also very common for sediment in the water to be assessed based on water clarity using measures such as turbidity sediment generation is significantly influenced by the land use type and is conveyed majorly from agricultural landscapes through soil and wind erosion alike phosphorus therefore analysis of the concentration of phosphorus and sediments in water bodies e g streams lakes is considered to be vital to evaluate the overall water quality to be precise this information is essential in understandingthe quality of lakes the behavior of upstream water bodies e g streams rivers and the role of different sourceareas i e point and non point sources zhang et al 2019 moreover correct load predictions are usually required for cost effective progress and assessment of water quality monitoring projects ator et al 2011 bowes et al 2008 linker et al 2013 shenk and linker 2013 zhang et al 2015 so we need a tool to estimate the loads from the available data of sampled concentration and continuous discharge at a particular sampled location severalstatistical models can serve the purpose simple models include uncomplicated aggregation interpolation among the sampled concentrations and ratio estimators with time or flow based stratification to obtain total loads in addition there are various regression models i e simple and multiple linear regression which are intended to mainly focus on the patterns of correlation between discharge and concentration cohn et al 1989 ferguson 1987 the weighted regression model is also a type of regression model but is projected to be a flexible and robust model compared to simple and multiple linear regression that considers many strict assumptions for model formation hirsch et al 2010 in particular several advancements have been made concerning the regression models with the development of more robust models based on the adjustments for local deviations from the residuals including the composite model and the weighted regression in time discharge and season kalman filter model wrtds k aulenbach and hooper 2006 verma et al 2012 zhang and hirsch 2019 however the estimation bias systematic error of these models depends on many aspects including the type of nutrients e g sediment and phosphorus and form of constituent dissolved or total record period length the correlation between discharge and concentration watershed area and the sampling type and frequency worrall et al 2013 littlewood and marsh 2005 williams et al 2015 moatar et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 robertson 1999a b keeping these points in mind various statistical models have been used to estimate water quality loads sediment phosphorus nitrogen and other nutrients across southern ontario conditions in the past few decades a few selected studies are listed below in table 1 however since the performance of statistical models to estimate water quality loads depends on many aspects including the type of water quality constituent the sampling type and frequency considered and the watershed area it is very tough to make a choice of a particular statistical model among all for accurate load estimation this study therefore evaluates statistical models for predicting tss and tp loads considering various sampling scenarios and sampling stations with variable drainage areas therefore the specific objectives of the study are 1 1 objectives to estimate the total suspended solids and total phosphorus load using widely used statistical models to evaluate the performance of various statistical models to predict loads under widely ranged aspects including 1 sampling scenarios and low sampling frequencies 2 sampling stations with variable drainage areas thus the novelty or significance of this manuscript within the existing literature is the assessing of the differences in the used models due to sampling scenarios and drainage areas 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area included three dominant basins located in southern ontario canada the basins are northern lake erie eastern lake huron and lake ontario and niagara peninsula northern lake erie basin is located in southern ontario and is mainly dominated by agricultural row crops land use comprising 60 8 of total land use table 2 with a drainage area of around 22 647 km2 a major portion of the northern lake erie basin drains into lake erie while some portion along thames river within the basin drains into lake st clair and then to lake erie eastern lake huron basin is located in south western ontario and covers a drainage area of around 15 000 km2 and drains majorly into lake huron and some parts of georgian bay eastern lake huron basin is also an agriculture dominated watershed with 42 8 of the total land use for agricultural activities lake ontario and niagara peninsula basin is located in south east ontario and comprised mainly of forests covering 40 of the total land use lake ontario and niagara peninsula watershed has the largest drainage area among the selected basins covering a drainage area of around 28 500 km2 and draining into lake ontario 2 2 data this study mainly focused on analyzing two water quality constituents that have a considerable relationship with streamflow i e total suspended solids and total phosphorus as well as with each other flow and total suspended solids data were obtained from the hydrometric database hydat operated by the water survey of canada under the environment and climate change canada the data is published in hydat https wateroffice ec gc ca search historical e html database and includes daily and monthly mean streamflow water level and tss concentration for over 2500 active and 5500 discontinued monitoring stations for a period between 1965 and 2018 across ontario fourteen tss sampling stations were selected for the study based on spatio temporal coverage and available dataset the tss dataset contains a maximum monitoring duration of 29 years humber river at elder mills and a minimum monitoring duration of three years south maitland river at summerhill with an average monitoring duration of ten years table 4 tp data were obtained from the provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn database https www ontario ca environment and energy map provincial stream water quality monitoring network ten tp stations were selected for the study based on the availability of the dataset table 4 and fig 1 the monitoring stations are distributed across all three watersheds with variable drainage areas fig 1 streamflow and tss were monitored at the same location for all fourteen sampling stations both the water quality constituents were analyzed using two different sampling approaches tss monitoring includes samples collected daily while tp monitoring was not daily but was done more frequently https uwaterloo ca water institute research issue 2 feature long term phosphorus concentration trends ontario streams more frequently means an irregular monitoring frequency that is more than monthly but less than daily as two different authorities monitored streamflow and water quality constituents distinctly monitoring of streamflow and water quality were not measured at the same location for many monitoring stations in ontario as four tp stations humber river at old mill road grand river at bridge port ausable river near park hill and thames river at jacobs road did not have concurrent streamflow stations streamflow for these stations was estimated from the nearest streamflow monitoring stations using a drainage area weightage method developed by hirsch 1979 the details have been provided in supplementary section s1 1 see table 3 3 materials and method supplementary section 1 describes the flow estimation for the ungauged sites coefficient of variation cv and richards baker r b flashiness index statistics for all tss tp monitoring stations the rest of the methodology has been presented below 3 1 statistical models formation 3 1 1 beale s ratio estimator interpolation and composite models 3 1 1 1 beale s ratio estimator beale 1962 first introduced this class of mathematical load estimation model the ratio based load estimation model beale s ratio estimator has been used primarily for load estimation at the great lakes contributing sites the ratio estimator model is an effective mathematical tool for calculating pollutant load from continuous flow data and infrequent concentration data meals et al 2013 ratio estimators consider that a positive correlation exists between the concentration and the flow on sampled days the daily load is measured as the sum of the sampled concentration and the daily mean streamflow on sampled days and the mean load is also computed over the year the average daily load is further multiplied by a flow ratio determined by dividing the average flow over the entire duration by the average flow over the sampled days the equation further incorporates a bias correction factor to take into account the effects of the association between load and discharge the daily mean load is then multiplied by the number of days in a year to get the annual load if there is a great deal of variability in flow levels over the monitoring period accuracy can be improved by stratifying the full data set based on discharge in the case of estimating loads based on a stratified model i e for distinct seasons and months ratio estimators are generally applied by dividing the sampled concentration data into multiple strata strata can be characterized based on time or discharge conditions upon selection of strata the beale ratio estimator of a selected stratum is obtained by 1 l a l o q a q o 1 1 n 1 n s l q l o q o 1 1 n 1 n s q q q o 2 where l a total load of the stratum l o sample mean load of the stratum q o sample mean streamflow of the stratum q a mean streamflow of the stratum n number of sampled days in the stratum n total number of days in the stratum including sampled and unsampled days slq covariance between sample load and sample streamflow of the stratum i o q o product of sample mean load and sample mean streamflow of the stratum sqq sample variance of streamflow within the stratum q o 2 square of the sample mean streamflow of the stratum an estimate of the total load of the strata is obtained as the product of beale s ratio estimate for the stratum multiplied by the total number of days within the stratum the sum of load estimates for all strata gives the estimate of the total load over the predictive period of all days beale s ratio estimator normally employs discrete samples and streamflow data solely from the year for which the loads are to be estimated lee et al 2016 ratio estimators usually use the average daily flow to calculate loads and are thus better suited to monitoring programs with adequate flow information but with relatively minimal concentration information dolan et al 1981 3 1 1 2 interpolation models the interpolation model included in the study was one of the simplest models for water quality load sediment phosphorus nitrogen and other nutrients estimation interpolation can be called a simple model as it requires only a dependent variable i e water quality concentration for the load computations unlike regression models that require one or more independent variables e g streamflow and time the first and simplest model demonstrated here is the interpolation model the interpolation model predicts daily missing concentration values by performing a simple interpolation among the series of sampled concentrations the interpolated daily concentration value is further multiplied by the daily streamflow for that particular day and a unit conversion factor to generate a unit daily load unit daily loads are generated for a series of interpolated concentration values and then summed to obtain annual loads lee et al 2016 interpolation models have been used in different ways in several studies of solute and sediment fluxes buso et al 2000 vanni et al 2001 interpolation models are usually recommended when regression models are unacceptable i e owing to a shortage of data or because the correlation between independent variables and the concentrations is very weak in particular an interpolation model might be appropriate if the measured concentrations are sufficiently available at frequent intervals that each set of subsequent concentrations is indicative of the concentrations in the time between them webb et al 1997 robertson 1999a b 3 1 1 3 composite models the composite model is another model based on the error correction of load estimates using residual departures the composite model generates residuals using one of the nine regression models from the loadest models the composite model further uses a piecewise interpolation among these residuals based on the trends and patterns the composite model was built using the loadflex package in r appling et al 2015 for this study residuals from loadest model 9 seven parameter model were used for the development of a composite model as the seven parameter model has been extensively implemented in literature for tss and tp load estimates 3 1 2 loadest models simple and multiple linear regression the process of load estimation is aggravated by non normality retransformation bias and data censoring instantaneous load estimates using the ordinary least squares regression ols model are generally biased load predictions might underestimate true loads by 50 percent ferguson 1986 retransformation bias is taken into account by incorporating a bias correction factor to estimate load data censoring arises when many samples included in the model formation possess constituent concentrations below the laboratory detection level gilbert 1987 the assumption that the model residuals are normally distributed is another complication of the ols regression loadest uses three different models for the load estimation due to these complications maximum likelihood estimate mle least absolute deviation lad and adjusted maximum likelihood estimate amle the model coefficients can be determined using the maximum likelihood test as a substitute to ols regression when censored data is used in the calibration data mle implementation is also classified as tobit regression with an assumption that residuals are normally distributed and constant variance helsel and hirsch 1992 if the calibration data is uncensored bradu and mundlak 1970 bias correction factor generates loads using a minimum variance unbiased estimate mvue cohn et al 1989 2 l lad exp a 0 j 1 m a j x j g m m s 2 v where l muve is the instantaneous load generated using mle s2 is the residual variance m is the degrees of freedom and v is an independent variable function cohn et al 1989 adjusted maximum likelihood estimation eliminates the first order bias in the model which generally occurs in the mle load estimation for censored data using the calculation specified in shenton and bowman 1977 when calibration data has uncensored observations the amle load predictions are the same as mle load predictions cohn et al 1992 an estimate of instantaneous load for censored data using amle approach is given by 3 l lad exp a 0 j 1 m a j x j h a b s 2 α κ where l amle is the instantaneous load generated using amle s2 is the residual variance a and b are independent variables function cohn et al 1992 and α and κ are the parameters of the gamma distribution all of the previously described approaches to regression ols amle and mle consider that the residuals are distributed normally and that they vary constantly if model residuals are not in agreement with the above assumption alternative strategies can be applied loadest considers such models as the least absolute deviation lad model lad model coefficients are established using powell 1984 regression model as introduced by buchinsky 1998 given the coefficients of the model predictions of instantaneous load are formed using duan 1983 smearing approach 4 l lad exp a 0 j 1 m a j x j k 1 n e x p e k n where l lad is the lad instantaneous load e is the model error a0 and aj are the model coefficients and n is the total number of uncensored observations loadest model provides 11 regression models eqs 5 to 15 and one of the models that hold a strong correlation between streamflow and concentration can be applied to predict instantaneous constituent loads models 1 to 9 eqs 5 to 13 are applicable to predict pollutant loads for unsampled dates missing data and models 10 and 11 are applicable to predict pollutant loads for specific intervals model 1 and 2 eqs 5 and 6 are regression equations that take into consideration only discharge as the explanatory variable that can be relevant to the high correlation between discharge and water quality constituent kim et al 2018 model 3 9 eqs 7 to 13 includes time seasonal and

season wrtds is an improvised regression model that is based on weighted regression over time discharge and season wrtds model was formed using the exploration and graphics for river trends egret package in r hirsch et al 2015 the main equation of the model is hirsch et al 2010 16 ln c i β 0 i β 1 i ln q i β 2 i t i β 3 i sin 2 π t i β 4 i cos 2 π t i σ i z i where ci is the concentration in

the time domain σi is denoted as the conditional standard deviation of model error zi is denoted as standardized residual on the ith day zhang and hirsch 2019 structurally wrtds constructs one regression model that predicts concentration and load on every single day of the record for the defined date season and discharge of the prediction wrtds screens the complete concentration data record and chooses concentration samples that are fairly near to the predicted day related to the date streamflow and season the selected samples are further used to construct a weighted regression model using eq 16 and it creates a series of model coefficients computed model coefficients are then used to predict the logarithm of concentration for the prediction day by using values of time and streamflow logarithms of concentration are further transformed into arithmetic space by incorporating a bias correction factor as mentioned in zhang and hirsch 2019 17 e c i exp β 0 i β 1 i ln q i β 2

season with kalman filtering wrtds k is one of the error correction models based on residual departures wrtds k model generates standardized residuals using the load predictions from the developed wrtds model wrtds k model considers these standardized residuals to have an ar1 serial correlation structure with a lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ ranging between 0 1 based on the study done by zhang and hirsch 2019 they found the optimal lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ between 0 85 and 0 95 for total suspended solids and total phosphorus over various sampling scenarios based on this consideration lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ of 0 90 was used in this study for the development of wrtds k model the number of monte carlo replicate was kept to 50 numbers for the development of wrtds k model considering the computational timing load estimates using wrtds k model were done using the extended code for wrtds k model developed by zhang and hirsch 2019 wrtds k is a modification of the standard wrtds model to predict concentration based on time streamflow and season first the model uses the observed concentration record to create a standard wrtds model second the model further computes the residuals in the log space on sampled observations 19 r i ln c i β 0 i β 1 i ln q i β 2 i t i β 3 i sin 2 π t i β 4 i cos 2 π t i these residuals are considered as model error and they are interpreted as the difference between observed ln c and estimated ln c finally standardized residuals are generated by dividing the residuals to the standard deviation specific for the day zhang and hirsch 2019 20 z i r i σ i wrtds k model considers that these standardized residuals possess an ar1 serial correlation structure that has a lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ ranging between 0 1 wrtds k splits the entire dataset into non overlapping gap intervals depending on the days of observation for a gap time say that day 1 is the last observation before the gap and day n is the first observation after the gap so for this gap interval there are n 2 days that wrtds k will estimate for owing to the complication of the model e g log transformed data and timely changing model coefficients the predicted value for each of the unsampled day is calculated using a monte carlo simulation using many replicates user defined with each replication the model produces a missing time series it produces values c2 c3 c4 cn 3 cn 2 cn 1 based on predetermined values of c1 and cn the coefficients of the eq 19 and the estimation of σ at each time step of the gap period the key equation for generating standardized residuals is centered on the ar1 recursive relationship procedure using the wrtds k model 21 z k 1 ρ z k 1 ρ 2 e k where ek is denoted as independent standard normal random variable on estimation day z1 n is the standardized residuals on the estimation day when the value ρ is near to 0 the predicted values are built solely on ek the predicted values are entirely based on zk i e standardized residuals when the value of ρ in near to 1 the above procedure is repeated for each gap in the dataset the above procedure is designed in such a manner that all the z values that will include all values generated by the data and all values produced in between has a lag 1 coefficient of correlation ρ generated z values for estimation days are again transformed into real space as 22 e c i exp β 0 i β 1 i ln q i β 2 i t i β 3 i sin 2 π t i β 4 i cos 2 π t i σ i z i the process referred to above is replicated m number of times and the expected concentration value for each ith day is calculated using the average of the m replicates of ci which would be the expected concentration value for ith day c i on the sampled days the concentration estimates are the same as the observed value to test the accuracy and precision of various statistical models and to further analyze the performance of statistical models under various sampling frequencies and sampling stations a design of a subsampling approach was developed for the tss and tp monitoring data at all monitoring stations and sampling scenarios fig 2 provides an overview of the design of the sub sampling approach for both water quality constituents i e tss and tp and they are also discussed in the following section 3 2 sampling and subsampling experiment three sampling scenarios were developed for all tss sampling stations as a sufficient dataset in the case of tss were available at a daily time step for longer monitoring periods sampling types included systematic random and stratified sampling systematic subsampling includes taking a dense dataset and separating it into subsamples of the same length systematic subsampling scenarios included in this study were weekly bi weekly monthly and bi monthly table 5 the weekly subsampling strategy refers to taking a sample every consecutive week from the dataset weekly subsampling is designed in such a way that there exists a gap of at least seven days from the successive sample to meet the assumptions of systematic sampling for this subsampling experiment seven subsets were created under weekly subsampling to test the accuracy and precision over repetitive subsets and which could include higher variability and temporal coverage from the whole dataset table 5 the bi weekly subsampling scenario includes taking a sample every two weeks from the dataset similar to the weekly subsampling strategy there exists a gap of at least 14 days from the successive sample for the bi weekly sampling strategy for this subsampling experiment 14 subsets were created under a bi weekly subsampling strategy table 5 the monthly sampling strategy includes taking a sample each month from the dataset similar to the bi weekly subsampling strategy there exists a gap of at least 30 days from the successive sample for the monthly sampling strategy for this subsampling experiment 29 subsets were created under the monthly subsampling strategy table 5 bi monthly sampling strategy includes taking a sample every two months from the dataset under the monthly subsampling strategy there exists a gap of at least 60 days from the successive sample for bi monthly sampling strategy for this subsampling experiment 16 subsets were created table 5 in the case of the random subsampling scenario 12 subsamples were randomly selected per calendar year within the monitoring window to form a single subset this procedure was repeated ten times to generate 10 subsets for the analysis however it is important to elucidate that 12 subsamples drawn from each calendar year were equally weighted across the months this states that each month had an equal probability of being subsampled however the subsample within each month was selected on a random basis such a subsampling scenario would better represent the actual sampling conditions currently being implemented by many of the conservation authorities under the pwqmn while in the case of the stratified subsampling approach three high flow samples were drawn in addition to the random subsampling scenario which resulted in 15 samples per calendar year high flow subsamples were drawn based on the consideration of richards 1998 for separating the storm events above 80 percentile streamflow values for the tributaries of great lakes a stratified sampling strategy helps to assess whether the accuracy of load estimates is improved by purposely targeting high flow conditions for the water quality constituents however it is vital to know that this type of sampling is only feasible when the timing and extent of high streamflow occurrences are priorly understood and so is an idealized situation that is difficult to mimic in reality in the case of tp monitoring stations systematic subsampling was not possible as tp datasets were not available at frequent intervals such as a daily time step supplementary section 7 2 for example the number of tp samples per month on average for all sampling stations ranged between 2 and 30 based on the available tp dataset a random subsampling experiment can be developed four scenarios were developed for the random subsampling experiment scenario 1 4 samples per month scenario 2 2 samples per month scenario 3 1 sample per month and scenario 4 1 sample per two months these scenarios were slightly comparable to all four systematic subsampling scenarios i e weekly bi weekly monthly and bi monthly based on the number of samples drawn from each month however the samples drawn from the month were based on a random basis as samples were taken at irregular intervals for all sampling stations most of the random sampling subsets were easily subsampled as enough sampled observations were available to meet the criteria however in the case of random scenario 1 when the number of sampled observations in a month was not enough to meet the criteria of four samples per month all sampled observations were drawn for that particular month five subsets were developed for each random scenario generating a total of 20 subsets all four random scenarios will be referred to as the four systematic scenarios to better interpret the results for tss and tp random scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 will be referred to as weekly bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios respectively 3 3 evaluation of statistical models the annual load was considered for the evaluation of statistical models at all sampling stations and sampling scenarios the annual load is a summation of multiple unit loads over a year a unit daily load was selected in this study as observations of streamflow and tss were frequently available at a daily timestep so the annual load is a summation of all n daily unit loads and is equated as 23 a n n u a l l o a d i 1 n k c i q i where ci is the tss concentration in mg l of the ith observation qi is the daily streamflow in m3 s of the ith observation k is the unit conversion factor to loads n is the total number of days in a year the value of k is taken as 86 40 unit conversion factor when the concentration unit is mg l and the streamflow unit is m3 s and the load unit is kg day 4 evaluation criteria 4 1 evaluation criteria for tss load estimates the accuracy and precision of various statistical models were evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and modified percentage bias pbias as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 the modified percentage bias was considered as a primary evaluator and nse was considered a secondary evaluator in this study the details of nse and modified percentage bias has been presented in supplementary section 2 accuracy and precision in load estimates of all the statistical models are shown using box plots accuracy was tested using the percentage difference pdiff values based on the central tendency using the median value on the boxplot a median value near zero suggests good enough accuracy in load estimates similarly precision was tested for the pdiff values ranging between the first quartile q1 and the third quartile q3 of the boxplot the first quartile and third quartile range together will be referred to hereby as an inter quartile range in the case of pdiff values inter quartile range values of the boxplot between 20 were considered acceptable precision for statistical models acceptable pdiff values are further shown in fig 3 a 4 2 evaluation criteria for tp load estimates tp load estimates for all the statistical models were evaluated based on the total load over the sampling window for all sampled observations as the number of samples was not available at the daily time step as in the case of tss samples hence generating annual loads was not feasible in this case total load over a whole monitoring period was considered in this study the total load over a given monitoring window is the summation of individual unit loads on sampled days the total tp load calculation is described in supplementary section 2 two performance evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the load estimates for all the statistical models nse and flux bias statistics fbs the description and acceptance criteria of nse is explained in supplementary section 2 fbs is a dimensionless depiction of the relative difference between the summation of the estimated loads including all sampled days and the summation of the loads including all sampled days hirsch 2014 fbs is computed as 24 f b s p m o p m where 25 o i 1 n l i i 1 n k c i q i 26 p m i 1 n l i i 1 n k c i q i where li is the observed load in kg day on the ith sampled day ci is observed concentration in mg l on ith sampled day qi is observed streamflow in m3 s on the ith sampled day l i is the estimated load in kg day on the ith sampled day ĉi is estimated concentration in mg l on the ith sampled day k is the unit conversion factor to loads n is the total number of samples in the sampling window the value of k is taken as 86 40 the unit conversion factor when the concentration unit is mg l and streamflow unit is m3 s and the load unit is kg day hirsch 2014 developed a monte carlo subsampling approach to analyze if the fbs was a good indicator of the true bias which is only possible when samples are taken every day he described that fbs can be a good indicator to analyze the potential bias problem when the true load for all days in the sampling window is not available the values of fbs near zero signify that the model is showing unbiased load estimates while a positive fbs value shows a positive bias and a negative fbs value shows a negative bias the author suggested the acceptable range of fbs to be between 0 1 to 0 1 which is generally equivalent to 10 of the true bias hirsch 2014 computations of the fbs values were generated with a substantial number of observations ranging between 400 and 1500 samples over 10 to 20 years of monitoring window across all selected tp sampling stations accuracy and precision in load estimates of all the statistical models are shown using box plots accuracy was tested using the fbs values based on the central tendency using the median value on the boxplot a median value near zero suggests good enough accuracy in load estimates similarly precision was tested for the fbs values ranging between the first quartile q1 and the third quartile q3 of the boxplot the first quartile and third quartile range together will be referred to hereby as an inter quartile range in the case of fbs inter quartile range values of the boxplot between 0 1 were considered as acceptable precision for statistical models acceptable fbs values are further shown in fig 3 b 4 3 t test for load estimates a t test on independent groups was further performed to analyze the load estimates among the statistical models for both tss and tp kim 2015 a t test was performed to compare the results of load estimates from statistical models to that of observed loads comparison of load estimates between the statistical models and comparison of load estimates of statistical models under all sampling scenarios the significance level α was selected as 0 05 27 μ 1 μ 2 0 h 0 28 μ 1 μ 2 0 h a where h0 represents the null hypothesis and ha represents the alternate hypothesis the difference between the individual groups was considered to be statistically significant when the computed p value was smaller than the significance level α similarly the difference between the individual groups was considered to be statistically not significant when the computed p value was greater than the significance level α 4 4 uncertainty analysis of water quality load estimation the codes of statistical models provide standard error se estimates on prediction supplementary section 5 these measures help in getting a qualitative and quantitative idea of the uncertainties however the assumptions for se are not uniform for the models hirsch 2014 for example se remains virtually constant across all the days on the other hand se varies as a function of discharge year and seasons in wrtds model hirsch 2014 therefore it is not possible to compare the uncertainties of the models in the same platform using se estimates therefore to have a clear idea about prediction uncertainties we analyze uncertainties from all sources collectively using the quantile regression technique a stochastic approach koenker and bassett 1978 the statistical models simulations have been considered for uncertainty analysis the details of the process have been discussed in supplementary section 6 5 results and discussion we have provided the details of the selected models structure with benchmark references in the methodology section section 3 the models are well known and widely used all over the world in spite of that we did the validity check of the models with leave one out cross validation approach supplementary section 4 the leave one out cross validation results figs s3 a f and s4 a d show the validity of the models up to a satisfactory level with cross validation error rate cver closer to zero avila et al 2018 besides we have mentioned and discussed the accuracy and precision of the results in the following sections as these are critical in the evaluation of regression models and the effect of sampling scenarios because accuracy indicates the degree of systematic error and precision indicates the degree of dispersion the details of the results and related discussion on analysis are provided below 5 1 total suspended solid tss 5 1 1 evaluation of the performance of the models in all cases under all sampling scenarios and sampling stations with different drainage areas wrtds k wrtds linear loadest models i e l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 and the composite models displayed satisfactory tss load estimates fig 4 and table 6 while simple models i e interpolation and beale ratio model and curved linear loadest models i e l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed unsatisfactory tss load estimates fig 4 and table 6 over many instances based on evaluation criteria i e pdiff statistics and nse statistics section 4 1 and statistical analysis section 4 3 these results are not surprising given differences among the sampling scenarios poor sampling coverage fig s9 drainage areas and the large number of model configurations that were considered despite this there were some clear patterns in the results to be precise load estimates of the wrtds k model were within 20 of the observed loads for most instances i e good accuracy and precision an inter quartile range of pdiff values ranging between 19 21 to 19 57 with a median pdiff value of 2 79 and highest median nse value of 0 64 among all statistical models fig 4 furthermore statistical analysis results were also confirming that wrtds k model displayed significantly different load estimates over fewer instances around 31 table 6 in contrast wrtds model showed better accuracy with a median pdiff value of 2 43 but it also showed low precision with inter quartile pdiff values ranging from 27 72 to 16 07 which indicated that the model tended to overestimate the observed loads for some instances fig 4 statistical analysis further revealed wrtds model as the second lowest significantly different load estimates of around 33 table 6 meanwhile loadest models that included linear streamflow terms i e l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 displayed similar patterns in load estimates this was evident with the statistical analysis with statistically not significant p 0 05 load estimates supplementary section 3 table s5 the models displayed modest variability in load estimates satisfactory accuracy with median pdiff values ranging between 7 14 to 10 61 while displaying low precision with an inter quartile range of pdiff values ranging between 12 82 to 29 16 and median nse values ranging from 0 60 to 0 62 fig 4 similarly loadest models that included additional quadratic streamflow terms i e l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed similar patterns in load estimates while statistical analysis exhibited that l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 models displayed no significant differences p 0 05 in load estimates supplementary section 3 table s5 the models displayed significant variability in load estimates with potential overestimation of observed loads for most instances good accuracy with median pdiff values ranging between 1 96 and 6 71 unsatisfactory precision with an inter quartile range pdiff values ranging between 41 86 to 18 53 and median nse values ranging from 0 55 to 0 58 fig 4 moreover the composite model showed low precision i e it underestimated the observed loads over many instances satisfactory accuracy with a median pdiff value of 10 47 an inter quartile pdiff values ranging between 14 49 to 28 89 and highly variable nse values ranging from 0 29 to 0 74 fig 4 these findings were quite consistent based on statistical analysis as load estimates were substantially different over 44 of instances for the composite model table 6 on the other hand simple statistical models i e beale ratio median pdiff value of 22 35 and an inter quartile range pdiff values ranging between 14 01 to 51 84 and interpolation median pdiff value of 36 and an inter quartile range pdiff values ranging between 11 8 to 59 01 showed unsatisfactory load estimates based on accuracy and precision fig 4 statistical analysis also displayed that load estimates of the interpolation model were significantly different from that of other statistical models p 0 05 for all instances supplementary section 3 table s5 5 1 2 effect of sampling coverage sampling scenarios and drainage area of monitoring stations an evaluation of sampling coverage over the entire range of the probability of exceedance of the flow duration curve was conducted the results indicate there was poor sampling coverage for the high flow at all the gauging stations fig s9 a n though ausable river near springbank big creek near walsingham and big otter creek near calton have better sampling coverage for high flow figs s9 a c as a consequence loading estimate gets hampered as high flows can potentially deliver substantial loads walling and webb 1981 ferguson 1987 preston et al 1989 kuhnert et al 2012 lee et al 2016 in addition sampling coverage is poor for all flow types at saugeen river near port elgin south maitland river at summerhill and thames river at thamesville therefore we have delved deeply to evaluate the models at different gauging stations in advance of analysis for different sampling scenarios fig 5 results at each sampling station are shown using the threshold percentage fig 6 and statistical analysis table s3 threshold percentage refers to the number of times the load estimates of the statistical models were within 20 of the observed loads at a particular station statistical analysis refers to the t test to compare the mean observed load to the mean estimated loads of statistical models it is evident that there was significant variability in the results based on the load estimates among the sampling stations in particular the performance of all models was unsatisfactory at sturgeon creek and south maitland river stations with a threshold percentage below 30 fig 6 this was consistent with the statistical analysis which indicated that load estimates of most statistical models were significantly different p 0 05 compared to the observed loads at these two stations table s3 wrtds k performed slightly better than other statistical models at canagagigue creek and humber river stations with a threshold percentage of around 45 and the statistical analysis further indicated that load estimates were statistically not significant p 0 05 table s3 however based on the findings load estimates of l 2 and l 5 wrtds and wrtds k models at ausable river station were satisfactory as load estimates were not statistically different p 0 05 table s3 and these models showed a threshold percentage of about 40 60 fig 6 similarly load estimates of the most statistical models were not statistically significant p 0 05 at saugeen river thames river maitland river stations thames river at ingersoll humber river at weston big creek and big otter creek stations table s3 with high threshold percentage between 20 and 85 fig 6 hence were satisfactory in fact wrtds k was the best performing model at saugeen river thames river and maitland river stations with a threshold percentage above 50 p 0 05 on the other hand linear loadest models and wrtds k performed better than most models at credit river and big otter creek at calton stations with an overall threshold percentage of around 40 to 60 fig 6 unsatisfactory performance of all the statistical models at sturgeon creek south maitland river canagagigue creek and to some extent at humber river stations was likely due to two reasons lack of fit in the relationship of tss and streamflow and variable loading conditions while most of the sampling stations selected in this study had large drainage areas the drainage areas of sturgeon creek south maitland river canagagigue creek and humber river were relatively small ranging between 14 2 km2 to 296 km2 with a relatively smaller drainage area these stations exhibited the most variability in streamflow sturgeon creek and canagagigue creek displayed the highest streamflow variability with a cv of 2 11 and 2 07 and an r b flashiness index of 0 47 and 0 38 respectively supplementary section 1 table s1 this is evident that all the statistical models failed to capture the variability in streamflow considering the daily time step which would further lead to high variability in loads at these four sampling stations meanwhile the lack of fit in the linear relationship between streamflow and sediments at ausable river r 0 03 and south maitland river r 0 0003 stations leads to unsatisfactory performance of linear loadest models fig 6 wrtds model that does not necessarily rely on the relationship between streamflow and concentration showed less biased results as compared to loadest models particularly at ausable river station in general the performance of statistical models at saugeen river and thames river stations was majorly influenced by the sampling window while most of the sampling stations selected for this study had a long sampling window of more than 10 years these three stations had a short sampling window of fewer than five years using a frequent sampling approach at a relatively shorter time step as in the case of the weekly sampling scenario showed good results at these two stations despite a very small sampling window of fewer than five years as seen from the results the use of more frequent samples for a small sampling window generally allowed these statistical models to better understand the pattern and behavior of the tss concentration across variable streamflow conditions throughout the sampling window and with further increase in sampling interval under bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios the predictive power of these statistical models decreased as relatively fewer samples with infrequent sampling for a very small sampling window did not allow the models to understand the pattern and behavior of tss concentration across streamflow conditions in addition low to moderate variability in streamflow conditions flashiness index ranging between 0 1 and 0 3 and moderate to a high correlation between streamflow and total suspended solids correlation ranging between 0 5 and 0 72 with a longer monitoring window 10 20 years better allowed the statistical models to accurately predict the tss loads at big otter creek big creek big otter creek at calton thames river at ingersoll credit river and humber river at weston stations in general accuracy and precision in load estimates among most statistical models were heavily influenced by sampling scenarios littlewood 1995 kronvang and bruhn 1996 letcher et al 1999 lee et al 2016 in this junction fig 5 depicts the performance of all statistical models with pdiff and nse values under all six sampling scenarios thus table 7 serves as a guide to understanding how well the statistical models performed under various sampling scenarios through statistical comparison of load estimates furthermore a comparison of load estimates of statistical models under various sampling scenarios is shown in table s6 precisely the interpolation model does not take into account any relationship with streamflow and beale ratio model considers all sampled observations to generate average load so both of these models depend largely on the number of sampling observations used to construct the model lee et al 2016 when more samples were available at frequent intervals as in the case of the weekly sampling scenario both models performed better as a short interval between the observations would better allow the model to predict the load estimates by increasing the probability of including more samples that are influenced by streamflow hirsch 2014 in fact beale ratio model displayed good enough accuracy and precision in load estimates under the weekly sampling scenario however efficiency in load estimates further declined with an increase in sampling interval as it was observed that there was a monotonic decline in the precision of load estimates with pdiff values extending up to 50 of the observed loads however the interpolation model displayed unsatisfactory load estimates under all sampling scenarios and further displayed that predictive power in load estimates declined with an increase in the sampling interval these findings were consistent with the statistical analysis and nse statistics as load estimates of the interpolation model were significantly different over more than 50 of instances under all sampling scenarios table 7 and showed a consistent decrease in nse values with an increase in the sampling interval fig 5 statistical comparison for these two models showed similarities with both the models showing significant differences in load estimates when compared under most of the sampling scenarios p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s6 to be precise loadest models were less influenced by the type of sampling scenarios considered particularly for longer sampling periods these considerations were evident from the results as l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 models that included linear streamflow terms performed better under all sampling scenarios fig 5 supplementary section 3 table s6 unsatisfactory performance of curved linear loadest l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 models was primarily due to no apparent curvature in the relationship between streamflow and tss for various scenarios which limited the potential to predict accurate and precise load estimates in quadratic models fritz 2014 on the other hand the wrtds k model displayed accurate and precise load estimates under weekly bi weekly and stratified sampling scenarios with pdiff values between 20 of the observed loads for most instances while under bi monthly and random sampling scenarios the wrtds k model showed a modest decrease in precision with pdiff values exceeding the acceptable 20 percent criteria these findings were very consistent based on nse values and statistical analysis which indicated that the wrtds k model displayed higher median nse value under weekly bi weekly and stratified sampling and further load estimates under these three sampling scenarios were significantly different over less than 25 instances table 7 statistical analysis also showed that the load estimates of the wrtds k model were significantly different among the sampling scenarios with a p value less than 0 05 for most instances supplementary section 3 table s6 the wrtds model showed a marked decrease in precision with an increase in the sampling interval as in the case of bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios compared to weekly sampling indicating the general tendency to overestimate the observed loads with pdiff values above 20 of the observed loads statistical analysis showed that load estimates of the wrtds model under weekly bi weekly and stratified sampling scenarios were significantly different for less than 30 of instances table 7 whereas the precision of the load estimates of the wrtds model showed a marginal increase under the stratified sampling method compared to the random sampling approach unlike loadest models that build a single regression model across whole monitoring duration based on the relationship between streamflow and tss the wrtds model uses weighted regressions based on time discharge and season and thus develops an individual regression model for each sampling observation when more samples were available at frequent intervals to build the wrtds model as in the case with weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios accuracy and to some extent precision improved as more frequent samples at weekly and bi weekly time steps better allowing the model to predict load estimates sharifi et al 2017 under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios where samples were not frequently available wrtds model showed weak precision as using fewer samples and samples not covering extreme streamflow conditions in model formation generally limited the potential to generate precise load estimates aulenbach 2013 wrtds k model constructs an autoregressive lag 1 model using the standardized residuals generated from the wrtds model at shorter intervals as in the case of weekly and bi weekly and to some extent under monthly sampling scenario the wrtds k model showed good enough accuracy and precision as more observations at frequent intervals allowed the model to predict loads better near the observation points however wrtds k showed low accuracy and similar results to the wrtds model under bi monthly sampling scenarios which was evidently due to samples taken at sporadic intervals and consisting of longer gaps resulting in no possible load computations using the wrtds k model and the results were mainly based on wrtds estimates the composite model showed the second best accurate and precise results after wrtds k under weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios more observations at frequent intervals allowed the model to interpolate better between the residuals to predict accurate and precise load estimates appling et al 2015 however an increase in sampling interval in the case of monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios decreased the precision in load estimates as interpolating over longer gaps generally hindered accurate load prediction ferrant et al 2013 appling et al 2015 however the composite model showed better accuracy and precision in load estimates under weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios with pdiff values between 20 of the observed loads and statistical analysis further revealed that load estimates under these two scenarios were significantly different for less than 35 of instances on the contrary it was found that the precision further decreased with an increase in the sampling interval as under the monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios with pdiff values extending below 20 implying that the composite model seemed to underestimate the observed loads at a longer interval between the samples and statistical analysis and nse statistics showed similar results as the load estimates under these two sampling scenarios were significantly different for more than 45 instances table 7 and there was observed to be high variability in nse values based on the inter quartile range fig 5 statistical analysis further demonstrated that load estimates of the composite model were significantly different under weekly sampling scenarios compared to other sampling scenarios p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s6 5 1 3 uncertainty analysis of sediment load estimation in the process of quantification of uncertainty using the quantile regression technique we have focused on p and r factors supplementary section 6 1 fig s7 presents the p factor and r factor during models simulation of tp for different monitoring stations and sampling scenarios p factor equal to 1 and r factor equal to 0 representing the best model simulations with no uncertainty the figure clearly shows that the uncertainty is the least in case of wrtds and wrtds k in comparison to other models for weekly p factor 0 34 0 79 r factor 0 22 0 57 bi weekly p factor 0 3 0 68 r factor 0 2 0 57 and monthly p factor 0 27 0 7 r factor 0 2 0 53 sampling scenarios fig s7 a c however for bi monthly p factor 0 47 0 79 r factor 0 22 0 52 random p factor 0 44 0 75 r factor 0 29 0 53 and stratified p factor 0 39 0 70 r factor 0 37 0 65 scenarios uncertainties increase for all the models irrespective of gauging stations although uncertainties are comparatively high in the gauging stations other than ausable river near springbank and big creek near walsingham for all models and sampling scenarios fig s7 a c fig s9 a n this may be due to poor sampling coverage of the grab sample fig s9 besides the large variation in r value is due to higher standard deviations in model simulation fig s7 meanwhile the results are supported by standard error estimation in section 5 1 the results are also in agreement with the discussion in previous sub sections however the uncertainty needs to be further analyzed with a longer period data set for becoming very sure about the applicability of the technique of predicting load data because unavailable datasets render many processes unidentifiable therefore this lack of knowledge should be accounted for during the uncertainty analysis for better environmental decision support making 5 2 total phosphorus tp 5 2 1 evaluation of the performance of the models overall the wrtds k wrtds composite and to some extent curved linear loadest models i e l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed satisfactory load estimates while interpolation and linear loadest models i e l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 displayed unsatisfactory load estimates over many instances based on fbs statistics nse statistics and statistical analysis fig 8 and table 8 for different sampling scenarios and monitoring stations covering variable drainage areas in particular wrtds k model showed satisfactory precision with a median fbs value of 0 01 and an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 04 to 0 09 fig 7 besides the wrtds model also displayed acceptable accuracy with a median fbs value of 0 01 and an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 06 to 0 08 the composite model displayed good accuracy with a median fbs value of 0 03 and displayed satisfactory precision with an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 04 to 0 11 statistical analysis and nse statistics further presented that load estimates of these three models were significantly different over fewer instances for about 10 table 8 and a median nse value greater than 0 7 for these models fig 7 load estimates among loadest models in the case of tp displayed opposite patterns in comparison to tss i e curved linear loadest models l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 performed better than linear loadest models l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 the influence of drainage area and in stream processes may be the reason behind this instance lee et al 2016 curved linear models l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 displayed good accuracy with median fbs values ranging between 0 04 and 0 07 and showed satisfactory precision with inter quartile range fbs values ranging between 0 14 to 0 02 indicating that these models displayed modest variability in load estimates with a modest overestimation bias over some instances fig 7 statistical analysis displayed that load estimates of curved linear loadest models were significantly different over less than 35 of instances table 8 statistical analysis further indicated that load estimates using the curved linear loadest models were not significantly different p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s7 in contrast linear loadest models l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 displayed unsatisfactory accuracy and precision in load estimates with median fbs values ranging between 0 18 to 0 24 and inter quartile range fbs values ranging between 0 09 to 0 38 fig 7 linear loadest models tended to underestimate the observed loads for most instances statistical analysis revealed that load estimates of linear laodest models were significantly different over the range of 62 to 85 instances table 8 unsatisfactory performance of linear l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 loadest models for tp load estimates was mainly influenced by the lack of fit between streamflow and tp concentration at high streamflow conditions in the case of simple models the beale ratio model was not evaluated for tp load estimates as this model computes loads over the entire sampling window the interpolation model displayed unsatisfactory accuracy and precision in load estimates with a median fbs value of 0 14 and an inter quartile range of fbs values ranging between 0 03 to 0 33 fig 7 statistical analysis for comparison among the models indicated the load estimates of the interpolation model were statistically different compared to other models p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s7 5 2 2 effect of sampling coverage sampling scenarios and drainage area of monitoring stations an evaluation of sampling coverage over the entire range of the probability of exceedance of the flow duration curve was conducted and indicated there was poor sampling coverage for all types of flows and especially for the high flow at all the gauging stations fig s10 moreover it is even poor in saugeen river near port elgin fig s10 g therefore we have delved deeply to evaluate the models at different gauging stations in advance of analysis for different sampling scenarios fig 8 the performance of statistical models at all tp sampling stations is shown in fig 9 the comparison of statistical models using statistical analysis at all tp sampling stations is shown in table s4 the performance of statistical models across most of the sampling locations had significant differences loadest models showed the most site specific variability in load estimates compared to other statistical models performance of most statistical models except linear loadest l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 models were consistently better at thames river at byron grand river at centre wellington and thames river at jacobs road stations for wrtds wrtds k composite interpolation and curved linear loadest l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 models the threshold percentage at these three stations ranged between 65 and 100 percent furthermore statistical analysis showed that the load estimates of all statistical models at grand river at centre wellington and thames river at byron stations were not significantly different p 0 05 table s4 whereas load estimates of only linear loadest models were significantly different p 0 05 at the thames river at jacobs road station among all statistical models table s4 l 8 l 9 composite wrtds and wrtds k models displayed better results at sydenham river and don river stations with a threshold percentage ranging between 55 and 90 fig 9 the statistical analysis further showed that load estimates of all the statistical models were statistically not significant p 0 05 table s4 linear loadest models performed better at saugeen river and humber river stations with a threshold percentage ranging between 55 and 90 and statistical analysis further confirmed that load estimates were not significantly different p 0 05 at these two stations table s4 the wrtds wrtds k and composite models displayed better results at ausable river near parkhill station with a threshold percentage between 60 and 75 fig 9 the performance of most statistical models at credit river and grand river at bridge port was unsatisfactory however interpolation and wrtds k displayed better results than other models at station credit river with threshold percentages ranging between 50 and 56 with a threshold percentage of about five percent regression models were less accurate at this location credit river and statistical analysis further showed that load estimates of regression models were significantly different compared to observed loads p 0 05 table s4 the performance of models at thames river at byron and grand river at centre wellington stations was mainly governed by the overall fit between streamflow and tp concentration over the entire sampling window these two stations showed the least association between streamflow and tp unsatisfactory performance of linear l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 loadest models at these two stations was mainly due to no linear relationship between streamflow and tp on the contrary this streamflow tp relation was better captured by curved linear l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 loadest models especially during high streamflow conditions supplementary section 1 fig s2 and fig s10 on the other hand the wrtds model which is generally less influenced by the overall fit between streamflow and tp showed the most accurate and precise load estimates under all sampling scenarios the composite and wrtds k model further improved the accuracy and precision of load estimates compared to l 9 and wrtds models which accounted for the correction in load estimates based on residual departures there was high variability in the accuracy and precision of load estimates among statistical models at thames river at jacobs road sydenham river don river and ausable river near parkhill stations these four stations demonstrated a moderate to strong positive correlation between streamflow and tp supplementary section 1 and fig s2 despite showing a moderate to strong correlation at these four stations linear l 1 l 3 l 4 and l 7 loadest models showed unsatisfactory load estimates with likely underestimation bias under all sampling scenarios at these stations the underestimation bias of linear loadest models was typically due to a lack of linearity over high streamflow conditions while the better performance of curved linear l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 loadest models was mainly due to better fit in streamflow and tp concentration throughout high streamflow conditions it is particularly important to understand the performance of these statistical models throughout high streamflow conditions because the total load is mainly influenced by the period of high streamflows fig s10 this was clear with the results for these four stations as linear loadest generally displayed the tendency to underestimate over high flows which impacted the overall load estimates of these models despite showing accurate load estimates over the moderate and low streamflow conditions meanwhile saugeen river and humber stations displayed a good correlation between streamflow and tp concentration across the sampling interval with a correlation coefficient value of above 0 60 supplementary section 1 and fig s2 unlike the performance of linear loadest models at the thames river at jacobs road and sydenham river stations displaying modest underestimation bias the performance of these models improved considerably at saugeen river and humber river stations compared to curved linear loadest models better performance of linear loadest models than curved linear loadest models was due to better linear fit between streamflow and tp concentration especially over moderate to high flow conditions while curved linear loadest models tended to overestimate the observed loads mainly due to overprediction across moderate to high flow conditions moreover wrtds wrtds k and composite models showed good performance over these two stations however there was a significant influence of sampling scenarios on the precision of load estimates among these models as there exists a positive serial correlation between streamflow and tp sampling during moderate to high streamflow conditions is of paramount importance this condition would be generally satisfied under weekly and bi weekly scenarios as sampling at short time intervals would increase the probability of capturing more samples across moderate to high streamflow conditions however the probability of collecting samples during wide ranging streamflow conditions would decrease under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios with samples taken at longer time intervals which was evident in the results as these models showed moderate underestimation and overestimation bias under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios statistical models displayed the least accurate and precise load estimates at credit river and grand river at bridge port stations these two stations displayed no substantial correlation between streamflow and tp concentration with no meaningful correlation it was obvious that linear loadest models would possibly display unsatisfactory load estimates however no model showed load estimates within the acceptance requirements wrtds k composite and interpolation models to some extent performed better at these stations and displayed high accuracy and precision in load estimates using frequent sampling approaches under weekly and bi weekly sampling scenarios this is mainly because short gaps between the subsequent samples better allowed these models to predict accurate load estimates however under monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios these models showed unsatisfactory load estimates suggesting that longer gaps of more than 30 days were not suitable for predicting accurate load estimates using these models at credit river station while the performance of the wrtds and loadest models was consistently unsatisfactory under all sampling scenarios at credit river the unsatisfactory performance of these models was primarily due to the overall lack of fit between stream flow and tp concentration and variable loading conditions supplementary section 1 fig s2 and table s2 there existed a high variability in tp concentration across the moderate to high streamflow conditions in addition to that tp concentrations were highest during the period of low streamflow conditions fig s10 with evident variation in tp concentrations across the range of streamflow conditions these models would not be capable to capture such variations in tp concentration with respect to streamflow which was quite clear with results as these models showed unsatisfactory load estimates with significant underestimation bias under all sampling scenarios however the performance of curved linear loadest models was better at grand river at bridge port as including the curvature in the relationship of streamflow and tp better explained the overall fit across the sampling window especially in case of moderate to high streamflow conditions for further investigation we consider fig 8 which shows the performance of all statistical models using pdiff values under four sampling scenarios table 9 serves as a guide to understanding how well the statistical models performed under various sampling scenarios through statistical analysis for the comparison of load estimates of statistical models furthermore a comparison of load estimates of statistical models under various sampling scenarios is shown in supplementary section 3 and table s8 under different sampling scenarios and monitoring stations with variable areas the interpolation model showed the highest variability in tp load estimates p 0 05 the interpolation model showed good accuracy and precision in load estimates under the weekly sampling scenario compared to other sampling scenarios sharifi et al 2017 however the interpolation model showed a substantial decrease in the precision and accuracy of load estimates with a further increase in sampling interval as in the case of bi weekly monthly and bi monthly sampling scenarios p 0 05 hirsch 2014 appling et al 2015 lee et al 2016 sharifi et al 2017 the interpolation model does not take into account any relationship with streamflow and is therefore largely dependent on the number of sampling observations used to construct the model preston et al 1989 littlewood 1995 hirsch 2014 lee et al 2016 of all the statistical models considered linear loadest models displayed unsatisfactory accuracy and precision in load estimates with fbs values outside the acceptance criteria of 0 1 for most cases statistical analysis showed that load estimates of linear loadest models were significantly different over many instances ranging from 26 to 52 table 9 statistical analysis further indicated that load estimates of linear loadest models under all sampling scenarios were statistically not significant p 0 05 supplementary section 3 table s8 compared to linear loadest models curved linear loadest models l 2 l 5 l 6 l 8 and l 9 demonstrated greater precision and accuracy in load estimates table 9 and table s8 furthermore it was observed that the wrtds wrtds k and composite model displayed accurate and precise load estimates under weekly bi weekly and monthly sampling scenarios with fbs values within 0 1 of the acceptance criteria fig 8 over most instances and a high median nse value ranging from 0 51 to 0 90 this finding is supported by hirsch 2014 appling et al 2015 lee et al 2016 sharifi et al 2017 however it was found that with an increase in the sampling interval these models showed a modest decrease in precision hirsch 2014 zhang and hirsch 2019 the decrease in precision of load estimates among these models was mainly due to long gaps in the sampling interval zhang and hirsch 2019 it suggests that most of the subsets designed at all sampling stations successfully captured high and low flow periods the decrease in precision of load estimates among these models may be due to some of the subsets that would have significantly under sampled high and low flow periods due to longer gaps in the sampling appling et al 2015 sharifi et al 2017 5 2 3 uncertainty analysis of phosphorous load estimation in the process of quantification of uncertainty using the quantile regression technique we have focused on p and r factors supplementary section 6 1 fig s8 presents the p factor and r factor during models simulation of tp for different monitoring stations and sampling scenarios p factor equal to 1 and r factor equal to 0 representing the best model simulations with no uncertainty the figure clearly shows that the uncertainty is the least in case of wrtds and wrtds k in comparison to other models for weekly p factor 0 3 0 7 r factor 0 15 0 4 and and bi weekly p factor 0 28 0 7 r factor 0 16 0 4 sampling scenarios fig s8 a b however for monthly p factor 0 38 0 6 r factor 0 26 0 4 and bi monthly p factor 0 61 0 79 r factor 0 32 0 43 scenarios uncertainties increase for all the models irrespective of gauging stations although uncertainties are comparatively high in don river at pottery road humber river at old mill road grand river at bridge port ausable river near park hill thames river at jacobs road and saugeen river near port elgin gauging stations for all models and sampling scenarios fig s8 a b the results are supported by standard error estimation in section 5 2 the results are also in agreement with the discussion in previous sub sections the probable reason may be the poor sampling coverage of grab samples for the gauging stations fig s10 a j however uncertainty in humber river at old mill road grand river at bridge port ausable river near park hill thames river at jacobs road may get affected by the estimated streamflow as mentioned in section 2 2 in this junction we want to argue particularly with frequent sampling and similar efforts between years that may be the only way to confirm such an outcome relying on the method therefore the use of methods that fully account for uncertainty is recommended to obtain statistically valid results in a wider range of conditions however if sampling is so irregular that important fluctuations are missed entirely in some years the uncertainty analysis could become dubious in interpretation and usefulness therefore the uncertainty needs to be further analyzed with a longer period data set for becoming very sure about the applicability of the technique of predicting load data 6 conclusion in this study tss and tp loads from various tributaries in southern ontario canada were computed using wide ranging statistical models statistical models including simple models i e interpolation and beale ratio estimator simple and multiple linear regression i e loadest models weighted regression i e wrtds and error correction models i e wrtds k and composite model were evaluated the performance of statistical models to estimate tss and tp loads were further evaluated under various sampling scenarios and sampling stations with variable watershed drainage areas the precise conclusions of this study are listed below the wrtds k and wrtds models showed the most accurate and precise estimates over most sampling scenarios and sampling stations for tss load and tp load respectively while simple models interpolation and beale ratio model did not do well for most possible cases furthermore the performances of wrtds wrtds k and the composite model were generally better under weekly bi weekly and monthly sampling scenarios but were less consistent under the bi monthly sampling scenario while other models were statistically non significant over the most possible sampling scenarios in addition most statistical models showed satisfactory load estimates at sampling stations with large drainage areas although no statistical models showed the potential to accurately predict tp and tss loads at sampling stations with small drainage areas credit authorship contribution

2558,water scarcity and carbon emissions are two of the most pressing issues facing the world water rights trading wrt and carbon emissions trading cet can alleviate pressure on resources and the environment and promote sustainable development however the relationship between water scarcity and carbon emissions results in a complex water carbon nexus between sectors to explore the mechanisms of interaction among related sectors in the context of wrt and cet this study built a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture industry and forestry sectors aifss to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations four cities in the dongjiang river basin drb in southern china were analyzed to quantify the influence of key parameters on the strategic evolution process and reveal the relationship between sectors under the effect of wrt and cet the results indicated that there is a significant impact of agricultural net benefits in the drb on the choice of aifs strategy which in turn leads to better wrt that promotes the mutual coupling of aifs strategies in addition strategy coupling brings higher relative returns and risks to the game system and multiple markets enable aifs to hedge losses that may result from single market failures in the mutual game furthermore aifs behavioral strategies are not necessarily aligned with market expectations which has implications for us as we guide the development of wrt and cet keywords water carbon nexus water rights trading carbon emissions trading tripartite evolutionary game data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rapid development has intensified the demand for water and energy flörke et al 2018 sognnaes et al 2021 resulting in serious environmental issues including water shortages and massive carbon emissions kummu et al 2016 peters et al 2012 which are intertwined chen et al 2019 for instance carbon emissions have given rise to global warming matthews et al 2009 and global warming has exacerbated water scarcity he et al 2021 similarly in economic production processes water and carbon exhibit a high degree of synergy agriculture and industry for example both have substantial water consumption and carbon emissions associated with their production processes it is therefore ineffectual to consider water utilization and carbon emissions in isolation and identifying the internal relationships and heterogeneity between sectors in the water carbon nexus can contribute to the integrated management of these sectors this link between water and carbon emissions has prompted various studies of the water carbon nexus methods for investigating the water carbon nexus include input output analysis life cycle analysis computable general equilibrium material flow analysis and system dynamics bodunrin et al 2018 chhipi shrestha et al 2017 elshkaki 2019 fan et al 2018 wang et al 2022 various studies have considered ways to reveal the water carbon nexus within individual sectors liao et al 2016 roibás et al 2015 tang et al 2020 silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 for example assessed the land water energy nexus of sugarcane production li et al 2013 moreover calculated carbon emissions from agricultural water while su et al 2019 highlighted the synergistic effect of the water carbon nexus in industrial production other studies have examined the flow of virtual water and carbon associated with trade and consumption processes in economic networks chen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 some researchers have considered the water carbon nexus across multiple sectors within a region such as li et al 2020 who quantified the characteristics of the energy carbon water nexus embodied in sectors in china yang et al 2018 developed a consumption emissions coefficient and index to analyze the sectoral energy water carbon nexus in shanghai and beijing zhang and vesselinov 2017 examined interrelationships and trade offs in the sectoral water energy food nexus quantifying the effects of future climate change on cycles of water carbon coupling su et al 2018 predicted the carbon energy water nexus in an urbanizing catchment in china others have developed hybrid network management systems to analyze water carbon flows reifsnyder et al 2021 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b the characteristics and quantification of the water carbon nexus at different scales have been widely studied meanwhile systems that employ market mechanisms to optimize resource allocation have been widely implemented to achieve sustainability and reduce environmental harm in this regard water rights trading wrt and carbon emissions trading cet chong sunding 2006 zhu et al 2019 can improve resource allocation between regions or sectors but they can also intensify resource competitiveness making the water carbon nexus more complicated fang chen 2017 studies have focused on building models to simulate the market environment and competitive behavior among stakeholders and identify the main factors affecting trading behavior and its optimal solutions di et al 2020 for example used a dynamic differential game and pricing game to calculate the optimal trading quantity and price for different regions erfani et al 2014 built a generalized optimization model to simulate water rights transaction processes womble and hanemann 2020 studied transaction costs in the colorado water market and revealed its systematic heterogeneity a few studies meanwhile have integrated the synergy between different resource trading markets for instance settre et al 2019 revealed the synergy between wrt and cet in coexisting carbon and water markets moreover studies have revealed obvious synergies among the agriculture industry and forestry sectors aifss under wrt and cet connor et al 2016 mushtaq et al 2015 tan et al 2021 this means the behavior of one department will affect other departments the implementation of wrt and cet has deepened both resource cooperation and conflict among aifss creating new requirements for the formulation of resource policies and management it has been extensively studied how departments behave in the context of wrt or cet with technological advancements and farmland management agriculture is able to participate in national emissions trading systems and water rights trading markets as compared to traditional agricultural production brandt svendsen 2011 lee 2017 zhang et al 2021a and agricultural carbon reduction can reduce irrigation water consumption synergistically silalertruksa gheewala 2018 in the context of resource market trading industry can choose to use traditional water saving and emission reduction methods or trade with other sectors dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 and similarly water saving and carbon reduction in industry are synergistic tan et al 2021 in the process of growing plantation forests consume watershed resources dresel et al 2018 yu et al 2019 especially when short term mature trees or fruit trees are selected nordblom et al 2015 the consumption of water is greater and does not meet the requirements of a carbon sink in contrast the development of carbon sink forests has a much lower impact on water resources ferraz et al 2013 in australia a research has been conducted on forest agriculture water trading in order to reduce the impact of plantation forests on runoff connor et al 2016 in practice and research it has been established that there are endogenous water carbon synergies in the production processes of agriculture industry and forestry which has resulted in these three sectors becoming important participants in the water carbon market research on sectoral behavior strategies in the context of wrt and cet remains relatively limited moreover sectors are usually regarded as a whole rather than a collection of numerous stakeholders there is also a lack of research on the behavior strategies evolution of aifss from a dynamic perspective game theory can provide an effective way to solve these problems however classical games assume the participants are completely rational which is contrary to the real situation evolutionary games meanwhile assume that information sharing among stakeholders is imperfect and they must choose the best strategy through trial and error this mathematical model can also reveal the dynamic mechanism of strategic interactions between participants which derives from game theory and biological evolution evolutionary game theory has been applied in various fields such as transboundary water sharing mechanisms mirzaei nodoushan et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 the optimal management of coastal groundwater ketabchi ataie ashtiani 2015 and ecological compensation mechanisms ju et al 2022 therefore evolutionary game theory could be used to describe the behavioral rules and evolution characteristics of aifss in the context of wrt and cet this study s contributions are as follows 1 this study constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture industry and forestry sectors aifss to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations 2 the behaviors and dynamic strategies of aifss in water rights trading wrt and carbon emissions trading cet were described and the sensitivity of these strategies to the key parameters were assessed 3 the essential features and rules of the aifs operators acting strategies and the driving elements were revealed the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 all of the strategy combinations and payoffs of aifs stakeholders are defined the payoff matrix of the tripartite game is established and a replication dynamic equation is introduced to describe the evolution of different strategies in aifss section 3 analyzes the evolutionary stable state ess of the tripartite game system in section 4 we consider the influence of initial probabilities and parameter change on game stability based on an example from the dongjiang river basin section 5 presents the discussion and policy implications while section 6 conclusions 2 evolutionary game model for aifss 2 1 problem description it is assumed that there are multiple stakeholders in the same basin who belong to aifss and the interaction between stakeholders has formed a game relationship because of wrt and cet these stakeholders will modify their strategies during the game causing the probability of strategies between different sectors to change over time with rapid socioeconomic development and increasingly prominent environmental problems water resource exploitation and carbon emissions have been constrained to varying degrees thus to offer solutions for sustainable socioeconomic development it is important to determine how to balance the material distribution of aifss under the premise of rigid resource restriction and achieve maximum benefit for all sectors however the various stakeholders in aifss do not have an overall vision they rely on their own limited cognition to choose development strategies which they may constantly adjust over time 2 2 tripartite evolutionary game analysis 2 2 1 for agricultural operators agricultural production supports national economic development but there is considerable room to improve the efficiency of production and resource utilization population growth and changing dietary requirements place new demands on agriculture development in contrast to traditional models green agricultural development can not only increase output but also reduce resource environmental costs by for example improving soil quality reducing irrigation water usage and reducing fertilizer usage however green agricultural development is comparatively expensive resulting in lower unit benefits than in traditional models in this case the water resources and carbon sinks produced by agricultural green development can obtain additional benefits through wrt and cet with industry and forestry however depending on the benefits of external resource transactions there will be some uncertainty if the interests of industry and forestry are not taken into consideration agriculture will not be able to receive the expected benefits 2 2 2 for industrial operators as a pillar of the national economy industry is characterized by high added value and intensive resource consumption generally industrial production capacity corresponds to a certain amount of resource consumption rapid increases in industrial output value will be accompanied by continuous increases in water resource utilization and carbon emission intensity economic development requires the long term support of resource intensive industries and government guidance for green industrial development has thus become necessary for sustainable development green industrial development can be achieved in two ways one is to maintain current production capacities and obtain resources through external cooperation the other is to optimize industrial production processes and improve production efficiency without cooperation regarding external cooperation industrial enterprises may seek transactions with agricultural irrigation water users in the same basin wrt in the same basin does not need to consider the additional costs associated with new water diversion projects thus there is little difference in the price of water rights between buyers and sellers when agriculture refuses to transfer water rights however industry suffers as a result of a lack of basic production water for the purposes of cet there are substantial differences in industrial carbon emission levels between different regions thus an industry can purchase extra carbon emission permits from industries outside the basin who have improved their production efficiency or from carbon sequestration projects within the basin that sell carbon sinks in terms of noncooperation by harnessing the synergistic effect between water and carbon in production processes industry can often save water and reduce emissions at the same time by transforming production processes although the investment is high 2 2 3 for forestry operators forestry is an important economic sector we only examined the strategic choices of plantation operators depending on carbon sink and water consumption characteristics a plantation may be developed into either a carbon sequestration forest or an economic forest carbon sequestration forest development is likely to gain new momentum following the paris agreement carbon sequestration forest is a new form of forestry development that uses chinese fir poplar masson s pine and other tree species that can improve the sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems the costs associated with carbon sequestration projects are high because they require strict forest management and scientific methods for measuring carbon sequestration through industrial transactions operators benefit from carbon sequestration during the project period and they also benefit from wood after the project has ended however the net annual value of timber is relatively low owing to the long development cycle of projects regarding economic forest development the main objective of economic forests is to obtain economic benefits through the production of forest products which is the traditional method of forestry production an economic forest includes timber forests fuel wood forests and fruit forests among others this type of plantation has a short rotation period high water consumption no evident sequestration of carbon and high unit economic benefits nevertheless the total amount of water resources is strictly controlled thus trade with agricultural operators is the only option for meeting the water requirements of new economic forests however water shortages will result in a significant decrease in forestry production nordblom et al 2015 based on the above analysis fig 1 depicts the relationship between tripartite stakeholders in the water carbon nexus 2 3 model assumptions according to the research questions and the requirements of the tripartite evolutionary game model we make the following assumptions table 1 shows the meanings of the parameters the detailed calculation formulas can be referred to the supplementary information assumption 1 aifs stakeholders have limited rationality the stakeholders in each sector are capable of learning and replicating they can modify their selections depending on the benefits of a strategy their primary objective is to choose the strategy that maximizes their own interests yet stakeholders are often unable to make informed decisions because of incomplete information assumption 2 each player in the game has only two strategies to choose from the two strategic options available to agricultural operators are sustainable development sd and traditional production mode tpm industrial enterprises meanwhile can choose between external cooperation ec and industrial optimization io for forestry operators the two strategies are the reforestation of carbon sequestration forests csf or economic forests ef assumption 3 agricultural operators may adopt a sd strategy with a probability of x 0 x 1 while those who follow a tpm strategy have a probability of 1 x in a similar manner the probability of industrial operators adopting an ec strategy is y 0 y 1 and the probability of adopting an io strategy is 1 y finally the probability of forestry operators adopting a csf strategy is z 0 z 1 and the probability of selecting an ef strategy is 1 z where x y and z are functions of time t assumption 4 in this study agricultural operators refer to farmers and agricultural enterprises with a focus on four categories average income production costs government subsidies and water and carbon prices the area of cultivated agricultural land is s a the unit net benefit of sustainable development is e a 1 and the unit net benefit of current production capacity is e a 2 when choosing an sd strategy the government subsidies agricultural operators can obtain are s 1 a large amount of irrigation water q wa can be saved and transferred to other economic sectors and the annual carbon sink capacity is q sa the transaction price of water rights is p w of carbon sinks is p s assumption 5 industrial operators will make decisions based on government policies related to resources and the environment normally the benefit of industrial operators is e i when choosing an ec strategy the total market demand of industry for water rights is q wi and for carbon emission rights it is q ci when carbon sink trading cannot offset industrial carbon emissions industrial operators must purchase carbon emission rights which is more expensive the trading price coefficients of that are ε 1 a n d ε 2 however if agricultural operators refuse to trade industrial operators will lose basic benefits because of water shortage then the loss coefficient is δ i δ i 1 and δ i 2 when choosing an io strategy the benefits will not change but industrial operators will invest additional costs in energy saving transformation which is c i assumption 6 we assume there are plantations with an area of s f in the watershed forestry operators can then decide on the direction of development when choosing to develop csf the annual carbon sink capacity is q sf if there are carbon sink buyers in the basin the transaction price is p s the input cost of csf projects is high and the benefit is low the healthy development of csf projects requires government subsidies denoted by s 2 the unit net benefit of csf is e f 1 when choosing to develop ef the unit net benefit is e f 2 it is further assumed that e f 2 e f 1 however forestry operators will face the problem of increasing water demand q wf if the necessary water resources for ef cannot be obtained production will be reduced and the unit benefit will suffer losses the loss coefficient of water shortage is δ f δ f 1 and δ f 2 assumption 7 we assume that the difference between the amount of carbon sinks and carbon emissions in the basin is likely to affect the implementation of cet when the total amount of carbon sink in the basin is greater than that of carbon emission q sf q sa q ci φ c 1 0 φ c 2 1 and ε 1 1 or φ c 1 1 φ c 2 0 and ε 1 1 moreover we assume that industry will purchase carbon sinks in proportion to the output of carbon sinks when carbon sinks are surplus based on the assumption that the agriculture and forestry carbon sinks contribute γ 2 and 1 γ 2 respectively the carbon sinks purchased by industrial operators are γ 2 q ci and 1 γ 2 q ci wrt development will also be affected by the difference between agricultural water saving and basin water demand as a result of agricultural water saving not being able to meet all the water demand in the basin but being greater than the industrial water demand q wi q wf q wa q wi φ w 1 0 or φ w 1 1 similarly when it exceeds the forestry q wi q wf q wa q wf φ w 3 0 or φ w 3 1 the assumption is that operators can purchase agricultural water rights in accordance with the proportion of water demand consequently the industry can obtain γ 1 q wa forestry is 1 γ 1 q wa when q wa q wi q wf φ w 2 0 or φ w 2 1 table 2 presents the payoff matrix for the tripartite game based on the above analysis and assumptions it shows the profit and loss values of each player in a tripartite evolutionary game under different strategies the expected returns of evolutionary games can be interpreted in terms of the theory of fitness in evolutionary biology a strategy s strength and weakness can be quantified by measuring the expected return multiplying the probability by the corresponding payoff will yield the expected return or fitness of a strategy kim kim 1997

assumptions and analysis of the aifs evolutionary game table 4 depicts the stability analysis of the equilibrium points it establishes the conditions required to form ess it is evident from table 4 that there is no definitive stable solution for this problem owing to the payoff parameter uncertainty of each player in the game therefore any point with uncertain stability can be an ess point take the condition in which e 7 1 1 0 and e 8 1 1 1 becomes ess as an example these two conditions are ideal for wrt and cet in a basin e 7 1 1 0 represents that agriculture selects the sd strategy industry selects the ec strategy and forestry selects the ef strategy in order to qualify for this ess the net benefits of agricultural sustainable development plus government subsidies and wrt income should be greater than the net benefits of traditional agriculture it is more costly to optimize and transform the industrial process than to purchase rights to carbon emissions and water the benefits of forestry carbon sequestration projects are not as good as those of economic forests despite the possibility of obtaining subsidies furthermore the loss of industry and forestry due to a water shortage should not be excessive water rights were sold by agriculture to the two departments and wrt can get better developmentat this time as a result of the above conditions e a 2 s a s 1 e a 1 s a

by agriculture is reduced so the income from cet needs to be considered when comparing the income from agricultural sustainable development and traditional development mode at this time carbon sequestration in the basin has increased significantly when comparing strategies the industrial operators take into account the sequestration of carbon in the basin additionally there is less competition between forestry and industry for water rights in the basin and industry s water shortage loss coefficient has decreased to offset carbon emissions the industry can obtain carbon sinks

based on the above analysis we summarized eight kinds of esss that aifss can constitute through mathematical reasoning now we need to further explore the effects of different parameters on ess through numerical examples 4 numerical examples 4 1 study area to test and validate the proposed evolutionary game models we empirically studied wrt and cet in the dongjiang river basin drb fig 2 located in the southeast of guangdong province china it is composed of four prefecture level cities heyuan huizhou dongguan and shenzhen it covers an area of 31 504 57 km2 with a forest cover percentage of 64 04 as a typical southern region drb is rich in water resources however all of the cities regard it as their sole water source thus it has the highest annual usage rate 25 9 of water resources in the province fig 3 depicts the evolution of aifss in the four cities since 2010 the economic output value of aifss has grown every year with the added value of industry considerably exceeding that of agriculture and forestry resulting in increased energy consumption and carbon emissions in drb it is worth noting that drb s carbon emission intensity and water consumption intensity are both decreasing dropping 31 76 and 67 19 respectively since 2010 in agriculture there has been little increase in water efficiency and the cultivated land area has remained essentially unchanged however forestry has been continually afforestation since 2015 with 3 87 million mu of forest planted drb is the most developed area in guangdong province it faces many environmental challenges related to rapid population growth and economic development including water scarcity forest degradation and intensive emissions the ministry of water resources authorized wrt management legislation in 2016 and drb was chosen as the first pilot area to implement wrt meanwhile china has been focused on reducing carbon emissions since signing the paris agreement in 2016 and the ministry of ecology and environment and the china green foundation have developed various carbon emission management regulations including cet therefore drb has the potential to simultaneously carry out wrt and cet 4 2 data and parameters our model was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how trade affects aifs strategy selection within a basin as it was expected that drb would support the growth of wrt and cet we designed four scenarios business as usual bu this scenario was based on guangdong s current carbon mitigation 34 carbon intensity reduction and water conservation targets 47 5 water use intensity reduction cet has been implemented in seven industrial sectors agricultural carbon sink is not considered wrt has not occurred spontaneously the authorities have not strictly limited resource use and financial subsidies for water saving and carbon sequestration projects are insufficient water market wm in this scenario water management in the basin becomes more stringent with a reduction of 69 75 in industrial water use intensity by 2020 as compared to the level in 2010 water rights can be traded between aifs where industrial and forestry operators can purchase water rights for additional permits for water withdrawals that would otherwise be subject to water shortages a subsidy of 150 yuan mu will be provided for agricultural sustainable development carbon market cm this scenario reduces the intensity of energy related carbon emissions by 40 by 2020 as compared to the level in 2010 the government continues to expand the scope of the carbon market through implementation of cdm projects both agriculture and forestry are permitted to sell carbon sinks under the clean development mechanism cdm proposed in the kyoto protocol in addition subsidies of 150 yuan mu and 333 yuan mu will be provided for sustainable development in agriculture and carbon sink development in forestry multiple market mm this scenario strengthens the regulation of both water resources and greenhouse gas emissions water use targets and emission reduction targets are aligned with the wm and cm scenarios and water rights and carbon sinks can be traded simultaneously across aifs sectors a subsidy is provided simultaneously for providers of water rights and carbon sinks the data for this study were derived from published literature and government reports table 5 shows the game parameter settings for the four scenarios the detailed data sources can be referred to the supplementary information based on the replication dynamic equations for aifss we used matlab to simulate the strategy evolution process of the game system in the initial state the probabilities of aifs strategies were initially set to 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 4 3 numerical results 4 3 1 ess in four scenarios to analyze the evolution of aifss strategies under four different scenarios we simulated the evolutionary game process using replicated dynamic equations and empirical data fig 4 while the game systems in the four scenarios could both achieve ess they had vastly different evolutionary path and convergence time the ess of aifss finally converged to e 3 0 1 0 in the bu scenario this also verified the ess analysis of aifss in section 3 in the absence of strong government regulation and financial incentives agricultural industrial and forestry operators tended to choose tpm ec and ef strategies respectively this was because sd io and csf are novel production modes that require significant investment to build and operate thus industry was more eager to trade resources but agriculture and forestry were not by contrast in other scenarios the ess of aifss converged to e 7 1 1 0 agricultural operators will ultimately change their strategies to sd under government guidance the aifss strategy selection had effectively increased departmental collaboration and resource complementarity in the bu scenario the convergence time of the sd and ec strategies is the longest and the ef strategy is the shortest reflecting the relative benefits of the different strategies market developments shorten the convergence time of sd and ec strategies and prolong the convergence time of ef strategies in the wm scenario the initial strategy probability of agriculture has the greatest impact on the convergence speed of the ec strategy there is a greater degree of interaction between aifs strategies in this scenario the convergence times of different strategy combinations are significantly affected by the initial probability the convergence time of sd strategy is mainly determined by the choice of forestry operator strategy which is proportional to the probability of ef strategy additionally the convergence time of ec and ef strategies is largely influenced by the strategy choice of agricultural operators which is also proportional to the probability of sd strategies in addition the initial probability of agricultural strategy has a greater influence on the choice of strategy in industry and forestry than they do on agricultural strategy results indicate that industrial ec and forestry ef strategies have more benefits than io and csf strategies whereas the gap between the two agricultural strategies is smaller meanwhile the market can effectively increase the relative benefits of sd ec and csf strategies for the corresponding operators the presence of mm scenario further enhances the mutual influence and synergistic relationship among aifs moreover owing to the deepening of interdepartmental relationships the effect of initial strategy probability on departments appeared to be asymmetric 4 3 2 impact of change in carbon prices and water prices to understand the effect of different carbon and water prices on the strategy evolution of aifss we considered carbon prices corresponding to p s in america korea tokyo switzerland and water prices corresponding to p w in australia america and inner mongolia fig 5 depicts the evolutionary path of aifs behavioral strategies under various levels of carbon and water prices in the bu scenario carbon pricing significantly influences industrial strategy evolution while having little effect on agricultural and forestry operations as a result of a higher carbon price in the cm scenario operators will be discouraged from adopting an ec strategy while they will be encouraged to adopt sd or csf strategies at an appropriate level if the carbon price is too high industrial operators will cease to cooperate and the relative benefits of developing carbon sinks in agriculture and forestry will also decrease a change in water prices has a significant impact on agricultural sd strategy selection in the wm scenario and could have a further influence on ec strategy selection nevertheless if the carbon price at this stage is too high the opposite outcome will occur according to the mm scenario the impact of carbon pricing on ec strategy evolution was significantly reduced even though the demand for carbon sequestrations by industrial operators has increased this indicates that the industry has become more resilient to carbon pricing over time additionally a high carbon price has an obvious promotion effect on the adoption of sd and csf strategies the effect of water prices on agricultural and forestry operators is consistent with this the difference is that an increase in the price of water may compel operators to adopt sd ec or csf strategies water and carbon prices increasing simultaneously can offset the negative impact of high carbon prices on industrial operators ec strategies for agricultural and forestry operators the benefits of choosing sd and csf strategies will become higher the results suggest that in an immature market environment increasing water and carbon prices does not have any meaningful effect wrt could significantly improve carbon price affordability for the industry increasing carbon prices in the cm scenario does not affect forest operators choice of ef strategy however increases in water prices in the mm scenario may influence their choice of csf strategy 4 3 3 impact of change in agricultural water saving fig 6 shows the effect of agricultural water saving on the strategy evolution of aifss when q wa was reduced by 20 40 60 and 90 respectively when agricultural water savings were reduced by 40 the amount of water rights available cannot meet the demands of both industry and forestry after reducing the amount by 60 even if wrt is only applied to forestry there is still a shortfall of 92 million m3 of water for forestry at 90 reduction the water savings in agriculture are only 0 75 billion m3 and neither industry nor forestry can meet their water needs it can be observed that when only a water market exists the lower the agricultural water savings the more industrial operators are affected however forestry operators are able to withstand the losses caused by a sharp reduction in agricultural water usage and continue to adopt ef strategies as aifs seeks to maximize its own benefits it indirectly contributes to the shift from wrt to cet as the dominant market 4 3 4 impact of change in subsidies for agriculture and forestry fig 7 shows the effect of subsidies on the strategy evolution of aifss the represents that the subsidy price in drb remains unchanged under the corresponding situation the represents that the subsidy is increased on the original basis and the represents that the subsidy is decreased on the original basis the greater the subsidy the greater the preference for sd and csf strategies among agricultural and forestry operators additionally subsidies for agricultural and forestry operators do not affect the evolution of industrial ec strategies by wrt or cet agricultural operators would still be able to use sd strategies while reducing subsidies by 50 despite this the implementation of water trading and carbon trading does not enable forestry operators to choose a csf strategy for the original or lower subsidy scenario it is interesting to note that in the mm scenario lower subsidies to agriculture actually prolong the convergence time of the ef strategy as a result of the findings agriculture may be able to gain greater benefits from trading in water and carbon at this stage there is however a great benefits gap between forestry ef and csf strategies and in order to develop forestry carbon sinks government subsidies are required 5 discussion and policy implications our simulation revealed the influence of initial strategy probability and parameter values on the evolution of strategy in a tripartite evolutionary game specifically the numerical simulation revealed the following a one way sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the 19 main parameters on the evolution of aifs strategies in four scenarios with 10 variation in each parameter fig 8 figs s1 s3 according to our findings the strategy evolution of aifss under the cm scenario are more sensitive to unit net benefits of agriculture transformation costs unit net benefits of economic forests forest area and carbon sink subsidies in addition the effects of unit net benefits of agriculture are more pronounced on the wm scenario and mm scenario thus the strategy choice of agricultural operators in the drb will influence the other two sectors significantly through wrt and cet nevertheless wrt and cet are based on the assumption that there are buyers sellers and surplus resources in the basin in the drb the relative benefits of ec and ef strategies is high the result is the establishment of more stable buyers on the market it is more conducive by improving the net benefits of agricultural sd strategies in the drb to the establishment of effective and stable resource cooperation among aifs even though most existing studies focus on the transaction costs and prices of the trading process we find that carbon and water prices are generally low in the basin and have little influence on the strategies evolution of aifs prior studies have primarily focused on single markets our results suggest however that market trading facilitates intersectoral resource cooperation resulting in a certain degree of coupling between sectoral strategy choices it is also evident that there is an asymmetry in the strategic coupling effect of wrt and cet on aifs as a result we find that the contribution made by cet to the mutual coupling of aifs strategies under the cm scenario is relatively limited while wrt under the wm scenario enhances the strategic coupling between the agricultural and industrial sectors the wrt plays a dominant role in influencing aifs strategy choices when these two markets work together and multiple markets form a complex strategic coupling according to scott et al 2011 water is scarce at the basin scale than carbon and is more likely to affect sectoral decisions strengthening the development and management of water markets may be an effective way to overcome the current low level of participation in the market among operators in the drb the synergy of multiple markets in watershed resource transactions results in greater benefits for participants whereas the deepening strategic coupling of participants carries significant risks previous research has also demonstrated the benefits and risks associated with synergies dong et al 2019 pittock et al 2013 qiang jian 2020 in the event that agricultural operators change their sd strategies or cut back on water savings as a result of external environmental uncertainties they directly undermine the relative benefits of ec and ef strategies for industrial and forestry operators water shortage losses in industry and forestry are causing this impact with marginal water shortage losses increasing in tandem with marginal water use benefits industry and forestry will suffer further losses due to water shortages in the future as a result of the current increasingly stringent water uses requirements we have found that under a diversified market when the benefits of wrt to industry and forestry operators are significantly lower 90 reduction they will adjust their strategies in order to form a market dominated by cet diversifying the market environment can effectively reduce the risk of a particular market failing a traditional approach to modeling resource markets places a greater emphasis on the contribution of trading behavior to society s overall welfare bekchanov et al 2015 britz et al 2013 in this study we present an analysis of the potential trade offs and coordination between water and carbon trading based on the overlap in participants between the water and carbon markets and the pursuit of self interest maximization by the individuals involved our findings indicate that market frameworks do not always correspond with participant behavior a participant will always choose the strategy that maximizes his or her own interests which may not correspond with the expectations of the market environment in the framework hypothesized in this study forestry operators prefer to adopt the ef strategy there are important implications for understanding the construction of regional resource markets and participants trading behaviors arising from these results the above analysis has significant policy implications for mutual cooperation and resource complementarity in a region the implications are as follows sustainable agricultural development must be emphasized based on the results of this study sustainable agricultural development plays an important role in facilitating resource market transactions in the watershed traditional agricultural production models place a great deal of emphasis on economic efficiency but this can have adverse effects on the environment sustainable agricultural development can contribute to water conservation and carbon sink capacity ensuring a stable supply of resources in the water and carbon market despite the fact that sustainable agricultural development in a market framework can generate more revenue through wrt and cet the development of sustainable agricultural development is currently inextricably linked to the government s policies that support it as a result policy makers should enhance regulations technological innovations and policy management in order to ensure sustainable agriculture water security should be ensured for industry and forestry according to our research wrt plays a dominant role in a multiple market and it can improve the effectiveness with which industry and forestry choose ec and ef strategies significantly however the uncertainty associated with agricultural water savings can affect the benefits of industry and forestry participation in water rights trading it is recommended that basins consider implementing models such as reserve water rights trading and water options trading to ensure the stability of water markets the revenue gap must be balanced in forestry development models forestry operators choose a very short convergence time for their ef strategy and they develop carbon sink forests only after the benefits of water rights trading have significantly decreased this means that forestry operators have already suffered huge economic losses when adjusting their strategies which is not conducive to the growth of a diversified market developing carbon sink forests requires the improvement of relevant laws and regulations planting techniques and management methods increasing the average mu carbon sink capacity of forest land as well as increasing the amount of financial subsidies and carbon sink prices that are provided for carbon sink projects balanced income from forest development will facilitate the development of a diversified market and optimize the allocation of water and carbon in the watershed this study has certain limitations first there were no matching statistical data at the urban level which poses a major challenge to water carbon nexus modeling between aifss therefore some data were based on previous research second the hypothesis section of the evolutionary game model was streamlined we only analyzed the direct benefits and losses of aifss in wrt and cet the effects of environmental and social benefits on the model were not quantified additionally since drb is located in southern china where water resources are abundant this study did not investigate the effect of new afforestation on runoff 6 conclusion we used an evolutionary game model to analyze the strategic interaction of aifs stakeholders in wrt and cet and built a replication dynamic equation to simulate the evolutionary strategy process on that basis combined with the empirical analysis of drb we discussed the influence of parameter value changes on the ess of aifss specifically we find that the aifs strategy in the drb evolves in market scenarios to an e 7 1 1 0 equilibrium that is more conducive to the wrt wrt strengthens the coupling of aifs strategies in diversified markets and the net benefits of agriculture have the greatest impact on game systems additionally the diversified market increases the affordability of industry for higher carbon prices and agriculture for lower subsidies but it also introduces more uncertainty risk into the market when a particular market fails players in a multi market environment may adjust their strategies accordingly nevertheless the strategies devised by individuals according to their own interests do not always align with the expectations of the market our understanding of the differences between individual behavior and market framework has very important practical implications for improving market conditions guiding

2558,water scarcity and carbon emissions are two of the most pressing issues facing the world water rights trading wrt and carbon emissions trading cet can alleviate pressure on resources and the environment and promote sustainable development however the relationship between water scarcity and carbon emissions results in a complex water carbon nexus between sectors to explore the mechanisms of interaction among related sectors in the context of wrt and cet this study built a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture industry and forestry sectors aifss to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations four cities in the dongjiang river basin drb in southern china were analyzed to quantify the influence of key parameters on the strategic evolution process and reveal the relationship between sectors under the effect of wrt and cet the results indicated that there is a significant impact of agricultural net benefits in the drb on the choice of aifs strategy which in turn leads to better wrt that promotes the mutual coupling of aifs strategies in addition strategy coupling brings higher relative returns and risks to the game system and multiple markets enable aifs to hedge losses that may result from single market failures in the mutual game furthermore aifs behavioral strategies are not necessarily aligned with market expectations which has implications for us as we guide the development of wrt and cet keywords water carbon nexus water rights trading carbon emissions trading tripartite evolutionary game data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rapid development has intensified the demand for water and energy flörke et al 2018 sognnaes et al 2021 resulting in serious environmental issues including water shortages and massive carbon emissions kummu et al 2016 peters et al 2012 which are intertwined chen et al 2019 for instance carbon emissions have given rise to global warming matthews et al 2009 and global warming has exacerbated water scarcity he et al 2021 similarly in economic production processes water and carbon exhibit a high degree of synergy agriculture and industry for example both have substantial water consumption and carbon emissions associated with their production processes it is therefore ineffectual to consider water utilization and carbon emissions in isolation and identifying the internal relationships and heterogeneity between sectors in the water carbon nexus can contribute to the integrated management of these sectors this link between water and carbon emissions has prompted various studies of the water carbon nexus methods for investigating the water carbon nexus include input output analysis life cycle analysis computable general equilibrium material flow analysis and system dynamics bodunrin et al 2018 chhipi shrestha et al 2017 elshkaki 2019 fan et al 2018 wang et al 2022 various studies have considered ways to reveal the water carbon nexus within individual sectors liao et al 2016 roibás et al 2015 tang et al 2020 silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 for example assessed the land water energy nexus of sugarcane production li et al 2013 moreover calculated carbon emissions from agricultural water while su et al 2019 highlighted the synergistic effect of the water carbon nexus in industrial production other studies have examined the flow of virtual water and carbon associated with trade and consumption processes in economic networks chen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 some researchers have considered the water carbon nexus across multiple sectors within a region such as li et al 2020 who quantified the characteristics of the energy carbon water nexus embodied in sectors in china yang et al 2018 developed a consumption emissions coefficient and index to analyze the sectoral energy water carbon nexus in shanghai and beijing zhang and vesselinov 2017 examined interrelationships and trade offs in the sectoral water energy food nexus quantifying the effects of future climate change on cycles of water carbon coupling su et al 2018 predicted the carbon energy water nexus in an urbanizing catchment in china others have developed hybrid network management systems to analyze water carbon flows reifsnyder et al 2021 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b the characteristics and quantification of the water carbon nexus at different scales have been widely studied meanwhile systems that employ market mechanisms to optimize resource allocation have been widely implemented to achieve sustainability and reduce environmental harm in this regard water rights trading wrt and carbon emissions trading cet chong sunding 2006 zhu et al 2019 can improve resource allocation between regions or sectors but they can also intensify resource competitiveness making the water carbon nexus more complicated fang chen 2017 studies have focused on building models to simulate the market environment and competitive behavior among stakeholders and identify the main factors affecting trading behavior and its optimal solutions di et al 2020 for example used a dynamic differential game and pricing game to calculate the optimal trading quantity and price for different regions erfani et al 2014 built a generalized optimization model to simulate water rights transaction processes womble and hanemann 2020 studied transaction costs in the colorado water market and revealed its systematic heterogeneity a few studies meanwhile have integrated the synergy between different resource trading markets for instance settre et al 2019 revealed the synergy between wrt and cet in coexisting carbon and water markets moreover studies have revealed obvious synergies among the agriculture industry and forestry sectors aifss under wrt and cet connor et al 2016 mushtaq et al 2015 tan et al 2021 this means the behavior of one department will affect other departments the implementation of wrt and cet has deepened both resource cooperation and conflict among aifss creating new requirements for the formulation of resource policies and management it has been extensively studied how departments behave in the context of wrt or cet with technological advancements and farmland management agriculture is able to participate in national emissions trading systems and water rights trading markets as compared to traditional agricultural production brandt svendsen 2011 lee 2017 zhang et al 2021a and agricultural carbon reduction can reduce irrigation water consumption synergistically silalertruksa gheewala 2018 in the context of resource market trading industry can choose to use traditional water saving and emission reduction methods or trade with other sectors dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 and similarly water saving and carbon reduction in industry are synergistic tan et al 2021 in the process of growing plantation forests consume watershed resources dresel et al 2018 yu et al 2019 especially when short term mature trees or fruit trees are selected nordblom et al 2015 the consumption of water is greater and does not meet the requirements of a carbon sink in contrast the development of carbon sink forests has a much lower impact on water resources ferraz et al 2013 in australia a research has been conducted on forest agriculture water trading in order to reduce the impact of plantation forests on runoff connor et al 2016 in practice and research it has been established that there are endogenous water carbon synergies in the production processes of agriculture industry and forestry which has resulted in these three sectors becoming important participants in the water carbon market research on sectoral behavior strategies in the context of wrt and cet remains relatively limited moreover sectors are usually regarded as a whole rather than a collection of numerous stakeholders there is also a lack of research on the behavior strategies evolution of aifss from a dynamic perspective game theory can provide an effective way to solve these problems however classical games assume the participants are completely rational which is contrary to the real situation evolutionary games meanwhile assume that information sharing among stakeholders is imperfect and they must choose the best strategy through trial and error this mathematical model can also reveal the dynamic mechanism of strategic interactions between participants which derives from game theory and biological evolution evolutionary game theory has been applied in various fields such as transboundary water sharing mechanisms mirzaei nodoushan et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 the optimal management of coastal groundwater ketabchi ataie ashtiani 2015 and ecological compensation mechanisms ju et al 2022 therefore evolutionary game theory could be used to describe the behavioral rules and evolution characteristics of aifss in the context of wrt and cet this study s contributions are as follows 1 this study constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture industry and forestry sectors aifss to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations 2 the behaviors and dynamic strategies of aifss in water rights trading wrt and carbon emissions trading cet were described and the sensitivity of these strategies to the key parameters were assessed 3 the essential features and rules of the aifs operators acting strategies and the driving elements were revealed the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 all of the strategy combinations and payoffs of aifs stakeholders are defined the payoff matrix of the tripartite game is established and a replication dynamic equation is introduced to describe the evolution of different strategies in aifss section 3 analyzes the evolutionary stable state ess of the tripartite game system in section 4 we consider the influence of initial probabilities and parameter change on game stability based on an example from the dongjiang river basin section 5 presents the discussion and policy implications while section 6 conclusions 2 evolutionary game model for aifss 2 1 problem description it is assumed that there are multiple stakeholders in the same basin who belong to aifss and the interaction between stakeholders has formed a game relationship because of wrt and cet these stakeholders will modify their strategies during the game causing the probability of strategies between different sectors to change over time with rapid socioeconomic development and increasingly prominent environmental problems water resource exploitation and carbon emissions have been constrained to varying degrees thus to offer solutions for sustainable socioeconomic development it is important to determine how to balance the material distribution of aifss under the premise of rigid resource restriction and achieve maximum benefit for all sectors however the various stakeholders in aifss do not have an overall vision they rely on their own limited cognition to choose development strategies which they may constantly adjust over time 2 2 tripartite evolutionary game analysis 2 2 1 for agricultural operators agricultural production supports national economic development but there is considerable room to improve the efficiency of production and resource utilization population growth and changing dietary requirements place new demands on agriculture development in contrast to traditional models green agricultural development can not only increase output but also reduce resource environmental costs by for example improving soil quality reducing irrigation water usage and reducing fertilizer usage however green agricultural development is comparatively expensive resulting in lower unit benefits than in traditional models in this case the water resources and carbon sinks produced by agricultural green development can obtain additional benefits through wrt and cet with industry and forestry however depending on the benefits of external resource transactions there will be some uncertainty if the interests of industry and forestry are not taken into consideration agriculture will not be able to receive the expected benefits 2 2 2 for industrial operators as a pillar of the national economy industry is characterized by high added value and intensive resource consumption generally industrial production capacity corresponds to a certain amount of resource consumption rapid increases in industrial output value will be accompanied by continuous increases in water resource utilization and carbon emission intensity economic development requires the long term support of resource intensive industries and government guidance for green industrial development has thus become necessary for sustainable development green industrial development can be achieved in two ways one is to maintain current production capacities and obtain resources through external cooperation the other is to optimize industrial production processes and improve production efficiency without cooperation regarding external cooperation industrial enterprises may seek transactions with agricultural irrigation water users in the same basin wrt in the same basin does not need to consider the additional costs associated with new water diversion projects thus there is little difference in the price of water rights between buyers and sellers when agriculture refuses to transfer water rights however industry suffers as a result of a lack of basic production water for the purposes of cet there are substantial differences in industrial carbon emission levels between different regions thus an industry can purchase extra carbon emission permits from industries outside the basin who have improved their production efficiency or from carbon sequestration projects within the basin that sell carbon sinks in terms of noncooperation by harnessing the synergistic effect between water and carbon in production processes industry can often save water and reduce emissions at the same time by transforming production processes although the investment is high 2 2 3 for forestry operators forestry is an important economic sector we only examined the strategic choices of plantation operators depending on carbon sink and water consumption characteristics a plantation may be developed into either a carbon sequestration forest or an economic forest carbon sequestration forest development is likely to gain new momentum following the paris agreement carbon sequestration forest is a new form of forestry development that uses chinese fir poplar masson s pine and other tree species that can improve the sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems the costs associated with carbon sequestration projects are high because they require strict forest management and scientific methods for measuring carbon sequestration through industrial transactions operators benefit from carbon sequestration during the project period and they also benefit from wood after the project has ended however the net annual value of timber is relatively low owing to the long development cycle of projects regarding economic forest development the main objective of economic forests is to obtain economic benefits through the production of forest products which is the traditional method of forestry production an economic forest includes timber forests fuel wood forests and fruit forests among others this type of plantation has a short rotation period high water consumption no evident sequestration of carbon and high unit economic benefits nevertheless the total amount of water resources is strictly controlled thus trade with agricultural operators is the only option for meeting the water requirements of new economic forests however water shortages will result in a significant decrease in forestry production nordblom et al 2015 based on the above analysis fig 1 depicts the relationship between tripartite stakeholders in the water carbon nexus 2 3 model assumptions according to the research questions and the requirements of the tripartite evolutionary game model we make the following assumptions table 1 shows the meanings of the parameters the detailed calculation formulas can be referred to the supplementary information assumption 1 aifs stakeholders have limited rationality the stakeholders in each sector are capable of learning and replicating they can modify their selections depending on the benefits of a strategy their primary objective is to choose the strategy that maximizes their own interests yet stakeholders are often unable to make informed decisions because of incomplete information assumption 2 each player in the game has only two strategies to choose from the two strategic options available to agricultural operators are sustainable development sd and traditional production mode tpm industrial enterprises meanwhile can choose between external cooperation ec and industrial optimization io for forestry operators the two strategies are the reforestation of carbon sequestration forests csf or economic forests ef assumption 3 agricultural operators may adopt a sd strategy with a probability of x 0 x 1 while those who follow a tpm strategy have a probability of 1 x in a similar manner the probability of industrial operators adopting an ec strategy is y 0 y 1 and the probability of adopting an io strategy is 1 y finally the probability of forestry operators adopting a csf strategy is z 0 z 1 and the probability of selecting an ef strategy is 1 z where x y and z are functions of time t assumption 4 in this study agricultural operators refer to farmers and agricultural enterprises with a focus on four categories average income production costs government subsidies and water and carbon prices the area of cultivated agricultural land is s a the unit net benefit of sustainable development is e a 1 and the unit net benefit of current production capacity is e a 2 when choosing an sd strategy the government subsidies agricultural operators can obtain are s 1 a large amount of irrigation water q wa can be saved and transferred to other economic sectors and the annual carbon sink capacity is q sa the transaction price of water rights is p w of carbon sinks is p s assumption 5 industrial operators will make decisions based on government policies related to resources and the environment normally the benefit of industrial operators is e i when choosing an ec strategy the total market demand of industry for water rights is q wi and for carbon emission rights it is q ci when carbon sink trading cannot offset industrial carbon emissions industrial operators must purchase carbon emission rights which is more expensive the trading price coefficients of that are ε 1 a n d ε 2 however if agricultural operators refuse to trade industrial operators will lose basic benefits because of water shortage then the loss coefficient is δ i δ i 1 and δ i 2 when choosing an io strategy the benefits will not change but industrial operators will invest additional costs in energy saving transformation which is c i assumption 6 we assume there are plantations with an area of s f in the watershed forestry operators can then decide on the direction of development when choosing to develop csf the annual carbon sink capacity is q sf if there are carbon sink buyers in the basin the transaction price is p s the input cost of csf projects is high and the benefit is low the healthy development of csf projects requires government subsidies denoted by s 2 the unit net benefit of csf is e f 1 when choosing to develop ef the unit net benefit is e f 2 it is further assumed that e f 2 e f 1 however forestry operators will face the problem of increasing water demand q wf if the necessary water resources for ef cannot be obtained production will be reduced and the unit benefit will suffer losses the loss coefficient of water shortage is δ f δ f 1 and δ f 2 assumption 7 we assume that the difference between the amount of carbon sinks and carbon emissions in the basin is likely to affect the implementation of cet when the total amount of carbon sink in the basin is greater than that of carbon emission q sf q sa q ci φ c 1 0 φ c 2 1 and ε 1 1 or φ c 1 1 φ c 2 0 and ε 1 1 moreover we assume that industry will purchase carbon sinks in proportion to the output of carbon sinks when carbon sinks are surplus based on the assumption that the agriculture and forestry carbon sinks contribute γ 2 and 1 γ 2 respectively the carbon sinks purchased by industrial operators are γ 2 q ci and 1 γ 2 q ci wrt development will also be affected by the difference between agricultural water saving and basin water demand as a result of agricultural water saving not being able to meet all the water demand in the basin but being greater than the industrial water demand q wi q wf q wa q wi φ w 1 0 or φ w 1 1 similarly when it exceeds the forestry q wi q wf q wa q

player in a tripartite evolutionary game under different strategies the expected returns of evolutionary games can be interpreted in terms of the theory of fitness in evolutionary biology a strategy s strength and weakness can be quantified by measuring the expected return multiplying the probability by the corresponding payoff will yield the expected return or fitness of a strategy kim kim 1997

asymptotically stable state in the replication dynamic process friedman 1991 ritzberger weibull 1995 furthermore only the pure strategies of a multiparty evolutionary game can reach asymptotically stable states in a replication dynamic system while the hybrid strategies cannot thus this study only considered eight pure strategic equilibrium points roca et al 2009 the equilibrium point is not necessarily an ess the lyapunov function can be employed to assess the willingness of a point to return to the original equilibrium state after being disturbed ess can be verified using lyapunov

assumptions and analysis of the aifs evolutionary game table 4 depicts the stability analysis of the equilibrium points it establishes the conditions required to form ess it is evident from table 4 that there is no definitive stable solution for this problem owing to the payoff parameter uncertainty of each player in the game therefore any point with uncertain stability can be an ess point take the condition in which e 7 1 1 0 and e 8 1 1 1 becomes ess as an example these two conditions are ideal for wrt and cet in a basin e 7 1 1 0 represents that agriculture selects the sd strategy industry selects the ec strategy and forestry selects the ef strategy in order to qualify for this ess the net benefits of agricultural sustainable development plus government subsidies and wrt income should be greater than the net benefits of traditional agriculture it is more costly to optimize and transform the industrial process than to purchase rights to carbon emissions and water the benefits of forestry carbon sequestration projects are not as good as those of economic forests despite the possibility of obtaining subsidies furthermore the loss of industry and forestry due to a water shortage should not be excessive water rights were sold by agriculture to the two departments and wrt can get better developmentat this time as a result of the above conditions e a 2 s a s 1 e a 1 s a

by agriculture is reduced so the income from cet needs to be considered when comparing the income from agricultural sustainable development and traditional development mode at this time carbon sequestration in the basin has increased significantly when comparing strategies the industrial operators take into account the sequestration of carbon in the basin additionally there is less competition between forestry and industry for water rights in the basin and industry s water shortage loss coefficient has decreased to offset carbon emissions the industry can obtain carbon sinks

based on the above analysis we summarized eight kinds of esss that aifss can constitute through mathematical reasoning now we need to further explore the effects of different parameters on ess through numerical examples 4 numerical examples 4 1 study area to test and validate the proposed evolutionary game models we empirically studied wrt and cet in the dongjiang river basin drb fig 2 located in the southeast of guangdong province china it is composed of four prefecture level cities heyuan huizhou dongguan and shenzhen it covers an area of 31 504 57 km2 with a forest cover percentage of 64 04 as a typical southern region drb is rich in water resources however all of the cities regard it as their sole water source thus it has the highest annual usage rate 25 9 of water resources in the province fig 3 depicts the evolution of aifss in the four cities since 2010 the economic output value of aifss has grown every year with the added value of industry considerably exceeding that of agriculture and forestry resulting in increased energy consumption and carbon emissions in drb it is worth noting that drb s carbon emission intensity and water consumption intensity are both decreasing dropping 31 76 and 67 19 respectively since 2010 in agriculture there has been little increase in water efficiency and the cultivated land area has remained essentially unchanged however forestry has been continually afforestation since 2015 with 3 87 million mu of forest planted drb is the most developed area in guangdong province it faces many environmental challenges related to rapid population growth and economic development including water scarcity forest degradation and intensive emissions the ministry of water resources authorized wrt management legislation in 2016 and drb was chosen as the first pilot area to implement wrt meanwhile china has been focused on reducing carbon emissions since signing the paris agreement in 2016 and the ministry of ecology and environment and the china green foundation have developed various carbon emission management regulations including cet therefore drb has the potential to simultaneously carry out wrt and cet 4 2 data and parameters our model was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how trade affects aifs strategy selection within a basin as it was expected that drb would support the growth of wrt and cet we designed four scenarios business as usual bu this scenario was based on guangdong s current carbon mitigation 34 carbon intensity reduction and water conservation targets 47 5 water use intensity reduction cet has been implemented in seven industrial sectors agricultural carbon sink is not considered wrt has not occurred spontaneously the authorities have not strictly limited resource use and financial subsidies for water saving and carbon sequestration projects are insufficient water market wm in this scenario water management in the basin becomes more stringent with a reduction of 69 75 in industrial water use intensity by 2020 as compared to the level in 2010 water rights can be traded between aifs where industrial and forestry operators can purchase water rights for additional permits for water withdrawals that would otherwise be subject to water shortages a subsidy of 150 yuan mu will be provided for agricultural sustainable development carbon market cm this scenario reduces the intensity of energy related carbon emissions by 40 by 2020 as compared to the level in 2010 the government continues to expand the scope of the carbon market through implementation of cdm projects both agriculture and forestry are permitted to sell carbon sinks under the clean development mechanism cdm proposed in the kyoto protocol in addition subsidies of 150 yuan mu and 333 yuan mu will be provided for sustainable development in agriculture and carbon sink development in forestry multiple market mm this scenario strengthens the regulation of both water resources and greenhouse gas emissions water use targets and emission reduction targets are aligned with the wm and cm scenarios and water rights and carbon sinks can be traded simultaneously across aifs sectors a subsidy is provided simultaneously for providers of water rights and carbon sinks the data for this study were derived from published literature and government reports table 5 shows the game parameter settings for the four scenarios the detailed data sources can be referred to the supplementary information based on the replication dynamic equations for aifss we used matlab to simulate the strategy evolution process of the game system in the initial state the probabilities of aifs strategies were initially set to 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 4 3 numerical results 4 3 1 ess in four scenarios to analyze the evolution of aifss strategies under four different scenarios we simulated the evolutionary game process using replicated dynamic equations and empirical data fig 4 while the game systems in the four scenarios could both achieve ess they had vastly different evolutionary path and convergence time the ess of aifss finally converged to e 3 0 1 0 in the bu scenario this also verified the ess analysis of aifss in section 3 in the absence of strong government regulation and financial incentives agricultural industrial and forestry operators tended to choose tpm ec and ef strategies respectively this was because sd io and csf are novel production modes that require significant investment to build and operate thus industry was more eager to trade resources but agriculture and forestry were not by contrast in other scenarios the ess of aifss converged to e 7 1 1 0 agricultural operators will ultimately change their strategies to sd under government guidance the aifss strategy selection had effectively increased departmental collaboration and resource complementarity in the bu scenario the convergence time of the sd and ec strategies is the longest and the ef strategy is the shortest reflecting the relative benefits of the different strategies market developments shorten the convergence time of sd and ec strategies and prolong the convergence time of ef strategies in the wm scenario the initial strategy probability of agriculture has the greatest impact on the convergence speed of the ec strategy there is a greater degree of interaction between aifs strategies in this scenario the convergence times of different strategy combinations are significantly affected by the initial probability the convergence time of sd strategy is mainly determined by the choice of forestry operator strategy which is proportional to the probability of ef strategy additionally the convergence time of ec and ef strategies is largely influenced by the strategy choice of agricultural operators which is also proportional to the probability of sd strategies in addition the initial probability of agricultural strategy has a greater influence on the choice of strategy in industry and forestry than they do on agricultural strategy results indicate that industrial ec and forestry ef strategies have more benefits than io and csf strategies whereas the gap between the two agricultural strategies is smaller meanwhile the market can effectively increase the relative benefits of sd ec and csf strategies for the corresponding operators the presence of mm scenario further enhances the mutual influence and synergistic relationship among aifs moreover owing to the deepening of interdepartmental relationships the effect of initial strategy probability on departments appeared to be asymmetric 4 3 2 impact of change in carbon prices and water prices to understand the effect of different carbon and water prices on the strategy evolution of aifss we considered carbon prices corresponding to p s in america korea tokyo switzerland and water prices corresponding to p w in australia america and inner mongolia fig 5 depicts the evolutionary path of aifs behavioral strategies under various levels of carbon and water prices in the bu scenario carbon pricing significantly influences industrial strategy evolution while having little effect on agricultural and forestry operations as a result of a higher carbon price in the cm scenario operators will be discouraged from adopting an ec strategy while they will be encouraged to adopt sd or csf strategies at an appropriate level if the carbon price is too high industrial operators will cease to cooperate and the relative benefits of developing carbon sinks in agriculture and forestry will also decrease a change in water prices has a significant impact on agricultural sd strategy selection in the wm scenario and could have a further influence on ec strategy selection nevertheless if the carbon price at this stage is too high the opposite outcome will occur according to the mm scenario the impact of carbon pricing on ec strategy evolution was significantly reduced even though the demand for carbon sequestrations by industrial operators has increased this indicates that the industry has become more resilient to carbon pricing over time additionally a high carbon price has an obvious promotion effect on the adoption of sd and csf strategies the effect of water prices on agricultural and forestry operators is consistent with this the difference is that an increase in the price of water may compel operators to adopt sd ec or csf strategies water and carbon prices increasing simultaneously can offset the negative impact of high carbon prices on industrial operators ec strategies for agricultural and forestry operators the benefits of choosing sd and csf strategies will become higher the results suggest that in an immature market environment increasing water and carbon prices does not have any meaningful effect wrt could significantly improve carbon price affordability for the industry increasing carbon prices in the cm scenario does not affect forest operators choice of ef strategy however increases in water prices in the mm scenario may influence their choice of csf strategy 4 3 3 impact of change in agricultural water saving fig 6 shows the effect of agricultural water saving on the strategy evolution of aifss when q wa was reduced by 20 40 60 and 90 respectively when agricultural water savings were reduced by 40 the amount of water rights available cannot meet the demands of both industry and forestry after reducing the amount by 60 even if wrt is only applied to forestry there is still a shortfall of 92 million m3 of water for forestry at 90 reduction the water savings in agriculture are only 0 75 billion m3 and neither industry nor forestry can meet their water needs it can be observed that when only a water market exists the lower the agricultural water savings the more industrial operators are affected however forestry operators are able to withstand the losses caused by a sharp reduction in agricultural water usage and continue to adopt ef strategies as aifs seeks to maximize its own benefits it indirectly contributes to the shift from wrt to cet as the dominant market 4 3 4 impact of change in subsidies for agriculture and forestry fig 7 shows the effect of subsidies on the strategy evolution of aifss the represents that the subsidy price in drb remains unchanged under the corresponding situation the represents that the subsidy is increased on the original basis and the represents that the subsidy is decreased on the original basis the greater the subsidy the greater the preference for sd and csf strategies among agricultural and forestry operators additionally subsidies for agricultural and forestry operators do not affect the evolution of industrial ec strategies by wrt or cet agricultural operators would still be able to use sd strategies while reducing subsidies by 50 despite this the implementation of water trading and carbon trading does not enable forestry operators to choose a csf strategy for the original or lower subsidy scenario it is interesting to note that in the mm scenario lower subsidies to agriculture actually prolong the convergence time of the ef strategy as a result of the findings agriculture may be able to gain greater benefits from trading in water and carbon at this stage there is however a great benefits gap between forestry ef and csf strategies and in order to develop forestry carbon sinks government subsidies are required 5 discussion and policy implications our simulation revealed the influence of initial strategy probability and parameter values on the evolution of strategy in a tripartite evolutionary game specifically the numerical simulation revealed the following a one way sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the 19 main parameters on the evolution of aifs strategies in four scenarios with 10 variation in each parameter fig 8 figs s1 s3 according to our findings the strategy evolution of aifss under the cm scenario are more sensitive to unit net benefits of agriculture transformation costs unit net benefits of economic forests forest area and carbon sink subsidies in addition the effects of unit net benefits of agriculture are more pronounced on the wm scenario and mm scenario thus the strategy choice of agricultural operators in the drb will influence the other two sectors significantly through wrt and cet nevertheless wrt and cet are based on the assumption that there are buyers sellers and surplus resources in the basin in the drb the relative benefits of ec and ef strategies is high the result is the establishment of more stable buyers on the market it is more conducive by improving the net benefits of agricultural sd strategies in the drb to the establishment of effective and stable resource cooperation among aifs even though most existing studies focus on the transaction costs and prices of the trading process we find that carbon and water prices are generally low in the basin and have little influence on the strategies evolution of aifs prior studies have primarily focused on single markets our results suggest however that market trading facilitates intersectoral resource cooperation resulting in a certain degree of coupling between sectoral strategy choices it is also evident that there is an asymmetry in the strategic coupling effect of wrt and cet on aifs as a result we find that the contribution made by cet to the mutual coupling of aifs strategies under the cm scenario is relatively limited while wrt under the wm scenario enhances the strategic coupling between the agricultural and industrial sectors the wrt plays a dominant role in influencing aifs strategy choices when these two markets work together and multiple markets form a complex strategic coupling according to scott et al 2011 water is scarce at the basin scale than carbon and is more likely to affect sectoral decisions strengthening the development and management of water markets may be an effective way to overcome the current low level of participation in the market among operators in the drb the synergy of multiple markets in watershed resource transactions results in greater benefits for participants whereas the deepening strategic coupling of participants carries significant risks previous research has also demonstrated the benefits and risks associated with synergies dong et al 2019 pittock et al 2013 qiang jian 2020 in the event that agricultural operators change their sd strategies or cut back on water savings as a result of external environmental uncertainties they directly undermine the relative benefits of ec and ef strategies for industrial and forestry operators water shortage losses in industry and forestry are causing this impact with marginal water shortage losses increasing in tandem with marginal water use benefits industry and forestry will suffer further losses due to water shortages in the future as a result of the current increasingly stringent water uses requirements we have found that under a diversified market when the benefits of wrt to industry and forestry operators are significantly lower 90 reduction they will adjust their strategies in order to form a market dominated by cet diversifying the market environment can effectively reduce the risk of a particular market failing a traditional approach to modeling resource markets places a greater emphasis on the contribution of trading behavior to society s overall welfare bekchanov et al 2015 britz et al 2013 in this study we present an analysis of the potential trade offs and coordination between water and carbon trading based on the overlap in participants between the water and carbon markets and the pursuit of self interest maximization by the individuals involved our findings indicate that market frameworks do not always correspond with participant behavior a participant will always choose the strategy that maximizes his or her own interests which may not correspond with the expectations of the market environment in the framework hypothesized in this study forestry operators prefer to adopt the ef strategy there are important implications for understanding the construction of regional resource markets and participants trading behaviors arising from these results the above analysis has significant policy implications for mutual cooperation and resource complementarity in a region the implications are as follows sustainable agricultural development must be emphasized based on the results of this study sustainable agricultural development plays an important role in facilitating resource market transactions in the watershed traditional agricultural production models place a great deal of emphasis on economic efficiency but this can have adverse effects on the environment sustainable agricultural development can contribute to water conservation and carbon sink capacity ensuring a stable supply of resources in the water and carbon market despite the fact that sustainable agricultural development in a market framework can generate more revenue through wrt and cet the development of sustainable agricultural development is currently inextricably linked to the government s policies that support it as a result policy makers should enhance regulations technological innovations and policy management in order to ensure sustainable agriculture water security should be ensured for industry and forestry according to our research wrt plays a dominant role in a multiple market and it can improve the effectiveness with which industry and forestry choose ec and ef strategies significantly however the uncertainty associated with agricultural water savings can affect the benefits of industry and forestry participation in water rights trading it is recommended that basins consider implementing models such as reserve water rights trading and water options trading to ensure the stability of water markets the revenue gap must be balanced in forestry development models forestry operators choose a very short convergence time for their ef strategy and they develop carbon sink forests only after the benefits of water rights trading have significantly decreased this means that forestry operators have already suffered huge economic losses when adjusting their strategies which is not conducive to the growth of a diversified market developing carbon sink forests requires the improvement of relevant laws and regulations planting techniques and management methods increasing the average mu carbon sink capacity of forest land as well as increasing the amount of financial subsidies and carbon sink prices that are provided for carbon sink projects balanced income from forest development will facilitate the development of a diversified market and optimize the allocation of water and carbon in the watershed this study has certain limitations first there were no matching statistical data at the urban level which poses a major challenge to water carbon nexus modeling between aifss therefore some data were based on previous research second the hypothesis section of the evolutionary game model was streamlined we only analyzed the direct benefits and losses of aifss in wrt and cet the effects of environmental and social benefits on the model were not quantified additionally since drb is located in southern china where water resources are abundant this study did not investigate the effect of new afforestation on runoff 6 conclusion we used an evolutionary game model to analyze the strategic interaction of aifs stakeholders in wrt and cet and built a replication dynamic equation to simulate the evolutionary strategy process on that basis combined with the empirical analysis of drb we discussed the influence of parameter value changes on the ess of aifss specifically we find that the aifs strategy in the drb evolves in market scenarios to an e 7 1 1 0 equilibrium that is more conducive to the wrt wrt strengthens the coupling of aifs strategies in diversified markets and the net benefits of agriculture have the greatest impact on game systems additionally the diversified market increases the affordability of industry for higher carbon prices and agriculture for lower subsidies but it also introduces more uncertainty risk into the market when a particular market fails players in a multi market environment may adjust their strategies accordingly nevertheless the strategies devised by individuals according to their own interests do not always align with the expectations of the market our understanding of the differences between individual behavior and market framework has very important practical implications for improving market conditions guiding market development and resolving market problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2559,the flow regime of the largest lake in southeast asia tonle sap lake is driven by the reverse flow phenomenon caused by its link with the mekong river this reverse flow makes the lake one of the most productive aquatic ecosystems globally and thus provides important economic opportunities for local communities the recent human activities in the upstream as well as climate variations have resulted in unforeseen alterations in the reverse flow however little is known about the explicit attribution of different parts of the upstream basin to these variations which would be essential for transboundary water management to unveil these attributions we developed a novel modeling setup consisting of hydrodynamic hydrological and machine learning models this modeling setup allowed us to separate the impacts of a climate variation b human activities in the chinese part of the basin and b the lower part of the basin i e laos thailand and vietnam during the 2001 2009 baseline when human modifications to the flow were still minimal we found that tonle sap lake received on average 42 4 km3 yr water from the mekong 48 2 of the total inflow to the lake during the period of increased human activities 2010 2020 this decreased due to climate variation to 40 1 km3 yr a 5 7 drop which was further exacerbated by the increased human activities in the upstream parts of the basin china 7 3 laos thailand and vietnam 9 additionally during the flow period when water flows from the lake towards the mekong on average 31 of the total inflow into the mekong delta originated from the lake during the baseline period climate variation decreased this by 4 percentage points pp i e to 27 while the human activities in china and lower parts of the basin decreased this by 1 6 pp 25 4 and 1 9 pp 25 1 respectively our findings unveiled the attributions of different drivers on tonle sap lake s hydrology and will facilitate transboundary water management in the basin the impacts of future plans on different parts of the basin should be carefully evaluated together with existing anthropogenic impacts as well as climate change to minimize the further impacts on the lake keywords tonle sap lake reverse flow climate variation human activities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction while river floodplains are regarded as the most ecologically productive ecosystems globally dang et al 2018 recent anthropogenic activities exacerbated by climate variation have led to the river lake floodplain systems being identified as the most endangered part of the large scale basins rosenzweig et al 2007 frappart et al 2018 the mekong river tonle sap lake system harboring one of the world s most noticeable assemblies of fish diversity second only to the amazon river chan et al 2020 is mainly the case influenced by human activities and climate variation in the past decades keskinen 2006 pokhrel et al 2018 oeurng et al 2019 do et al 2020 fig 1 shows the lancang mekong river basin lmrb and the constructed dams until 2020 cgiar research program on water land and ecosystems as the most critical remnant wetland ecosystem campbell et al 2009 mrc 2010 uk et al 2018 the tonle sap lake floodplain system fig 1a experiences an annual hydraulic phenomenon known as reverse flow due to existing interaction with mekong river the reverse flow benefits in the given river lake system are twofold during the wet season a relatively large portion of water from the mekong river is discharged into the lake and surrounding alluvial plain through the tonle sap river which expands the area significantly arias et al 2014 providing a rich habitat for spawning 296 fish species baran et al 2013 additionally these flood waters increase soil fertility for rice farming by bringing nutrient rich sediment from the upper mekong during the dry season the tonle sap lake functions as a natural floodwater reservoir so that the stored water during the wet season due to the reverse flow is gradually drained and re combined with the mekong river which per se positively affects the fishery habitat and rice farming in the mekong delta highlighting the transboundary importance of the reverse flow phenomenon the lmrb is endowed with geographic advantages through crossing various ecological zones in the recent decade the riparian countries have been under pressure for harnessing its powerful flow through the construction of hydropower dams and irrigation water abstraction projects e g the rice white gold project in 2010 announced by the cambodian government see more details in asian development bank adb 2019 besides many tributary dams 13 dams have been completed on the mainstream of the lmr thus far of which 11 and 2 of them are attributed to china and laos respectively providing 10 of the total hydropower potential of the lmrb mrc 2019 the common theory is that mainstream dams have the leading role in lmrb s current flow regime change supporting the viewpoint that the cost of the given alterations in the flow regime is borne by downstream countries keskinen et al 2010 yu et al 2019 these together with climate variation have influenced the reverse flow phenomenon and other major features of the flow regime associated with the river lake system including the inundation area lake volume the exchanged water between the tonle sap lake and mekong river and the contribution of the lake to the mekong delta before 2005 the flow regime of the lmrb remained in a relatively natural condition mrc 2005 and a few studies were conducted to quantify various flow regime features and their changes in the tonle sap lake floodplain system kummu and sarkkula 2008 kummu et al 2014 lin and qi 2017 ji et al 2018 however in the investigated period the lmrb was less influenced by anthropogenic activities than after 2010 thus requiring further research on the influence of human caused activities on the tonle sap lake s flow regime some valuable studies were recently conducted to address the annual flood duration flood pulse and inundation area based on three main human caused activities dams sand mining and irrigation chen et al 2021 chua et al 2022 however these lack explicit attribution of the observed changes by tonle sap lake s flow regime to climate variability and upstream human activities previous studies employed some developed rating curves to calculate water exchange between the mekong river and tonle sap lake applicable to when the water level at phnom penh port station was higher than the lake see fig 1b for stations location fig 1c shows that the onset and end of the reverse flow phenomenon do not coincide with the water level at phnom penh port station being higher than the lake thereby causing errors in calculating the annual discharged water into the lake during the reverse flow period from mekong river one potential reason is that the water level in the mekong river fluctuates mainly due to dam operation policy and heavy downpours causing the water level not to remain higher than the lake continuously this consequently negatively influences the calculation of the drained water from the lake to the mekong river and further delta during the non reverse flow period an error in accurately determining the reverse flow interval would cause the role of the lake functioning as a natural spillway for the mekong delta to be poorly assessed therefore the existing complicated phenomenon in the given river lake system requires a hydrodynamic model to continuously monitor the streamlines direction to accurately determine the onset and end of the reverse flow additionally quantitative analysis of the tonle sap lake system poses challenges a factor blamed on modeling its environs since numerous tributaries characterize the area see fig 1b the lake s dynamic behavior and flow regime variability of the lmrb beyond reliable continuous data on main tributaries flowing into the lake accordingly tonle sap lake and its environs have been investigated in many aspects using integrated models e g hydrodynamic and hydrological models tanaka et al 2018 dang et al 2022 and rating curves frappart et al 2006 kummu et al 2014 siev et al 2016 frappart et al 2018 development of the integrated models is to a certain justified as data scarcity remains a further challenge in this area particularly for the lake s tributaries for example rating curves were generated for these tributaries based on the limited number of measured discharge data over the study period see for example kummu et al 2014 in other words the rating curves in such works are limited to the data set of a given study and when they are used with data outside of the original period they either no longer apply or degrade therefore as recommended by kummu et al 2014 the developed rating curves must be methodically updated which has remained a challenge as measured data for surrounding areas for the recent decade does not exist despite limitations in the approaches discussed earlier recent developed floodplain reservoir hydrodynamic models coupled with hydrological ones have overcome these limitations to some extent for example in dang et al 2022 however reservoir operation uncertainties and considering some of the upstream dams hinder explicit attribution of the current flow regime change to climate variability and each upstream country which is vital for transboundary water development understanding flow regime change and the degree to which this change is attributed to the human activities in the upper countries and climate variation is critical to sustainable regional management especially with establishing a couple of cooperation mechanisms among the riparian countries e g mrc lancang mekong cooperation mechanism etc given the importance of the area and knowledge gaps identified above this study expands on previous research in at least three ways i our developed hydrodynamic model can accurately reproduce the annual reverse and non reverse flow periods resulting in accurate calculation of the exchanged water between tonle sap lake and mekong river ii the model is then integrated with hydrological and machine learning models to quantify the effects of human activities in upstream countries and climate variation on the tonle sap lake s flow regime shifting the conversation from how much the flow regime has changed to how much each upstream country has contributed to these changes which is essential for transboundary development iii the developed model and results of the present work provide a reference and valuable insight into understanding the river lake systems driven by the reverse flow phenomenon 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with 4880 km in length and an average annual runoff of 457 billion m3 the lmr drains an area of 812 000 km2 the tibetan plateau northern highlands khorat plateau tonle sap lake basin and the delta are the main physiographic regions of the lmr lyon et al 2017 the northern highlands covers laos thailand and some parts of vietnam where the lmr flows through steep rock cut valleys with a low gradient region providing dendritic flow features for lmr the khorat plateau comprises northeast thailand and the eastern margin of central laos as the central component of the lmr and the most crucial wetland ecosystem in southeast asia with alluvial lowlands and a dome like structure the tonle sap lake basin covers most of cambodia the lake connects with the mekong river at phnom penh through the tonle sap river a tributary of the mekong river with 120 km long lamberts 2008 siev et al 2019 see fig 1b the lake comprises a permanent part consisting of a large northwest basin connected with a narrow strait to a relatively smaller southeast basin shrubs and inundated forests are the dominant features of the surrounding floodplains of the permanent part of the lake forming a vital part of the given ecological system ji et al 2018 the lake is located in a tropic monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation varying from 1300 mm to 1500 mm siev et al 2018 during the flood season the water level in the mekong river is higher than the lake reversing the flow in tonle sap river and discharging into the lake making the lake area to be enlarged from 3500 km2 to around 12500 km2 kummu et al 2014 and according to some studies even to almost 17500 km2 arias et al 2012 tangdamrongsub et al 2016 nagumo et al 2017 the enlarged area and the significant amount of transported nutrients due to the given river lake interaction increase soil fertility for rice farming and fish spawning making the tonle sap lake the most fish abundant body of freshwater globally kummu et al 2004 2 2 methods and data collection an integrated hydrodynamic hydrological machine learning model was developed to quantitatively address the impacts produced by upstream countries human activities and climate variation on the flow regime of the given river lake system fig 2 shows the detailed steps of how the developed models were employed in the present work detailed information about the developed models is presented in the following sub sections 2 2 1 data we obtained daily water level h for chaktomuk hch phnom penh port hpp prek kdam hpk and kompong luong hkl stations and daily discharge data for kratie qkr station from the mrc https portal mrcmekong org time series for the years 2001 to 2020 see fig 1 for stations location these stations were selected due to their undeniable role in investigating the major features of the flow regime of the area for the investigated years the corresponding data were continuous except for the kompong luong station therefore a relationship was developed based on the historical water level data of hch hpk and hkl using gene expression programming see fig s1 in section 1 of the supplementary material sm file as follows 1 h kl h pk 2 h ch r 2 0 97 many tributaries flow into the tonle sap river and tonle sap lake see fig 1b with no or limited continuous measured data over the last two decades these tributaries play an essential role in the flow regime analysis of the tonle sap lake system rating curves for these tributaries were generated however they have limitations as discussed earlier to produce highly accurate continuous and reliable discharge data on a daily scale we developed a hydrological model namely threw model i e tsinghua representative elementary watershed for detailed information refer to the following sub sections and tian et al 2008 and tian et al 2012 li et al 2012 sun et al 2014 and xu et al 2019 2 2 2 hydrological model the adopted hydrological model i e threw has been successfully applied to the mekong river and other watersheds in existing studies tian et al 2006 2008 and tian et al 2012 li et al 2012 sun et al 2014 xu et al 2019 morovati et al 2021 the model was further improved for two purposes 1 to obtain continuous daily time series discharge data for tributaries with no measured or limited data and 2 to consider the impacts of each country s human activities and climate variation on mainstream and tributaries discharge while detailed information about the model can be attained from the above mentioned references a brief outline of the model is given below the threw model delineates the watershed using the representative elementary watershed rew method the rew is a functional element that contains all of the necessary information for the watershed the scale and division of the rew have no effect on hydrological characteristics allowing the user to define these features based on the level of detail precision required additionally this characteristic enables a rew to be subdivided into additional rews to further increase precision in complex areas of a watershed eight zones were contained within each rew bare soil zone vegetated zone snow covered zone glacier covered zone sub stream network zone main channel reach zone saturated zone and unsaturated zone tian et al 2008 each zone was connected to the rew using mass momentum energy and entropy balance equations meteorological and rainfall data provided by mrc and china meteorological administration cma were used as drivers for the threw model for the mekong and lancang sub regions daily rainfall data were obtained from 166 and 12 gauge stations respectively for both sub regions meteorological data containing near surface air pressure air temperature air specific humidity wind speed and direction sunshine duration and solar radiation was also obtained from 12 gauge stations these data were then used to compute potential evapotranspiration as an essential input for threw model based upon the penman monteith equation for eight hydrological stations on the lmr i e jinghong chiang saen luang prabang nong khai nakhon phanom mukdahan pakse and stung treng see fig 1a measured daily discharge data were obtained for the years between 1991 and 2016 from 2005 onward the number of rainfall gauges has decreased significantly thus gpm imerg final run dataset huffman et al 2019 being already proven to yield highly accurate data lauri et al 2014 he et al 2015 li et al 2019 was used threw model was calibrated 2001 2009 and validated 1991 2000 based on eight hydrological stations mentioned above 2 2 3 machine learning model to estimate daily water levels at chaktomuk used as the outlet boundary for the hydrodynamic model fig 2c we applied a machine learning model i e long short term memory lstm morovati et al 2021 contrary to the process based models i e hydrological and hydrodynamic models which require numerous high resolution inputs and great computational capacity hindering the application of these models machine learning data based models not only require much less simulation time but can effectively capture the inherent nonlinear relationship between the input and output therefore a deep learning method lstm was used to predict the daily river water levels at the chaktomuk station corresponding to the discharge data of kratie station as the input data for the lstm model the deep learning methods have multiple neuron layers in their architecture increasing their ability to simulate more complex functions 2 2 4 hydrodynamic model a hydrodynamic model is required to simulate the dynamics of the given river lake system therefore we developed a hydrodynamic model to simulate the water exchange between the mekong river and tonle sap lake during reverse and non reverse flow periods water levels and determination of the reverse flow interval these can be seen as the most critical factors in addressing the major features of the flow regime variability in this complex river lake system we used the open source delft3d flow software deltares 2014 to simulate the 3d flow field in tonle sap lake and its environs delft3d flow model is a modeling suite with the capability of investigating hydrodynamics sediment transport and morphology in complex areas such as estuaries rivers and lakes deltares 2014 the model has been successfully used in similar systems soulignac et al 2017 baracchini et al 2020 gaillard et al 2022 and thus justifies its use in our study the horizontal length scale is much larger than the depth for rivers lakes and estuaries meaning that the shallow water assumption is valid therefore following shallow water flow equations and boussinesq assumptions the navier stokes equations were solved in delft3d flow for an incompressible fluid in rivers and estuaries the boundaries are generally curved and an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate was used to reduce the discretization errors as these boundaries may not be smoothly represented by the rectangular grid therefore the spherical coordinate was used in the horizontal direction supported by an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity were set to 1 and 10 5 respectively advection in momentum equations was completed using the cyclic method the impact of wind wasn t considered in the simulations implemented thus the turbulent kinetic energy k close to the free surface was set to zero the flow in the simulations was regarded as a non stratified flow water level and discharge were calculated or defined in the grid cell centers the developed model does not consider the groundwater infiltration process owing to data scarcity and lack of information previous studies have conducted some groundwater infiltration analyses however they have concentrated on the areas outside of the tonle sap lake landon 2011 burnett et al 2013 analyzed the available data for the year 2009 and found that infiltration for the northern section of the lake during the recession phase was 4 8 km3 even if we suppose that this value will remain constant for upcoming years the conducted analysis would not significantly change this study s water level data is expressed as the elevation above mean sea level amsl in hatien vietnam the kratie station located on the mekong river and virtually 164 km upstream of the confluence was considered as the inlet boundary condition fig 2c daily time series discharge data with a vertical uniform profile for hydrodynamics was imposed on the inlet boundary the chaktomuk station was considered with water level time series data for the outlet boundary fig 2c the existing main tributaries discharging into tonle sap lake and tonle sap river were considered as the additional boundary condition and the corresponding continuous daily time series discharge data were obtained by threw model discussed earlier a spherical system was used to define the meshing of the computational domain and the corresponding requirements concerning smoothness and orthogonality were fulfilled dd boundary technique was used for meshing since tonle sap lake is quite wide compared to the tonle sap river and mekong river as seen in fig 2c detailed information on the developed hydrodynamic model is found in sections 2 and 3 of the sm file the simulations were implemented at a daily time step over 20 years starting from jan 2001 and ending in dec 2020 in this work a computer workstation with 24 cores intel r xeon r cpu e7 4850 v4 2 10 ghz and 32 gb of ram was employed and the computational time for each run from 2001 to 2020 was about 35 days 2 3 scenario setting to separate the impacts of human activities from different parts of the basin and climate variations we used observed and simulated data over the past two decades i e 2001 to 2020 this time period can be divided into distinct phases until 2005 the flow regime of the mekong river remained relatively unimpacted by human activities according to the mrc 2005 and from 2005 to 2009 only jinghong dam was constructed with a total capacity of around 0 25 km3 which is insignificant compared to average annual runoff 421 km3 at kratie station thus the flow regime of the mekong river experienced insignificant changes due to human impact before 2009 and we considered this period i e 2001 to 2009 as the baseline period from 2010 to 2020 the number of irrigation projects and commissioned dams with large storage capacity increased significantly e g xiaowan and nuozhadu dams with a total capacity of 39 km3 representing the mega dam era mekong region futures institute mrfi 2020 soukhaphon et al 2021 the impacts of the increased human activities and climate variation from 2010 to 2020 on the major features of the flow regime of the tonle sap lake system were addressed and compared with the baseline period human activities refer to all types of water withdrawals and consumptions as well as dam operations since there was not enough historical reliable and comprehensive data for each sector to be separately considered for example attributes of dams regarding operation rules are publicly available only for a handful of dams while an extensive number of such structures have been built on the mainstream and tributaries influencing the streamflow of the mekong river we assessed and quantified the flow regime changes of the tonle sap river lake floodplain system using five scenarios as described below see also fig s10 the assessed flow regime changes include water level and discharge in the mekong river exchanged water between mekong river and tonle sap lake inundation area a and lake volume v baseline scenario sbaseline the observed discharge data at stung treng from 2001 to 2009 qst1 was used to calculate the baseline discharge as follows from stung treng to kratie station there are some tributaries see fig 1a and b and the corresponding discharge data of these tributaries qtribs obtained by threw model were added to the observed discharge data at stung treng to obtained the discharge data at kratie station note that stung treng is the closest cambodian station to the border with laos where its corresponding discharge represents the upstream impacts also as we mentioned above the kratie station was used as the inlet boundary for the developed hydrodynamic model qbaseline denoting the discharge for the baseline period is obtained as follows 2 q baseline q s t 1 q tribs climate scenario sclimate to assess the impact of changes in climate on the flow regime we compared the discharge obtained by equation 2 i e qbaseline with the simulated discharge from 2010 to 2020 this is defined as iclimate 3 i climate q simst q tribs q baseline where qsimst denotes the simulated discharge data by threw model at stung treng station china scenario schina to quantify the influence of the increased human activities from 2010 to 2020 hereafter ihad2 in china the observed discharge in the jinghong station qmj the last hydrological station in china see also fig s10 was used as an upstream boundary in threw model i e instead of simulating the chinese part of the basin we used the observed flow influenced by human activities and climate change then the threw model was run for the areas between jinghong and stung treng stations with meteorological data from 2010 to 2020 producing the influenced discharge time series data by climate change and ihad2 in china at stung treng also some tributaries exist from stung treng to kratie stations as discussed above we added the corresponding discharge data of these tributaries with the obtained discharge of stung treng station to yield the kratie discharge used as the inlet boundary for the

assessed and quantified to be noted the human activities of laos thailand and vietnam were not separated because the mekong river and many tributaries e g the 3s tributary that includes sekong sesan and srepok rivers span across the country s borders and thus we considered these countries as one area to estimate the impact from these countries we first estimated the impact of the ihad2 related to all countries iall equation 5 and that was calculated as follows 5 i all q s t 2 q tribs q baseline i climate where qst2 denotes the observed discharge data at stung treng station for the years 2010

given in fig s10 in section 6 of the sm file distinguishing the chines part of the basin and downstream countries as well as the type of data used in each scenario as discussed above the present study s main purpose was to address the contribution of the upstream countries anthropogenic activities to the flow regime change of the tonle sap lake floodplain system thus we assumed that the recent human activities downstream of the stung treng station less pronounced than upstream basins have insignificantly influenced the mekong river s streamflow and the lake s surrounding area in other words we assumed that the lake s surrounding area and the area between stung treng and chaktomuk stations remained intact from 2010 to 2020 to ensure the combination of the observed and modeled data in these scenarios does not influence the flow regime analysis a comparison was conducted over the years 1991 to 2000 for major features of the flow regime between threw model and measured data at kratie station for example less than a 2 discrepancy and two days difference were observed in the exchanged water between the mekong river and the lake and the reverse flow interval this 2 discrepancy originating from simulation errors in threw hydrodynamic and machine learning models as well as the combination of the modeled data with observed ones appears to be reasonable and acceptable because of 1 uncertainties in bathymetry and sedimentation process making it difficult to accurately represent the river channel bifurcation 2 lack of continuous observed discharge data for 11 tributaries flowing into the tonle sap river and tonle sap lake which per se causes errors in the case of employing rating curves or threw model 3 the strategy for scenarios is analogous making the obtained trend see results section remain unchanged although the percentage changes of the contribution of the upstream countries may change 3 results and interpretation 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 hydrological model the threw hydrological model was calibrated with 2001 to 2009 data and validated with 1991 2000 data using observed daily discharge data from eight hydrological stations along the lmrb the model shows almost the same accuracy in all stations an average nse 0 92 and the produced discharge profiles follow relatively close to the measured ones see fig 3 the greatest nse is attributed to the stung treng station 0 95 which is used as a key hydrological station in scenario setting section and flow regime analyses during the reverse flow period in this river lake system 3 1 2 machine learning model to validate the machine learning model the simulated daily water levels were compared with the observed ones at two floodplain stations chaktomuk and prek kdam see fig 1b for stations location the model captured well the water level fluctuations and the general shapes of the obtained water level profiles followed relatively close to the observed ones see section 5 of the sm file the corresponding accuracy of water level estimation at both stations showed nse 0 97 highlighting the reliability of the developed model further information is found in morovati et al 2021 3 1 3 hydrodynamic model observing streamlines at various time scales is one of the advantages of the developed hydrodynamic model through which the onset and end of the reverse flow period are determined see fig s7 in section 3 of the sm file an accurate prediction of the reverse flow period in the tonle sap lake is of utmost importance as the accumulated water due to this phenomenon i e reverse flow enlarges the lake s area providing a rich habitat for spawning fish and rice farming a comparison of the predicted reverse flow period between 2010 and 2020 is conducted in table 1 using the k ε turbulence model and various discretization schemes cyclic model yields more accurate results than its counterpart for the cyclic method though the onset and end of the period are different from the observed dates with a maximum difference of 2 days the duration of the given periods remains almost identical the accuracy of the reverse flow prediction reduces as the flooding and waqua schemes are employed further information regarding mesh sensitivity analysis discretization schemes and turbulence models is found in section 3 of the sm file to further verify the accuracy of the developed model a comparison of the yielded daily discharge data by the developed hydrodynamic model with measured daily discharge data from 2000 to 2020 at prek kdam station is presented in fig 4 in this figure negative and positive discharge values correspond to the discharged water into the lake from the mekong river during the reverse flow period hereafter qintsr and the drained water from the lake to the mekong river during the non reverse flow period hereafter qouttsr respectively the developed model agrees very well with the measured discharge data in reverse and non reverse flow periods on average nse 0 97 note that the obtained measured data were discontinuous over the study period all of which are given in fig 4 3 2 changes in the mekong river the flow regime s major features influencing the tonle sap lake ecosystem are driven by the mekong river s streamflow västilä et al 2010 arias et al 2013 kallio and kummu 2021 the influenced discharge at the kratie station yielded by threw model and the water level at the chaktomuk station obtained by the developed machine learning model is shown in fig 5 as expected both discharge and the corresponding water level follow virtually the same trend the obtained trends for discharge in sbasline and sclimate are greatly consistent with climate variation trend e g precipitation see fig 5a from june to september the most significant alterations to discharge and the water level are observed referring to the dam s role in storing water during the wet season to provide more water for surrounding areas and downstream as one of the primary goals of these structures compared to sclimate schina decreased discharge and water levels from august to october end while sltv influenced a longer interval i e from june to november as seen climate variation and upstream human activities changed the occurrence of maximum discharge at the kratie station from august to september compared to the baseline period with the monthly average peak discharge water level of 35 200 m3 s 9 30 m sclimate decreased the monthly average peak discharge water level to around 34 800 m3 s 9 25 m schina reduced the peak discharge water level to 33 400 m3 s 9 12 m or 4 1 4 and a larger reduction of peak discharge by sltv i e 32 700 m3 s 8 99 m or 6 2 8 the combined scenario of all impacts scombined decreased the peak discharge water level to 30 787 m3 s 8 08 m or 12 6 13 1 compared to the baseline period sclimate had an insignificant impact on the minimum discharge water level and both remained virtually constant at 2300 m3 s 1 81 m in contrast sltv increased the minimum discharge water level to 2805 m3 s 1 94 m or 22 7 2 with a more pronounced increase attributed to schina i e 3138 m3 s and 2 01 m or 36 11 scombined increased the minimum discharge water level to 3250 m3 s 2 02 m i e a 41 increase 11 6 increase 3 3 changes in tonle sap lake s major features the ecosystem of the tonle sap lake and mekong delta is driven by the reverse flow phenomenon as according to some studies fujii et al 2003 kummu et al 2014 a significant portion of the discharged water into the mekong delta originates from the lake since the major features of the flow regime in this area are addressed by the length of the reverse flow it is essential to accurately determine how climate variation and increased human activities in the recent decade have influenced this phenomenon fig 6 shows the length of the reverse flow period influenced by defined scenarios the end of the reverse flow period was insignificantly influenced by climate variation and ihad2 in the upstream countries for example compared to the sbaseline sclimate has insignificantly changed the onset of the reverse flow one day while the end of the period remained unchanged this is primarily consistent with schina where it commenced 4 days earlier compared to the sbaseline regarding sltv the reverse flow period was further shortened with a more pronounced decline attributed to the onset of the reverse flow period on average 9 days highlighting the greater negative impact of the downstream countries of china which could be due to the high number of dams and other water abstraction projects in the recent decade from jinghong station to stung treng station as well as a relatively small portion of the jinghong stations runoff 13 8 to the total runoff passing kratie station as expected scombined covers the shortest interval of the rainy season for the reverse flow phenomenon compared to other scenarios delaying the onset of the given phenomenon by about 12 days additionally the average monthly water level for phnom penh port hpp and kompong luong hkl stations is illustrated in fig 6 for both decades results reveal that the onset of the reverse flow does not coincide with when hpp hkl contradicting the presumption reported by kummu et al 2014 in the first decade i e 2001 to 2009 with the onset of the rainy season may hpp hkl while on average the reverse flow starts at the may end see sbaseline this trend did not remain constant for the second decade and hpp hkl occurred in early april while the average start date of the reverse flow was early june see scombined table 2 gives information on the main features of the flow regime of the tonle sap lake floodplain system during the reverse flow period the largest contributions to the total inflow into the lake tot are attributed to qintsr and the lake s tributaries qtribslake 44 contrary to the combined effects of climate variation and human activities scombined in which the tributaries played the leading role in total inflow into the lake 48 32 in other scenarios the greater contribution was attributed to the qintsr representing the mekong river s role compared to the sbaseline climate variation sclimate decreased the total inflow into the lake to 80 0 km3 yr around a 9 drop this was further exacerbated by schina 76 4 km3 yr and sltv 75 0 km3 yr the combined effects of climate variation and human activities scombined caused the largest reduction 70 0 km3 yr accounting for a 20 4 drop further the slightest variation is attributed to precipitation and evaporation and for all scenarios the corresponding values remained virtually constant note that the results corresponding to qintsr in table 2 were produced by the developed hydrodynamic model regarding how the corresponding results of precipitation and evaporation were calculated refer to section 7 of the sm file also for annual values of qintsr associated with the defined scenarios refer to section 7 of the sm file the inundated area a during the reverse flow period is vital for the ecosystem and productivity of the tonle sap lake for example if the discharged water floods a smaller area during the reverse flow period a smaller amount of potential terrestrial organic matter is exchanged between the aquatic and terrestrial transition zones junk 1997 lamberts and koponen 2008 kummu et al 2014 the inundation area and lake volume are calculated based on the water level at kompong luong station hkl we followed the same approach reported by kummu et al 2014 to calculate a and v we used the digital bathymetric model dbm of the lake together with hkl to develop the following relationships on a daily scale 9 a k m 2 5 5701 h kl 3 137 4 h kl 2 470 29 h kl 1680 2 r 2 0 99 10 v k m 3 0 7307 h kl 2 0 354 h kl 0 9127 r 2 0 99 table 3 gives information about the annual average maximum and minimum values of a v and hkl based on defined scenarios as expected the tonle sap lake experienced the highest water level inundation area and volume in the sbaseline compared to the sbaseline sclimate decreased the maximum values of hkl a and v to 7 72 m 10950 km2 and 42 km3 accounting for an 11 5 8 1 and 14 4 drop respectively upstream human activities further exacerbated this trend with a more negative impact attributed to sltv similar to the results given in table 2 the combined effects of climate variation and upstream human activities scombined caused the largest decrease in maximum water level at kampong luong maximum lake area a and maximum lake volume v 15 4 for hkl 16 3 for a and 25 8 for v a similar trend is observed for the minimum values of the a v and hkl though in different percentage changes 3 4 changes in reverse flow to the mekong delta the share of the tonle sap lake in the total inflow passing confluence and further mekong delta during the non reverse flow period i e flow from the lake to the mekong is shown in fig 7 in the baseline scenario sbaseline tonle sap lake provided the considerable portion of the total water flow for the delta with the highest and lowest contributions attributed to december 46 2 and october 18 4 respectively with an annual average of 31 this highlights the transboundary importance of the tonle sap lake and its floodplains this trend is more consistent with sclimate however the annual contribution of the lake to delta decreased to 27 around a 4 percentage point pp drop while the share of the lake to the total water into the delta remained almost constant in november and october upstream ihad2 resulted in the least amount of water being supplied in april the annual average contribution of the lake to the delta influenced by the schina and sltv decreased to 25 4 and 25 1 respectively the cumulative impacts of climate variation and upstream human activities defined by scombined show that the annual contribution of the lake decreased to around 23 9 i e a 7 1 pp drop compared to sbaseline a factor blamed on storing less water during the reverse flow period in the lake s surrounding area and passing relatively less water through kratie station towards the downstream parts during the dry season see fig 5b in other words the lower the stored water during the wet season in the lake the less water is released to the delta during the dry season 4 discussion various recent studies have explored the changing hydrology of the given river lake floodplain system mainly by employing measured and satellite based data tangdamrongsub et al 2016 frappart et al 2018 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 however an explicit quantification of the impacts produced by climate variation and upstream human activities on the major features of the flow regime shifts in the lake is lacking we developed an integrated model consisting of hydrological machine learning and hydrodynamic models to quantitatively address how the growing anthropogenic activities in the recent decade i e 2010 to 2020 in the lmrb compared to the previous decade altered the flow regime of the tonle sap lake floodplain system while climate variability was found to explain part of the flow regime change upstream human activities were found to have even larger impacts while the combined impacts of the increased human activities and climate variation in the recent decade decreased the peak discharge of kratie station by around 12 6 compared to the previous decade i e from 2001 to 2009 minimum flow increased by approximately 41 3 this trend was in line with findings reported by dang et al 2022 although the magnitude of change differs somewhat between the studies they found that the peak low flow decreased increased by around 7 3 31 6 this difference could be due to the consideration of 86 dams in their research and uncertainties assumptions in the reservoir operation scheme while in the present study findings were based on all upstream human activities regarding the water level and inundation area in the tonle sap lake we found a direct impact of the influenced mekong river s streamflow by climate variation and upstream human activities on the lake s water level and inundation area since 44 of the total inflow into the lake during the reverse flow period originated from mekong river corroborating findings reported by other researchers arias 2012 kummu and sarkkula 2008 dang et al 2022 the declining trend of the lake s water level reported by previous studies lu and chua 2021 chua et al 2022 was further supported in the present work however the results reported in this work provide crucial additional insights by attributing the changes to the upstream countries human activities and climate variation our results indicated that in the recent decade the inundation area shrunk by around 16 4 compared to the previous decade from 11 917 km2 to 9 967 km2 of which 2 2 pp or 13 of total change and 8 1 pp or 50 of total change were attributed to climate change and increased human activities in china respectively our findings thus contradict the findings of wang et al 2020 who estimated that 76 1 and 6 9 of the current shrinkage of the inundation area are due to changes in precipitation i e climate and the impact of chinese dams respectively our results also brought new insight into the occurrence time of the reverse flow phenomenon the developed hydrodynamic model allowed us to simulate the daily flow directions and consequently determine the accurate reverse flow interval the model resulted in more accurate results than existing studies kummu et al 2014 chua et al 2022 which used rating curves to estimate the reverse flow and assumed that the reverse flow occurred when the water level in the mekong river was higher than the lake our results highlighted that the occurrence time of the reverse flow did not always coincide with this water level difference see fig 6 nonetheless the found declining trend of the discharged water into the lake was in line with previous findings chen et al 2021 dang et al 2022 chua et al 2022 however the percentage change was different for example chua et al 2022 reported that the total annual inflow into the lake from the mekong river decreased from 37 75 km3 yr 1995 2009 to 31 74 km3 yr 2010 2018 15 9 drop while the present study found that the total annual inflow dropped from 42 4 km3 yr 2001 2009 to 33 2 km3 yr 2010 2020 21 7 drop further contrary to the existing study conducted by kummu et al 2014 our results revealed no significant difference between the role of the lake s tributaries and the mekong river in the total inflow into the lake during the reverse flow period regarding the mekong delta the released water from tonle sap lake during the dry season oct apr from 2001 to 2009 accounted for 18 46 of the total flow entering into the confluence i e chaktomuk station and further into the delta this is well in line with the findings reported by fujii et al 2003 inomata and fukami 2008 and kummu et al 2014 in which the years before 2004 were addressed 20 50 highlighting that the lake maintained its positive role in supplying water to the delta until 2009 however in the recent decade i e from 2010 to 2020 and with the combined impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change the lake discharge accounted for 11 33 4 1 limitations and way forward although we were able to advance the current understanding there are some priority issues that we were unable to consider in the applied models it would be important to address them to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate variation and upstream development i contrary to the previous research mrc 2011 arias et al 2012 horton et al 2022 this study considered a relatively short baseline period 2001 to 2009 however it was believed that the average values obtained for the baseline period did not significantly change for an extended baseline period since the flow regime along the lmrb remained almost unchanged before 2005 according to many references mrc 2005 kummu et al 2014 ii the combination of the observed and simulated data threw model was used to define scenarios this per se could cause errors in the mekong river s discharge and water levels and consequently the main features of the tonle sap lake although the discrepancies were relatively insignificant as discussed in the 2 3 section providing more accurate data would lead to more precise analysis iii as discussed above the groundwater infiltration process was not considered in the developed hydrodynamic model although its impact seems insignificant compared to the discharged water into the lake from the mekong river qintsr and tributaries it hinders the conducted analysis to precisely address the major features contribution to the total inflow outflow into the lake mekong river such uncertainty as a remained challenge is mainly imposed on the impact of human activities in downstream countries because it is obtained as the residual difference between observed difference vs climate variation and chinese dams it is therefore recommended to commence groundwater measurements within the tonle sap lake floodplain as well as more detailed modeling of the impacts of different parts of the basin iv although the developed hydrological model produced highly accurate results on the mekong river s mainstream and some tributaries around the lake see for example morovati et al 2021 providing more observed data for calibration will reduce the uncertainty of the model v sediment is essential in the lmrb as large amounts are annually transported from the upper parts into the lower mekong subsequently the configuration of the river bed would experience some change the developed model did not consider sediment transportation because of the absence of reliable data on this process additionally riparian countries continuously extract transported sediments from the rivers for construction purposes for which relevant data are generally unavailable and further hinder the understanding of the existing sediment process updating the cross section shape of critical stations such as chaktomuk prek kdam and phnom penh port stations brings valuable insights regarding produced recorded bathymetry data 5 conclusions by developing and integrating a novel modeling setup of hydrodynamic hydrological and machine learning models we explicitly addressed the contribution of the climate variation and upstream countries human activities to the main features of the flow regime shifts in the tonle sap lake mekong river floodplain system through conducting a comprehensive validation we showed that the developed modeling framework performed well and could therefore potentially be employed for lmr s upcoming studies and other floodplains experiencing reverse flow phenomenon findings contributed to the existing literature by providing new insights into the role of the upstream countries and climate variation in the current flow regime change in tonle sap lake while climate variability had changed the flow regime we found that recent increased human activities in the upstream countries played an even larger role in the flow regime change in this unique river lake system as a key parameter in addressing the other major features results associated with reverse flow interval showed that the reverse flow flow from the mekong to the lake lasted on average for 116 days during the baseline period 2001 2009 and it decreased to 107 days due to climate variation and all upstream human activities within the 2010 2020 period we also found that the yearly average discharge into the lake from the mekong river was 42 4 km3 yr during the baseline period this decreased to 33 2 km3 yr in 2010 2020 by the combined impact of climate variation and increased human activities in all upstream countries equivalent to a 21 7 drop of which 6 7 pp was attributed to china caused human activities and around 8 2 pp for downstream countries i e laos thailand vietnam finally we found that on average around 31 of the total inflow into the mekong delta originated from the lake during the baseline period whereas the human activities and climate variation decreased this to 23 9 i e around a 7 1 pp drop our findings assist in developing strategic plan formulation and decision making processes on regional and transboundary scales the implications of the lmrb s development impacts on the flow regime shifts during flooding and dry seasons should be carefully examined decreased mekong river flow during the flooding season provides flood protection benefits especially for the basins close to the mainstream and upstream of the lake whereas increased flow in the dry season provides more water for irrigation and other sectors despite these benefits the negative impacts associated with the less water discharged into the lake from the mekong river during the wet season due to the upstream developments should also be carefully considered as vulnerable communities live around the tonle sap lake floodplain these recent changes have threatened the tonle sap lake ecosystem which is driven by the flood pulse and the large difference between the dry season and wet season water levels this might even increase as the lmrb will experience more anthropogenic activities in the coming years and decades therefore sustainably addressing future climate change and upcoming infrastructure developments requires a balance between these trade offs as tonle sap lake is inseparable from the mekong

2559,the flow regime of the largest lake in southeast asia tonle sap lake is driven by the reverse flow phenomenon caused by its link with the mekong river this reverse flow makes the lake one of the most productive aquatic ecosystems globally and thus provides important economic opportunities for local communities the recent human activities in the upstream as well as climate variations have resulted in unforeseen alterations in the reverse flow however little is known about the explicit attribution of different parts of the upstream basin to these variations which would be essential for transboundary water management to unveil these attributions we developed a novel modeling setup consisting of hydrodynamic hydrological and machine learning models this modeling setup allowed us to separate the impacts of a climate variation b human activities in the chinese part of the basin and b the lower part of the basin i e laos thailand and vietnam during the 2001 2009 baseline when human modifications to the flow were still minimal we found that tonle sap lake received on average 42 4 km3 yr water from the mekong 48 2 of the total inflow to the lake during the period of increased human activities 2010 2020 this decreased due to climate variation to 40 1 km3 yr a 5 7 drop which was further exacerbated by the increased human activities in the upstream parts of the basin china 7 3 laos thailand and vietnam 9 additionally during the flow period when water flows from the lake towards the mekong on average 31 of the total inflow into the mekong delta originated from the lake during the baseline period climate variation decreased this by 4 percentage points pp i e to 27 while the human activities in china and lower parts of the basin decreased this by 1 6 pp 25 4 and 1 9 pp 25 1 respectively our findings unveiled the attributions of different drivers on tonle sap lake s hydrology and will facilitate transboundary water management in the basin the impacts of future plans on different parts of the basin should be carefully evaluated together with existing anthropogenic impacts as well as climate change to minimize the further impacts on the lake keywords tonle sap lake reverse flow climate variation human activities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction while river floodplains are regarded as the most ecologically productive ecosystems globally dang et al 2018 recent anthropogenic activities exacerbated by climate variation have led to the river lake floodplain systems being identified as the most endangered part of the large scale basins rosenzweig et al 2007 frappart et al 2018 the mekong river tonle sap lake system harboring one of the world s most noticeable assemblies of fish diversity second only to the amazon river chan et al 2020 is mainly the case influenced by human activities and climate variation in the past decades keskinen 2006 pokhrel et al 2018 oeurng et al 2019 do et al 2020 fig 1 shows the lancang mekong river basin lmrb and the constructed dams until 2020 cgiar research program on water land and ecosystems as the most critical remnant wetland ecosystem campbell et al 2009 mrc 2010 uk et al 2018 the tonle sap lake floodplain system fig 1a experiences an annual hydraulic phenomenon known as reverse flow due to existing interaction with mekong river the reverse flow benefits in the given river lake system are twofold during the wet season a relatively large portion of water from the mekong river is discharged into the lake and surrounding alluvial plain through the tonle sap river which expands the area significantly arias et al 2014 providing a rich habitat for spawning 296 fish species baran et al 2013 additionally these flood waters increase soil fertility for rice farming by bringing nutrient rich sediment from the upper mekong during the dry season the tonle sap lake functions as a natural floodwater reservoir so that the stored water during the wet season due to the reverse flow is gradually drained and re combined with the mekong river which per se positively affects the fishery habitat and rice farming in the mekong delta highlighting the transboundary importance of the reverse flow phenomenon the lmrb is endowed with geographic advantages through crossing various ecological zones in the recent decade the riparian countries have been under pressure for harnessing its powerful flow through the construction of hydropower dams and irrigation water abstraction projects e g the rice white gold project in 2010 announced by the cambodian government see more details in asian development bank adb 2019 besides many tributary dams 13 dams have been completed on the mainstream of the lmr thus far of which 11 and 2 of them are attributed to china and laos respectively providing 10 of the total hydropower potential of the lmrb mrc 2019 the common theory is that mainstream dams have the leading role in lmrb s current flow regime change supporting the viewpoint that the cost of the given alterations in the flow regime is borne by downstream countries keskinen et al 2010 yu et al 2019 these together with climate variation have influenced the reverse flow phenomenon and other major features of the flow regime associated with the river lake system including the inundation area lake volume the exchanged water between the tonle sap lake and mekong river and the contribution of the lake to the mekong delta before 2005 the flow regime of the lmrb remained in a relatively natural condition mrc 2005 and a few studies were conducted to quantify various flow regime features and their changes in the tonle sap lake floodplain system kummu and sarkkula 2008 kummu et al 2014 lin and qi 2017 ji et al 2018 however in the investigated period the lmrb was less influenced by anthropogenic activities than after 2010 thus requiring further research on the influence of human caused activities on the tonle sap lake s flow regime some valuable studies were recently conducted to address the annual flood duration flood pulse and inundation area based on three main human caused activities dams sand mining and irrigation chen et al 2021 chua et al 2022 however these lack explicit attribution of the observed changes by tonle sap lake s flow regime to climate variability and upstream human activities previous studies employed some developed rating curves to calculate water exchange between the mekong river and tonle sap lake applicable to when the water level at phnom penh port station was higher than the lake see fig 1b for stations location fig 1c shows that the onset and end of the reverse flow phenomenon do not coincide with the water level at phnom penh port station being higher than the lake thereby causing errors in calculating the annual discharged water into the lake during the reverse flow period from mekong river one potential reason is that the water level in the mekong river fluctuates mainly due to dam operation policy and heavy downpours causing the water level not to remain higher than the lake continuously this consequently negatively influences the calculation of the drained water from the lake to the mekong river and further delta during the non reverse flow period an error in accurately determining the reverse flow interval would cause the role of the lake functioning as a natural spillway for the mekong delta to be poorly assessed therefore the existing complicated phenomenon in the given river lake system requires a hydrodynamic model to continuously monitor the streamlines direction to accurately determine the onset and end of the reverse flow additionally quantitative analysis of the tonle sap lake system poses challenges a factor blamed on modeling its environs since numerous tributaries characterize the area see fig 1b the lake s dynamic behavior and flow regime variability of the lmrb beyond reliable continuous data on main tributaries flowing into the lake accordingly tonle sap lake and its environs have been investigated in many aspects using integrated models e g hydrodynamic and hydrological models tanaka et al 2018 dang et al 2022 and rating curves frappart et al 2006 kummu et al 2014 siev et al 2016 frappart et al 2018 development of the integrated models is to a certain justified as data scarcity remains a further challenge in this area particularly for the lake s tributaries for example rating curves were generated for these tributaries based on the limited number of measured discharge data over the study period see for example kummu et al 2014 in other words the rating curves in such works are limited to the data set of a given study and when they are used with data outside of the original period they either no longer apply or degrade therefore as recommended by kummu et al 2014 the developed rating curves must be methodically updated which has remained a challenge as measured data for surrounding areas for the recent decade does not exist despite limitations in the approaches discussed earlier recent developed floodplain reservoir hydrodynamic models coupled with hydrological ones have overcome these limitations to some extent for example in dang et al 2022 however reservoir operation uncertainties and considering some of the upstream dams hinder explicit attribution of the current flow regime change to climate variability and each upstream country which is vital for transboundary water development understanding flow regime change and the degree to which this change is attributed to the human activities in the upper countries and climate variation is critical to sustainable regional management especially with establishing a couple of cooperation mechanisms among the riparian countries e g mrc lancang mekong cooperation mechanism etc given the importance of the area and knowledge gaps identified above this study expands on previous research in at least three ways i our developed hydrodynamic model can accurately reproduce the annual reverse and non reverse flow periods resulting in accurate calculation of the exchanged water between tonle sap lake and mekong river ii the model is then integrated with hydrological and machine learning models to quantify the effects of human activities in upstream countries and climate variation on the tonle sap lake s flow regime shifting the conversation from how much the flow regime has changed to how much each upstream country has contributed to these changes which is essential for transboundary development iii the developed model and results of the present work provide a reference and valuable insight into understanding the river lake systems driven by the reverse flow phenomenon 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with 4880 km in length and an average annual runoff of 457 billion m3 the lmr drains an area of 812 000 km2 the tibetan plateau northern highlands khorat plateau tonle sap lake basin and the delta are the main physiographic regions of the lmr lyon et al 2017 the northern highlands covers laos thailand and some parts of vietnam where the lmr flows through steep rock cut valleys with a low gradient region providing dendritic flow features for lmr the khorat plateau comprises northeast thailand and the eastern margin of central laos as the central component of the lmr and the most crucial wetland ecosystem in southeast asia with alluvial lowlands and a dome like structure the tonle sap lake basin covers most of cambodia the lake connects with the mekong river at phnom penh through the tonle sap river a tributary of the mekong river with 120 km long lamberts 2008 siev et al 2019 see fig 1b the lake comprises a permanent part consisting of a large northwest basin connected with a narrow strait to a relatively smaller southeast basin shrubs and inundated forests are the dominant features of the surrounding floodplains of the permanent part of the lake forming a vital part of the given ecological system ji et al 2018 the lake is located in a tropic monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation varying from 1300 mm to 1500 mm siev et al 2018 during the flood season the water level in the mekong river is higher than the lake reversing the flow in tonle sap river and discharging into the lake making the lake area to be enlarged from 3500 km2 to around 12500 km2 kummu et al 2014 and according to some studies even to almost 17500 km2 arias et al 2012 tangdamrongsub et al 2016 nagumo et al 2017 the enlarged area and the significant amount of transported nutrients due to the given river lake interaction increase soil fertility for rice farming and fish spawning making the tonle sap lake the most fish abundant body of freshwater globally kummu et al 2004 2 2 methods and data collection an integrated hydrodynamic hydrological machine learning model was developed to quantitatively address the impacts produced by upstream countries human activities and climate variation on the flow regime of the given river lake system fig 2 shows the detailed steps of how the developed models were employed in the present work detailed information about the developed models is presented in the following sub sections 2 2 1 data we obtained daily water level h for chaktomuk hch phnom penh port hpp prek kdam hpk and kompong luong hkl stations and daily discharge data for kratie qkr station from the mrc https portal mrcmekong org time series for the years 2001 to 2020 see fig 1 for stations location these stations were selected due to their undeniable role in investigating the major features of the flow regime of the area for the investigated years the corresponding data were continuous except for the kompong luong station therefore a relationship was developed based on the historical water level data of hch hpk and hkl using gene expression programming see fig s1 in section 1 of the supplementary material sm file as follows 1 h kl h pk 2 h ch r 2 0 97 many tributaries flow into the tonle sap river and tonle sap lake see fig 1b with no or limited continuous measured data over the last two decades these tributaries play an essential role in the flow regime analysis of the tonle sap lake system rating curves for these tributaries were generated however they have limitations as discussed earlier to produce highly accurate continuous and reliable discharge data on a daily scale we developed a hydrological model namely threw model i e tsinghua representative elementary watershed for detailed information refer to the following sub sections and tian et al 2008 and tian et al 2012 li et al 2012 sun et al 2014 and xu et al 2019 2 2 2 hydrological model the adopted hydrological model i e threw has been successfully applied to the mekong river and other watersheds in existing studies tian et al 2006 2008 and tian et al 2012 li et al 2012 sun et al 2014 xu et al 2019 morovati et al 2021 the model was further improved for two purposes 1 to obtain continuous daily time series discharge data for tributaries with no measured or limited data and 2 to consider the impacts of each country s human activities and climate variation on mainstream and tributaries discharge while detailed information about the model can be attained from the above mentioned references a brief outline of the model is given below the threw model delineates the watershed using the representative elementary watershed rew method the rew is a functional element that contains all of the necessary information for the watershed the scale and division of the rew have no effect on hydrological characteristics allowing the user to define these features based on the level of detail precision required additionally this characteristic enables a rew to be subdivided into additional rews to further increase precision in complex areas of a watershed eight zones were contained within each rew bare soil zone vegetated zone snow covered zone glacier covered zone sub stream network zone main channel reach zone saturated zone and unsaturated zone tian et al 2008 each zone was connected to the rew using mass momentum energy and entropy balance equations meteorological and rainfall data provided by mrc and china meteorological administration cma were used as drivers for the threw model for the mekong and lancang sub regions daily rainfall data were obtained from 166 and 12 gauge stations respectively for both sub regions meteorological data containing near surface air pressure air temperature air specific humidity wind speed and direction sunshine duration and solar radiation was also obtained from 12 gauge stations these data were then used to compute potential evapotranspiration as an essential input for threw model based upon the penman monteith equation for eight hydrological stations on the lmr i e jinghong chiang saen luang prabang nong khai nakhon phanom mukdahan pakse and stung treng see fig 1a measured daily discharge data were obtained for the years between 1991 and 2016 from 2005 onward the number of rainfall gauges has decreased significantly thus gpm imerg final run dataset huffman et al 2019 being already proven to yield highly accurate data lauri et al 2014 he et al 2015 li et al 2019 was used threw model was calibrated 2001 2009 and validated 1991 2000 based on eight hydrological stations mentioned above 2 2 3 machine learning model to estimate daily water levels at chaktomuk used as the outlet boundary for the hydrodynamic model fig 2c we applied a machine learning model i e long short term memory lstm morovati et al 2021 contrary to the process based models i e hydrological and hydrodynamic models which require numerous high resolution inputs and great computational capacity hindering the application of these models machine learning data based models not only require much less simulation time but can effectively capture the inherent nonlinear relationship between the input and output therefore a deep learning method lstm was used to predict the daily river water levels at the chaktomuk station corresponding to the discharge data of kratie station as the input data for the lstm model the deep learning methods have multiple neuron layers in their architecture increasing their ability to simulate more complex functions 2 2 4 hydrodynamic model a hydrodynamic model is required to simulate the dynamics of the given river lake system therefore we developed a hydrodynamic model to simulate the water exchange between the mekong river and tonle sap lake during reverse and non reverse flow periods water levels and determination of the reverse flow interval these can be seen as the most critical factors in addressing the major features of the flow regime variability in this complex river lake system we used the open source delft3d flow software deltares 2014 to simulate the 3d flow field in tonle sap lake and its environs delft3d flow model is a modeling suite with the capability of investigating hydrodynamics sediment transport and morphology in complex areas such as estuaries rivers and lakes deltares 2014 the model has been successfully used in similar systems soulignac et al 2017 baracchini et al 2020 gaillard et al 2022 and thus justifies its use in our study the horizontal length scale is much larger than the depth for rivers lakes and estuaries meaning that the shallow water assumption is valid therefore following shallow water flow equations and boussinesq assumptions the navier stokes equations were solved in delft3d flow for an incompressible fluid in rivers and estuaries the boundaries are generally curved and an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate was used to reduce the discretization errors as these boundaries may not be smoothly represented by the rectangular grid therefore the spherical coordinate was used in the horizontal direction supported by an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity were set to 1 and 10 5 respectively advection in momentum equations was completed using the cyclic method the impact of wind wasn t considered in the simulations implemented thus the turbulent kinetic energy k close to the free surface was set to zero the flow in the simulations was regarded as a non stratified flow water level and discharge were calculated or defined in the grid cell centers the developed model does not consider the groundwater infiltration process owing to data scarcity and lack of information previous studies have conducted some groundwater infiltration analyses however they have concentrated on the areas outside of the tonle sap lake landon 2011 burnett et al 2013 analyzed the available data for the year 2009 and found that infiltration for the northern section of the lake during the recession phase was 4 8 km3 even if we suppose that this value will remain constant for upcoming years the conducted analysis would not significantly change this study s water level data is expressed as the elevation above mean sea level amsl in hatien vietnam the kratie station located on the mekong river and virtually 164 km upstream of the confluence was considered as the inlet boundary condition fig 2c daily time series discharge data with a vertical uniform profile for hydrodynamics was imposed on the inlet boundary the chaktomuk station was considered with water level time series data for the outlet boundary fig 2c the existing main tributaries discharging into tonle sap lake and tonle sap river were considered as the additional boundary condition and the corresponding continuous daily time series discharge data were obtained by threw model discussed earlier a spherical system was used to define the meshing of the computational domain and the corresponding requirements concerning smoothness and orthogonality were fulfilled dd boundary technique was used for meshing since tonle sap lake is quite wide compared to the tonle sap river and mekong river as seen in fig 2c detailed information on the developed hydrodynamic model is found in sections 2 and 3 of the sm file the simulations were implemented at a daily time step over 20 years starting from jan 2001 and ending in dec 2020 in this work a computer workstation with 24 cores intel r xeon r cpu e7 4850 v4 2 10 ghz and 32 gb of ram was employed and the computational time for each run from 2001 to 2020 was about 35 days 2 3 scenario setting to separate the impacts of human activities from different parts of the basin and climate variations we used observed and simulated data over the past two decades i e 2001 to 2020 this time period can be divided into distinct phases until 2005 the flow regime of the mekong river remained relatively unimpacted by human activities according to the mrc 2005 and from 2005 to 2009 only jinghong dam was constructed with a total capacity of around 0 25 km3 which is insignificant compared to average annual runoff 421 km3 at kratie station thus the flow regime of the mekong river experienced insignificant changes due to human impact before 2009 and we considered this period i e 2001 to 2009 as the baseline period from 2010 to 2020 the number of irrigation projects and commissioned dams with large storage capacity increased significantly e g xiaowan and nuozhadu dams with a total capacity of 39 km3 representing the mega dam era mekong region futures institute mrfi 2020 soukhaphon et al 2021 the impacts of the increased human activities and climate variation from 2010 to 2020 on the major features of the flow regime of the tonle sap lake system were addressed and compared with the baseline period human activities refer to all types of water withdrawals and consumptions as well as dam operations since there was not enough historical reliable and comprehensive data for each sector to be separately considered for example attributes of dams regarding operation rules are publicly available only for a handful of dams while an extensive number of such structures have been built on the mainstream and tributaries influencing the streamflow of the mekong river we assessed and quantified the flow regime changes of the tonle sap river lake floodplain system using five scenarios as described below see also fig s10 the assessed flow regime changes include water level and discharge in the mekong river exchanged water between mekong river and tonle sap lake inundation area a and lake volume v baseline scenario sbaseline the observed discharge data at stung treng from 2001 to 2009 qst1 was used to calculate the baseline discharge as follows from stung treng to kratie station there are some tributaries see fig 1a and b and the corresponding discharge data of these tributaries qtribs obtained by threw model were added to the observed discharge data at stung treng to obtained the discharge data at kratie station note that stung treng is the closest cambodian station to the border with laos where its corresponding discharge represents the upstream impacts also as we mentioned above the kratie station was used as the inlet boundary for the developed hydrodynamic model qbaseline denoting the discharge for the baseline period is obtained as follows 2 q baseline q s t 1 q tribs climate scenario sclimate to assess the impact of changes in climate on the flow regime we compared the discharge obtained by equation 2 i e qbaseline with the simulated discharge from 2010 to 2020 this is defined as iclimate 3 i climate q simst q tribs q baseline where qsimst denotes the simulated discharge data by threw model at stung treng station china scenario schina to quantify the influence of the increased human activities from 2010 to 2020 hereafter ihad2 in china the observed discharge in the jinghong station qmj the last hydrological station in china see also fig s10 was used as an upstream boundary in threw model i e instead of simulating the chinese part of the basin we used the observed flow influenced by human activities and climate change then the threw model was run for the areas between jinghong and stung treng stations with meteorological data from 2010 to 2020 producing the influenced discharge time series data by climate change and ihad2 in china at stung treng also some tributaries exist from stung treng to kratie stations as discussed above we added the corresponding discharge data of these tributaries with the obtained discharge of stung treng station to yield the kratie discharge used as the inlet boundary for the developed hydrodynamic model i e qchina representing the discharge data at kratie station influenced by ihad2 in china and climate change therefore the impact of the ihad2 related to china ichina equation 4 was calculated as follows 4 i china q china q baseline i climate downstream scenario sltv in this case the impact of ihad2 in the downstream countries of china i e laos thailand vietnam was assessed and quantified to be noted the human activities of laos thailand and vietnam were not separated because the mekong river and many tributaries e g the 3s tributary that includes sekong sesan and srepok rivers span across the country s borders and thus we considered these countries as one area to estimate the impact from these countries we first estimated the impact of the ihad2 related to all countries iall equation 5 and that was calculated as follows 5 i all q s t 2 q tribs q baseline i climate where qst2 denotes the observed discharge data at stung treng station for the years 2010

tribs combined scenario scombined the combined impact of climate variation and direct anthropogenic actions over 2010 2020 was also quantified this was done using observed discharge data at stung treng station for the years 2001 2009 qst1 and years 2010 2020 qst2 as follows 8 i combined q s t 2 q s t 1 to further clarify the defined scenarios the schematic drawing of the described scenarios is given in fig s10 in section 6 of the sm file distinguishing the chines part of the basin and downstream countries as well as the type of data used in each scenario as discussed above the present study s main purpose was to address the contribution of the upstream countries anthropogenic activities to the flow regime change of the tonle sap lake floodplain system thus we assumed that the recent human activities downstream of the stung treng station less pronounced than upstream basins have insignificantly influenced the mekong river s streamflow and the lake s surrounding area in other words we assumed that the lake s surrounding area and the area between stung treng and chaktomuk stations remained intact from 2010 to 2020 to ensure the combination of the observed and modeled data in these scenarios does not influence the flow regime analysis a comparison was conducted over the years 1991 to 2000 for major features of the flow regime between threw model and measured data at kratie station for example less than a 2 discrepancy and two days difference were observed in the exchanged water between the mekong river and the lake and the reverse flow interval this 2 discrepancy originating from simulation errors in threw hydrodynamic and machine learning models as well as the combination of the modeled data with observed ones appears to be reasonable and acceptable because of 1 uncertainties in bathymetry and sedimentation process making it difficult to accurately represent the river channel bifurcation 2 lack of continuous observed discharge data for 11 tributaries flowing into the tonle sap river and tonle sap lake which per se causes errors in the case of employing rating curves or threw model 3 the strategy for scenarios is analogous making the obtained trend see results section remain unchanged although the percentage changes of the contribution of the upstream countries may change 3 results and interpretation 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 hydrological model the threw hydrological model was calibrated with 2001 to 2009 data and validated with 1991 2000 data using observed daily discharge data from eight hydrological stations along the lmrb the model shows almost the same accuracy in all stations an average nse 0 92 and the produced discharge profiles follow relatively close to the measured ones see fig 3 the greatest nse is attributed to the stung treng station 0 95 which is used as a key hydrological station in scenario setting section and flow regime analyses during the reverse flow period in this river lake system 3 1 2 machine learning model to validate the machine learning model the simulated daily water levels were compared with the observed ones at two floodplain stations chaktomuk and prek kdam see fig 1b for stations location the model captured well the water level fluctuations and the general shapes of the obtained water level profiles followed relatively close to the observed ones see section 5 of the sm file the corresponding accuracy of water level estimation at both stations showed nse 0 97 highlighting the reliability of the developed model further information is found in morovati et al 2021 3 1 3 hydrodynamic model observing streamlines at various time scales is one of the advantages of the developed hydrodynamic model through which the onset and end of the reverse flow period are determined see fig s7 in section 3 of the sm file an accurate prediction of the reverse flow period in the tonle sap lake is of utmost importance as the accumulated water due to this phenomenon i e reverse flow enlarges the lake s area providing a rich habitat for spawning fish and rice farming a comparison of the predicted reverse flow period between 2010 and 2020 is conducted in table 1 using the k ε turbulence model and various discretization schemes cyclic model yields more accurate results than its counterpart for the cyclic method though the onset and end of the period are different from the observed dates with a maximum difference of 2 days the duration of the given periods remains almost identical the accuracy of the reverse flow prediction reduces as the flooding and waqua schemes are employed further information regarding mesh sensitivity analysis discretization schemes and turbulence models is found in section 3 of the sm file to further verify the accuracy of the developed model a comparison of the yielded daily discharge data by the developed hydrodynamic model with measured daily discharge data from 2000 to 2020 at prek kdam station is presented in fig 4 in this figure negative and positive discharge values correspond to the discharged water into the lake from the mekong river during the reverse flow period hereafter qintsr and the drained water from the lake to the mekong river during the non reverse flow period hereafter qouttsr respectively the developed model agrees very well with the measured discharge data in reverse and non reverse flow periods on average nse 0 97 note that the obtained measured data were discontinuous over the study period all of which are given in fig 4 3 2 changes in the mekong river the flow regime s major features influencing the tonle sap lake ecosystem are driven by the mekong river s streamflow västilä et al 2010 arias et al 2013 kallio and kummu 2021 the influenced discharge at the kratie station yielded by threw model and the water level at the chaktomuk station obtained by the developed machine learning model is shown in fig 5 as expected both discharge and the corresponding water level follow virtually the same trend the obtained trends for discharge in sbasline and sclimate are greatly consistent with climate variation trend e g precipitation see fig 5a from june to september the most significant alterations to discharge and the water level are observed referring to the dam s role in storing water during the wet season to provide more water for surrounding areas and downstream as one of the primary goals of these structures compared to sclimate schina decreased discharge and water levels from august to october end while sltv influenced a longer interval i e from june to november as seen climate variation and upstream human activities changed the occurrence of maximum discharge at the kratie station from august to september compared to the baseline period with the monthly average peak discharge water level of 35 200 m3 s 9 30 m sclimate decreased the monthly average peak discharge water level to around 34 800 m3 s 9 25 m schina reduced the peak discharge water level to 33 400 m3 s 9 12 m or 4 1 4 and a larger reduction of peak discharge by sltv i e 32 700 m3 s 8 99 m or 6 2 8 the combined scenario of all impacts scombined decreased the peak discharge water level to 30 787 m3 s 8 08 m or 12 6 13 1 compared to the baseline period sclimate had an insignificant impact on the minimum discharge water level and both remained virtually constant at 2300 m3 s 1 81 m in contrast sltv increased the minimum discharge water level to 2805 m3 s 1 94 m or 22 7 2 with a more pronounced increase attributed to schina i e 3138 m3 s and 2 01 m or 36 11 scombined increased the minimum discharge water level to 3250 m3 s 2 02 m i e a 41 increase 11 6 increase 3 3 changes in tonle sap lake s major features the ecosystem of the tonle sap lake and mekong delta is driven by the reverse flow phenomenon as according to some studies fujii et al 2003 kummu et al 2014 a significant portion of the discharged water into the mekong delta originates from the lake since the major features of the flow regime in this area are addressed by the length of the reverse flow it is essential to accurately determine how climate variation and increased human activities in the recent decade have influenced this phenomenon fig 6 shows the length of the reverse flow period influenced by defined scenarios the end of the reverse flow period was insignificantly influenced by climate variation and ihad2 in the upstream countries for example compared to the sbaseline sclimate has insignificantly changed the onset of the reverse flow one day while the end of the period remained unchanged this is primarily consistent with schina where it commenced 4 days earlier compared to the sbaseline regarding sltv the reverse flow period was further shortened with a more pronounced decline attributed to the onset of the reverse flow period on average 9 days highlighting the greater negative impact of the downstream countries of china which could be due to the high number of dams and other water abstraction projects in the recent decade from jinghong station to stung treng station as well as a relatively small portion of the jinghong stations runoff 13 8 to the total runoff passing kratie station as expected scombined covers the shortest interval of the rainy season for the reverse flow phenomenon compared to other scenarios delaying the onset of the given phenomenon by about 12 days additionally the average monthly water level for phnom penh port hpp and kompong luong hkl stations is illustrated in fig 6 for both decades results reveal that the onset of the reverse flow does not coincide with when hpp hkl contradicting the presumption reported by kummu et al 2014 in the first decade i e 2001 to 2009 with the onset of the rainy season may hpp hkl while on average the reverse flow starts at the may end see sbaseline this trend did not remain constant for the second decade and hpp hkl occurred in early april while the average start date of the reverse flow was early june see scombined table 2 gives information on the main features of the flow regime of the tonle sap lake floodplain system during the reverse flow period the largest contributions to the total inflow into the lake tot are attributed to qintsr and the lake s tributaries qtribslake 44 contrary to the combined effects of climate variation and human activities scombined in which the tributaries played the leading role in total inflow into the lake 48 32 in other scenarios the greater contribution was attributed to the qintsr representing the mekong river s role compared to the sbaseline climate variation sclimate decreased the total inflow into the lake to 80 0 km3 yr around a 9 drop this was further exacerbated by schina 76 4 km3 yr and sltv 75 0 km3 yr the combined effects of climate variation and human activities scombined caused the largest reduction 70 0 km3 yr accounting for a 20 4 drop further the slightest variation is attributed to precipitation and evaporation and for all scenarios the corresponding values remained virtually constant note that the results corresponding to qintsr in table 2 were produced by the developed hydrodynamic model regarding how the corresponding results of precipitation and evaporation were calculated refer to section 7 of the sm file also for annual values of qintsr associated with the defined scenarios refer to section 7 of the sm file the inundated area a during the reverse flow period is vital for the ecosystem and productivity of the tonle sap lake for example if the discharged water floods a smaller area during the reverse flow period a smaller amount of potential terrestrial organic matter is exchanged between the aquatic and terrestrial transition zones junk 1997 lamberts and koponen 2008 kummu et al 2014 the inundation area and lake volume are calculated based on the water level at kompong luong station hkl we followed the same approach reported by kummu et al 2014 to calculate a and v we used the digital bathymetric model dbm of the lake together with hkl to develop the following relationships on a daily scale 9 a k m 2 5 5701 h kl 3 137 4 h kl 2 470 29 h kl 1680 2 r 2 0 99 10 v k m 3 0 7307 h kl 2 0 354 h kl 0 9127 r 2 0 99 table 3 gives information about the annual average maximum and minimum values of a v and hkl based on defined scenarios as expected the tonle sap lake experienced the highest water level inundation area and volume in the sbaseline compared to the sbaseline sclimate decreased the maximum values of hkl a and v to 7 72 m 10950 km2 and 42 km3 accounting for an 11 5 8 1 and 14 4 drop respectively upstream human activities further exacerbated this trend with a more negative impact attributed to sltv similar to the results given in table 2 the combined effects of climate variation and upstream human activities scombined caused the largest decrease in maximum water level at kampong luong maximum lake area a and maximum lake volume v 15 4 for hkl 16 3 for a and 25 8 for v a similar trend is observed for the minimum values of the a v and hkl though in different percentage changes 3 4 changes in reverse flow to the mekong delta the share of the tonle sap lake in the total inflow passing confluence and further mekong delta during the non reverse flow period i e flow from the lake to the mekong is shown in fig 7 in the baseline scenario sbaseline tonle sap lake provided the considerable portion of the total water flow for the delta with the highest and lowest contributions attributed to december 46 2 and october 18 4 respectively with an annual average of 31 this highlights the transboundary importance of the tonle sap lake and its floodplains this trend is more consistent with sclimate however the annual contribution of the lake to delta decreased to 27 around a 4 percentage point pp drop while the share of the lake to the total water into the delta remained almost constant in november and october upstream ihad2 resulted in the least amount of water being supplied in april the annual average contribution of the lake to the delta influenced by the schina and sltv decreased to 25 4 and 25 1 respectively the cumulative impacts of climate variation and upstream human activities defined by scombined show that the annual contribution of the lake decreased to around 23 9 i e a 7 1 pp drop compared to sbaseline a factor blamed on storing less water during the reverse flow period in the lake s surrounding area and passing relatively less water through kratie station towards the downstream parts during the dry season see fig 5b in other words the lower the stored water during the wet season in the lake the less water is released to the delta during the dry season 4 discussion various recent studies have explored the changing hydrology of the given river lake floodplain system mainly by employing measured and satellite based data tangdamrongsub et al 2016 frappart et al 2018 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 however an explicit quantification of the impacts produced by climate variation and upstream human activities on the major features of the flow regime shifts in the lake is lacking we developed an integrated model consisting of hydrological machine learning and hydrodynamic models to quantitatively address how the growing anthropogenic activities in the recent decade i e 2010 to 2020 in the lmrb compared to the previous decade altered the flow regime of the tonle sap lake floodplain system while climate variability was found to explain part of the flow regime change upstream human activities were found to have even larger impacts while the combined impacts of the increased human activities and climate variation in the recent decade decreased the peak discharge of kratie station by around 12 6 compared to the previous decade i e from 2001 to 2009 minimum flow increased by approximately 41 3 this trend was in line with findings reported by dang et al 2022 although the magnitude of change differs somewhat between the studies they found that the peak low flow decreased increased by around 7 3 31 6 this difference could be due to the consideration of 86 dams in their research and uncertainties assumptions in the reservoir operation scheme while in the present study findings were based on all upstream human activities regarding the water level and inundation area in the tonle sap lake we found a direct impact of the influenced mekong river s streamflow by climate variation and upstream human activities on the lake s water level and inundation area since 44 of the total inflow into the lake during the reverse flow period originated from mekong river corroborating findings reported by other researchers arias 2012 kummu and sarkkula 2008 dang et al 2022 the declining trend of the lake s water level reported by previous studies lu and chua 2021 chua et al 2022 was further supported in the present work however the results reported in this work provide crucial additional insights by attributing the changes to the upstream countries human activities and climate variation our results indicated that in the recent decade the inundation area shrunk by around 16 4 compared to the previous decade from 11 917 km2 to 9 967 km2 of which 2 2 pp or 13 of total change and 8 1 pp or 50 of total change were attributed to climate change and increased human activities in china respectively our findings thus contradict the findings of wang et al 2020 who estimated that 76 1 and 6 9 of the current shrinkage of the inundation area are due to changes in precipitation i e climate and the impact of chinese dams respectively our results also brought new insight into the occurrence time of the reverse flow phenomenon the developed hydrodynamic model allowed us to simulate the daily flow directions and consequently determine the accurate reverse flow interval the model resulted in more accurate results than existing studies kummu et al 2014 chua et al 2022 which used rating curves to estimate the reverse flow and assumed that the reverse flow occurred when the water level in the mekong river was higher than the lake our results highlighted that the occurrence time of the reverse flow did not always coincide with this water level difference see fig 6 nonetheless the found declining trend of the discharged water into the lake was in line with previous findings chen et al 2021 dang et al 2022 chua et al 2022 however the percentage change was different for example chua et al 2022 reported that the total annual inflow into the lake from the mekong river decreased from 37 75 km3 yr 1995 2009 to 31 74 km3 yr 2010 2018 15 9 drop while the present study found that the total annual inflow dropped from 42 4 km3 yr 2001 2009 to 33 2 km3 yr 2010 2020 21 7 drop further contrary to the existing study conducted by kummu et al 2014 our results revealed no significant difference between the role of the lake s tributaries and the mekong river in the total inflow into the lake during the reverse flow period regarding the mekong delta the released water from tonle sap lake during the dry season oct apr from 2001 to 2009 accounted for 18 46 of the total flow entering into the confluence i e chaktomuk station and further into the delta this is well in line with the findings reported by fujii et al 2003 inomata and fukami 2008 and kummu et al 2014 in which the years before 2004 were addressed 20 50 highlighting that the lake maintained its positive role in supplying water to the delta until 2009 however in the recent decade i e from 2010 to 2020 and with the combined impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change the lake discharge accounted for 11 33 4 1 limitations and way forward although we were able to advance the current understanding there are some priority issues that we were unable to consider in the applied models it would be important to address them to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate variation and upstream development i contrary to the previous research mrc 2011 arias et al 2012 horton et al 2022 this study considered a relatively short baseline period 2001 to 2009 however it was believed that the average values obtained for the baseline period did not significantly change for an extended baseline period since the flow regime along the lmrb remained almost unchanged before 2005 according to many references mrc 2005 kummu et al 2014 ii the combination of the observed and simulated data threw model was used to define scenarios this per se could cause errors in the mekong river s discharge and water levels and consequently the main features of the tonle sap lake although the discrepancies were relatively insignificant as discussed in the 2 3 section providing more accurate data would lead to more precise analysis iii as discussed above the groundwater infiltration process was not considered in the developed hydrodynamic model although its impact seems insignificant compared to the discharged water into the lake from the mekong river qintsr and tributaries it hinders the conducted analysis to precisely address the major features contribution to the total inflow outflow into the lake mekong river such uncertainty as a remained challenge is mainly imposed on the impact of human activities in downstream countries because it is obtained as the residual difference between observed difference vs climate variation and chinese dams it is therefore recommended to commence groundwater measurements within the tonle sap lake floodplain as well as more detailed modeling of the impacts of different parts of the basin iv although the developed hydrological model produced highly accurate results on the mekong river s mainstream and some tributaries around the lake see for example morovati et al 2021 providing more observed data for calibration will reduce the uncertainty of the model v sediment is essential in the lmrb as large amounts are annually transported from the upper parts into the lower mekong subsequently the configuration of the river bed would experience some change the developed model did not consider sediment transportation because of the absence of reliable data on this process additionally riparian countries continuously extract transported sediments from the rivers for construction purposes for which relevant data are generally unavailable and further hinder the understanding of the existing sediment process updating the cross section shape of critical stations such as chaktomuk prek kdam and phnom penh port stations brings valuable insights regarding produced recorded bathymetry data 5 conclusions by developing and integrating a novel modeling setup of hydrodynamic hydrological and machine learning models we explicitly addressed the contribution of the climate variation and upstream countries human activities to the main features of the flow regime shifts in the tonle sap lake mekong river floodplain system through conducting a comprehensive validation we showed that the developed modeling framework performed well and could therefore potentially be employed for lmr s upcoming studies and other floodplains experiencing reverse flow phenomenon findings contributed to the existing literature by providing new insights into the role of the upstream countries and climate variation in the current flow regime change in tonle sap lake while climate variability had changed the flow regime we found that recent increased human activities in the upstream countries played an even larger role in the flow regime change in this unique river lake system as a key parameter in addressing the other major features results associated with reverse flow interval showed that the reverse flow flow from the mekong to the lake lasted on average for 116 days during the baseline period 2001 2009 and it decreased to 107 days due to climate variation and all upstream human activities within the 2010 2020 period we also found that the yearly average discharge into the lake from the mekong river was 42 4 km3 yr during the baseline period this decreased to 33 2 km3 yr in 2010 2020 by the combined impact of climate variation and increased human activities in all upstream countries equivalent to a 21 7 drop of which 6 7 pp was attributed to china caused human activities and around 8 2 pp for downstream countries i e laos thailand vietnam finally we found that on average around 31 of the total inflow into the mekong delta originated from the lake during the baseline period whereas the human activities and climate variation decreased this to 23 9 i e around a 7 1 pp drop our findings assist in developing strategic plan formulation and decision making processes on regional and transboundary scales the implications of the lmrb s development impacts on the flow regime shifts during flooding and dry seasons should be carefully examined decreased mekong river flow during the flooding season provides flood protection benefits especially for the basins close to the mainstream and upstream of the lake whereas increased flow in the dry season provides more water for irrigation and other sectors despite these benefits the negative impacts associated with the less water discharged into the lake from the mekong river during the wet season due to the upstream developments should also be carefully considered as vulnerable communities live around the tonle sap lake floodplain these recent changes have threatened the tonle sap lake ecosystem which is driven by the flood pulse and the large difference between the dry season and wet season water levels this might even increase as the lmrb will experience more anthropogenic activities in the coming years and decades therefore sustainably addressing future climate change and upcoming infrastructure developments requires a balance between these trade offs as tonle sap lake is inseparable from the mekong
