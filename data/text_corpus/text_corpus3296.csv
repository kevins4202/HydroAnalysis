16480,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as a group of toxic and carcinogenic compounds are large scale globally emitted anthropogenic pollutants mainly emitted into the atmosphere however atmospheric transport cannot fully explain the spatial variability of pahs in the marine atmosphere and seawater it is hypothesized that pahs accumulated in seawater and ocean circulation can also influence pahs observed in air above the ocean in order to investigate pahs in seawater as a potential secondary source to air we collected paired air and seawater samples during a research cruise from china to the antarctic in 2018 2019 covering the pacific ocean the indian ocean and the southern ocean summed concentrations of 28 analyzed pahs in seawater were highest in the pacific ocean 4000 1400 pg l followed by the indian ocean 2700 1000 pg l and the southern ocean 2300 520 pg l three ringed pahs dominated the composition profile we found that pah levels in the pacific and indian oceans were strong inversely correlated with salinity and distance to the coastline this suggests that riverine inputs and continental discharges are important sources of pahs to the marine environment derived air seawater fugacity ratios suggest that net fluxes of pahs were from seawater to the air in the pacific and indian oceans at 9 0 8100 median 1600 ng m2 d and 290 2000 median 1300 ng m2 d respectively in the southern ocean the net flow of pahs was from air to seawater with a flux of 1000 450 median 82 ng m2 d source apportionment from two different models suggested that the largest contribution to total pahs was from petrogenic sources 44 57 followed by coal wood combustion 30 31 fossil fuel combustion 15 and engine combustion emissions 2 8 9 5 higher contributions from petrogenic sources were found at sites close to coastal regions both coal wood combustion and petrogenic sources are responsible for the pah concentrations detected in the indian and southern oceans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pahs spatial distribution ocean currents air seawater exchange positive matrix factorization model 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are released into the environment either from direct emissions from petrogenic sources or the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels biomass and other petrogenic sources pahs are ubiquitously found in the global environment casal et al 2018 ya et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a long term human exposure to pahs is associated with various adverse health effects such as carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects biache et al 2014 yu et al 2019 pahs can be found even in remote regions like the southern ocean cabrerizo et al 2014 cao et al 2018 as their susceptibility for long range atmospheric transport drotikova et al 2020 singh et al 2017 is coupled with long range transport by ocean currents lohmann et al 2013 and associated air seawater exchange in the open ocean casal et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 however the fate and transport of pahs in the highly dynamic marine environment are still not completely understood cai et al 2016 gonzález gaya et al 2016 lohmann et al 2013 several previous studies have reported pahs in seawater chen et al 2021 lohmann et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 higher concentrations were found in the atlantic ocean compared to the pacific and indian ocean gonzález gaya et al 2016 recently zheng et al 2021 reported the distribution of pahs from the north pacific to the arctic ocean and found an inverse correlation with latitude these studies have greatly improved the understanding of the occurrence of pahs in the marine environment particularly in the atlantic arctic ocean basin however there is a lack of assessment of the effects of ocean currents and continental discharges on pahs concentrations as the transport of ocean currents is considered an important vector for the global transport of the semi volatile organic compounds svocs gonzález gaya et al 2014 such as the antarctic circumpolar current acc which forms as a physical barrier that effectively inhibits north south transport of surface seawaters from surrounding oceans bengtson nash et al 2010 cai et al 2016 therefore more information on their distribution profiles in seawater is needed allowing a better understanding the compound specific mobility and the associated factors of pahs as an important indicator of svocs in the marine environment the marine environment has been identified as an important sink for various svocs however the environmental conditions are changing and whether this is still an important function in the svoc global cycling or they already act as secondary sources is an important research question nowadays overall many studies have been conducted on the air seawater exchange and biogeochemical processes of pahs in the marine environment these reports focused on the arctic tropical subtropical regions chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 the tropical atlantic ocean lohmann et al 2013 nizzetto et al 2008 and the subtropical pacific and indian ocean gonzález gaya et al 2016 studies on the chinese marginal seas have also been conducted ya et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a these studies have greatly improved our understanding on the fate of pahs in the marine environment particularly in the atlantic arctic ocean basin however there are few existing assessments of pahs in antarctica and the adjacent southern ocean casal et al 2018 as a consequence the biogeochemical and physical processes driving the pahs occurrence in the southern ocean remain still largely unknown determining the possible sources and contributions of pahs in seawater is essential for understanding pahs contamination in the marine environment empirical studies in combination with statistical treatment such as factor analysis methods like principal component analysis multiple linear regression models pca mlr and positive matrix factorization pmf have been widely used to identify the source of svocs in aquatic environments bi et al 2018 li et al 2020 salim et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a used pca mlr and pmf to identify the sources of pahs in the south china sea these two models have been previously used for pollutant sources apportionment in urban regions jang et al 2013 lakes zhang et al 2012 and river basins cao et al 2011 chang et al 2009 stout and graan 2010 however the compound specific source apportionment for pahs in the marine environment is still mainly using diagnostic ratios cai et al 2016 cao et al 2018 lohmann et al 2013 which are only of indicative nature reports on the quantitative source contribution of pahs in the oceans are hence still scarce in the scientific literature for the here reported study on the role of oceans on pahs mobility and fate seawater samples were collected during an antarctic expedition of the chinese research vessel xuelong from the northwestern pacific to the antarctic in 2018 2019 the analytical data were examined for better understanding 1 the concentrations and spatial trends of pahs in the southern ocean 2 the effects of coastal discharges rivers and ocean currents on the presence of pahs in the marine environment 3 whether the pacific indian and southern oceans serving as sinks or secondary sources of pahs through the air seawater exchange 4 the spatial distribution of pahs source for each source category obtained from pca mlr and pmf models 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling information onboard the chinese antarctic research vessel xuelong of the polar research institute of china from november 2018 to march 2019 air and seawater samples were collected from the northwestern pacific to the southern ocean 179 177 e 77 19 n for the analysis of 28 pahs table s1 provides their full names and abbreviations all sampling locations plotted by ocean data view schlitzer 2021 are shown in figs 1 and the coordinates are provided in tables s2 of the supporting information si specific information about collecting air and seawater samples is described in si in situ meteorological and hydrological data including seawater temperature and salinity were also obtained table s2 2 2 sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis all samples were pretreated using high volume spe isiu technology at the state oceanic administration key laboratory for polar sciences shanghai china gao et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 prior to extraction a mixture of 1 0 ppm deuterated pah standards of 100 μl was added as a recovery standard table s1 each xad was placed in a stainless steel tube 45 ml mixed solvent acetone dichloromethane n hexane 1 1 1 v v v was added in the column and was ultrasonically vibrated for 5 min 90 break rate 2 s 5 s to ensure desorption of pahs triplicate extractions were performed and the eluent was collected and transferred to a 200 ml evaporation tube turbovap ii biotage sweden the eluent was evaporated to 100 μl under a gentle gas stream of pure nitrogen 99 99 the target pahs were analyzed on an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph coupled to a 7010b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and equipped with a 7693a autosampler injector gc ms ms agilent palo alto ca usa the ms ms was operated in dynamic multi reaction monitoring mode details are provided in si the ionization modes transitions quantification and qualifying ions used to monitor pahs are shown in table s1 2 3 quality assurance and quality control qa qc all materials used for the sampling were rigorously cleaned and properly stored before the sampling cruise all the equipment was precleaned by rinsing with methanol distilled water and then seawater from the specific locations before sampling detailed descriptions of the qa qc are shown in si method detection limits were ranged from 0 048 to 34 pg l for seawater samples table s3 recoveries were monitored in xad columns using 15 perdeuterated pahs and they ranged from 62 to 110 table s4 seawater samples 22 39 and 41 were lost in storage and therefore were not included for further discussion 3 results and discussion 3 1 pahs concentrations and profiles in seawater concentrations of pahs in seawater are shown in fig 1 twenty three of the targeted 28 pahs acy ace flu dbt phe ant cab fluo pyr ret bbf bcp baa chry bbjkf bep bap pery icdp daha and bghip were detected in over 95 of the surface seawater samples the remaining 5 pahs were detected in less than 15 of the samples and thus were not included for further discussion pahs were divided into four groups 3 ring pahs acy ace flu phe ant dbt cab and ret 4 ring pahs fluo pyr baa chry bbf and bcp 5 ring pahs bbjkf bap daha pery and bep and 6 ring pahs icdp and bghip on average 3 ring pahs 4 ring pahs 5 ring pahs and 6 ring pahs contributed 55 88 11 36 0 50 5 0 and 0 20 9 0 respectively to the total seawater pah concentrations 23pahs the sum of 23 pah concentrations figure s1 overall 23pahs concentrations ranged from 1300 to 9500 pg l with a median of 2700 pg l phe 570 2000 pg l flu 65 2000 pg l fluo 120 440 pg l pyr 120 390 pg l ace 46 3000 pg l and ant 73 420 pg l figure s2 were the most abundant pahs and contributed 21 49 5 0 21 4 0 15 4 0 15 3 0 31 and 3 0 10 to 23pahs concentrations respectively in contrast the proportions of high molecular weight homologues such as 5 6 rings pahs merely account for 0 40 6 0 of the 23pahs consistent with other reports of pahs in the seawater gonzález gaya et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 overall the seawater concentration of measured compounds here were within the range as previously reported data zheng et al 2021 measured 9 pahs from the north pacific to the arctic ocean in 2014 using passive sampling with ldpes and reported a median of 1 8 ng l for phe 1 5 ng l for flu 0 90 ng l for fluo and 0 77 ng l for pyr ji et al 2019 estimated concentrations of 0 76 4 3 ng l for flu 0 44 2 1 ng l for fluo and 0 0060 0 030 ng l for pyr in the russian arctic ocean in 2016 in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans gonzález gaya et al 2016 measured phe pyr fluo flu and ace with mean concentrations ranging from 0 21 0 46 ng l 0 30 0 50 ng l 0 27 0 42 ng l 0 056 0 20 ng l and 0 022 0 14 ng l respectively lohmann et al 2013 reported mean concentrations for phe pyr and fluo were 170 pg l 70 pg l and 30 pg l respectively in the entire tropical atlantic ocean via active sampling with puf plugs in 2009 3 2 spatial distribution trends of pahs dominated by continental discharges and ocean currents the spatial distribution of pahs in the surface seawater samples was investigated by dividing the sample locations into three groups pacific ocean w1 w14 w66 w71 southern ocean w15 w55 and indian ocean w56 w65 the median concentrations of 23pahs from high to low were in the following order pacific ocean 4000 1400 pg l indian ocean 2700 1000 pg l and southern ocean 2300 520 pg l table s5 the higher concentration in the pacific ocean is expected to be influenced by continental source regions such as australia southeast asian countries and china whereas the pah profiles from the southern ocean were lower in concentration confirming the remoteness of potential sources a latitudinal trend in seawater pah concentrations was observed concentrations of all pahs except bghip bap icdp and daha increased linearly from south to north with increasing latitude figs 2 and s3 this latitudinal pattern confirms the remoteness of the southern ocean and the large distance from primary pah sources positive correlation between pah concentrations and latitude of the sampling sites were found for 95 of the 3 and 4 ring pahs and 81 of the 5 and 6 ring pahs spearman correlation p 0 05 table s6 the good correlations between 3 and 4 ring and 5 and 6 ring pahs suggests that these congeners have similar source inputs and undergo similar transport processes in the marine environment it has been reported that diffusive air seawater exchange is the primary process driving the exchange of 3 4 rings pahs present in seawater samples gonzález gaya et al 2016 while high ring pahs have some of the lowest henry s law constants hlcs among our analyzed compounds and are more likely to undergo oceanic transport or to be effectively sequestered by the ocean during atmospheric transport and eventually deposited in the deep ocean and sediments bigot et al 2016 gonzález gaya et al 2016 concentrations of svocs in coastal seawater have been noted to be significantly higher than the open ocean and their sources have been determined as primarily land based sources via riverine inputs and wastewater gonzález gaya et al 2014 shan et al 2021 to understand the effects of continental emissions the variation of pahs concentration with the distance from the sampling site to the shoreline were explored at some sampling sites in the pacific and indian oceans samples w1 11 w13 w14 w61 71 detailed information is shown in si acy ace flu dbt phe cab chry bghip and 23pahs displayed an obvious linear decline with increasing distance to the coastline r2 0 20 to 0 62 p 0 05 figure s4 in addition a significant inverse linear relationship between seawater salinity and concentrations of flu dbt bghip and 23pahs were also observed p 0 05 figure s5 indicating a direct apparent riverine influence zhang et al 2019 all of these provide robust evidence that pahs pollution in the pacific and indian oceans were highly influenced by ongoing inputs from continental discharges and riverine inputs gonzález gaya et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 similar to our study gonzález gaya et al 2014 2016 reported that higher concentrations of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas and pahs were observed close to continents rather than in the ocean basins zhang et al 2019 demonstrated that continental discharges are the primary source of pfas in the marine environment of the northwest atlantic margin higher concentrations were observed at sites w11 4100 pg l w12 9500 pg l and w13 4600 pg l off the east coast of australia fig 1 than the median concentrations 4000 pg l at sites w1 10 and w65 71 in the pacific ocean these sites are located in regions influenced by the east australian current eac the western boundary current that flows southward along the east coast of australia as it flows southward along the north coast of new south wales the eac narrows into a strong shallow surface current that strongly but relatively steadily pounds the continental shelf and slope further south around 33 s the eac often separates from the coast deepening and flowing eastward into the tasman sea sometimes the eac would form large anticyclonic eddies marchesiello and middleton 2000 the accumulation by the eac and coastal discharges from australia under the role of coastal currents can be responsible for the high concentrations of pahs observed at these sites the highest concentration 9500 pg l was observed at site w12 which is located in the subtropical convergence zone defined as the northern boundary of the southern ocean forming a major frontal zone in the global ocean where nutrient rich subantarctic waters meet and sink in typically low nutrient subtropical waters garcia rojas et al 2018 the combination of subtropical convergence zone and subtropical oceanic gyres contributed to the high concentrations at site w12 meanwhile sydney canberra and melbourne the three largest cities located on the southeast coast of australia are not far from w12 400 580 km and may contribute to the high w12 concentrations as the distance from land based source regions is the main reason for high aqueous pahs antarctic convergence ac the interface between different ocean masses represents a boundary at which cold northward flowing antarctic water sinks beneath relatively warm water from lower latitudes this deep water formation process can influence the latitudinal distribution of pahs bigot et al 2016 the ac is located within the latitudes between 50 and 60 s with w14 and w15 to the east and w54 and w56 to the west the seawater temperatures of the ac were 2 5 c and the salinities were 33 7 33 8 psu civel mazens et al 2021 lüning et al 2019 sarkar et al 2021 concentrations of all pahs except for ret icdp daha and bghip were significantly greater mann whitney test p 0 01 at north of ac compared to the south implying that the north south transfer of pahs could be hampered by the ac as reported in the literature for β hexachlorocyclohexane heptachlor epoxide b and perfluorinated contaminants bengtson nash et al 2010 bigot et al 2016 the antarctic circumpolar current acc which flows continuously eastward is the largest ocean current in the southern polar regions and forms the northern boundary of the southern ocean it is the main pathway for the exchange of seawater between the atlantic indian and pacific oceans barker et al 2007 the seawater carried in the acc contains a mixture of seawater from the global ocean the mean concentration of 23pah was 2 3 ng l in surface seawaters from 40 to 60 s sites w13 w14 w15 w30 w54 w55 w56 w57 and w58 which is close to the global ocean average 2 7 ng l gonzález gaya et al 2016 the seawater to the south of the acc is supplied by the deep atlantic indian and pacific oceans which have been isolated from the atmosphere for centuries and are expected to carry low levels of pahs bengtson nash et al 2010 seawater concentrations of pahs measured in this study were compared with available literature reports the summed concentration of 64 pahs 64pahs was 1 9 3 4 ng l in seawater from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans sampled between december 2010 and july 2011 gonzález gaya et al 2016 the geographically closest available data come from measurements of seawater sampled between 2010 and 2011 in the western pacific and southern oceans where 9pahs were in the range from not detected to 21 ng l cai et al 2016 a more recent study sampled in 2016 reported comparable σ15pahs ranging from 0 82 to 3 7 ng l in open water sampled from the north pacific to the arctic ocean chen et al 2021 overall the pah concentrations observed in our study fall within the range of previous studies and showing no significant declining trends over the past decade 3 3 pahs transport at the air seawater interface air seawater exchange is the main process responsible for environmental mobility including transport and dynamics of svocs in the marine environment air samples were also collected during this cruise allowed the estimation of air seawater exchange to be made detailed information about the air concentration can be found in our previous study zhang et al 2021b more information on the calculation of air seawater exchange fugacity fluxes and associated error propagation are shown in the supporting information according to the ac mentioned above the sampling sites were divided into three regions pacific ocean w2 13 w66 70 southern ocean w16 53 and indian ocean w56 65 with median seawater temperature were 28 4 8 0 29 1 0 and 21 9 3 respectively most of 3 4 rings pahs were scattered across the volatilization or equilibrium area namely fa fw 1 in the pacific and indian oceans fig 3 and s6 indicating a primary net volatilization trend for low molecular weight mw pahs from the seawater to the atmosphere especially for ace and flu significantly correlations were found between these pahs fig 3 indicating similar transport trends and commensurate fugacity gradients in air seawater exchange liu et al 2016 volatilization of low mw pahs from seawater were also reported elsewhere chen et al 2021 gonzález gaya et al 2016 the exceptions were cab bbf and bcp which showed a net deposition trend as a function of their difference in sources and degradation rates in air and surface seawater ghosal et al 2016 ya et al 2018 in the southern ocean except for ace ant dbt and ret all the low mw pahs showed median fa fw 1 but were not significantly different from the phase equilibrium indicating that the tendency process of air seawater exchange for low mw pahs was deposition from air to seawater the possible reason is that the significantly lower seawater temperatures in the southern ocean 0 29 1 0 compared to the pacific 28 4 8 and indian oceans 21 9 3 mann whitney test p 0 01 and the migration of higher volatile pahs from seawater to the atmosphere are limited ma et al 2018 warming is expected to favor the partitioning of svocs from the aqueous to the gaseous phase especially for those legacy svocs whose atmospheric concentrations have terminated and whose lifetimes are much shorter in air than in water cabrerizo et al 2019 all 5 6 ring pahs showed significant deposition across the air seawater interface of the ocean the behavior of high mw pahs was far away from equilibrium showing net deposition in the pacific indian and southern oceans with the transport direction is from air to seawater meanwhile the relationship between fa fw and the ring number and subcooled vapor pressure log pº l was observed figure s7 the results showed that fa fw increased significantly with the increase of ring number r2 0 53 p 0 01 and decreased significantly with the increasing of log pº l r2 0 92 p 0 01 indicating the air seawater exchange of pahs was influenced by physicochemical property the flux of air seawater exchange faw for individual pahs varies considerably in different oceans fig 4 in the pacific and indian oceans the greatest net volatilization fluxes were always observed for flu phe and ace which had median values were 540 ng m2 day 450 ng m2 day and 390 ng m2 day in the pacific ocean and 280 ng m2 day 430 ng m2 day and 160 ng m2 day in the indian ocean respectively generally volatilization trends were observed for most 3 4 ring pahs while 5 6 ring pahs all showed deposition fluxes indicating that seawater in the pacific and indian oceans is acting as an important secondary source of 3 4 ring pahs to the atmosphere a similar phenomenon was observed in the taiwan strait china ya et al 2018 the russian arctic ocean ji et al 2019 in the southern ocean all pahs showed negative faw values with median values ranging from 60 ng m2 day phe to 0 083 ng m2 day daha except ace 20 ng m2 day dbt 4 9 ng m2 day ret 3 6 ng m2 day and ant 2 8 ng m2 day fig 4 which again implies that they are currently being loaded into seawater from the atmosphere deposition fluxes of other svocs such as dieldrin chlorpyrifos hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorocyclohexane have been reported in several publications from the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 galbán malagón et al 2013a xie et al 2011 distance from the sources isolation of seawater by the acc bengtson nash et al 2010 as well as loss processes in the water column such as biological and degradative pumps galbán malagón et al 2013a 2013b all contribute to lower concentrations of pahs in the southern ocean in addition the entry of pahs enriched ice shelves into the ocean can increase the pahs concentrations casal et al 2018 since the calculation of fluxes relies heavily on the measured pahs concentrations all of these can result in large variations in fluxes the air seawater exchange fluxes in open oceans measured here was compared with available information from the scientific literatures wu et al 2017 studied the fluxes of pahs to the northwestern pacific ocean and showed that the fluxes of pahs from air to seawater ranged from 54 to 110 ng m2 day depending on locations volatilizations of phe 70 210 ng m2 day and ant 3 0 70 ng m2 day were observed along a north south atlantic transect nizzetto et al 2008 net deposition of 150 ng m2 day of pahs in late spring and net volatilization of 220 ng m2 day in late summer were observed in the coastal waters at livingston island antarctica casal et al 2018 overall the air seawater exchange fluxes observed in our study are outside the range of previous studies these findings may be due to region specific differences seasonality and selection of target pah derivatives 3 4 source apportionment of pahs pca mlr and pmf models have been widely used to estimate the source profiles and their contributions to svocs in the aquatic environment li et al 2020 shi et al 2021 more information on pca mlr and pmf analysis can be found in the supporting information section 3 4 1 principal component analysis multiple linear regression four principal components pc1 pc2 pc3 and pc4 were extracted and rotated accounting for 85 of the total variance with factor loadings matrix is shown in table s7 the first rotated component pc1 accounts for 46 of the total variance and is highly associated with baa chry bbjkf bep bap and pery baa chry bbjkf and bap have been identified as characteristic of the pah signal produced via fossil fuel combustion yang et al 2013 yu et al 2015 similar profile was observed in the sediments from the northern bering chukchi region lin et al 2020 the second rotated component pc2 is responsible for 20 of the total variance and was characterized by high loadings of 3 ring pahs acy ace flu dbt phe and ant low mw pahs such as ace flu phe ant and dbt have been reported to be important tracers of petrogenic sources li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a the third rotated component pc3 explaining 11 of the total variance and is predominately composed of fluo pyr ret and bbf with moderate loading from pheand ant several authors report fluo pyr phe and ant as predominant coal combustion profiles cao et al 2011 harrison et al 1996 larsen and baker 2003 simcik et al 1999 ret has been reported to be a marker of wood combustion lohmann et al 2013 wang et al 2013 thus this profile is indicative of coal wood combustion the fourth rotated component pc4 contributing 2 8 of the total variance and showed a good correlation with icdp daha and bghip according to the literature this source is highly indicative of engine combustion emissions icdp and daha are predominant in diesel exhaust bi et al 2018 cao et al 2011 bghip has been suggested to indicate diesel vehicles levels larsen and baker 2003 zhang et al 2012 totally the estimated average contributions for four factors were 15 57 24 and 2 8 for fossil fuels combustion sources petrogenic sources coal wood combustion sources and engine combustion emissions sources respectively 3 4 2 positive matrix factorization model the four factors identifying the source profiles were extracted by the pmf model and showed similar results to the pca mlr model from figure s8 it can be found that factor 1 is engine combustion sources factor 2 is identified as the fossil fuel combustion source factor 3 is associated with petrogenic sources and factor 4 is identified as a coal wood combustion the contribution of the four sources was estimated as petrogenic sources 44 coal wood combustion 31 fossil fuel combustion 15 engine combustion 10 the comparisons between the measured and modeled pahs concentrations of the two models were shown in figure s9 the results showed that the slops of pca mlr and pmf are 0 98 and 1 0 with the r2 values are 0 99 and 0 98 respectively this again confirms that most of the predicted pah concentrations are close to the real measured concentrations as mentioned above the pah source profile shown in the two receptor models yields similar results indicating petrogenic sources as the most important sources 44 57 followed by coal wood combustion 30 31 fossil fuel combustion 15 and engine combustion 2 8 10 the spatial distributions of the target pahs from each source category for the respective ocean regional categories are shown in fig 5 high levels of petrogenic sources contributions are found in the pacific ocean however both coal wood combustion and petrogenic sources are responsible for the pah concentrations detected in the indian and southern oceans in the open sea potential ship emissions oil spills and produced water discharge from offshore oil platforms could explain the high contribution of petrogenic sources ya et al 2018 our previous study found that the contribution of pahs in the atmosphere over the southern ocean is coal wood combustion zhang et al 2021b as mentioned above atmospheric deposition is the dominant process of air seawater exchange in the southern ocean which may contribute to the source of coal wood combustion in seawater potential sources identification in marine environment appears to be scarce limiting our comparisons in 2014 cao et al 2018 reported a profile of mixed sources of petroleum as well as biomass and coal combustion in seawater of bransfield strait antarctica based on molecular diagnostic ratios which is similar to our results 4 conclusions this study reports the occurrence air seawater fluxes and possible source contributions of 28 priority pahs along a sampling transect from the northwestern pacific to the southern ocean 19 n 77 s a significant north south decreasing gradient of pahs levels ranging from 1300 to 9500 pg l is reported this gradient confirms the remoteness of the southern ocean related to primary pah sources coastal outflows and ocean currents play an important role in determining spatial distribution trends for pahs the estimated air seawater fugacity ratios and fluxes suggest that under current climatic conditions the pacific and indian oceans serves as a second source for most 3 4 ring pahs to the atmosphere while the southern ocean is still considered as a sink for most pahs four important source categories for pahs were identified namely petrogenic sources coal wood combustion fossil fuel combustion and engine combustion emissions by two models dominant petrogenic sources contributions were found in the pacific ocean while both coal wood combustion and petrogenic sources are identified as predominant sources for pahs in the indian and southern oceans this study provides one of the few reports on pah profiles in the seawater along a transect from the pacific to the southern oceans and helps to better understand the large scale fate of pahs in the global oceans declaration of

16480,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as a group of toxic and carcinogenic compounds are large scale globally emitted anthropogenic pollutants mainly emitted into the atmosphere however atmospheric transport cannot fully explain the spatial variability of pahs in the marine atmosphere and seawater it is hypothesized that pahs accumulated in seawater and ocean circulation can also influence pahs observed in air above the ocean in order to investigate pahs in seawater as a potential secondary source to air we collected paired air and seawater samples during a research cruise from china to the antarctic in 2018 2019 covering the pacific ocean the indian ocean and the southern ocean summed concentrations of 28 analyzed pahs in seawater were highest in the pacific ocean 4000 1400 pg l followed by the indian ocean 2700 1000 pg l and the southern ocean 2300 520 pg l three ringed pahs dominated the composition profile we found that pah levels in the pacific and indian oceans were strong inversely correlated with salinity and distance to the coastline this suggests that riverine inputs and continental discharges are important sources of pahs to the marine environment derived air seawater fugacity ratios suggest that net fluxes of pahs were from seawater to the air in the pacific and indian oceans at 9 0 8100 median 1600 ng m2 d and 290 2000 median 1300 ng m2 d respectively in the southern ocean the net flow of pahs was from air to seawater with a flux of 1000 450 median 82 ng m2 d source apportionment from two different models suggested that the largest contribution to total pahs was from petrogenic sources 44 57 followed by coal wood combustion 30 31 fossil fuel combustion 15 and engine combustion emissions 2 8 9 5 higher contributions from petrogenic sources were found at sites close to coastal regions both coal wood combustion and petrogenic sources are responsible for the pah concentrations detected in the indian and southern oceans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pahs spatial distribution ocean currents air seawater exchange positive matrix factorization model 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are released into the environment either from direct emissions from petrogenic sources or the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels biomass and other petrogenic sources pahs are ubiquitously found in the global environment casal et al 2018 ya et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a long term human exposure to pahs is associated with various adverse health effects such as carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects biache et al 2014 yu et al 2019 pahs can be found even in remote regions like the southern ocean cabrerizo et al 2014 cao et al 2018 as their susceptibility for long range atmospheric transport drotikova et al 2020 singh et al 2017 is coupled with long range transport by ocean currents lohmann et al 2013 and associated air seawater exchange in the open ocean casal et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 however the fate and transport of pahs in the highly dynamic marine environment are still not completely understood cai et al 2016 gonzález gaya et al 2016 lohmann et al 2013 several previous studies have reported pahs in seawater chen et al 2021 lohmann et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 higher concentrations were found in the atlantic ocean compared to the pacific and indian ocean gonzález gaya et al 2016 recently zheng et al 2021 reported the distribution of pahs from the north pacific to the arctic ocean and found an inverse correlation with latitude these studies have greatly improved the understanding of the occurrence of pahs in the marine environment particularly in the atlantic arctic ocean basin however there is a lack of assessment of the effects of ocean currents and continental discharges on pahs concentrations as the transport of ocean currents is considered an important vector for the global transport of the semi volatile organic compounds svocs gonzález gaya et al 2014 such as the antarctic circumpolar current acc which forms as a physical barrier that effectively inhibits north south transport of surface seawaters from surrounding oceans bengtson nash et al 2010 cai et al 2016 therefore more information on their distribution profiles in seawater is needed allowing a better understanding the compound specific mobility and the associated factors of pahs as an important indicator of svocs in the marine environment the marine environment has been identified as an important sink for various svocs however the environmental conditions are changing and whether this is still an important function in the svoc global cycling or they already act as secondary sources is an important research question nowadays overall many studies have been conducted on the air seawater exchange and biogeochemical processes of pahs in the marine environment these reports focused on the arctic tropical subtropical regions chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 the tropical atlantic ocean lohmann et al 2013 nizzetto et al 2008 and the subtropical pacific and indian ocean gonzález gaya et al 2016 studies on the chinese marginal seas have also been conducted ya et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a these studies have greatly improved our understanding on the fate of pahs in the marine environment particularly in the atlantic arctic ocean basin however there are few existing assessments of pahs in antarctica and the adjacent southern ocean casal et al 2018 as a consequence the biogeochemical and physical processes driving the pahs occurrence in the southern ocean remain still largely unknown determining the possible sources and contributions of pahs in seawater is essential for understanding pahs contamination in the marine environment empirical studies in combination with statistical treatment such as factor analysis methods like principal component analysis multiple linear regression models pca mlr and positive matrix factorization pmf have been widely used to identify the source of svocs in aquatic environments bi et al 2018 li et al 2020 salim et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a used pca mlr and pmf to identify the sources of pahs in the south china sea these two models have been previously used for pollutant sources apportionment in urban regions jang et al 2013 lakes zhang et al 2012 and river basins cao et al 2011 chang et al 2009 stout and graan 2010 however the compound specific source apportionment for pahs in the marine environment is still mainly using diagnostic ratios cai et al 2016 cao et al 2018 lohmann et al 2013 which are only of indicative nature reports on the quantitative source contribution of pahs in the oceans are hence still scarce in the scientific literature for the here reported study on the role of oceans on pahs mobility and fate seawater samples were collected during an antarctic expedition of the chinese research vessel xuelong from the northwestern pacific to the antarctic in 2018 2019 the analytical data were examined for better understanding 1 the concentrations and spatial trends of pahs in the southern ocean 2 the effects of coastal discharges rivers and ocean currents on the presence of pahs in the marine environment 3 whether the pacific indian and southern oceans serving as sinks or secondary sources of pahs through the air seawater exchange 4 the spatial distribution of pahs source for each source category obtained from pca mlr and pmf models 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling information onboard the chinese antarctic research vessel xuelong of the polar research institute of china from november 2018 to march 2019 air and seawater samples were collected from the northwestern pacific to the southern ocean 179 177 e 77 19 n for the analysis

the supporting information si specific information about collecting air and seawater samples is described in si in situ meteorological and hydrological data including seawater temperature and salinity were also obtained table s2 2 2 sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis all samples were pretreated using high volume spe isiu technology at the state oceanic administration key laboratory for polar sciences shanghai china gao et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 prior to extraction a mixture of 1 0 ppm deuterated pah standards of 100 μl was added as a recovery standard table s1 each xad was placed in a stainless steel tube 45 ml mixed solvent acetone dichloromethane n hexane 1 1 1 v v v was added in the column and was ultrasonically vibrated for 5 min 90 break rate 2 s 5 s to ensure desorption of pahs triplicate extractions were performed and the eluent was collected and transferred to a 200 ml evaporation tube turbovap ii biotage sweden the eluent was evaporated to 100 μl under a gentle gas stream of pure nitrogen 99 99 the target pahs were analyzed on an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph coupled to a 7010b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and equipped with a 7693a autosampler injector gc ms ms agilent palo alto ca usa the ms ms was operated in dynamic multi reaction monitoring mode details are provided in si the ionization modes transitions quantification and qualifying ions used to monitor pahs are shown in table s1 2 3 quality assurance and quality control qa qc all materials used for the sampling were rigorously cleaned and properly stored before the sampling cruise all the equipment was precleaned by rinsing with methanol distilled water and then seawater from the specific locations before sampling detailed descriptions of the qa qc are shown in si method detection limits were ranged from 0 048 to 34 pg l for seawater samples table s3 recoveries were monitored in xad columns using 15 perdeuterated pahs and they ranged from 62 to 110 table s4 seawater samples 22 39 and 41 were lost in storage and therefore were not included for further discussion 3 results and discussion 3 1 pahs concentrations and profiles in seawater concentrations of pahs in seawater are shown in fig 1 twenty three of the targeted 28 pahs acy ace flu dbt phe ant cab fluo pyr ret bbf bcp baa chry bbjkf bep bap pery icdp daha and bghip were detected in over 95 of the surface seawater samples the remaining 5 pahs were detected in less than 15 of the samples and thus were not included for further discussion pahs were divided into four groups 3 ring pahs acy ace flu phe ant dbt cab and ret 4 ring pahs fluo pyr baa chry bbf and bcp 5 ring pahs bbjkf bap daha pery and bep and 6 ring pahs icdp and bghip on average 3 ring pahs 4 ring pahs 5 ring pahs and 6 ring pahs contributed 55 88 11 36 0 50 5 0 and 0 20 9 0 respectively to the total seawater pah concentrations 23pahs the sum of 23 pah concentrations figure s1 overall 23pahs concentrations ranged from 1300 to 9500 pg l with a median of 2700 pg l phe 570 2000 pg l flu 65 2000 pg l fluo 120 440 pg l pyr 120 390 pg l ace 46 3000 pg l and ant 73 420 pg l figure s2 were the most abundant pahs and contributed 21 49 5 0 21 4 0 15 4 0 15 3 0 31 and 3 0 10 to 23pahs concentrations respectively in contrast the proportions of high molecular weight homologues such as 5 6 rings pahs merely account for 0 40 6 0 of the 23pahs consistent with other reports of pahs in the seawater gonzález gaya et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 overall the seawater concentration of measured compounds here were within the range as previously reported data zheng et al 2021 measured 9 pahs from the north pacific to the arctic ocean in 2014 using passive sampling with ldpes and reported a median of 1 8 ng l for phe 1 5 ng l for flu 0 90 ng l for fluo and 0 77 ng l for pyr ji et al 2019 estimated concentrations of 0 76 4 3 ng l for flu 0 44 2 1 ng l for fluo and 0 0060 0 030 ng l for pyr in the russian arctic ocean in 2016 in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans gonzález gaya et al 2016 measured phe pyr fluo flu and ace with mean concentrations ranging from 0 21 0 46 ng l 0 30 0 50 ng l 0 27 0 42 ng l 0 056 0 20 ng l and 0 022 0 14 ng l respectively lohmann et al 2013 reported mean concentrations for phe pyr and fluo were 170 pg l 70 pg l and 30 pg l respectively in the entire tropical atlantic ocean via active sampling with puf plugs in 2009 3 2 spatial distribution trends of pahs dominated by continental discharges and ocean currents the spatial distribution of pahs in the surface seawater samples was investigated by dividing the sample locations into three groups pacific ocean w1 w14 w66 w71 southern ocean w15 w55 and indian ocean w56 w65 the median concentrations of 23pahs from high to low were in the following order pacific ocean 4000 1400 pg l indian ocean 2700 1000 pg l and southern ocean 2300 520 pg l table s5 the higher concentration in the pacific ocean is expected to be influenced by continental source regions such as australia southeast asian countries and china whereas the pah profiles from the southern ocean were lower in concentration confirming the remoteness of potential sources a latitudinal trend in seawater pah concentrations was observed concentrations of all pahs except bghip bap icdp and daha increased linearly from south to north with increasing latitude figs 2 and s3 this latitudinal pattern confirms the remoteness of the southern ocean and the large distance from primary pah sources positive correlation between pah concentrations and latitude of the sampling sites were found for 95 of the 3 and 4 ring pahs and 81 of the 5 and 6 ring pahs spearman correlation p 0 05 table s6 the good correlations between 3 and 4 ring and 5 and 6 ring pahs suggests that these congeners have similar source inputs and undergo similar transport processes in the marine environment it has been reported that diffusive air seawater exchange is the primary process driving the exchange of 3 4 rings pahs present in seawater samples gonzález gaya et al 2016 while high ring pahs have some of the lowest henry s law constants hlcs among our analyzed compounds and are more likely to undergo oceanic transport or to be effectively sequestered by the ocean during atmospheric transport and eventually deposited in the deep ocean and sediments bigot et al 2016 gonzález gaya et al 2016 concentrations of svocs in coastal seawater have been noted to be significantly higher than the open ocean and their sources have been determined as primarily land based sources via riverine inputs and wastewater gonzález gaya et al 2014 shan et al 2021 to understand the effects of continental emissions the variation of pahs concentration with the distance from the sampling site to the shoreline were explored at some sampling sites in the pacific and indian oceans samples w1 11 w13 w14 w61 71 detailed information is shown in si acy ace flu dbt phe cab chry bghip and 23pahs displayed an obvious linear decline with increasing distance to the coastline r2 0 20 to 0 62 p 0 05 figure s4 in addition a significant inverse linear relationship between seawater salinity and concentrations of flu dbt bghip and 23pahs were also observed p 0 05 figure s5 indicating a direct apparent riverine influence zhang et al 2019 all of these provide robust evidence that pahs pollution in the pacific and indian oceans were highly influenced by ongoing inputs from continental discharges and riverine inputs gonzález gaya et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 similar to our study gonzález gaya et al 2014 2016 reported that higher concentrations of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas and pahs were observed close to continents rather than in the ocean basins zhang et al 2019 demonstrated that continental discharges are the primary source of pfas in the marine environment of the northwest atlantic margin higher concentrations were observed at sites w11 4100 pg l w12 9500 pg l and w13 4600 pg l off the east coast of australia fig 1 than the median concentrations 4000 pg l at sites w1 10 and w65 71 in the pacific ocean these sites are located in regions influenced by the east australian current eac the western boundary current that flows southward along the east coast of australia as it flows southward along the north coast of new south wales the eac narrows into a strong shallow surface current that strongly but relatively steadily pounds the continental shelf and slope further south around 33 s the eac often separates from the coast deepening and flowing eastward into the tasman sea sometimes the eac would form large anticyclonic eddies marchesiello and middleton 2000 the accumulation by the eac and coastal discharges from australia under the role of coastal currents can be responsible for the high concentrations of pahs observed at these sites the highest concentration 9500 pg l was observed at site w12 which is located in the subtropical convergence zone defined as the northern boundary of the southern ocean forming a major frontal zone in the global ocean where nutrient rich subantarctic waters meet and sink in typically low nutrient subtropical waters garcia rojas et al 2018 the combination of subtropical convergence zone and subtropical oceanic gyres contributed to the high concentrations at site w12 meanwhile sydney canberra and melbourne the three largest cities located on the southeast coast of australia are not far from w12 400 580 km and may contribute to the high w12 concentrations as the distance from land based source regions is the main reason for high aqueous pahs antarctic convergence ac the interface between different ocean masses represents a boundary at which cold northward flowing antarctic water sinks beneath relatively warm water from lower latitudes this deep water formation process can influence the latitudinal distribution of pahs bigot et al 2016 the ac is located within the latitudes between 50 and 60 s with w14 and w15 to the east and w54 and w56 to the west the seawater temperatures of the ac were 2 5 c and the salinities were 33 7 33 8 psu civel mazens et al 2021 lüning et al 2019 sarkar et al 2021 concentrations of all pahs except for ret icdp daha and bghip were significantly greater mann whitney test p 0 01 at north of ac compared to the south implying that the north south transfer of pahs could be hampered by the ac as reported in the literature for β hexachlorocyclohexane heptachlor epoxide b and perfluorinated contaminants bengtson nash et al 2010 bigot et al 2016 the antarctic circumpolar current acc which flows continuously eastward is the largest ocean current in the southern polar regions and forms the northern boundary of the southern ocean it is the main pathway for the exchange of seawater between the atlantic indian and pacific oceans barker et al 2007 the seawater carried in the acc contains a mixture of seawater from the global ocean the mean concentration of 23pah was 2 3 ng l in surface seawaters from 40 to 60 s sites w13 w14 w15 w30 w54 w55 w56 w57 and w58 which is close to the global ocean average 2 7 ng l gonzález gaya et al 2016 the seawater to the south of the acc is supplied by the deep atlantic indian and pacific oceans which have been isolated from the atmosphere for centuries and are expected to carry low levels of pahs bengtson nash et al 2010 seawater concentrations of pahs measured in this study were compared with available literature reports the summed concentration of 64 pahs 64pahs was 1 9 3 4 ng l in seawater from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans sampled between december 2010 and july 2011 gonzález gaya et al 2016 the geographically closest available data come from measurements of seawater sampled between 2010 and 2011 in the western pacific and southern oceans where 9pahs were in the range from not detected to 21 ng l cai et al 2016 a more recent study sampled in 2016 reported comparable σ15pahs ranging from 0 82 to 3 7 ng l in open water sampled from the north pacific to the arctic ocean chen et al 2021 overall the pah concentrations observed in our study fall within the range of previous studies and showing no significant declining trends over the past decade 3 3 pahs transport at the air seawater interface air seawater exchange is the main process responsible for environmental mobility including transport and dynamics of svocs in the marine environment air samples were also collected during this cruise allowed the estimation of air seawater exchange to be made detailed information about the air concentration can be found in our previous study zhang et al 2021b more information on the calculation of air seawater exchange fugacity fluxes and associated error propagation are shown in the supporting information according to the ac mentioned above the sampling sites were divided into three regions pacific ocean w2 13 w66 70 southern ocean w16 53 and indian ocean w56 65 with median seawater temperature were 28 4 8 0 29 1 0 and 21 9 3 respectively most of 3 4 rings pahs were scattered across the volatilization or equilibrium area namely fa fw 1 in the pacific and indian oceans fig 3 and s6 indicating a primary net volatilization trend for low molecular weight mw pahs from the seawater to the atmosphere especially for ace and flu significantly correlations were found between these pahs fig 3 indicating similar transport trends and commensurate fugacity gradients in air seawater exchange liu et al 2016 volatilization of low mw pahs from seawater were also reported elsewhere chen et al 2021 gonzález gaya et al 2016 the exceptions were cab bbf and bcp which showed a net deposition trend as a function of their difference in sources and degradation rates in air and surface seawater ghosal et al 2016 ya et al 2018 in the southern ocean except for ace ant dbt and ret all the low mw pahs showed median fa fw 1 but were not significantly different from the phase equilibrium indicating that the tendency process of air seawater exchange for low mw pahs was deposition from air to seawater the possible reason is that the significantly lower seawater temperatures in the southern ocean 0 29 1 0 compared to the pacific 28 4 8 and indian oceans 21 9 3 mann whitney test p 0 01 and the migration of higher volatile pahs from seawater to the atmosphere are limited ma et al 2018 warming is expected to favor the partitioning of svocs from the aqueous to the gaseous phase especially for those legacy svocs whose atmospheric concentrations have terminated and whose lifetimes are much shorter in air than in water cabrerizo et al 2019 all 5 6 ring pahs showed significant deposition across the air seawater interface of the ocean the behavior of high mw pahs was far away from equilibrium showing net deposition in the pacific indian and southern oceans with the transport direction is from air to seawater meanwhile the relationship between fa fw and the ring number and subcooled vapor pressure log pº l was observed figure s7 the results showed that fa fw increased significantly with the increase of ring number r2 0 53 p 0 01 and decreased significantly with the increasing of log pº l r2 0 92 p 0 01 indicating the air seawater exchange of pahs was influenced by physicochemical property the flux of air seawater exchange faw for individual pahs varies considerably in different oceans fig 4 in the pacific and indian oceans the greatest net volatilization fluxes were always observed for flu phe and ace which had median values were 540 ng m2 day 450 ng m2 day and 390 ng m2 day in the pacific ocean and 280 ng m2 day 430 ng m2 day and 160 ng m2 day in the indian ocean respectively generally volatilization trends were observed for most 3 4 ring pahs while 5 6 ring pahs all showed deposition fluxes indicating that seawater in the pacific and indian oceans is acting as an important secondary source of 3 4 ring pahs to the atmosphere a similar phenomenon was observed in the taiwan strait china ya et al 2018 the russian arctic ocean ji et al 2019 in the southern ocean all pahs showed negative faw values with median values ranging from 60 ng m2 day phe to 0 083 ng m2 day daha except ace 20 ng m2 day dbt 4 9 ng m2 day ret 3 6 ng m2 day and ant 2 8 ng m2 day fig 4 which again implies that they are currently being loaded into seawater from the atmosphere deposition fluxes of other svocs such as dieldrin chlorpyrifos hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorocyclohexane have been reported in several publications from the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 galbán malagón et al 2013a xie et al 2011 distance from the sources isolation of seawater by the acc bengtson nash et al 2010 as well as loss processes in the water column such as biological and degradative pumps galbán malagón et al 2013a 2013b all contribute to lower concentrations of pahs in the southern ocean in addition the entry of pahs enriched ice shelves into the ocean can increase the pahs concentrations casal et al 2018 since the calculation of fluxes relies heavily on the measured pahs concentrations all of these can result in large variations in fluxes the air seawater exchange fluxes in open oceans measured here was compared with available information from the scientific literatures wu et al 2017 studied the fluxes of pahs to the northwestern pacific ocean and showed that the fluxes of pahs from air to seawater ranged from 54 to 110 ng m2 day depending on locations volatilizations of phe 70 210 ng m2 day and ant 3 0 70 ng m2 day were observed along a north south atlantic transect nizzetto et al 2008 net deposition of 150 ng m2 day of pahs in late spring and net volatilization of 220 ng m2 day in late summer were observed in the coastal waters at livingston island antarctica casal et al 2018 overall the air seawater exchange fluxes observed in our study are outside the range of previous studies these findings may be due to region specific differences seasonality and selection of target pah derivatives 3 4 source apportionment of pahs pca mlr and pmf models have been widely used to estimate the source profiles and their contributions to svocs in the aquatic environment li et al 2020 shi et al 2021 more information on pca mlr and pmf analysis can be found in the supporting information section 3 4 1 principal component analysis multiple linear regression four principal components pc1 pc2 pc3 and pc4 were extracted and rotated accounting for 85 of the total variance with factor loadings matrix is shown in table s7 the first rotated component pc1 accounts for 46 of the total variance and is highly associated with baa chry bbjkf bep bap and pery baa chry bbjkf and bap have been identified as characteristic of the pah signal produced via fossil fuel combustion yang et al 2013 yu et al 2015 similar profile was observed in the sediments from the northern bering chukchi region lin et al 2020 the second rotated component pc2 is responsible for 20 of the total variance and was characterized by high loadings of 3 ring pahs acy ace flu dbt phe and ant low mw pahs such as ace flu phe ant and dbt have been reported to be important tracers of petrogenic sources li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a the third rotated component pc3 explaining 11 of the total variance and is predominately composed of fluo pyr ret and bbf with moderate loading from pheand ant several authors report fluo pyr phe and ant as predominant coal combustion profiles cao et al 2011 harrison et al 1996 larsen and baker 2003 simcik et al 1999 ret has been reported to be a marker of wood combustion lohmann et al 2013 wang et al 2013 thus this profile is indicative of coal wood combustion the fourth rotated component pc4 contributing 2 8 of the total variance and showed a good correlation with icdp daha and bghip according to the literature this source is highly indicative of engine combustion emissions icdp and daha are predominant in diesel exhaust bi et al 2018 cao et al 2011 bghip has been suggested to indicate diesel vehicles levels larsen and baker 2003 zhang et al 2012 totally the estimated average contributions for four factors were 15 57 24 and 2 8 for fossil fuels combustion sources petrogenic sources coal wood combustion sources and engine combustion emissions sources respectively 3 4 2 positive matrix factorization model the four factors identifying the source profiles were extracted by the pmf model and showed similar results to the pca mlr model from figure s8 it can be found that factor 1 is engine combustion sources factor 2 is identified as the fossil fuel combustion source factor 3 is associated with petrogenic sources and factor 4 is identified as a coal wood combustion the contribution of the four sources was estimated as petrogenic sources 44 coal wood combustion 31 fossil fuel combustion 15 engine combustion 10 the comparisons between the measured and modeled pahs concentrations of the two models were shown in figure s9 the results showed that the slops of pca mlr and pmf are 0 98 and 1 0 with the r2 values are 0 99 and 0 98 respectively this again confirms that most of the predicted pah concentrations are close to the real measured concentrations as mentioned above the pah source profile shown in the two receptor models yields similar results indicating petrogenic sources as the most important sources 44 57 followed by coal wood combustion 30 31 fossil fuel combustion 15 and engine combustion 2 8 10 the spatial distributions of the target pahs from each source category for the respective ocean regional categories are shown in fig 5 high levels of petrogenic sources contributions are found in the pacific ocean however both coal wood combustion and petrogenic sources are responsible for the pah concentrations detected in the indian and southern oceans in the open sea potential ship emissions oil spills and produced water discharge from offshore oil platforms could explain the high contribution of petrogenic sources ya et al 2018 our previous study found that the contribution of pahs in the atmosphere over the southern ocean is coal wood combustion zhang et al 2021b as mentioned above atmospheric deposition is the dominant process of air seawater exchange in the southern ocean which may contribute to the source of coal wood combustion in seawater potential sources identification in marine environment appears to be scarce limiting our comparisons in 2014 cao et al 2018 reported a profile of mixed sources of petroleum as well as biomass and coal combustion in seawater of bransfield strait antarctica based on molecular diagnostic ratios which is similar to our results 4 conclusions this study reports the occurrence air seawater fluxes and possible source contributions of 28 priority pahs along a sampling transect from the northwestern pacific to the southern ocean 19 n 77 s a significant north south decreasing gradient of pahs levels ranging from 1300 to 9500 pg l is reported this gradient confirms the remoteness of the southern ocean related to primary pah sources coastal outflows and ocean currents play an important role in determining spatial distribution trends for pahs the estimated air seawater fugacity ratios and fluxes suggest that under current climatic conditions the pacific and indian oceans serves as a second source for most 3 4 ring pahs to the atmosphere while the southern ocean is still considered as a sink for most pahs four important source categories for pahs were identified namely petrogenic sources coal wood combustion fossil fuel combustion and engine combustion emissions by two models dominant petrogenic sources contributions were found in the pacific ocean while both coal wood combustion and petrogenic sources are identified as predominant sources for pahs in the indian and southern oceans this study provides one of the few reports on pah profiles in the seawater along a transect from the pacific to the southern oceans and helps to better understand the large scale fate of pahs in the global oceans declaration of

16481,aging of microplastics mps i e degradation and weathering is ubiquitous in the environment the mp aging process is thought to be limited to light and static areas while aging in dark and fluctuating anoxic oxic areas is poorly understood here we provide initial evidence for aging of polystyrene microplastics ps mps under different anoxic oxic conditions in sediments and we further explored these mechanisms using sediment column experiments and pure culture experiments the results showed that ps mps in alternating anoxic oxic sediments displayed the highest degree of aging in the in situ experiment both the weight losses and o c ratios of ps mps aged under alternating anoxic oxic conditions were 2 times higher than those aged under static oxic and static anoxic conditions during 2 month experiments in a 2 month column experiment the ps mps in the alternating anoxic oxic group showed weight losses and o c ratios that were respectively triple and double the corresponding values for the static oxic and static anoxic groups column and pure culture experiments demonstrated that dark production of oh which showed a positive correlation with a fe redox process could explain enhanced mp aging under the alternating anoxic oxic conditions these findings provide a basis for risk assessment and management of mps in the natural environment such as in intertidal zones and paddy fields and also have implications for engineering of optimized mp degradation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic aging degree alternating anoxic oxic

accumulated by aquatic organisms and terrestrial plants and may be subsequently transferred along the food chain thereby serving as a potential threat to human health since humans are the ultimate consumers in the food web vethaak and leslie 2016 lu et al 2016 sun et al 2020a mps can be distributed in the environment for long periods of time they are susceptible to physical stress ultraviolet radiation fluctuating temperatures salinity oxidizing conditions and microbial colonization jahnke et al 2017 consequently they become more hydrophilic lower in molecular weight and more fragile and they exhibit more irregular shapes yan et al 2020 we use degradation weathering and aging interchangeably to describe these processes waldman and rillig 2020 the carbonyl index ci and oxygen to carbon o c atom ratio are parameters providing quantitative descriptions of the degree of mp aging liu et al 2019 natural aging of mps after entering the environment has attracted much attention recently since it promotes the release of their additives e g bisphenol a phthalate and polybrominated diphenyl ether etc affects binding interactions between mps and pollutants and facilitates the formation of biofilms on surfaces luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 aging has been shown to increase the sorption capacities of mps for heavy metals hydrophilic organic pollutants and biofilms and to decrease those for hydrophobic organic pollutants such as 9 nitroanthracene in addition aging processes potentially affect mp ingestion by aquatic organisms due to changes in mp sizes colors and surface charges liu et al 2020b however most current studies investigating mp aging have been focused on photoaging in exposed areas halle et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 research on mp aging in dark or enclosed environments such as in sediments and in the soil is still scarce zhang et al 2021 especially for sediments subjected to different flooding conditions that would produce different anoxic oxic environments mp aging can be caused by heat thermal degradation light photodegradation ionizing radiation radiative degradation mechanical degradation chemical degradation and organism biodegradation yousif and haddad 2013 quecholac piña et al 2020 mechanical degradation chemical degradation and biodegradation might occur in sediments and soil and exhibit various effects under different anoxic oxic conditions for example anoxic oxic conditions produce different microbial communities that might affect the biodegradation of mps and free radicals generated in microbially driven fenton reactions in an alternating anoxic oxic environment might result in different chemical degradation pathways deangelis et al 2010 broman et al 2017 jia et al 2017 thus we hypothesized that mps might show significantly different aging behaviors in sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions polystyrene ps is one of the most widely used plastics and millions of tons are produced annually lang et al 2020 it was employed here to study the aging of polystyrene microplastics ps mps with both the in situ sediment experiments and sediment column experiments under different anoxic oxic conditions weight losses molecular weight shifts surface chemistries and hydrophobicities of ps mps were used to study aging under different conditions the compositions of microbial communities and the production of hydroxyl radical oh were analyzed and a pure culture experiment was conducted to determine which factors influence degradation and play major roles in the aging of ps mps in sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ experiments a site on the minjiang river 26 1ʹ47ʺ n 119 14ʹ23ʺ w fuzhou china which is a semidiurnal tidal river was selected for in situ experiments conducted over 2 months from february 12th to april 17th 2021 during this period the maximum minimum and average temperatures were 34 13 and 22 c respectively and the total rainfall was approximately 200 mm the river beach and intertidal zones represented static anoxic static oxic and alternating anoxic oxic zones repectively the intertidal zone underwent a 6 10 h anoxic stage oxygen content 20 μm and a 2 6 h oxic stage oxygen content 130 μm in every tidal cycle physical and chemical characteristics such as total carbon nitrogen and fe concentrations and particle size distributions were measured for sediment samples from each zone kroetsch and wang 2008 yang et al 2012 pan et al 2017 and the results are summarized in table s1 a film sheet of ps mps was prepared according to yang et al 2015 to avoid introducing unknown properties of commercial ps mp sheets three grams of ps particles 1 20 mm in diameter purchased from king pearl co tianjin china were dissolved in 100 ml of xylene to produce a concentration of 0 03 g ml the solution was then spread on a glass plate and a ps mp sheet 0 02 mm in thickness and 90 mm in diameter was formed after 6 h sheets were rinsed with methanol and deionized water dried at room temperature and then cut in to 5 mm 5 mm square mp film sheets approximately 100 mg of ps mp sheets were packed into each 40 mesh nylon filter bag 5 cm 5 cm each nylon bag was buried approximately 1 cm deep beneath the surface of sediments each zone had 9 12 bags of ps mps distributed in different sites 2 2 characterization of ps mps after 2 months the residual ps mps were immersed in a 2 solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant macklin shanghai china for 4 h to remove microbes and other impurities from the ps mp surface the ps mps were rinsed with deionized water in the wash bottle for 5 min and dried at room temperature then the physicochemical properties of ps mps were analyzed weight losses for the sheets in each bag were measured by an analytical balance and molecular weight shifts were determined with gel permeation chromatography gpc lc20 shimadzu kyoto japan with 0 1 mol l nano3 including 0 06 nan3 as mobile eluent and a flow

surface hydrophobicity of ps mps a 5 0 μl droplet of ultrapure water was deposited onto the preflattened ps mps and a digital image of the water droplet was taken when the droplet reached a steady state on the substrate six measurements were carried out at different locations on each polymer for averaging changes in the morphologies of ps mp surfaces were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem su8020 hitachi tokyo japan data were analyzed using spss statistical software version 21 0 2 3 sediment column setup and operation to study the mechanisms of different aging behaviors under different anoxic oxic conditions river sediments surface 0 8 cm were collected from the intertidal zones of the in situ experiments and used to prepare all sediment columns thus the initial conditions of all columns were similar and we focused on anoxic oxic conditions as the sole variable the column setup is illustrated in figure s1 each cylindrical column 9 cm inner diameter 50 cm height was filled to a height of 10 cm with sediments one of the nylon bags described above was horizontally buried 1 cm deep beneath the surface of the sediment in each column control experiments with sterile silica sands particle size 0 8 1 2 mm used instead of natural sediment were constructed in sterile cylindrical columns to investigate whether physical abrasion by sediment particles caused mechanical degradation of ps mps the placement of ps mp sheets and the flooding conditions used in these controls were similar to those of column experiments with sediment three different flooding conditions were set as follows 1 anoxic conditions in which a 39 cm high water column was layered over the sediment and the oxygen content in the sediment was 0 μm 2 oxic conditions in which no water column overlayed the sediment and the oxygen content in the sediment was 180 μm and 3 anoxic oxic conditions in which anoxic and oxic conditions were used with alternating cycling period of 6 h and the oxygen contents ranged from 0 to 130 μm for each flooding condition three sediment columns and three sterile silica sand columns were prepared i e a total of nine sediment columns and nine sterile silica sand columns and all columns were placed indoors at room temperature for 2 months from july 6th to september 5th 2020 during these two months the maximum minimum and average temperatures were 35 19 and 28 c respectively the relative humidities were 40 50 and the columns were illuminated with an intensity of 150 μw cm2 and cycles of 12 h light and 12 h dark water overlaying the sediment was taken from minjiang river and bubbled with nitrogen until the oxygen content was 0 μm every time before it was filled into the column the chemical characteristics of the water were measured following chen et al 2020 and are summarized in table s2 oxygen contents were measured with an oxygen microsensor ox n unisense a s aarhus denmark 2 4 pure culture experiments shewanella oneidensis strain mr 1 is a typical dissimilatory iron reducing bacterium that is facultative anaerobic and abundant in the alternating anoxic oxic areas and it generates oh under these alternating conditions sekar and dichristina 2014 thus it was used to set up a pure culture experiment to investigate dark production of oh and its effects on ps mp aging s oneidensis mr 1 of an early stationary phase was collected by centrifugation at 6000 g washed three times with 0 9 nacl and then resuspended in lactate supplemented solution table s3 with a final cell density of 1 109 cell ml in the 500 ml serum bottle there were 100 mg of ps mp sheets in each bottle atmospheric conditions alternated between anaerobic and aerobic every 6 h anaerobic conditions were produced by continuous sparging with nitrogen gas while aerobic conditions were maintained by sparging with air mckinzi and dichristina 1999 a control group with a 120 mm concentration of the radical scavenging compound mannitol was also set up sodium lactate 10 mm was added to each bottle every two days three parallel bottles were set up for each condition and the whole pure culture experiment ran at 25 c in a calorstat system lrh 250f yiheng shanghai china 2 5 microbial community analysis after 2 month operation of the sediment column experiment the total dna of microbial communities in the sediments within 0 5 cm of the nylon filter bag and on the surface of ps mps was extracted using the power soil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad usa and assessed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer li et al 2019 universal primers 515f 5ʹ gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3ʹ and 909r 5ʹ ccccgycaattcmtttragt 3ʹ were used to amplify the v4 v5 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene and its1

final extension at 72 c for 10 min the pcr products were purified using an agencourt ampure xp kit bacterial sequencing data were processed according to edgar 2013 with the ribosomal database project rdp classifier and the fungal sequencing data were processed with the unite database the dissimilarity test nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis similarity distance matrices were performed by the vegan package in r 3 1 3 anova tukey s multiple comparisons 2 6 sediment oxygenation and fenton product detection since the overlying water in column experiments was changed with changes in anoxic and oxic conditions in the anoxic oxic group and there was no water in the oxic group it was impossible to add sodium benzoate directly into the column to measure cumulative oh concentrations thus we evaluated the concentration of oh production potential instead to obtain the oh production potential 5 g of sediment located within 1 cm beneath the surface of the sediment in each column were removed at 0 6 12 18 and 24 h mixed with 30 ml of 10 mm sodium benzoate in an uncapping bottle exposed to air and shaken at 100 rpm in the dark for 6 h to allow sediment oxygenation tong et al 2016 after 6 h the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min and 2 ml of the supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane then the oh concentration was quantified by measuring the p hydroxybenzoic acid p bha content with ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc ultimate 3000 thermo frankfurt germany with a c18 column 4 6 250 mm and a detection wavelength of 255 nm the mobile phase and the calculations used were those described by liao et al 2019 to measure fe ii concentrations in sediments of column experiments 1 g of sediment was mixed with 10 ml of 0 5 mol l hcl and shaken at 100 rpm for 6 h after centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min the supernatant was tested using the ferrozine assay lovley and phillips 1988 in the pure culture experiment 15 mm sodium benzoate was added into each bottle to trap oh radicals through formation of p bha which was measured by uhplc as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 aging properties of ps mps in sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions weight losses of ps mps were used to identify degradation efficiency under different anoxic oxic conditions generally the degradation of ps is known to be very slow in natural ecosystems for example the weight loss of ps caused by biodegradation under different microbial consortia ranged from 0 005 to 1 5 within 2 months yang et al 2015 however fig 1 a and 1b show that ps mps displayed 4 6 0 13 and 3 4 0 7 weight losses under alternating anoxic oxic conditions during a 2 month treatment period in in situ sediment and in sediment columns respectively and these values were 1 7 to 6 8 times those seen under static anoxic and static oxic conditions the o c ratio is a parameter used for quantitative determination of the degree of surface aging for mps liu et al 2019 increases in the o c ratios under anoxic oxic conditions were 0 10 0 03 and 0 11 0 01 in in situ sediments and sediment columns respectively which were remarkably higher than those measured under static oxic or static anoxic conditions fig 1a and b this degree of aging seen over 2 months with alternating anoxic oxic sediment conditions was comparable to that seen for ps mps irradiated by sunlight in an aquatic environment over 150 days zhu et al 2020 but the ps mps in that study might have contained additives that delayed plastic degradation liu et al 2020b after 2 months of treatment the molecular weights of the ps mps were determined using gpc m n is the number average molecular weight and m w is the weight average molecular weight fig 1c and d show that m n values for ps mps subjected to anoxic oxic conditions dropped by 13 and 21 in the in situ and the column experiments respectively and m w values under anoxic oxic conditions dropped by 13 and 10 in the in situ and the column experiments respectively decreases in the molecular weights of the original ps mps were 2 10 and 7 15 under anoxic conditions and oxic conditions respectively the gpc peaks of ps mps subjected to anoxic oxic conditions displayed the highest retention times and lowest refractive indices ri among the 3 experimental groups figure s2 demonstrating that alternating anoxic oxic conditions led to more depolymerization of long chain structures and generated more low molecular weight fragments than static anoxic or static oxic conditions zhu et al 2019 the surface hydrophobicities of ps mps were analyzed by determining water contact angles wcas fig 2 a and b reveal that the wca values of ps mps treated under anoxic oxic conditions were the smallest of those measured i e the hydrophobicity decreased the most among those for the 3 experiment groups sem images fig 2c and d showed obvious surface deterioration comprising pits and cavities on the surface of ps mps subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions and static oxic conditions changes in the surface chemical compositions and functional groups of ps mps were characterized by xps as shown in figure s3a and s3b the signal for oxygen at 532 3 ev increased significantly for the alternating anoxic oxic group while it increased only slightly for the anoxic and oxic groups fitting of the c 1 s spectrum indicated the presence of a peak at 286 5 ev for the alternating anoxic oxic group and the static anoxic group in in situ experiments fig 2e which was assigned to c o yang et al 2015 this c o peak was also present in spectra of alternating anoxic oxic and static oxic samples from the column experiments fig 2f the small amounts of oxygen atoms 3 74 5 60 fig 1a and b and oxygen containing groups fig 2e and 2f present in the original ps mps suggested that the surfaces of ps mps had been partially oxidized during polymer processing mechanical crushing or storage yousif et al 2012 in the o 1 s spectra of ps mps figure s4 peaks assigned to oxygen containing groups c o c o and c o oh had higher intensities under anoxic oxic and oxic conditions than under anoxic conditions the c 1 s and o 1 s results indicated that carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl groups were generated under both alternating anoxic oxic and static oxic conditions together these multiple lines of evidence revealed that ps mps subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions in sediments displayed the highest degree of aging 3 2 are mechanical and microbial degradations responsible for the highest degree of ps mp aging in alternating anoxic oxic sediments in our experiments different anoxic oxic conditions of sediments were most likely to lead to degradation of ps mps via different mechanical chemical and microbial processes to investigate whether physical abrasion by sediment particles caused mechanical degradation of microplastics in the alternating anoxic oxic group sun et al 2020b sterile silica sands were used instead of sediment to fill sterile cylindrical columns the locations of ps mp sheets and the flooding conditions were similar to those of the experiments performed with sediment after a 2 month operation levels of dry weight losses and o c ratios showed no significant differences among the three different flooding conditions figure s5 which excluded the possibility that the alternating anoxic oxic system resulted in more mechanical degradation at least in the column experiments to determine whether microorganisms played an important role in the different aging degrees displayed under different anoxic and oxic conditions microbial communities in the sediment located within 0 5 cm of the nylon filter bag and on the surfaces of ps mps were analyzed shannon wiener diversity is an index emphasizing the richness component to determine the species biodiversity of a community spellerberg and fedor 2003 figure s6a shows that sediments in the anoxic oxic group displayed a shannon wiener diversity similar to that of the oxic group and the ps mp surfaces from the anoxic oxic group displayed a shannon wiener diversity similar to that of the anoxic group the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds results figure s6b revealed that the bacterial communities in sediments and on the surfaces of ps mps shifted towards different succession directions nmds2 0 in the sediment v s nmds2 0 on the ps mp surfaces the bray curtis distance is an index used to show dissimilarities between two groups i e a longer distance means greater dissimilarity ricotta and podani 2017 the bray curtis distance between the alternating anoxic oxic group and the anoxic group was shorter than the bray curtis distance between the alternating anoxic oxic group and the oxic group regardless of whether the groups were sampled from the sediment or from the surfaces of ps mps table s4 the operational taxonomic unit otu is the cluster of similar sequence variants of the 16s rdna marker gene sequence venn diagrams figure s7 which evaluate the differences and similarities among samples showed that the alternating anoxic oxic group shared more otus with the anoxic group than with the oxic group indicating that both the bacterial and fungal communities of the alternating anoxic oxic group were more similar to those of the anoxic group the heatmap depicting the percentages of the top 50 dominant genera found in each group is plotted in fig 3 a some bacteria belonging to amycolatopsis sp pseudomonas sp ideonella sp and rhodococcus sp have been shown to effect polymeric degradation jarerat et al 2002 yoshida et al 2016 auta et al 2018 giacomucci et al 2019 in particular pseudomonas aeruginosa had been shown to degrade 26 mg of ps mps within 15 days kim et al 2020 fig 3b illustrates the relative abundances of all fungal genera that can utilize plastics as their carbon source for growth ru et al 2020 however these plastic degrading genera did not display higher abundances in the anoxic oxic group than in the other groups even though the anoxic oxic group showed the highest extent of ps mp aging suggesting that direct microbial degradation might not be the reason for enhanced ps aging in the anoxic oxic group 3 3 oh production from alternating anoxic oxic sediments chemical degradation might be critical for the enhanced ps mp degradation seen in the alternating anoxic oxic sediments and reactive oxygen species that can form during natural processes and interact with other environmental stressors to cause chemical oxidation are the most important reactants for mps sun et al 2020b different flooding conditions lead to different redox dynamic environments and redox dynamic sediments rich in iron might induce oh generation fe ii and h2o2 would be produced under anoxic and oxic conditions respectively by both abiotic and biotic pathways and fe ii reacts with h2o2 to produce oh tong et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 this oh generation could remove pollutants such as trichloroethylene and phenol liu et al 2017 cheng et al 2020 xie et al 2020 fig 3a shows that geobacter sp a typical dissimilarity fe reducing genus exhibited the highest abundance on the surface of ps mps in the anoxic oxic group thus we specifically analyzed fe reducing and fe oxidizing bacteria according to weber et al 2006 and pan et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 the abundances of fe reducing and fe oxidizing bacteria on the surface of ps mps were significantly higher than those in sediments under all flooding conditions among which the anoxic oxic group showed the highest abundances both in sediments and on ps mps suggesting that an iron redox reaction might take place in the anoxic oxic group fe cycling in sediments is a main factor of the dark production of oh han et al 2020 hence we speculated that there might be oh production that influenced ps aging in the anoxic oxic group to test the above proposal first levels of oh produced after oxygenation of sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions were detected with p bha and uhplc fig 5 a shows that oh produced by microorganisms accounted for 38 5 of the total oh generated in a 6 h oxygenation of anoxic sediment see 6 h and 18 h which were time points for the end of the anoxic stage and remaining oh production might be attributed to abiotic reactions in the biotic pathway microorganisms might play a role in both the reduction of fe iii and the production of superoxide o2 and both fe ii and o2 are key intermediates in oh production han et al 2020 linear regression was applied to assess whether fe ii production was related to oh production in either the column or in situ experiments fig 5b shows fe ii concentrations and fig 5c shows oh production through sediment oxygenation under different anoxic oxic conditions in the sediment column fig 5d indicates the possible contributions of sediment fe ii content to oh production r2 0 5678 the above results demonstrated that the anoxic oxic group did support generation of oh while the other two groups did not and the level of oh generation was positively correlated with the content of fe ii in sediments microorganisms also played a part in this oh production 3 4 oh production for enhanced ps mp aging previous studies involved the use of 2 propanol to scavenge oh and determine whether oh played a role in pollutant degradation cheng et al 2020 liu et al 2020c most of these pollutants can be rapidly removed within times ranging from 30 min to 10 h however aging of mps in the natural environment is quite slow for example based on our experiments ps mps should take 2 months to achieve 3 weight loss thus the changes occurring in a short period are hard to characterize zhou et al 2020 during such a long time period the scavenger would influence the microbial communities so that the oh scavenger group could not serve as a strict control to confirm the effects of oh on ps mps making research on the aging behaviors of mps a major challenge thus we set up a pure culture experiment to solve this problem fig 6 a shows that cumulative oh production in the pure culture experiment was approximately 100 µmol within 14 days and approximately 94 of oh was scavenged by mannitol in the control group ps mps in the culture subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions displayed 4 8 0 5 weight loss within 14 days but only 0 5 0 1 weight loss was observed in the presence of the oh scavenger over the same period fig 6b the o c ratios of ps mps were 0 52 0 08 and 0 11 0 03 without and with oh scavenger added respectively fig 6b fig 6c reveals that the wca values of ps mps treated without the addition of oh scavenger were significantly smaller than those observed with oh scavenger the surfaces of samples treated without added oh scavenger had more pits and cavities than those treated in the presence of oh scavenger fig 6d the m n and m w values of ps mp aged without the oh scavenger dropped by 14 and 5 respectively while those aged with the oh scavenger present dropped by only 2 and 0 5 respectively fig 6e all the above data from pure culture experiments demonstrated that oh production in the anoxic oxic sediment could be a factor in the enhanced aging of ps mps 3 5 environmental implications the above results will enhance our capabilities for risk assessment and management of mps in the natural environment especially in areas such as intertidal zones and paddy fields with alternating anoxic oxic conditions since the aging of mps influence their mobility bioavailability adsorption by contaminants and their release of additives botterell et al 2019 luo et al 2020 liu et al 2020b for example when the o c ratio of ps mps rose from 0 044 to 0 322 increases in the capacities of ps mps for absorption of heavy metals including cu pb cd ni and zn ranged from 40 to 170 due to increased surface polarities and charges of ps mps mao et al 2020 when the o c ratio rose from 0 01 to 0 05 the capacity of ps mps for adsorption of hydrophilic amlodipine increased over 2 times while that for hydrophobic atorvastatin decreased by almost 50 liu et al 2020a in addition these findings suggest that we can engineer optimal degradation of mps by exploring different anoxic oxic conditions for instance sewage sludge containing a large amount of iron is a significant source and sink of mps the froth flotation technique and the flocculation technique which are base on the hydrophilic hydrophobic characteristics of particles are usually used to remove mps from sludge sol et al 2020 in this study we have learned that the degree of mp aging which influences hydrophobicity can be regulated easily by adjusting the anoxic oxic conditions in some environments rich in iron therefore this work could also serve as a starting point for mp management by engineering processes for removal of mps 4 conclusions this work expands our knowledge of mp aging in dark sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions whereas most previous studies were focused on photoaging our results showed that ps mps in sediments subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions displayed the highest aging degree but those subjected to oxic conditions did not in in situ experiments both the weight losses and o c ratios of ps mps under alternating anoxic oxic conditions were 2 times higher than those of ps mps under static oxic or static anoxic conditions during 2 month experiments in a 2 month column experiment the ps mps in the alternating anoxic oxic group showed weight losses and o c ratios that were respectively triple and double the corresponding values for the static oxic and static anoxic groups oxygenation experiments showed that the anoxic oxic conditions led to generation of oh and the pure culture experiment demonstrated that the oh produced in sediments subjected to anoxic oxic conditions could be involved in enhancement of ps mp aging these findings demonstrated that the dark production of oh could be an important cause of enhanced ps mp aging in sediments during alternating anoxic oxic periods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16481,aging of microplastics mps i e degradation and weathering is ubiquitous in the environment the mp aging process is thought to be limited to light and static areas while aging in dark and fluctuating anoxic oxic areas is poorly understood here we provide initial evidence for aging of polystyrene microplastics ps mps under different anoxic oxic conditions in sediments and we further explored these mechanisms using sediment column experiments and pure culture experiments the results showed that ps mps in alternating anoxic oxic sediments displayed the highest degree of aging in the in situ experiment both the weight losses and o c ratios of ps mps aged under alternating anoxic oxic conditions were 2 times higher than those aged under static oxic and static anoxic conditions during 2 month experiments in a 2 month column experiment the ps mps in the alternating anoxic oxic group showed weight losses and o c ratios that were respectively triple and double the corresponding values for the static oxic and static anoxic groups column and pure culture experiments demonstrated that dark production of oh which showed a positive correlation with a fe redox process could explain enhanced mp aging under the alternating anoxic oxic conditions these findings provide a basis for risk assessment and management of mps in the natural environment such as in intertidal zones and paddy fields and also have implications for engineering of optimized mp degradation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic aging degree alternating anoxic oxic

of biofilms on surfaces luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 aging has been shown to increase the sorption capacities of mps for heavy metals hydrophilic organic pollutants and biofilms and to decrease those for hydrophobic organic pollutants such as 9 nitroanthracene in addition aging processes potentially affect mp ingestion by aquatic organisms due to changes in mp sizes colors and surface charges liu et al 2020b however most current studies investigating mp aging have been focused on photoaging in exposed areas halle et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 research on mp aging in dark or enclosed environments such as in sediments and in the soil is still scarce zhang et al 2021 especially for sediments subjected to different flooding conditions that would produce different anoxic oxic environments mp aging can be caused by heat thermal degradation light photodegradation ionizing radiation radiative degradation mechanical degradation chemical degradation and organism biodegradation yousif and haddad 2013 quecholac piña et al 2020 mechanical degradation chemical degradation and biodegradation might occur in sediments and soil and exhibit various effects under different anoxic oxic conditions for example anoxic oxic conditions produce different microbial communities that might affect the biodegradation of mps and free radicals generated in microbially driven fenton reactions in an alternating anoxic oxic environment might result in different chemical degradation pathways deangelis et al 2010 broman et al 2017 jia et al 2017 thus we hypothesized that mps might show significantly different aging behaviors in sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions polystyrene ps is one of the most widely used plastics and millions of tons are produced annually lang et al 2020 it was employed here to study the aging of polystyrene microplastics ps mps with both the in situ sediment experiments and sediment column experiments under different anoxic oxic conditions weight losses molecular weight shifts surface chemistries and hydrophobicities of ps mps were used to study aging under different conditions the compositions of microbial communities and the production of hydroxyl radical oh were analyzed and a pure culture experiment was conducted to determine which factors influence degradation and play major roles in the aging of ps mps in sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ experiments a site on the minjiang river 26 1ʹ47ʺ n 119 14ʹ23ʺ w fuzhou china which is a semidiurnal tidal river was selected for in situ experiments conducted over 2 months from february 12th to april 17th 2021 during this period the maximum minimum and average temperatures were 34 13 and 22 c respectively and the total rainfall was approximately 200 mm the river beach and intertidal zones represented static anoxic static oxic and alternating anoxic oxic zones repectively the intertidal zone underwent a 6 10 h anoxic stage oxygen content 20 μm and a 2 6 h oxic stage oxygen content 130 μm in every tidal cycle physical and chemical characteristics such as total carbon nitrogen and fe concentrations and particle size distributions were measured for sediment samples from each zone kroetsch and wang 2008 yang et al 2012 pan et al 2017 and the results are summarized in table s1 a film sheet of ps mps was prepared according to yang et al 2015 to avoid introducing unknown properties of commercial ps mp sheets three grams of ps particles 1 20 mm in diameter purchased from king pearl co tianjin china were dissolved in 100 ml of xylene to produce a concentration of 0 03 g ml the solution was then spread on a glass plate and a ps mp sheet 0 02 mm in thickness and 90 mm in diameter was formed after 6 h sheets were rinsed with methanol and deionized water dried at room temperature and then cut in to 5 mm 5 mm square mp film sheets approximately 100 mg of ps mp sheets were packed into each 40 mesh nylon filter bag 5 cm 5 cm each nylon bag was buried approximately 1 cm deep beneath the surface of sediments each zone had 9 12 bags of ps mps distributed in different sites 2 2 characterization of ps mps after 2 months the residual ps mps were immersed in a 2 solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant macklin shanghai china for 4 h to remove microbes and other impurities from the ps mp surface the ps mps were rinsed with deionized water in the wash bottle for 5 min and dried at room temperature then the physicochemical properties of ps mps were analyzed weight losses for the sheets in each bag were measured by an analytical balance and molecular weight shifts were determined with gel permeation chromatography gpc lc20 shimadzu kyoto japan with 0 1 mol l nano3 including 0 06 nan3 as mobile eluent and a flow

peak fitting program xpspeak version 4 1 chen et al 2019 water contact angles wcas were measured using an optical contact angle measuring system oca50 dataphysics filderstadt germany to determine the surface hydrophobicity of ps mps a 5 0 μl droplet of ultrapure water was deposited onto the preflattened ps mps and a digital image of the water droplet was taken when the droplet reached a steady state on the substrate six measurements were carried out at different locations on each polymer for averaging changes in the morphologies of ps mp surfaces were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem su8020 hitachi tokyo japan data were analyzed using spss statistical software version 21 0 2 3 sediment column setup and operation to study the mechanisms of different aging behaviors under different anoxic oxic conditions river sediments surface 0 8 cm were collected from the intertidal zones of the in situ experiments and used to prepare all sediment columns thus the initial conditions of all columns were similar and we focused on anoxic oxic conditions as the sole variable the column setup is illustrated in figure s1 each cylindrical column 9 cm inner diameter 50 cm height was filled to a height of 10 cm with sediments one of the nylon bags described above was horizontally buried 1 cm deep beneath the surface of the sediment in each column control experiments with sterile silica sands particle size 0 8 1 2 mm used instead of natural sediment were constructed in sterile cylindrical columns to investigate whether physical abrasion by sediment particles caused mechanical degradation of ps mps the placement of ps mp sheets and the flooding conditions used in these controls were similar to those of column experiments with sediment three different flooding conditions were set as follows 1 anoxic conditions in which a 39 cm high water column was layered over the sediment and the oxygen content in the sediment was 0 μm 2 oxic conditions in which no water column overlayed the sediment and the oxygen content in the sediment was 180 μm and 3 anoxic oxic conditions in which anoxic and oxic conditions were used with alternating cycling period of 6 h and the oxygen contents ranged from 0 to 130 μm for each flooding condition three sediment columns and three sterile silica sand columns were prepared i e a total of nine sediment columns and nine sterile silica sand columns and all columns were placed indoors at room temperature for 2 months from july 6th to september 5th 2020 during these two months the maximum minimum and average temperatures were 35 19 and 28 c respectively the relative humidities were 40 50 and the columns were illuminated with an intensity of 150 μw cm2 and cycles of 12 h light and 12 h dark water overlaying the sediment was taken from minjiang river and bubbled with nitrogen until the oxygen content was 0 μm every time before it was filled into the column the chemical characteristics of the water were measured following chen et al 2020 and are summarized in table s2 oxygen contents were measured with an oxygen microsensor ox n unisense a s aarhus denmark 2 4 pure culture experiments shewanella oneidensis strain mr 1 is a typical dissimilatory iron reducing bacterium that is facultative anaerobic and abundant in the alternating anoxic oxic areas and it generates oh under these alternating conditions sekar and dichristina 2014 thus it was used to set up a pure culture experiment to investigate dark production of oh and its effects on ps mp aging s oneidensis mr 1 of an early stationary phase was collected by centrifugation at 6000 g washed three times with 0 9 nacl and then resuspended in lactate supplemented solution table s3 with a final cell density of 1 109 cell ml in the 500 ml serum bottle there were 100 mg of ps mp sheets in each bottle atmospheric conditions alternated between anaerobic and aerobic every 6 h anaerobic conditions were produced by continuous sparging with nitrogen gas while aerobic conditions were maintained by sparging with air mckinzi and dichristina 1999 a control group with a 120 mm concentration of the radical scavenging compound mannitol was also set up sodium lactate 10 mm was added to each bottle every two days three parallel bottles were set up for each condition and the whole pure culture experiment ran at 25 c in a calorstat system lrh 250f yiheng shanghai china 2 5 microbial community analysis after 2 month operation of the sediment column experiment the total dna of microbial communities in the sediments within 0 5 cm of the nylon filter bag and on the surface of ps mps was extracted using the power soil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad usa and assessed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer li et al 2019 universal primers 515f 5ʹ gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3ʹ and 909r 5ʹ ccccgycaattcmtttragt 3ʹ were used to amplify the v4 v5 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene and its1

final extension at 72 c for 10 min the pcr products were purified using an agencourt ampure xp kit bacterial sequencing data were processed according to edgar 2013 with the ribosomal database project rdp classifier and the fungal sequencing data were processed with the unite database the dissimilarity test nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis similarity distance matrices were performed by the vegan package in r 3 1 3 anova tukey s multiple comparisons 2 6 sediment oxygenation and fenton product detection since the overlying water in column experiments was changed with changes in anoxic and oxic conditions in the anoxic oxic group and there was no water in the oxic group it was impossible to add sodium benzoate directly into the column to measure cumulative oh concentrations thus we evaluated the concentration of oh production potential instead to obtain the oh production potential 5 g of sediment located within 1 cm beneath the surface of the sediment in each column were removed at 0 6 12 18 and 24 h mixed with 30 ml of 10 mm sodium benzoate in an uncapping bottle exposed to air and shaken at 100 rpm in the dark for 6 h to allow sediment oxygenation tong et al 2016 after 6 h the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min and 2 ml of the supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane then the oh concentration was quantified by measuring the p hydroxybenzoic acid p bha content with ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc ultimate 3000 thermo frankfurt germany with a c18 column 4 6 250 mm and a detection wavelength of 255 nm the mobile phase and the calculations used were those described by liao et al 2019 to measure fe ii concentrations in sediments of column experiments 1 g of sediment was mixed with 10 ml of 0 5 mol l hcl and shaken at 100 rpm for 6 h after centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min the supernatant was tested using the ferrozine assay lovley and phillips 1988 in the pure culture experiment 15 mm sodium benzoate was added into each bottle to trap oh radicals through formation of p bha which was measured by uhplc as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 aging properties of ps mps in sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions weight losses of ps mps were used to identify degradation efficiency under different anoxic oxic conditions generally the degradation of ps is known to be very slow in natural ecosystems for example the weight loss of ps caused by biodegradation under different microbial consortia ranged from 0 005 to 1 5 within 2 months yang et al 2015 however fig 1 a and 1b show that ps mps displayed 4 6 0 13 and 3 4 0 7 weight losses under alternating anoxic oxic conditions during a 2 month treatment period in in situ sediment and in sediment columns respectively and these values were 1 7 to 6 8 times those seen under static anoxic and static oxic conditions the o c ratio is a parameter used for quantitative determination of the degree of surface aging for mps liu et al 2019 increases in the o c ratios under anoxic oxic conditions were 0 10 0 03 and 0 11 0 01 in in situ sediments and sediment columns respectively which were remarkably higher than those measured under static oxic or static anoxic conditions fig 1a and b this degree of aging seen over 2 months with alternating anoxic oxic sediment conditions was comparable to that seen for ps mps irradiated by sunlight in an aquatic environment over 150 days zhu et al 2020 but the ps mps in that study might have contained additives that delayed plastic degradation liu et al 2020b after 2 months of treatment the molecular weights of the ps mps were determined using gpc m n is the number average molecular weight and m w is the weight average molecular weight fig 1c and d show that m n values for ps mps subjected to anoxic oxic conditions dropped by 13 and 21 in the in situ and the column experiments respectively and m w values under anoxic oxic conditions dropped by 13 and 10 in the in situ and the column experiments respectively decreases in the molecular weights of the original ps mps were 2 10 and 7 15 under anoxic conditions and oxic conditions respectively the gpc peaks of ps mps subjected to anoxic oxic conditions displayed the highest retention times and lowest refractive indices ri among the 3 experimental groups figure s2 demonstrating that alternating anoxic oxic conditions led to more depolymerization of long chain structures and generated more low molecular weight fragments than static anoxic or static oxic conditions zhu et al 2019 the surface hydrophobicities of ps mps were analyzed by determining water contact angles wcas fig 2 a and b reveal that the wca values of ps mps treated under anoxic oxic conditions were the smallest of those measured i e the hydrophobicity decreased the most among those for the 3 experiment groups sem images fig 2c and d showed obvious surface deterioration comprising pits and cavities on the surface of ps mps subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions and static oxic conditions changes in the surface chemical compositions and functional groups of ps mps were characterized by xps as shown in figure s3a and s3b the signal for oxygen at 532 3 ev increased significantly for the alternating anoxic oxic group while it increased only slightly for the anoxic and oxic groups fitting of the c 1 s spectrum indicated the presence of a peak at 286 5 ev for the alternating anoxic oxic group and the static anoxic group in in situ experiments fig 2e which was assigned to c o yang et al 2015 this c o peak was also present in spectra of alternating anoxic oxic and static oxic samples from the column experiments fig 2f the small amounts of oxygen atoms 3 74 5 60 fig 1a and b and oxygen containing groups fig 2e and 2f present in the original ps mps suggested that the surfaces of ps mps had been partially oxidized during polymer processing mechanical crushing or storage yousif et al 2012 in the o 1 s spectra of ps mps figure s4 peaks assigned to oxygen containing groups c o c o and c o oh had higher intensities under anoxic oxic and oxic conditions than under anoxic conditions the c 1 s and o 1 s results indicated that carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl groups were generated under both alternating anoxic oxic and static oxic conditions together these multiple lines of evidence revealed that ps mps subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions in sediments displayed the highest degree of aging 3 2 are mechanical and microbial degradations responsible for the highest degree of ps mp aging in alternating anoxic oxic sediments in our experiments different anoxic oxic conditions of sediments were most likely to lead to degradation of ps mps via different mechanical chemical and microbial processes to investigate whether physical abrasion by sediment particles caused mechanical degradation of microplastics in the alternating anoxic oxic group sun et al 2020b sterile silica sands were used instead of sediment to fill sterile cylindrical columns the locations of ps mp sheets and the flooding conditions were similar to those of the experiments performed with sediment after a 2 month operation levels of dry weight losses and o c ratios showed no significant differences among the three different flooding conditions figure s5 which excluded the possibility that the alternating anoxic oxic system resulted in more mechanical degradation at least in the column experiments to determine whether microorganisms played an important role in the different aging degrees displayed under different anoxic and oxic conditions microbial communities in the sediment located within 0 5 cm of the nylon filter bag and on the surfaces of ps mps were analyzed shannon wiener diversity is an index emphasizing the richness component to determine the species biodiversity of a community spellerberg and fedor 2003 figure s6a shows that sediments in the anoxic oxic group displayed a shannon wiener diversity similar to that of the oxic group and the ps mp surfaces from the anoxic oxic group displayed a shannon wiener diversity similar to that of the anoxic group the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds results figure s6b revealed that the bacterial communities in sediments and on the surfaces of ps mps shifted towards different succession directions nmds2 0 in the sediment v s nmds2 0 on the ps mp surfaces the bray curtis distance is an index used to show dissimilarities between two groups i e a longer distance means greater dissimilarity ricotta and podani 2017 the bray curtis distance between the alternating anoxic oxic group and the anoxic group was shorter than the bray curtis distance between the alternating anoxic oxic group and the oxic group regardless of whether the groups were sampled from the sediment or from the surfaces of ps mps table s4 the operational taxonomic unit otu is the cluster of similar sequence variants of the 16s rdna marker gene sequence venn diagrams figure s7 which evaluate the differences and similarities among samples showed that the alternating anoxic oxic group shared more otus with the anoxic group than with the oxic group indicating that both the bacterial and fungal communities of the alternating anoxic oxic group were more similar to those of the anoxic group the heatmap depicting the percentages of the top 50 dominant genera found in each group is plotted in fig 3 a some bacteria belonging to amycolatopsis sp pseudomonas sp ideonella sp and rhodococcus sp have been shown to effect polymeric degradation jarerat et al 2002 yoshida et al 2016 auta et al 2018 giacomucci et al 2019 in particular pseudomonas aeruginosa had been shown to degrade 26 mg of ps mps within 15 days kim et al 2020 fig 3b illustrates the relative abundances of all fungal genera that can utilize plastics as their carbon source for growth ru et al 2020 however these plastic degrading genera did not display higher abundances in the anoxic oxic group than in the other groups even though the anoxic oxic group showed the highest extent of ps mp aging suggesting that direct microbial degradation might not be the reason for enhanced ps aging in the anoxic oxic group 3 3 oh production from alternating anoxic oxic sediments chemical degradation might be critical for the enhanced ps mp degradation seen in the alternating anoxic oxic sediments and reactive oxygen species that can form during natural processes and interact with other environmental stressors to cause chemical oxidation are the most important reactants for mps sun et al 2020b different flooding conditions lead to different redox dynamic environments and redox dynamic sediments rich in iron might induce oh generation fe ii and h2o2 would be produced under anoxic and oxic conditions respectively by both abiotic and biotic pathways and fe ii reacts with h2o2 to produce oh tong et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 this oh generation could remove pollutants such as trichloroethylene and phenol liu et al 2017 cheng et al 2020 xie et al 2020 fig 3a shows that geobacter sp a typical dissimilarity fe reducing genus exhibited the highest abundance on the surface of ps mps in the anoxic oxic group thus we specifically analyzed fe reducing and fe oxidizing bacteria according to weber et al 2006 and pan et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 the abundances of fe reducing and fe oxidizing bacteria on the surface of ps mps were significantly higher than those in sediments under all flooding conditions among which the anoxic oxic group showed the highest abundances both in sediments and on ps mps suggesting that an iron redox reaction might take place in the anoxic oxic group fe cycling in sediments is a main factor of the dark production of oh han et al 2020 hence we speculated that there might be oh production that influenced ps aging in the anoxic oxic group to test the above proposal first levels of oh produced after oxygenation of sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions were detected with p bha and uhplc fig 5 a shows that oh produced by microorganisms accounted for 38 5 of the total oh generated in a 6 h oxygenation of anoxic sediment see 6 h and 18 h which were time points for the end of the anoxic stage and remaining oh production might be attributed to abiotic reactions in the biotic pathway microorganisms might play a role in both the reduction of fe iii and the production of superoxide o2 and both fe ii and o2 are key intermediates in oh production han et al 2020 linear regression was applied to assess whether fe ii production was related to oh production in either the column or in situ experiments fig 5b shows fe ii concentrations and fig 5c shows oh production through sediment oxygenation under different anoxic oxic conditions in the sediment column fig 5d indicates the possible contributions of sediment fe ii content to oh production r2 0 5678 the above results demonstrated that the anoxic oxic group did support generation of oh while the other two groups did not and the level of oh generation was positively correlated with the content of fe ii in sediments microorganisms also played a part in this oh production 3 4 oh production for enhanced ps mp aging previous studies involved the use of 2 propanol to scavenge oh and determine whether oh played a role in pollutant degradation cheng et al 2020 liu et al 2020c most of these pollutants can be rapidly removed within times ranging from 30 min to 10 h however aging of mps in the natural environment is quite slow for example based on our experiments ps mps should take 2 months to achieve 3 weight loss thus the changes occurring in a short period are hard to characterize zhou et al 2020 during such a long time period the scavenger would influence the microbial communities so that the oh scavenger group could not serve as a strict control to confirm the effects of oh on ps mps making research on the aging behaviors of mps a major challenge thus we set up a pure culture experiment to solve this problem fig 6 a shows that cumulative oh production in the pure culture experiment was approximately 100 µmol within 14 days and approximately 94 of oh was scavenged by mannitol in the control group ps mps in the culture subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions displayed 4 8 0 5 weight loss within 14 days but only 0 5 0 1 weight loss was observed in the presence of the oh scavenger over the same period fig 6b the o c ratios of ps mps were 0 52 0 08 and 0 11 0 03 without and with oh scavenger added respectively fig 6b fig 6c reveals that the wca values of ps mps treated without the addition of oh scavenger were significantly smaller than those observed with oh scavenger the surfaces of samples treated without added oh scavenger had more pits and cavities than those treated in the presence of oh scavenger fig 6d the m n and m w values of ps mp aged without the oh scavenger dropped by 14 and 5 respectively while those aged with the oh scavenger present dropped by only 2 and 0 5 respectively fig 6e all the above data from pure culture experiments demonstrated that oh production in the anoxic oxic sediment could be a factor in the enhanced aging of ps mps 3 5 environmental implications the above results will enhance our capabilities for risk assessment and management of mps in the natural environment especially in areas such as intertidal zones and paddy fields with alternating anoxic oxic conditions since the aging of mps influence their mobility bioavailability adsorption by contaminants and their release of additives botterell et al 2019 luo et al 2020 liu et al 2020b for example when the o c ratio of ps mps rose from 0 044 to 0 322 increases in the capacities of ps mps for absorption of heavy metals including cu pb cd ni and zn ranged from 40 to 170 due to increased surface polarities and charges of ps mps mao et al 2020 when the o c ratio rose from 0 01 to 0 05 the capacity of ps mps for adsorption of hydrophilic amlodipine increased over 2 times while that for hydrophobic atorvastatin decreased by almost 50 liu et al 2020a in addition these findings suggest that we can engineer optimal degradation of mps by exploring different anoxic oxic conditions for instance sewage sludge containing a large amount of iron is a significant source and sink of mps the froth flotation technique and the flocculation technique which are base on the hydrophilic hydrophobic characteristics of particles are usually used to remove mps from sludge sol et al 2020 in this study we have learned that the degree of mp aging which influences hydrophobicity can be regulated easily by adjusting the anoxic oxic conditions in some environments rich in iron therefore this work could also serve as a starting point for mp management by engineering processes for removal of mps 4 conclusions this work expands our knowledge of mp aging in dark sediments under different anoxic oxic conditions whereas most previous studies were focused on photoaging our results showed that ps mps in sediments subjected to alternating anoxic oxic conditions displayed the highest aging degree but those subjected to oxic conditions did not in in situ experiments both the weight losses and o c ratios of ps mps under alternating anoxic oxic conditions were 2 times higher than those of ps mps under static oxic or static anoxic conditions during 2 month experiments in a 2 month column experiment the ps mps in the alternating anoxic oxic group showed weight losses and o c ratios that were respectively triple and double the corresponding values for the static oxic and static anoxic groups oxygenation experiments showed that the anoxic oxic conditions led to generation of oh and the pure culture experiment demonstrated that the oh produced in sediments subjected to anoxic oxic conditions could be involved in enhancement of ps mp aging these findings demonstrated that the dark production of oh could be an important cause of enhanced ps mp aging in sediments during alternating anoxic oxic periods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

waters 1 0 introduction fecal indicator bacteria fib i e escherichia coli enterococcus have been used for decades as surrogates for human pathogens in recreational waters to assess the water quality and evaluate the health risks to swimmers however the relationship between gastrointestinal gi illness and fib is usually more robust when the recreational water is impacted by human wastes including

public health garcía aljaro et al 2019 nevertheless evidence shows that fib cannot identify the source of contamination byappanahalli et al 2012 furthermore frick et al 2018 showed that fib are also present in poikilothermic animals such as fish frogs and snails in temperate regions studies also show the persistence of fib in various natural environments imamura et al 2011 yamahara et al 2009 which confounds source identification human specific mst markers which are highly specific to human waste contamination offer the advantage of better association with human pathogens this would

sources with 41 mst methods although some of the mst markers demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity towards human source contamination the magnitude concentration of mst markers also plays an important role in interpreting the health risks a risk based framework to evaluate the threshold concentration of mst markers using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach was proposed ahmed et al 2019a boehm et al 2018 2015 soller et al 2016 conducted qmra in parallel with a recreational water epidemiological study their study showed that qmra results were consistent with the epidemiological study and provided additional information to assist in the interpretation of epidemiological results a comprehensive review on the synergy between quantitative mst qmst and qmra was recently presented by zhang et al 2019 in their review paper the authors discuss several research gaps including the relationships between mst markers and pathogens degree of variability in the decay of mst markers and pathogens fate and transport of these microorganisms in natural environments fraction of pathogens that are infectious etc in addition they also highlighted the importance of qmst qmra as target concentrations are highly dependent on exposure scenarios and environmental conditions and thus application of a universal target at a fixed concentration may not be appropriate zhang et al 2019 owing to the different cell structures in mst markers and pathogens the decay of pathogens and indicators may differ under environmental stresses our earlier study reported different decay rates for fib mst markers and pathogens i e adenovirus under different salinity and sunlight irradiation liang et al 2017 other studies also examined the inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria mst markers and pathogens in the environment ahmed et al 2014 2019b bae and wuertz 2012 dick et al 2010 schulz and childers 2011 nevertheless to our knowledge there is currently no study that has derived the threshold concentrations of mst markers from gi illness risks by examining the simultaneous attenuation of mst markers and pathogens in the same environment ahmed et al 2018 2019b and boehm et al 2015 2018 identified the threshold concentrations of mst markers which corresponded to the threshold of gi illness level 30 36 gi illness per 1000 swimmers in most of these studies the occurrence of human markers and pathogens in environment were assumed to be the same ratio as in sewage the concentrations of pathogens in the environment were extrapolated from a ratio of human markers in the environment to human markers in sewage boehm et al 2015 in addition decay rates of mst markers and reference pathogens in the environment were not considered in their risk assessment except for boehm et al 2018 where decay rate constants were obtained through systematic reviews and meta analysis in this study we aim to achieve three main objectives the first objective is to identify the host specificity and sensitivity of three human associated mst markers i e hpyvs bacteroides thetaiotaomicron b theta and m smithii based on tropical urban conditions i e in singapore an urbanized country in southeast asia the mst markers were tested on feces of animals that are commonly found in singapore the second objective is to identify the threshold concentrations of mst markers that correspond to the acceptable gi illness risk using qmra with enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus as reference models decay rates of mst markers and reference pathogen fib under the influence of environmental factors e g sunlight and salinity were incorporated into the risk assessment as well as dilution factors the third objective is to validate the threshold concentration of mst markers with gi illness risks according to the surveillance data obtained from the environment this study complements ahmed and boehm s studies ahmed et al 2018a boehm et al 2015 by adopting their approach while considering the variation of decay rates in mst markers and reference pathogen fib as well as including parallel data of mst markers and reference pathogen fib obtained from the environment for further validation

for non normally distributed data was performed on the concentrations of different microorganisms detected from inland lakes and tributaries with spss version 22 0 spss inc and the critical p value for these tests was set at 0 05 2 5 identifying the threshold concentrations of mst markers the threshold concentrations of mst markers were evaluated according to gi illness risk from two reference pathogens i e adenovirus norovirus and a reference fib i e enterococcus from epidemiological study static qmra was used to estimate the gi illness risk for swimming activity in this study the exposure to reference pathogen fib was assumed to be only through ingestion three ingestion rates minimum average and maximum were assumed based on swimming activity reported in dufour et al s study 2006 table 3 reference pathogen fib and mst marker concentrations were subjected to decay and dilution factors decay rates as a function of light and salinity for enterococcus adenovirus and mst markers were studied in parallel in our previous study liang et al 2017 in this study we used the decay rates from liang et al 2017 and elmahdy et al 2018 studies we assumed first order decay of pathogens and mst markers as a function of travel time as shown in eq 7 a simple dilution model was applied to estimate the concentration of pathogens and mst markers eq 8 eq 7 c t c o exp kt where ct is the concentration of microorganisms at time of exposure gc 100 ml co is the concentration of microorganism at time 0 gc 100 ml k is the decay rate day 1 t is the travel time day eq 8 c c o x df where c is the concentration of microorganism at downstream gc 100 ml co is the original concentration of microorganism gc 100 ml df is the dilution factor in laboratory microcosms df is determined by the fraction of original sample volume to the volume of dilution water for instance df of 0 1 refers to one part of original sample added to nine parts of water making a concentration 1 10 of the original the dose of each reference pathogen fib was calculated based on the amount of microorganism ingested per swimming event around 45 min a harmonization factor was used for adenovirus as the measuring unit in dose response model i e tcid50 while our readings were in gene copies table 3 the dose response models for reference pathogen fib are showed in table 4 in the absence of study on the probability of illness pill given infection pinf for adenovirus through ingestion this study assumed that pill pinf 0 5 which is the median value in viau et al 2011 study using the qmra approach the threshold concentration of mst markers was drawn based on the gi illness benchmark of 36 illness per 1000 swimmers 0 036 usepa 2012 from the reference pathogen fib i e adenovirus norovirus and enterococcus syntax hypergeom a b z from matlab version r2018b was used to calculate the hypergeometic function the performance of mst markers to predict gi illness risks in the environment was evaluated based on the binary results from mst markers i e cell concentration below or above threshold value and binary results from reference pathogens i e pill below or exceed 0 036 3 0 results 3 1 standard curves and lowest detection limit the standard curve equations amplification efficiencies in ultra pure water and corresponding detection limit for each detection assay are listed in table 5 amplification efficiencies ranged from 85 to 99 and the r2 values were above 0 95 from the plasmid dna standards the lowest detection limits obtained in the b theta and m smithii qpcr assays were 2 gc μl dna corresponding to 30 gc 100 ml 1 gc μl dna corresponding to 15 gc 100 ml for hpyvs 2 5 gc μl dna corresponding to 20 gc l for adenovirus and 10 gc μl dna corresponding to 80 gc l 3 2 host specificity host specificity of the selected microbial markers was tested on sewage and animal fecal samples collected in singapore fig 1 shows the average concentration of mst markers as well as the percentage of positive detection for each marker in the different host groups all the mst markers were detected in 100 of the sewage samples however the average gene concentrations varied among the mst markers ranging from 9 73 105 gc ml b theta 2 23 104 gc ml hpyvs to 7 24 103 gc ml m smithii among the three mst markers hpyvs marker was shown to be highly specific to sewage and was not detected in feces from any of the tested animals m smithii was found to have limited cross reactivity in dog and boar feces 6 and 10 respectively while b theta could be detected in feces from dogs 18 cats 14 and mouse 43 the average concentrations of m smithii in dog and boar feces were 6 78 gc g and 1 15 103 gc g respectively high concentrations of b theta were detected in dog feces 7 81 106 gc g although b theta was detected in 6 out of 34 dog fecal samples similar high concentrations of b theta were detected in cat feces 3 14 104 gc g with a detection frequency of 3 out of 22 cat fecal samples in addition b theta had a high percentage of cross reactivity 43 in mice feces with an average concentration of 14 7 gc g table 6 shows the sensitivity and specificity of markers tested on the fecal samples collected in this study in this study all markers showed 100 sensitivity in sewage samples hpyvs is the only marker that gave 100 specificity with the fecal samples tested in this study this was followed by m smithii and b theta with a specificity of 97 and 90 respectively although hpyvs and m smithii gave high specificity towards the detection of sewage contamination the amount of cells per ml sewage were generally lower compared to b theta fig 1 3 3 estimates of the threshold concentrations of mst markers at gi illness risk levels the qmra approach was used to calculated gi illness risk levels based on reference pathogen fib adenovirus norovirus and enterococcus the probability of illness for three exposures minimum average and maximum ingestion rate for swimming activity were plotted against corresponding mst markers after considering two scenarios i decay of mst markers and reference pathogen fib over time in natural surface waters and ii dilution of mst markers and reference pathogen fib in the same waters figure s1 s8 by setting the illness benchmark of 0 036 the threshold concentrations of mst markers were interpolated from the graphs fig 2 summarizes the range of threshold concentration of mst markers by considering decay and dilution factors in freshwater the enterococcus model which reflects the gi illness risks from an epidemiological study showed that the threshold concentrations for b theta with average minimum and maximum ingestion rate were 1999 gc 100 ml 581 gc 100 ml and 6717 gc 100 ml respectively when considering the dilution factor threshold concentrations of b theta at gi illness risks enterococcus model were within the range of 760 gc 100 ml and 8073 gc 100 ml the average threshold concentration of b theta was not significantly different between the two adenovirus models with the average threshold concentration of 4817 gc 100 ml in the exponential model versus 3530 gc 100 ml in the hypergeometric model with the decay factor and 841 gc 100 ml in the exponential model versus 508 gc 100 ml in the hypergeometric model with the dilution factor as m smithii is present in low abundance in sewage 103 gc ml the threshold concentrations that corresponding to gi illness risk benchmark were generally below 1 log magnitude maximum threshold concentration 123 gc 100 ml in enterococcus model with dilution factor the threshold concentrations for hpyvs were relatively high with the decay factor ranging from 1687 gc 100 ml 6667 gc 100 ml compared to the dilution factor ranging from 13 gc 100 ml 643 gc 100 ml the decay period travel time ranges between 1 5 to 3 5 days for enterococcus and adenovirus to reach a level where the probability of gi illness is below the benchmark illness risk level 0 036 figure s1 and s2 however a longer duration 7 5 to 12 days is required for norovirus to decay till the benchmark illness risk level figure s3 this is due to the low decay rate of norovirus in the environment k 0 34 d elmahdy et al 2018 the dilution factors are of the order of 100 to 10 000 times in order to reach the level where the probability of gi illness from enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus are below the illness risk level different threshold concentrations were estimated for mst markers in seawater fig 3 among the three mst markers b theta has the highest threshold concentrations based on both adenovirus and enterococcus models the threshold concentrations of b theta based on the enterococcus models ranged between 1133 gc 100 ml to 10 286 gc 100 ml for the decay factor corresponding to 2 5 to 4 5 days and ranged between 760 gc 100 ml to 8073 gc 100 ml for the dilution factor corresponding to 100 to 1000 times dilution similarly lower threshold concentrations of b theta were obtained based on adenovirus models when considering dilution average concentration 508 gc 100 ml and 841 gc 100 ml compared to decay average concentration 3140 gc 100 ml and 4316 gc 100 ml two to three logs difference were observed in the hpyvs threshold concentrations for models considering decay and dilution factors in models considering decay the threshold concentrations for hpyvs were below the detection limit due to low abundance of m smithii in sewage samples the threshold concentrations for m smithii were also below the detection limit in both decay and dilution conditions 3 4 occurrence of mst markers and reference pathogens in local environmental freshwaters table 7 shows the geometric means gm of the microbial concentrations at different locations based on the cell concentration of enterococci the results showed that sites at inland lakes achieved higher water quality where gm of enterococci ranged from 1 to 41 most probable number mpn 100 ml these results are compliance with world health organization who recreational water guidelines which require that concentrations of enterococci should not be more than 200 counts 100 ml during 95 of the time 2003 water samples collected from tributaries gave higher counts for e coli gm from 180 to 10 341 mpn 100 ml and enterococci gm from 167 to 4022 mpn 100 ml mann whitney tests showed that the concentrations of different microorganisms detected from tributaries were significantly higher than those from inland lakes p 0 05 in addition three human specific markers were also more frequently detected at tributaries with gm ranging from below detection limit bdl to 738 gc 100 ml while their concentrations were generally low and always below the detection limit in inland lake samples among the three mst markers tested in this study the prevalence of m smithiii was lower in environmental water samples compared to hpyvs and b theta m smithii was detected in four sampling sites tributaries with detection frequencies of 6 at sites 2 and 5 and 33 at sites 18 and 19 higher detection frequencies of hpyvs were found at tributaries 0 33 than inland lakes 0 7 b theta has the highest detection frequencies 33 83 in tributaries with the highest gm of 738 gc 100 ml adenovirus was detected more frequently in both inland lakes and tributaries compared to mst markers nevertheless low abundance of adenovirus was found with the gm below 55 gc l a high prevalence of norovirus was found in both tributaries and inland lakes with concentrations at tributaries being significantly higher than inland lakes mann whitney tests p 0 05 3 5 field validation of threshold concentrations for mst markers mst markers and reference pathogen fib measured from the field samples were used to validate the threshold concentrations point estimation of risks from enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus were calculated using the qmra approach with actual cell concentrations in the field similar assumptions of ingestion rates and dose response models stated in section 2 5 table 3 and table 4 were applied for field data the threshold concentrations of mst markers estimated from field data were compared with the threshold concentrations interpolated from decay and dilution models section 3 3 fig 2 fig 4 s9 and s10 show the probability of gi illness risks based on enterococcus and the corresponding concentrations in mst markers the scatter plots were fitted into power function curves and the threshold concentrations of mst markers corresponding to gi illness benchmark 0 036 were interpolated from the graphs based on the enterococcus model threshold concentrations for b theta at minimum average and maximum ingestion rates were 6504 gc 100 ml 1012 gc 100 ml and 370 gc 100 ml fig 4 the fitted curves showed lower threshold concentrations for hpyvs ranging from 84 gc 100 ml to 4355 gc 100 ml that corresponded to the gi illness benchmark compared to b theta figure s9 the threshold concentrations for m smithii were the lowest among these three mst markers where the threshold concentrations were estimated around 85 gc 100 ml to 238 gc 100 ml depending on the exposure to pathogen figure s10 table 8 compares the threshold concentration of each mst marker based on the enterococcus model with decay factor dilution factor and actual field data for b theta the threshold concentrations estimated from decay and dilution factors were of the same order of magnitude as the threshold concentrations obtained from field data fig 4 as the detection frequencies of m smithii 3 5 and hpyvs 9 3 were low in field data the powered function curves gave significantly lower r values r 0 13 figures s9 and s10 the threshold concentrations for m smithii derived from field data were closer to threshold concentrations interpolated from the dilution factor table 8 a wider range of threshold concentrations for hpyvs was found in field data with different exposures the validation of threshold concentrations for mst markers was not carried out for the adenovirus model as there was low detection frequency 12 4 of adenovirus in field data in addition there were only 17 out of 223 samples 4 that exceeded the gi illness benchmark based on the adenovirus concentration in the field with maximum ingestion rate there was no clear regression pattern between mst markers and the occurrence of norovirus in the local environment as such validation of the threshold concentration for mst markers was not able to be tested 3 6 evaluating the health risks in tropical surface waters the probability of sewage contamination given a positive or negative result of mst marker in the sample was tested based on field data together with specificity and sensitivity of mst markers eq 3 eq 5 the probability of sewage contamination at each sampling site was examined with cumulative probability of sewage contamination from multiple samples at the same site eq 6 table 9 summarizes the cumulative probability of sewage contamination at the inland lakes and tributaries three sites from the inland lakes showed a probability of sewage contamination but only one site site 12 showed a probability of sewage contamination from two mst markers however a high probability of sewage contamination was found in almost all tributaries as the probability of sewage contamination was estimated based on the presence absence of mst markers this may overestimate the health risks as such this study proposed to more accurately evaluate the human health risks by combining information on specificity sensitivity and threshold concentration of mst markers in this study the lowest threshold concentration for each mst marker which represented the worst case scenario was applied to examine the health risks for tributary samples threshold concentrations derived from decay factors were applied as dilution is expected when water from tributaries flow into inland lakes the threshold concentrations derived from dilution factors were used the predictions from mst markers were compared with gi illness risks and the lowest threshold concentrations of mst markers are stated in tables 11 and 12 the binary data of mst markers safe below threshold value risk above threshold value and gi illness risks with mean ingestion rate safe probability of illness less than 0 036 risk probability of illness greater than 0 036 were compared for the inland lake samples table 10 and tributary samples table 11 all mst markers were able to correctly classify more than 95 of the inland lake samples with enterococcus and adenovirus as reference pathogens although mst markers successfully classified 100 at the safe level with norovirus as reference pathogen none of the mst markers were able to capture the risks from norovirus even when the threshold concentrations of m smithii and hpyvs were set at the detection limit for tributary samples correct classification of the level of safety was greater than 83 based on the gi illness risks from enterococcus and adenovirus however there was poor prediction of mst markers for samples with gi illness risks as such the threshold concentration of mst markers are useful to indicate the level of safety but not to predict the risk level in the environment mst markers were not able to predict the gi illness risks from norovirus even with their presence at the lowest detection limit by setting the threshold concentrations of mst markers as presented in tables 10 and 11 together with field data the percentage of samples that exceeded the mst marker threshold concentrations were calculated fig 5 shows that all inland lake samples were below the threshold concentrations except for sampling site 1 in adenovirus model and 12 in all models where the detection of hpyvs was above the threshold concentration nevertheless the percentage of sample with detection of hpyvs at these two sites was around 6 for tributary samples there are three sampling sites sites 5 18 and 19 where three mst markers were detected threshold concentrations of all mst markers were set at detection limits to estimate the gi illness risks from norovirus in the tributaries as such a higher percentage of sample exceeded the threshold concentrations fig 5c sampling site tributary 4 0 discussion 4 1 performances of mst marker assays mst markers have been well studied to identify sources of contamination the presence of human associated mst markers has been suggested to better correlate with the presence of human pathogens which cause health risks harwood et al 2014 hughes et al 2017 mcquaig et al 2012 however inconsistent application of these mst markers have been reported across different geographical regions wuertz et al 2011 for instance bacteroides hf183 was recommended as a human associated marker in california usa due to its consistent performance in term of sensitivity and specificity layton et al 2013 however similar assays demonstrated cross reactivity with non human fecal samples in odisha india odagiri et al 2015 florida usa staley et al 2012 hawaii kirs et al 2016 thailand kongprajug et al 2019 singapore nshimyimana et al 2017 and bangladesh ahmed et al 2010b human gut microbiome studies have revealed geographical variation in healthy gut microbiomes lloyd price et al 2016 rinninella et al 2019 diets early life exposures and genetics are some of the possible drivers of variation in the human gut microbiome application of antibiotics treatment may also affect the diversity of the microbiome lloyd price et al 2016 as such mst markers should be validated locally before being applied in the field for source tracking in this study we evaluated the performance of three mst markers b theta m smithii and hpyvs against local sewage and animal feces we found that all mst markers tested in this study have 100 sensitivity towards sewage detection b theta was present in high concentration in sewage followed by hpyvs and m smithii high prevalence of b theta 105 to 106 gc ml in sewage was also reported in other studies ahmed et al 2010b aslan and rose 2013 gómez doñate et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2011 a previous study also suggested that m smithii has lower prevalence in sewage compared to other human specific markers such as bacteroides hf183 and hpyvs ahmed et al 2012 this could be due to the lower percentage of individuals 29 that secrete m smithii in feces ufnar et al 2006 in term of specificity hpyvs has the highest specificity while b theta has the lowest specificity this is in agreement with other studies that showed hpyvs had higher specificity than bacteroides and m smithii presumably due to the obligate host specificity of viruses ahmed et al 2010a mcquaig et al 2009 in the same region nshimyimana et al 2017 reported higher specificity of b theta 98 compared to our study 90 in their study b theta assay was cross reacted with only one cat fecal sample while our study showed cross reactivity in dog cat and mice fecal samples similarly carson et al 2005 and kreader 1995 showed the presence of b theta in house pets although the detection frequencies of b theta were relatively low in dog feces 18 and cat feces 14 the concentrations of b theta were relatively high 106 gc g in dog feces 104 gc g in cat feces our results are consistent with the kreader 1995 study where high levels of b theta dna were found in 13 of the feces from house pets the lower specificity of b theta towards human waste contamination could probably be due to microbiome sharing among humans and pets e g dogs and cats song et al 2013 trinh et al 2018 apart from house pets kongprajug et al 2019 reported cross detection 85 specificity with some farm animals in thailand using the bacteroides hf183 assay the limitation of less specificity in b theta can be overcome by hpyvs which showed high specificity in non human fecal samples tested in this study as well as other studies ahmed et al 2010a mcquaig et al 2009 however the drawback of hpyvs is the low abundance in sewage samples i e approximately 1 2 logs lower compared to b theta as such application of multiple markers can increase the confidence level in source tracking of human fecal contamination 4 2 threshold concentrations of mst markers although many studies have proven that human related mst markers give better indication of human waste contamination and health risks mst markers have yet to be included in the guidelines to our knowledge there is currently no epidemiological data available for mst markers another problem includes the large choice of mst markers available for selection as well as the different performance of mst markers in different environments e g geographical variation water matrices liang et al 2017 wuertz et al 2011 in the absence of epidemiological data we applied the qmra approach to estimate the health risks from enterococcus dose response model derived from epidemiological data adenovirus and norovirus reference pathogen from enteric virus and subsequently interpolated the threshold concentrations of mst markers based on two scenarios i e decay and dilution this approach has been applied by other studies however most studies evaluated the risks considering only dilution factors ahmed et al 2018a boehm et al 2015 staley et al 2012 symonds et al 2016 our study aims to complement these studies by estimating the threshold concentrations of mst markers in consideration of the decay rates of mst markers and reference pathogen fib under natural sunlight irradiation and salinity in aquatic environments since dilution and decay are two main factors that greatly affect the distribution of microorganisms in the environment this study estimated the threshold concentrations considering dilution and decay factors separately boehm et al 2015 used multiple pathogens to estimate the threshold concentrations of bacteroides hf183 and humm2 their study estimated that 4200 copies of hf183 and 2800 copies of humm2 per 100 ml of recreational water corresponded to a benchmark illness rate of 30 gi illnesses per 1000 swimmers boehm et al 2015 by using norovirus and adenovirus as the reference pathogens ahmed et al 2018 estimated that hf 183 concentrations of 3220 gc 100 ml in water contaminated with fresh untreated sewage and 3660 gc 100 ml in water contaminated with secondary treated sewage represented a risk greater than 0 036 another study estimated that a human bacteroides concentration of 7800 gc 100 ml corresponded to an illness risk of 30 1000 in urban waters of the great lakes mclellan et al 2018 our study shows the average threshold concentrations of b theta ranging from 1999 gc 100 ml to 4817 gc 100 ml were of the same order of magnitude as boehm et al 2015 and ahmed et al 2018a studies except for the adenovirus model with dilution factor where the average threshold concentrations of b theta 508 gc 100 ml in hypergeometric model and 841 gc 100 ml in exponential model were around one magnitude order lower more recently boehm et al 2018 investigated the risks of gi illness associated with swimming in surface waters with aged sewage contamination through systematic reviews and meta analyses decay rates k values and concentrations of pathogens in untreated sewage samples were compiled without considering the decay factor the risk based threshold for hf183 was estimated around 9700 copies 100 ml which is more than double that of the previous estimate 4200 copies 100 ml these discrepancies in threshold concentrations are mainly due to the different distributions of pathogens applied to the models however when considering the decay factor model results indicate that the illness risk for primary contact recreators is unlikely to exceed the illness benchmark 30 1000 when the sewage contamination in surface water is over 3 3 days old boehm et al 2018 similarly our study also demonstrated that gi illness risk from contamination of aged sewage 2 5 3 5 days old in surface water is below the illness benchmark figure s1 s2 except for norovirus where the gi illness risk will be reduced to below illness benchmark after 7 5 days figure s3 the low decay rate of norovirus k 0 61 day 1 explains the projected threshold concentration of b theta below the detection limit fig 2 in this study the threshold concentrations for m smithii were the lowest among b theta and hpyvs when considering dilution factor and different exposures ingestion rates the threshold concentrations of m smithii ranged from 2 5 gc 100 ml to 123 gc 100 ml lower threshold concentrations were also suggested for m smithii based on gi illness from reference pathogens of norovirus and human adenovirus with the dilution approach in ahmed et al 2018a study in their study m smithii concentrations of 144 gc 100 ml for water contaminated with untreated sewage and 389 gc 100 ml for water contaminated with secondary treated sewage exceeded the benchmark risk of gi illness according to liang et al 2017 study m smithii has a higher decay rate among mst markers tested as well as compared to a reference pathogen adenovirus in microcosms with different sunlight intensity and salinity thus when considering the decay factor the threshold concentrations of m smithii were below detection limit 30 gc 100 ml together with the general low abundance of m smithii in sewage samples m smithii is not recommended as a sensitive mst marker the presence of m smithii could probably represent recent contamination due to faster decay rates in both freshwater and seawater although hpyvs have been shown to be highly specific to human waste contamination the threshold concentrations of hpyvs to interpret health risks are highly dependent on the type of water sample e g freshwater seawater and environmental factors e g temperature sunlight salinity etc when considering the decay factor higher threshold concentrations of hpyvs were interpolated in freshwater 1687 gc 100 ml 6667 gc 100 ml compared to seawater below detection limit this is mainly due to the faster decay rates of hpyvs in seawater kirs et al 2016 liang et al 2017 as such application of hpyvs to evaluate the gi risks in seawater need to be interpreted carefully particularly aged sewage contamination in seawater 4 3 occurrence of mst markers and associated health risks in environments to examine the probability of gi illness risk in environmental waters the lowest threshold concentrations of mst markers that are based on decay factor and dilution factor were used for tributary samples and inland lake samples respectively for inland lakes there were two sampling sites sites 1 and 12 with a probability of 0 06 1 in 17 sampling events that exceeded the threshold concentration of hpyvs further investigation of the individual concentrations from raw data revealed that the concentrations of hpyvs were 47 gc 100 ml and 257 gc 100 ml at sampling sites 1 and 12 respectively data not shown as such the gi illness risks at inland lakes were generally low and negligible on the other hand higher probabilities of gi illness risks were estimated at tributaries compared to inland lakes for instance sampling site 2 had the highest detection probability of b theta however the low detection probability in hpyvs and no detection of m smithii gave additional evidence to show the unlikely probability of human waste contamination as b theta also shows cross reactivity with several local animals from the field data there were three sampling sites sites 5 18 and 19 where b theta m smithii and hpyvs were present and exceeded their threshold concentrations the presence of all three mst markers in the tributaries suggested potential human fecal contamination in the surrounding watersheds among the mst markers m smithii had the lowest detection frequency in the environmental samples similar findings have been reported for environmental waters from southeast queensland australia ahmed et al 2012 this might be due to their lower prevalence in sewage ahmed et al 2012 ufnar et al 2006 as well as higher decay rates in environmental waters liang et al 2017 nevertheless the absence of m smithii in environmental water samples does not necessarily rule out the presence of sewage contamination we wish to highlight here that the gi illness risks estimated in this study were based on the hypothetical exposure scenario of full body contact recreational activities i e swimming with different ingestion rates the stringent risk assessment framework provided here allows for a better comparison of health risks between sites which subsequently offers a clearer picture to relevant authorities on the decision of appropriate recreational activities for particular sites 4 4 study limitations to the best of our knowledge there is currently no dose response model that has examined the probability of illness for adenovirus through oral ingestion although there are two studies which have reported the probability of illness for adenovirus through inhalation couch et al 1966 1969 in this study we adopted the median reading pill pinf 0 5 reported in viau et al 2011 study in order to determine how the different values of pill pinf affect the threshold concentrations of mst markers two extreme assumptions i e pill pinf 0 1 pill pinf 0 9 were evaluated by having 10 of pill pinf the threshold concentrations of mst markers in freshwater would be approximately one log higher compared to 50 of pill pinf if we consider higher pill pinf 90 the threshold concentrations of mst markers would generally be of similar magnitude data not shown as such we used a pill pinf 0 5 a more conservative assumption to estimate the threshold concentrations of mst markers the threshold concentrations of b theta were successfully validated with field data based on the enterococcus model however validation with enterococcus may introduce bias due to the potential sources from other warm blooded animals the prediction of gi illness risk from enterococcus is considered a more conservative approach as there are a wide variety of pathogens that can cause gi illness in this study adenovirus and norovirus were used in parallel with enterococcus to estimate the threshold concentration of mst markers however field validation based on adenovirus was not undertaken due to the extremely left skewed field data on the other hand a high prevalence of norovirus was found in local aquatic environments nevertheless the presence of norovirus did not correlate with any of these mst markers in some cases none of the mst markers were detected when norovirus counts exceeded the illness risk benchmark studies have shown the high persistence of norovirus in groundwater which can still be detected even after years charles et al 2009 seitz et al 2011 however there is only a limited number of studies on the persistence and decay rates of norovirus reported in the freshwater environment bae and schwab kellogg 2008 elmahdy et al 2018 ngazoa et al 2008 to date the experimental conditions conducted in elmahdy et al 2018 microcosm study is the closest to our current study in their study decay rates of murine norovirus a surrogate of human norovirus in surface and sediment samples under both sunlight and dark conditions were investigated the decay rate of norovirus was the slowest k 0 61 day 1 among all the microorganisms tested in this study k 1 31 to 5 4 day 1 this may explain why there is a high persistence of norovirus in the environment future studies should include infectivity assays of norovirus when efficient cell culture system for this virus has been established another limitation in this study is the lack of integration between decay and dilution factors when estimating the threshold concentration of mst markers in this study we assumed that decay is the governing factor for tributary samples while dilution is the governing factor for inland lake samples however in reality both decay and dilution processes exist and therefore should be considered together hydrological characteristics and hydrodynamics play important roles in determining the fate and transport of microbes in water bodies thus future studies should include hydrological characteristics and hydrodynamics modelling to estimate the threshold concentrations of mst markers 5 0 conclusion three human specific markers b theta m smithii and hpyvs were tested on 130 fecal samples from 8 main fecal sources i e sewage dog cat bird rabbit mice boar and monkey hpyvs showed 0 false positive identification for non human host groups tested in this study while m smithii also showed high specificity to sewage with 3 cross reactivity with dog and boar feces b theta had a relatively lower specificity of 90 compared to the other two mst markers all these mst markers were 100 sensitive towards the detection of sewage contamination however b theta was present in high abundance in sewage average concentration 9 73 105 gc ml compared to hpyvs 2 23 104 gc ml and m smithii 7 24 103 gc ml application of a single marker may be less sensitive and insufficient to draw a confident conclusion about human fecal contamination as such the application of multiple human specific microbial markers is useful for source tracking studies and is able to provide strong evidence for determining human fecal contamination such as the combination of hpyvs and b theta this study presents the range of threshold concentrations in mst markers in freshwater and seawater matrices by considering two scenarios i e decay and dilution under different exposures i e minimum average and maximum ingestion rates for swimming activity field validation confirmed the threshold concentrations of b theta estimated from decay 581 6717 gc 100 ml and dilution factors 760 8073 gc 100 ml where both estimated and field data 370 6500 gc 100 ml gave the same order of magnitude for threshold concentrations mst markers at threshold concentrations were able to successfully classify the safe level probability of gi illness risk 0 036 in more than 83 of the field data but were not able to predict the gi illness risk caused by norovirus a lack of correlation between norovirus and mst markers was observed in the field data in addition significant differences in decay rates between norovirus and mst markers upon exposure to the natural environment posed a great challenge for the prediction nevertheless the threshold concentrations of mst markers estimated from this study will still be useful as a quick guide and reference to understand the potential health risks i e gi illness however these threshold concentrations of mst markers should not exclusively be interpreted as the absolute thresholds as this study only derived the threshold concentrations of mst markers based on enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus there are other pathogens e g rotavirus enterovirus giardia lamblia cryptosporidium parvum etc which could be present in the wastewater or environment that can cause gi illness in addition interpretations of threshold concentration of mst markers should be done carefully by examining the environmental conditions and hydrodynamics of the water system the presence of high specificity mst markers show evidence of human waste contamination while threshold concentrations give some guidance on risk levels as this study is site specific to singapore the application of threshold concentrations needs to be interpreted with caution particularly for environments which are highly different from the current study in recent years crassphage has been proposed as a sensitive and specific human marker ahmed et al 2018b kongprajug et al 2019 stachler et al 2017 future studies should incorporate crassphage into the mst toolbox and evaluate the

16482,human specific microbial source tracking mst markers which are highly specific to human waste contamination offer the advantage of better association with human pathogens than traditional microbial indicators however the performance of these mst markers may vary across different geographical regions the magnitude of mst markers also plays an important role in interpreting the health risks this study aims to i validate the specificity and sensitivity of human markers for tropical urban catchments ii identify the threshold concentrations of mst markers i e human polyomaviruses hpyvs bacteroides thetaiotaomicron b theta and methanobrevibacter smithii m smithii that correspond to the acceptable gastrointestinal gi illness risks associated with swimming using the qmra approach and iii validate the threshold concentrations of mst markers using the surveillance data obtained from the tropical urban environment among the three mst markers hpyvs showed the highest specificity 100 to sewage samples followed by m smithii 97 and b theta 90 all mst markers showed 100 sensitivity towards sewage contamination with b theta present in highest abundance in sewage followed by hpyvs and m smithii this study demonstrates a risk based framework to identify the threshold concentrations of mst markers associated with gi illness risks in environmental waters by considering two main influencing factors i e decay and dilution factors this study successfully validated the b theta threshold concentration range 581 to 8073 gc 100 ml with field data 370 to 6500 gc 100 ml in estimating gi illness risks with an enterococcus model field data showed that the mst markers at threshold concentrations were able to classify the safe level in more than 83 of the samples according to gi illness risks from enterococcus and adenovirus the study also highlighted the lack of associations between mst markers and gi illness risks from norovirus with comprehensive information on specificity sensitivity and threshold concentrations of mst markers increasing confidence can be placed on identifying human source contamination and evaluating the health risks posed in environmental waters in singapore graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial source tracking mst markers quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra health risk human source contamination environmental waters 1 0 introduction fecal indicator bacteria fib i e escherichia coli enterococcus have been used for decades as surrogates for human pathogens in recreational waters to assess the water quality and evaluate the health risks to swimmers however the relationship between gastrointestinal gi illness and fib is usually more robust when the recreational water is impacted by human wastes including treated effluent or storm water runoff for areas with combined sewer systems haile et al 1999 wade et al 2010 many studies have reported the lack of relationship between gi illness and fib in recreational water without known sources of sewage colford et al 2007 fleisher et al 2010 human fecal contamination which is known to contain a broad range of human pathogens poses particular risks to public health garcía aljaro et al 2019 nevertheless evidence shows that fib cannot identify the source of contamination byappanahalli et al 2012 furthermore frick et al 2018 showed that fib are also present in poikilothermic animals such as fish frogs and snails in temperate regions studies also show the persistence of fib in various natural environments imamura et al 2011 yamahara et al 2009 which confounds source identification human specific mst markers which are highly specific to human waste contamination offer the advantage of better association with human pathogens this would subsequently provide better data to evaluate health risks to human among the human specific mst markers are human polyomaviruses hpyvs mcquaig et al 2009 human associated bacteroides kreader 1995 methanobrevibacter smithii m smithii ufnar et al 2006 coliphages cole et al 2003 pepper mild mottle virus rosario et al 2009 and the recent crassphage stachler et al 2017 however the specificity and sensitivity of human specific markers need to undergo validation according to their geographical locations harwood et al 2014 mst markers with low sensitivity and specificity may lead to false negative and false positive detection of sewage contamination in surface waters boehm et al 2013 conducted a large scale lab evaluation study which involved 27 labs to test against 12 different fecal sources with 41 mst methods although some of the mst markers demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity towards human source contamination the magnitude concentration of mst markers also plays an important role in interpreting the health risks a risk based framework to evaluate the threshold concentration of mst markers using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach was proposed ahmed et al 2019a boehm et al 2018 2015 soller et al 2016 conducted qmra in parallel with a recreational water epidemiological study their study showed that qmra results were consistent with the epidemiological study and provided additional information to assist in the interpretation of epidemiological results a comprehensive review on the synergy between quantitative mst qmst and qmra was recently presented by zhang et al 2019 in their review paper the authors discuss several research gaps including the relationships between mst markers and pathogens degree of variability in the decay of mst markers and pathogens fate and transport of these microorganisms in natural environments fraction of pathogens that are infectious etc in addition they also highlighted the importance of qmst qmra as target concentrations are highly dependent on exposure scenarios and environmental conditions and thus application of a universal target at a fixed concentration may not be appropriate zhang et al 2019 owing to the different cell structures in mst markers and pathogens the decay of pathogens and indicators may differ under environmental stresses our earlier study reported different decay rates for fib mst markers and pathogens i e adenovirus under different salinity and sunlight irradiation liang et al 2017 other studies also examined the inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria mst markers and pathogens in the environment ahmed et al 2014 2019b bae and wuertz 2012 dick et al 2010 schulz and childers 2011 nevertheless to our knowledge there is currently no study that has derived the threshold concentrations of mst markers from gi illness risks by examining the simultaneous attenuation of mst markers and pathogens in the same environment ahmed et al 2018 2019b and boehm et al 2015 2018 identified the threshold concentrations of mst markers which corresponded to the threshold of gi illness level 30 36 gi illness per 1000 swimmers in most of these studies the occurrence of human markers and pathogens in environment were assumed to be the same ratio as in sewage the concentrations of pathogens in the environment were extrapolated from a ratio of human markers in the environment to human markers in sewage boehm et al 2015 in addition decay rates of mst markers and reference pathogens in the environment were not considered in their risk assessment except for boehm et al 2018 where decay rate constants were obtained through systematic reviews and meta analysis in this study we aim to achieve three main objectives the first objective is to identify the host specificity and sensitivity of three human associated mst markers i e hpyvs bacteroides thetaiotaomicron b theta and m smithii based on tropical urban conditions i e in singapore an urbanized country in southeast asia the mst markers were tested on feces of animals that are commonly found in singapore the second objective is to identify the threshold concentrations of mst markers that correspond to the acceptable gi illness risk using qmra with enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus as reference models decay rates of mst markers and reference pathogen fib under the influence of environmental factors e g sunlight and salinity were incorporated into the risk assessment as well as dilution factors the third objective is to validate the threshold concentration of mst markers with gi illness risks according to the surveillance data obtained from the environment this study complements ahmed and boehm s studies ahmed et al 2018a boehm et al 2015 by adopting their approach while considering the variation of decay rates in mst markers and reference pathogen fib as well as including parallel data of mst markers and reference pathogen fib obtained from the environment for further validation

for non normally distributed data was performed on the concentrations of different microorganisms detected from inland lakes and tributaries with spss version 22 0 spss inc and the critical p value for these tests was set at 0 05 2 5 identifying the threshold concentrations of mst markers the threshold concentrations of mst markers were evaluated according to gi illness risk from two reference pathogens i e adenovirus norovirus and a reference fib i e enterococcus from epidemiological study static qmra was used to estimate the gi illness risk for swimming activity in this study the exposure to reference pathogen fib was assumed to be only through ingestion three ingestion rates minimum average and maximum were assumed based on swimming activity reported in dufour et al s study 2006 table 3 reference pathogen fib and mst marker concentrations were subjected to decay and dilution factors decay rates as a function of light and salinity for enterococcus adenovirus and mst markers were studied in parallel in our previous study liang et al 2017 in this study we used the decay rates from liang et al 2017 and elmahdy et al 2018 studies we assumed first order decay of pathogens and mst markers as a function of travel time as shown in eq 7 a simple dilution model was applied to estimate the concentration of pathogens and mst markers eq 8 eq 7 c t c o exp kt where ct is the concentration of microorganisms at time of exposure gc 100 ml co is the concentration of microorganism at time 0 gc 100 ml k is the decay rate day 1 t is the travel time day eq 8 c c o x df where c is the concentration of microorganism at downstream gc 100 ml co is the original concentration of microorganism gc 100 ml df is the dilution factor in laboratory microcosms df is determined by the fraction of original sample volume to the volume of dilution water for instance df of 0 1 refers to one part of original sample added to nine parts of water making a concentration 1 10 of the original the dose of each reference pathogen fib was calculated based on the amount of microorganism ingested per swimming event around 45 min a harmonization factor was used for adenovirus as the measuring unit in dose response model i e tcid50 while our readings were in gene copies table 3 the dose response models for reference pathogen fib are showed in table 4 in the absence of study on the probability of illness pill given infection pinf for adenovirus through ingestion this study assumed that pill pinf 0 5 which is the median value in viau et al 2011 study using the qmra approach the threshold concentration of mst markers was drawn based on the gi illness benchmark of 36 illness per 1000 swimmers 0 036 usepa 2012 from the reference pathogen fib i e adenovirus norovirus and enterococcus syntax hypergeom a b z from matlab version r2018b was used to calculate the hypergeometic function the performance of mst markers to predict gi illness risks in the environment was evaluated based on the binary results from mst markers i e cell concentration below or above threshold value and binary results from reference pathogens i e pill below or exceed 0 036 3 0 results 3 1 standard curves and lowest detection limit the standard curve equations amplification efficiencies in ultra pure water and corresponding detection limit for each detection assay are listed in table 5 amplification efficiencies ranged from 85 to 99 and the r2 values were above 0 95 from the plasmid dna standards the lowest detection limits obtained in the b theta and m smithii qpcr assays were 2 gc μl dna corresponding to 30 gc 100 ml 1 gc μl dna corresponding to 15 gc 100 ml for hpyvs 2 5 gc μl dna corresponding to 20 gc l for adenovirus and 10 gc μl dna corresponding to 80 gc l 3 2 host specificity host specificity of the selected microbial markers was tested on sewage and animal fecal samples collected in singapore fig 1 shows the average concentration of mst markers as well as the percentage of positive detection for each marker in the different host groups all the mst markers were detected in 100 of the sewage samples however the average gene concentrations varied among the mst markers ranging from 9 73 105 gc ml b theta 2 23 104 gc ml hpyvs to 7 24 103 gc ml m smithii among the three mst markers hpyvs marker was shown to be highly specific to sewage and was not detected in feces from any of the tested animals m smithii was found to have limited cross reactivity in dog and boar feces 6 and 10 respectively while b theta could be detected in feces from dogs 18 cats 14 and mouse 43 the average concentrations of m smithii in dog and boar feces were 6 78 gc g and 1 15 103 gc g respectively high concentrations of b theta were detected in dog feces 7 81 106 gc g although b theta was detected in 6 out of 34 dog fecal samples similar high concentrations of b theta were detected in cat feces 3 14 104 gc g with a detection frequency of 3 out of 22 cat fecal samples in addition b theta had a high percentage of cross reactivity 43 in mice feces with an average concentration of 14 7 gc g table 6 shows the sensitivity and specificity of markers tested on the fecal samples collected in this study in this study all markers showed 100 sensitivity in sewage samples hpyvs is the only marker that gave 100 specificity with the fecal samples tested in this study this was followed by m smithii and b theta with a specificity of 97 and 90 respectively although hpyvs and m smithii gave high specificity towards the detection of sewage contamination the amount of cells per ml sewage were generally lower compared to b theta fig 1 3 3 estimates of the threshold concentrations of mst markers at gi illness risk levels the qmra approach was used to calculated gi illness risk levels based on reference pathogen fib adenovirus norovirus and enterococcus the probability of illness for three exposures minimum average and maximum ingestion rate for swimming activity were plotted against corresponding mst markers after considering two scenarios i decay of mst markers and reference pathogen fib over time in natural surface waters and ii dilution of mst markers and reference pathogen fib in the same waters figure s1 s8 by setting the illness benchmark of 0 036 the threshold concentrations of mst markers were interpolated from the graphs fig 2 summarizes the range of threshold concentration of mst markers by considering decay and dilution factors in freshwater the enterococcus model which reflects the gi illness risks from an epidemiological study showed that the threshold concentrations for b theta with average minimum and maximum ingestion rate were 1999 gc 100 ml 581 gc 100 ml and 6717 gc 100 ml respectively when considering the dilution factor threshold concentrations of b theta at gi illness risks enterococcus model were within the range of 760 gc 100 ml and 8073 gc 100 ml the average threshold concentration of b theta was not significantly different between the two adenovirus models with the average threshold concentration of 4817 gc 100 ml in the exponential model versus 3530 gc 100 ml in the hypergeometric model with the decay factor and 841 gc 100 ml in the exponential model versus 508 gc 100 ml in the hypergeometric model with the dilution factor as m smithii is present in low abundance in sewage 103 gc ml the threshold concentrations that corresponding to gi illness risk benchmark were generally below 1 log magnitude maximum threshold concentration 123 gc 100 ml in enterococcus model with dilution factor the threshold concentrations for hpyvs were relatively high with the decay factor ranging from 1687 gc 100 ml 6667 gc 100 ml compared to the dilution factor ranging from 13 gc 100 ml 643 gc 100 ml the decay period travel time ranges between 1 5 to 3 5 days for enterococcus and adenovirus to reach a level where the probability of gi illness is below the benchmark illness risk level 0 036 figure s1 and s2 however a longer duration 7 5 to 12 days is required for norovirus to decay till the benchmark illness risk level figure s3 this is due to the low decay rate of norovirus in the environment k 0 34 d elmahdy et al 2018 the dilution factors are of the order of 100 to 10 000 times in order to reach the level where the probability of gi illness from enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus are below the illness risk level different threshold concentrations were estimated for mst markers in seawater fig 3 among the three mst markers b theta has the highest threshold concentrations based on both adenovirus and enterococcus models the threshold concentrations of b theta based on the enterococcus models ranged between 1133 gc 100 ml to 10 286 gc 100 ml for the decay factor corresponding to 2 5 to 4 5 days and ranged between 760 gc 100 ml to 8073 gc 100 ml for the dilution factor corresponding to 100 to 1000 times dilution similarly lower threshold concentrations of b theta were obtained based on adenovirus models when considering dilution average concentration 508 gc 100 ml and 841 gc 100 ml compared to decay average concentration 3140 gc 100 ml and 4316 gc 100 ml two to three logs difference were observed in the hpyvs threshold concentrations for models considering decay and dilution factors in models considering decay the threshold concentrations for hpyvs were below the detection limit due to low abundance of m smithii in sewage samples the threshold concentrations for m smithii were also below the detection limit in both decay and dilution conditions 3 4 occurrence of mst markers and reference pathogens in local environmental freshwaters table 7 shows the geometric means gm of the microbial concentrations at different locations based on the cell concentration of enterococci the results showed that sites at inland lakes achieved higher water quality where gm of enterococci ranged from 1 to 41 most probable number mpn 100 ml these results are compliance with world health organization who recreational water guidelines which require that concentrations of enterococci should not be more than 200 counts 100 ml during 95 of the time 2003 water samples collected from tributaries gave higher counts for e coli gm from 180 to 10 341 mpn 100 ml and enterococci gm from 167 to 4022 mpn 100 ml mann whitney tests showed that the concentrations of different microorganisms detected from tributaries were significantly higher than those from inland lakes p 0 05 in addition three human specific markers were also more frequently detected at tributaries with gm ranging from below detection limit bdl to 738 gc 100 ml while their concentrations were generally low and always below the detection limit in inland lake samples among the three mst markers tested in this study the prevalence of m smithiii was lower in environmental water samples compared to hpyvs and b theta m smithii was detected in four sampling sites tributaries with detection frequencies of 6 at sites 2 and 5 and 33 at sites 18 and 19 higher detection frequencies of hpyvs were found at tributaries 0 33 than inland lakes 0 7 b theta has the highest detection frequencies 33 83 in tributaries with the highest gm of 738 gc 100 ml adenovirus was detected more frequently in both inland lakes and tributaries compared to mst markers nevertheless low abundance of adenovirus was found with the gm below 55 gc l a high prevalence of norovirus was found in both tributaries and inland lakes with concentrations at tributaries being significantly higher than inland lakes mann whitney tests p 0 05 3 5 field validation of threshold concentrations for mst markers mst markers and reference pathogen fib measured from the field samples were used to validate the threshold concentrations point estimation of risks from enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus were calculated using the qmra approach with actual cell concentrations in the field similar assumptions of ingestion rates and dose response models stated in section 2 5 table 3 and table 4 were applied for field data the threshold concentrations of mst markers estimated from field data were compared with the threshold concentrations interpolated from decay and dilution models section 3 3 fig 2 fig 4 s9 and s10 show the probability of gi illness risks based on enterococcus and the corresponding concentrations in mst markers the scatter plots were fitted into power function curves and the threshold concentrations of mst markers corresponding to gi illness benchmark 0 036 were interpolated from the graphs based on the enterococcus model threshold concentrations for b theta at minimum average and maximum ingestion rates were 6504 gc 100 ml 1012 gc 100 ml and 370 gc 100 ml fig 4 the fitted curves showed lower threshold concentrations for hpyvs ranging from 84 gc 100 ml to 4355 gc 100 ml that corresponded to the gi illness benchmark compared to b theta figure s9 the threshold concentrations for m smithii were the lowest among these three mst markers where the threshold concentrations were estimated around 85 gc 100 ml to 238 gc 100 ml depending on the exposure to pathogen figure s10 table 8 compares the threshold concentration of each mst marker based on the enterococcus model with decay factor dilution factor and actual field data for b theta the threshold concentrations estimated from decay and dilution factors were of the same order of magnitude as the threshold concentrations obtained from field data fig 4 as the detection frequencies of m smithii 3 5 and hpyvs 9 3 were low in field data the powered function curves gave significantly lower r values r 0 13 figures s9 and s10 the threshold concentrations for m smithii derived from field data were closer to threshold concentrations interpolated from the dilution factor table 8 a wider range of threshold concentrations for hpyvs was found in field data with different exposures the validation of threshold concentrations for mst markers was not carried out for the adenovirus model as there was low detection frequency 12 4 of adenovirus in field data in addition there were only 17 out of 223 samples 4 that exceeded the gi illness benchmark based on the adenovirus concentration in the field with maximum ingestion rate there was no clear regression pattern between mst markers and the occurrence of norovirus in the local environment as such validation of the threshold concentration for mst markers was not able to be tested 3 6 evaluating the health risks in tropical surface waters the probability of sewage contamination given a positive or negative result of mst marker in the sample was tested based on field data together with specificity and sensitivity of mst markers eq 3 eq 5 the probability of sewage contamination at each sampling site was examined with cumulative probability of sewage contamination from multiple samples at the same site eq 6 table 9 summarizes the cumulative probability of sewage contamination at the inland lakes and tributaries three sites from the inland lakes showed a probability of sewage contamination but only one site site 12 showed a probability of sewage contamination from two mst markers however a high probability of sewage contamination was found in almost all tributaries as the probability of sewage contamination was estimated based on the presence absence of mst markers this may overestimate the health risks as such this study proposed to more accurately evaluate the human health risks by combining information on specificity sensitivity and threshold concentration of mst markers in this study the lowest threshold concentration for each mst marker which represented the worst case scenario was applied to examine the health risks for tributary samples threshold concentrations derived from decay factors were applied as dilution is expected when water from tributaries flow into inland lakes the threshold concentrations derived from dilution factors were used the predictions from mst markers were compared with gi illness risks and the lowest threshold concentrations of mst markers are stated in tables 11 and 12 the binary data of mst markers safe below threshold value risk above threshold value and gi illness risks with mean ingestion rate safe probability of illness less than 0 036 risk probability of illness greater than 0 036 were compared for the inland lake samples table 10 and tributary samples table 11 all mst markers were able to correctly classify more than 95 of the inland lake samples with enterococcus and adenovirus as reference pathogens although mst markers successfully classified 100 at the safe level with norovirus as reference pathogen none of the mst markers were able to capture the risks from norovirus even when the threshold concentrations of m smithii and hpyvs were set at the detection limit for tributary samples correct classification of the level of safety was greater than 83 based on the gi illness risks from enterococcus and adenovirus however there was poor prediction of mst markers for samples with gi illness risks as such the threshold concentration of mst markers are useful to indicate the level of safety but not to predict the risk level in the environment mst markers were not able to predict the gi illness risks from norovirus even with their presence at the lowest detection limit by setting the threshold concentrations of mst markers as presented in tables 10 and 11 together with field data the percentage of samples that exceeded the mst marker threshold concentrations were calculated fig 5 shows that all inland lake samples were below the threshold concentrations except for sampling site 1 in adenovirus model and 12 in all models where the detection of hpyvs was above the threshold concentration nevertheless the percentage of sample with detection of hpyvs at these two sites was around 6 for tributary samples there are three sampling sites sites 5 18 and 19 where three mst markers were detected threshold concentrations of all mst markers were set at detection limits to estimate the gi illness risks from norovirus in the tributaries as such a higher percentage of sample exceeded the threshold concentrations fig 5c sampling site tributary 4 0 discussion 4 1 performances of mst marker assays mst markers have been well studied to identify sources of contamination the presence of human associated mst markers has been suggested to better correlate with the presence of human pathogens which cause health risks harwood et al 2014 hughes et al 2017 mcquaig et al 2012 however inconsistent application of these mst markers have been reported across different geographical regions wuertz et al 2011 for instance bacteroides hf183 was recommended as a human associated marker in california usa due to its consistent performance in term of sensitivity and specificity layton et al 2013 however similar assays demonstrated cross reactivity with non human fecal samples in odisha india odagiri et al 2015 florida usa staley et al 2012 hawaii kirs et al 2016 thailand kongprajug et al 2019 singapore nshimyimana et al 2017 and bangladesh ahmed et al 2010b human gut microbiome studies have revealed geographical variation in healthy gut microbiomes lloyd price et al 2016 rinninella et al 2019 diets early life exposures and genetics are some of the possible drivers of variation in the human gut microbiome application of antibiotics treatment may also affect the diversity of the microbiome lloyd price et al 2016 as such mst markers should be validated locally before being applied in the field for source tracking in this study we evaluated the performance of three mst markers b theta m smithii and hpyvs against local sewage and animal feces we found that all mst markers tested in this study have 100 sensitivity towards sewage detection b theta was present in high concentration in sewage followed by hpyvs and m smithii high prevalence of b theta 105 to 106 gc ml in sewage was also reported in other studies ahmed et al 2010b aslan and rose 2013 gómez doñate et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2011 a previous study also suggested that m smithii has lower prevalence in sewage compared to other human specific markers such as bacteroides hf183 and hpyvs ahmed et al 2012 this could be due to the lower percentage of individuals 29 that secrete m smithii in feces ufnar et al 2006 in term of specificity hpyvs has the highest specificity while b theta has the lowest specificity this is in agreement with other studies that showed hpyvs had higher specificity than bacteroides and m smithii presumably due to the obligate host specificity of viruses ahmed et al 2010a mcquaig et al 2009 in the same region nshimyimana et al 2017 reported higher specificity of b theta 98 compared to our study 90 in their study b theta assay was cross reacted with only one cat fecal sample while our study showed cross reactivity in dog cat and mice fecal samples similarly carson et al 2005 and kreader 1995 showed the presence of b theta in house pets although the detection frequencies of b theta were relatively low in dog feces 18 and cat feces 14 the concentrations of b theta were relatively high 106 gc g in dog feces 104 gc g in cat feces our results are consistent with the kreader 1995 study where high levels of b theta dna were found in 13 of the feces from house pets the lower specificity of b theta towards human waste contamination could probably be due to microbiome sharing among humans and pets e g dogs and cats song et al 2013 trinh et al 2018 apart from house pets kongprajug et al 2019 reported cross detection 85 specificity with some farm animals in thailand using the bacteroides hf183 assay the limitation of less specificity in b theta can be overcome by hpyvs which showed high specificity in non human fecal samples tested in this study as well as other studies ahmed et al 2010a mcquaig et al 2009 however the drawback of hpyvs is the low abundance in sewage samples i e approximately 1 2 logs lower compared to b theta as such application of multiple markers can increase the confidence level in source tracking of human fecal contamination 4 2 threshold concentrations of mst markers although many studies have proven that human related mst markers give better indication of human waste contamination and health risks mst markers have yet to be included in the guidelines to our knowledge there is currently no epidemiological data available for mst markers another problem includes the large choice of mst markers available for selection as well as the different performance of mst markers in different environments e g geographical variation water matrices liang et al 2017 wuertz et al 2011 in the absence of epidemiological data we applied the qmra approach to estimate the health risks from enterococcus dose response model derived from epidemiological data adenovirus and norovirus reference pathogen from enteric virus and subsequently interpolated the threshold concentrations of mst markers based on two scenarios i e decay and dilution this approach has been applied by other studies however most studies evaluated the risks considering only dilution factors ahmed et al 2018a boehm et al 2015 staley et al 2012 symonds et al 2016 our study aims to complement these studies by estimating the threshold concentrations of mst markers in consideration of the decay rates of mst markers and reference pathogen fib under natural sunlight irradiation and salinity in aquatic environments since dilution and decay are two main factors that greatly affect the distribution of microorganisms in the environment this study estimated the threshold concentrations considering dilution and decay factors separately boehm et al 2015 used multiple pathogens to estimate the threshold concentrations of bacteroides hf183 and humm2 their study estimated that 4200 copies of hf183 and 2800 copies of humm2 per 100 ml of recreational water corresponded to a benchmark illness rate of 30 gi illnesses per 1000 swimmers boehm et al 2015 by using norovirus and adenovirus as the reference pathogens ahmed et al 2018 estimated that hf 183 concentrations of 3220 gc 100 ml in water contaminated with fresh untreated sewage and 3660 gc 100 ml in water contaminated with secondary treated sewage represented a risk greater than 0 036 another study estimated that a human bacteroides concentration of 7800 gc 100 ml corresponded to an illness risk of 30 1000 in urban waters of the great lakes mclellan et al 2018 our study shows the average threshold concentrations of b theta ranging from 1999 gc 100 ml to 4817 gc 100 ml were of the same order of magnitude as boehm et al 2015 and ahmed et al 2018a studies except for the adenovirus model with dilution factor where the average threshold concentrations of b theta 508 gc 100 ml in hypergeometric model and 841 gc 100 ml in exponential model were around one magnitude order lower more recently boehm et al 2018 investigated the risks of gi illness associated with swimming in surface waters with aged sewage contamination through systematic reviews and meta analyses decay rates k values and concentrations of pathogens in untreated sewage samples were compiled without considering the decay factor the risk based threshold for hf183 was estimated around 9700 copies 100 ml which is more than double that of the previous estimate 4200 copies 100 ml these discrepancies in threshold concentrations are mainly due to the different distributions of pathogens applied to the models however when considering the decay factor model results indicate that the illness risk for primary contact recreators is unlikely to exceed the illness benchmark 30 1000 when the sewage contamination in surface water is over 3 3 days old boehm et al 2018 similarly our study also demonstrated that gi illness risk from contamination of aged sewage 2 5 3 5 days old in surface water is below the illness benchmark figure s1 s2 except for norovirus where the gi illness risk will be reduced to below illness benchmark after 7 5 days figure s3 the low decay rate of norovirus k 0 61 day 1 explains the projected threshold concentration of b theta below the detection limit fig 2 in this study the threshold concentrations for m smithii were the lowest among b theta and hpyvs when considering dilution factor and different exposures ingestion rates the threshold concentrations of m smithii ranged from 2 5 gc 100 ml to 123 gc 100 ml lower threshold concentrations were also suggested for m smithii based on gi illness from reference pathogens of norovirus and human adenovirus with the dilution approach in ahmed et al 2018a study in their study m smithii concentrations of 144 gc 100 ml for water contaminated with untreated sewage and 389 gc 100 ml for water contaminated with secondary treated sewage exceeded the benchmark risk of gi illness according to liang et al 2017 study m smithii has a higher decay rate among mst markers tested as well as compared to a reference pathogen adenovirus in microcosms with different sunlight intensity and salinity thus when considering the decay factor the threshold concentrations of m smithii were below detection limit 30 gc 100 ml together with the general low abundance of m smithii in sewage samples m smithii is not recommended as a sensitive mst marker the presence of m smithii could probably represent recent contamination due to faster decay rates in both freshwater and seawater although hpyvs have been shown to be highly specific to human waste contamination the threshold concentrations of hpyvs to interpret health risks are highly dependent on the type of water sample e g freshwater seawater and environmental factors e g temperature sunlight salinity etc when considering the decay factor higher threshold concentrations of hpyvs were interpolated in freshwater 1687 gc 100 ml 6667 gc 100 ml compared to seawater below detection limit this is mainly due to the faster decay rates of hpyvs in seawater kirs et al 2016 liang et al 2017 as such application of hpyvs to evaluate the gi risks in seawater need to be interpreted carefully particularly aged sewage contamination in seawater 4 3 occurrence of mst markers and associated health risks in environments to examine the probability of gi illness risk in environmental waters the lowest threshold concentrations of mst markers that are based on decay factor and dilution factor were used for tributary samples and inland lake samples respectively for inland lakes there were two sampling sites sites 1 and 12 with a probability of 0 06 1 in 17 sampling events that exceeded the threshold concentration of hpyvs further investigation of the individual concentrations from raw data revealed that the concentrations of hpyvs were 47 gc 100 ml and 257 gc 100 ml at sampling sites 1 and 12 respectively data not shown as such the gi illness risks at inland lakes were generally low and negligible on the other hand higher probabilities of gi illness risks were estimated at tributaries compared to inland lakes for instance sampling site 2 had the highest detection probability of b theta however the low detection probability in hpyvs and no detection of m smithii gave additional evidence to show the unlikely probability of human waste contamination as b theta also shows cross reactivity with several local animals from the field data there were three sampling sites sites 5 18 and 19 where b theta m smithii and hpyvs were present and exceeded their threshold concentrations the presence of all three mst markers in the tributaries suggested potential human fecal contamination in the surrounding watersheds among the mst markers m smithii had the lowest detection frequency in the environmental samples similar findings have been reported for environmental waters from southeast queensland australia ahmed et al 2012 this might be due to their lower prevalence in sewage ahmed et al 2012 ufnar et al 2006 as well as higher decay rates in environmental waters liang et al 2017 nevertheless the absence of m smithii in environmental water samples does not necessarily rule out the presence of sewage contamination we wish to highlight here that the gi illness risks estimated in this study were based on the hypothetical exposure scenario of full body contact recreational activities i e swimming with different ingestion rates the stringent risk assessment framework provided here allows for a better comparison of health risks between sites which subsequently offers a clearer picture to relevant authorities on the decision of appropriate recreational activities for particular sites 4 4 study limitations to the best of our knowledge there is currently no dose response model that has examined the probability of illness for adenovirus through oral ingestion although there are two studies which have reported the probability of illness for adenovirus through inhalation couch et al 1966 1969 in this study we adopted the median reading pill pinf 0 5 reported in viau et al 2011 study in order to determine how the different values of pill pinf affect the threshold concentrations of mst markers two extreme assumptions i e pill pinf 0 1 pill pinf 0 9 were evaluated by having 10 of pill pinf the threshold concentrations of mst markers in freshwater would be approximately one log higher compared to 50 of pill pinf if we consider higher pill pinf 90 the threshold concentrations of mst markers would generally be of similar magnitude data not shown as such we used a pill pinf 0 5 a more conservative assumption to estimate the threshold concentrations of mst markers the threshold concentrations of b theta were successfully validated with field data based on the enterococcus model however validation with enterococcus may introduce bias due to the potential sources from other warm blooded animals the prediction of gi illness risk from enterococcus is considered a more conservative approach as there are a wide variety of pathogens that can cause gi illness in this study adenovirus and norovirus were used in parallel with enterococcus to estimate the threshold concentration of mst markers however field validation based on adenovirus was not undertaken due to the extremely left skewed field data on the other hand a high prevalence of norovirus was found in local aquatic environments nevertheless the presence of norovirus did not correlate with any of these mst markers in some cases none of the mst markers were detected when norovirus counts exceeded the illness risk benchmark studies have shown the high persistence of norovirus in groundwater which can still be detected even after years charles et al 2009 seitz et al 2011 however there is only a limited number of studies on the persistence and decay rates of norovirus reported in the freshwater environment bae and schwab kellogg 2008 elmahdy et al 2018 ngazoa et al 2008 to date the experimental conditions conducted in elmahdy et al 2018 microcosm study is the closest to our current study in their study decay rates of murine norovirus a surrogate of human norovirus in surface and sediment samples under both sunlight and dark conditions were investigated the decay rate of norovirus was the slowest k 0 61 day 1 among all the microorganisms tested in this study k 1 31 to 5 4 day 1 this may explain why there is a high persistence of norovirus in the environment future studies should include infectivity assays of norovirus when efficient cell culture system for this virus has been established another limitation in this study is the lack of integration between decay and dilution factors when estimating the threshold concentration of mst markers in this study we assumed that decay is the governing factor for tributary samples while dilution is the governing factor for inland lake samples however in reality both decay and dilution processes exist and therefore should be considered together hydrological characteristics and hydrodynamics play important roles in determining the fate and transport of microbes in water bodies thus future studies should include hydrological characteristics and hydrodynamics modelling to estimate the threshold concentrations of mst markers 5 0 conclusion three human specific markers b theta m smithii and hpyvs were tested on 130 fecal samples from 8 main fecal sources i e sewage dog cat bird rabbit mice boar and monkey hpyvs showed 0 false positive identification for non human host groups tested in this study while m smithii also showed high specificity to sewage with 3 cross reactivity with dog and boar feces b theta had a relatively lower specificity of 90 compared to the other two mst markers all these mst markers were 100 sensitive towards the detection of sewage contamination however b theta was present in high abundance in sewage average concentration 9 73 105 gc ml compared to hpyvs 2 23 104 gc ml and m smithii 7 24 103 gc ml application of a single marker may be less sensitive and insufficient to draw a confident conclusion about human fecal contamination as such the application of multiple human specific microbial markers is useful for source tracking studies and is able to provide strong evidence for determining human fecal contamination such as the combination of hpyvs and b theta this study presents the range of threshold concentrations in mst markers in freshwater and seawater matrices by considering two scenarios i e decay and dilution under different exposures i e minimum average and maximum ingestion rates for swimming activity field validation confirmed the threshold concentrations of b theta estimated from decay 581 6717 gc 100 ml and dilution factors 760 8073 gc 100 ml where both estimated and field data 370 6500 gc 100 ml gave the same order of magnitude for threshold concentrations mst markers at threshold concentrations were able to successfully classify the safe level probability of gi illness risk 0 036 in more than 83 of the field data but were not able to predict the gi illness risk caused by norovirus a lack of correlation between norovirus and mst markers was observed in the field data in addition significant differences in decay rates between norovirus and mst markers upon exposure to the natural environment posed a great challenge for the prediction nevertheless the threshold concentrations of mst markers estimated from this study will still be useful as a quick guide and reference to understand the potential health risks i e gi illness however these threshold concentrations of mst markers should not exclusively be interpreted as the absolute thresholds as this study only derived the threshold concentrations of mst markers based on enterococcus adenovirus and norovirus there are other pathogens e g rotavirus enterovirus giardia lamblia cryptosporidium parvum etc which could be present in the wastewater or environment that can cause gi illness in addition interpretations of threshold concentration of mst markers should be done carefully by examining the environmental conditions and hydrodynamics of the water system the presence of high specificity mst markers show evidence of human waste contamination while threshold concentrations give some guidance on risk levels as this study is site specific to singapore the application of threshold concentrations needs to be interpreted with caution particularly for environments which are highly different from the current study in recent years crassphage has been proposed as a sensitive and specific human marker ahmed et al 2018b kongprajug et al 2019 stachler et al 2017 future studies should incorporate crassphage into the mst toolbox and evaluate the

16483,ion exchange ix is a promising technology to remove legacy anionic per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas from water as increasing numbers of per and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids pfea and other emerging pfas were detected in the environment it is necessary to understand how well ix resins remove these emerging pfas for drinking water treatment in this study nine commercially available ix resins were tested to treat a drinking water source spiked with 40 legacy and emerging pfas at 600 ng l including pfea perfluoroalkyl carboxylic and sulfonic acids fluorotelomer sulfonic acids perfluoroalkane sulfonamides perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoacetic acids and zwitterionic species with limited contact time 15 min pfas properties such as the fluorinated chain length charge and functional groups all affected pfas adsorption to resins however the impact of pfas properties on pfas removal became less pronounced when the contact time increased beyond 2 h while the resin polymer matrix became the critical factor for pfas removal all five tested polystyrene divinylbenzene ps dvb resins achieved more than 90 removal in 24 h of 35 pfas compounds while polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins achieved 90 removal for less than half of the compounds regenerating ps dvb resin was investigated using different salt species regenerant ph brine concentrations and methanol contents sodium chloride and ammonium chloride were found the best brines for regenerating the tested resins increasing brine concentrations enhanced the regeneration efficiency especially for short chain pfas using simple salt regenerants up to 94 of selected short chain pfas was released from resins designed for general water treatment but no meaningful regeneration was achieved for long chain pfas or pfas specific resins when the organic solvent content was less than 20 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords genx zwitterionic pfas neutral pfas pfea pfca pfsa 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas refer to a large group of fluorinated aliphatic chemicals with an estimated number of 5000 types existing over the globe itrc 2020 usepa 2019 because of their unique properties such as resistance to water oil and heat pfas have been intensively introduced to various industrials household products and firefighting applications itrc 2020 usepa 2019 the stability and wide use of pfas made them ubiquitous in the environment and accumulated in humans drinking pfas contaminated water is a significant exposure pathway to humans domingo and nadal 2019 usepa 2019 thus more strict pfas regulations are being adopted on drinking water nowadays adsorption by activated carbon or anion exchange ix resin is one of the few effective technologies for removing pfas among the drinking water treatment processes used in practice gagliano et al 2020 hopkins et al 2018 previous studies show that ix resins outperformed activated carbon in removing pfas especially short chain pfas gagliano et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 as a result studies using ix to remove pfas from contaminated water increased in these years dixit et al 2020 laura del moral et al 2020 maimaiti et al 2018 park et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b zaggia et al 2016 and manufacturers marketed resins with high selectivity for pfas e g purolite a592e and pfa694e however there are still information gaps in applying ix to remove pfas from drinking water including 1 removal effectiveness for emerging pfas such as per and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids pfea and zwitterionic pfas 2 key pfas and resin properties determining the treatment performance and 3 practical resin regeneration strategies with minimal use of organic solvents along with the phase out of long chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos emerging pfas were manufactured to replace legacy pfaa compounds in the pfea group for example were identified at hundreds of ng l in the cape fear river basin near a fluoropolymers manufacturing plant in north carolina usa hopkins et al 2018 strynar et al 2015 sun et al 2016 as well as other places worldwide gebbink et al 2017 heydebreck et al 2015 compared to legacy pfaa literature focusing on removing pfea by ix is limited to date only nine publications reported the application of ix resins to remove pfas other than pfaa while six of them just included one or two emerging species boyer et al 2021 making it difficult to conclude how pfas properties affect their removal meanwhile research on emerging pfas mostly focused on genx and f 53b two alternatives for pfoa and pfos ateia et al 2019 dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019a however other pfea potentially present at much higher concentrations and more difficult to remove are overlooked similarly zwitterionic pfas associated with firefighting foams are absent from ix treatment studies fang et al 2021 itrc 2020 and may have very different removal performance from commonly studied anionic pfaa as more emerging pfas with different properties are identified in drinking water sources there is a need for evaluating the adsorption of pfas other than pfaa onto ix resins the performance of ix in removing pfas could be affected by the resin properties including polymer matrix porosity and functional groups gagliano et al 2020 nevertheless conclusions from previous studies regarding the role of resin properties are inconsistent for example one study showed more pfaa were adsorbed by polystyrene resin a520e from groundwater than polyacrylic resin a860 laura del moral et al 2020 while other studies reported higher capacity for genx pfoa and pfos onto polyacrylic resin ira67 and ira958 than polystyrene resin ira400 and ira900 deng et al 2010 wang et al 2019a moreover most previous studies evaluate the performance of just a couple of resins on pfas removal hence the results from one study are inadequate to conclude the critical role of resin properties meanwhile these studies were conducted with a wide range of initial pfas concentrations ng l to mg l in different water matrices making inter study comparison difficult thus the role of resin properties in adsorbing pfas remains obscure and it could increase the difficulty in determining the appropriate resin for water treatment facilities furthermore studies using pfas specific resins to remove pfas are limited dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021 hence a more systematic understanding of the key resin properties in removing pfas under ambient environmental conditions is needed regenerating pfas exhausted resins is challenging because of the high affinity of the resins for pfas and or the reduced solubility of pfas in concentrated brine and the regeneration recoveries and the appropriate strategies vary depending on the pfas and resin properties while some studies have achieved 80 recovery using simple brines dixit et al 2020 zaggia et al 2016 most studies failed to achieve more than 70 regeneration unless when 30 80 methanol or ethanol was used in the regenerant carter and farrell 2010 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 using a high percentage of organic solvents is not practical for water treatment from both the safety and cost perspectives yet whether regenerating the pfas exhausted resins by much lower solvent contents i e 20 is feasible remains a question in addition studies on regenerating resins loaded with pfas other than pfaa are limited to just genx f 53b and fluorotelomer sulfonic acids boyer et al 2021 while information on the release of other emerging pfas from resins is needed the objective of this study is to fill the knowledge gaps mentioned above for removing legacy and emerging pfas by ix we evaluated the effectiveness of nine commercially available ix resins with various properties in removing 40 legacy and emerging pfas from a drinking water source the best performing five resins were further tested for regeneration this study gives insights on 1 how effective ix is to remove emerging pfas 2 what properties of pfas and resins play important roles in pfas removal and 3 which practical regeneration conditions would work for spent resin and what the corresponding recovery of each pfas and resin could achieve under the optimal regeneration conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances eight groups of pfas were tested in this study including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfca perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsa fluorotelomer sulfonic acids ftsa per and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfeca per and polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids pfesa perfluoroalkane sulfonamides fasa perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoacetic acids fasaa and zwitterionic species associated with firefighting foams table 1 a total of forty pfas compounds were studied from these groups based on their occurrence in the drinking water sources in north carolina mccord and strynar 2019 availability of analytical standards and capability of our analytical methods the chemical structures of some emerging pfas are summarized in fig s1 in the supporting information si information on the chemicals used in this project is summarized in si 2 1 2 anion exchange resins nine commercially available anion exchange resins were assessed in our screening test table s2 these resins were chosen based on their good performance in removing pfas in previous studies deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 lundgren 2014 maimaiti et al 2018 besides the two purolite resins a592e and pfa694e are tested as novel pfas selective products on the market 2 1 3 water the matrix used in this study to test pfas removal was a drinking water source groundwater from a private well with known pfas contamination from a nearby fluorochemical manufactory in fayetteville nc the groundwater sample was collected on april 24 2019 and stored at 4 c until use due to the low ph of the raw groundwater around ph 3 8 sodium bicarbonate 50 mg l was used to adjust the ph to 7 0 0 2 the ph adjusted groundwater was filtered by 0 7 µm glass fiber membranes prior to use background pfas concentrations in the groundwater and other water characteristics are summarized in table s3 2 2 methods 2 2 1 screening tests screening tests were conducted in groundwater spiked with all pfas listed in table 1 to 600 ng l each except pmpa at 1161 ng l the original concentration in the groundwater table s3 the resins at a dose of 5 ml l and groundwater were mixed continuously at 150 rpm on an orbital shaker at room temperature around 21 c aqueous samples were collected after 15 min 2 h and 24 h of mixing the samples were filtered by 0 2 µm glass microfiber syringe filters and analyzed for pfas concentrations solution ph and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 little changes in solution ph and uv254 were observed hence these results are not presented all experiments were conducted in 50 ml polypropylene centrifugal tubes in duplicates the relative standard deviations of the duplicates are small 5 and thus the averages of the duplicates are presented and used for data analysis in the following content controls were conducted in 50 ml spiked groundwater without ix resins under the same conditions changes in pfas concentrations before and after the control tests were within 10 demonstrating little pfas loss or contamination in the test procedures 2 2 2 regeneration tests the best performing resins from the screening tests a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 were selected for regeneration pfas loaded resins were prepared by mixing 5 ml l resins with spiked groundwater at initial pfas concentrations of 1000 ng l each except pmpa at 1161 ng l for 24 h the mass of pfas on the resins was calculated using the initial and remaining aqueous phase pfas concentrations assuming a mass balance then the pfas loaded resins were mixed with regenerant solutions at 5 ml l for 3 h tested regeneration conditions include different salts nacl nh4cl nahco3 ch3coona and ch3coonh4 salt concentrations 0 01 10 by weight ph 6 9 11 and 13 and methanol contents 0 20 by volume 2 2 3 analytical method and data analysis the concentrations of pfas in the aqueous phase were analyzed by a liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry analysis of variance method was used to evaluate the statistical significance of pfas and resin properties for the adsorption details are described in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening tests 3 1 1 the impact of resin properties pfas removal from the spiked groundwater by the nine resins after 15 min 2 h and 24 h is illustrated in fig 1 the resin polymer matrix plays an important role in removing pfas since pfas removal by the polymethacrylate resin miex gold and the polymethacrylate dvb resin miex doc shows no significant difference p 0 05 the two resins are discussed in the same category despite the slight difference in their polymer matrices at 15 min polystyrene divinylbenzene ps dvb resins including a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 removed similar amounts of pfas as polymethacrylate resins miex gold and doc meanwhile the two polyacrylic resins ira67 and ira958 showed the least removal fig 1a with reaction time increased to 2 24 h the ps dvb resins outperformed the other two polymers fig 1b and c the significance of the polymer matrix in removing pfas was also observed in previous studies deng et al 2010 laura del moral et al 2020 wang et al 2019a because the ps dvb polymer aromatic hydrocarbon backbone is more hydrophobic than the polymethacrylate aliphatic ester backbone and polyacrylic matrices aliphatic carboxylic acid backbone purolite 2019 wang et al 2019a the higher pfas removal by ps dvb resins could be attributed to hydrophobic interactions this result agrees with previous studies where the ps dvb resins showed higher pfaa removal from groundwater than other resin polymers laura del moral et al 2020 maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 however deng et al 2010 observed faster kinetic and higher adsorption capacity of pfos to polyacrylic resins than to ps dvb resins in deionized water at ph 3 at much higher initial pfos concentrations 200 400 mg l notwithstanding pfos removal is heavily driven by hydrophobic interaction between pfos and water molecules aggregation among pfos molecules and air water interface enrichment comparably the pfos resin interactions become less important thus using pfos to compare performance of different resin polymers may be misleading in addition wang et al 2019a observed the impact of resin polymers on genx adsorption consistent with our observations at ph 2 6 8 and 10 but the opposite at ph 4 suggesting the role of resin polymers in determining pfas removal may also be affected by protonation of the amino functional groups maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019a in our screening tests the resin pore structure gel vs macroporous did not significantly influence pfas removal p 0 05 consistent with previous studies deng et al 2010 dudley 2012 zaggia et al 2016 similarly other resin properties including functional groups capacity and particle size had no significant impact on their pfas removal performance while the screening tests were not designed to systematically reveal pfas uptake kinetics results in fig 1a suggest that with a limited contact time gel type resins achieved higher pfas removal than macroporous resins among the five ps dvb resins for example between the two pfas selective resins pfa694e gel type removed above 50 of all the tested pfaa within 15 min while a592e macroporous only achieved 50 removal for 10 out of the 16 tested pfaa fig 1a similarly the average fasaa removal in 2 h is 36 by tan1 macroporous and 71 by dowex1 gel type fig 1b dudley et al 2015 also observed more rapid removal of pfas by gel type ps dvb resins compared to macroporous ones within 20 min and explained the observation with the smaller particle diameter or larger capacity of the gel type resins than macroporous resins in their study dudley et al 2015 similarly the faster removal by gel ps dvb resins in our study could result from the smaller particle diameter of pfa694e than a592e and the larger capacity of dowex1 than tan1 table s2 both contributing to more adsorption sites accessible to pfas the two polymethacrylate resins miex gold and doc adsorbed less short chain pfas compared to ps dvb resins after 2 h and no further adsorption was observed between 2 and 24 h fig 1b and c the removal of pfaa by miex doc in our study was 1 1 5 fold higher than what park et al 2020 reported at a higher resin dose 8 ml l from groundwater spiked with 300 ng l pfas since miex resins are typically used to remove dissolved organic carbon and mineral anions while the groundwater used by park et al 2020 contained 1 6 fold higher dissolved organic carbon and 1 3 fold higher ionic strength than in our groundwater the higher pfas removal in our study than the study of park et al 2020 was likely due to competition from these constituents polyacrylic resins ira67 and ira958 are deemed ineffective in removing pfas from groundwater based on results in fig 1 these resins not only showed the least pfas removal among the tested nine but also desorbed pfas after 2 h removal of long chain pfca pfsa ftsa pfeca fasa and fasaa decreased from above 50 at 2 h to less than 50 at 24 h fig 1b and c while the removal of the short chain compounds either did not change or increased slightly in a few case and the total pfas mass on each resin at 24 h was less than that at 2 h while the exact reason leading to the desorption of long chain pfas from these resins was unclear the results demonstrated the weak bonding of long chain pfas to the hydrophilic polyacrylic resins and indicate that the removals of long chain pfas and short chain pfas could be controlled by different mechanisms the impacts of pfas properties on ix removal will be discussed in the next section 3 1 2 the effect of pfas properties typically an anionic pfas molecule contains a non ionic hydrophobic fluorinated tail and an anionic functional group head the tail facilitates pfas non electrostatic adsorption via hydrophobic and van der waals interactions the head enables electrostatic adsorption with the anion exchange resins and the whole surfactant molecules exhibit additional removal mechanisms like molecular aggregation and air water interface enrichment boyer et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 meng et al 2014 wang et al 2019a zaggia et al 2016 thus pfas with different molecular structures behave differently in ix removal and the properties of pfas such as functional groups in the head and the number of fluorinated carbon atoms ncf in the tail could influence pfas removal by the resins table s4 3 1 2 1 adsorption in short contact time within limited contact time 15 min several pfas properties significantly affected the adsorption onto resins p 0 05 including the degree of fluorination perfluorinated vs polyfluorinated functional group and ncf increasing ncf in each pfas group increased adsorption regardless of the resin polymer matrix fig 1a consistent with previous adsorption studies gagliano et al 2020 park et al 2020 zaggia et al 2016 longer chains lead to greater hydrophobicity logdow and van der waals force which contributes to the higher affinity of pfas for the resins furthermore long chains pfas trend to partition into the air water interface in air bubbles which consequently are trapped by the resin and contribute to the observed removal from the aqueous phase meng et al 2014 long chain pfas removal may also be attributed to micelle hemimicelle and admicelle formation yu et al 2009 however this mechanism should not be important in this study since the tested pfas concentration 600 ng l was much lower than the critical micelle concentration at g l level yu et al 2009 at a given ncf pfas removal was further influenced by other properties when ncf 4 adsorption was almost the same across different pfas groups within each resin polymer type while pfsa and pfesa showed higher removal than other pfas groups by polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins fig 2 a even the neutral fbsa from the fasa group showed no significant difference compared to other anionic pfas with the same chain length such similarity implies that the physisorption determined by the fluorinated tail rather than the electrostatic force determined by the functional groups and charges drives short chain pfas adsorption because the electrostatic force is less important while the physisorption is not strong enough for short chain pfas the overall removal was low for pfas with ncf 4 increasing the ncf to 6 zwitterions and pfeca show the highest removal at the 15 minute contact time regardless of resin polymer types fig 2b the highest affinity of zwitterions and pfeca to resins could be associated with their longer total chain length contributed by the methylene or ether groups similarly pfeca showed higher adsorption than pfca with the same ncf by activated carbon possible because the ether oxygen atom shielded by the neighboring fluorine atoms cannot participate in hydrogen bonding thus the ether oxygen behaves more like carbon and essentially increases the chain length han et al 2021 du et al 2016 also reported higher adsorption of f 53b a chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate with the same ncf as pfos by activated carbon than pfos and the result was attributed to the ether group insertion in the f 53b molecules however the additional ch2 groups in ftsa did not improve adsorption as much as they did in the zwitterions suggesting the relative location between the methylene chain and the functional group also determines adsorption affinity among other pfas groups with ncf 6 sulfonates pfsa ftsa and pfesa were adsorbed more to polyacrylic resins than carboxylic acids pfca and sulfonamides fasa while pfesa shows slightly less adsorption to ps dvb resins than pfsa and ftsa park et al 2020 suspected that the higher adsorption of pfsa than pfca with the same chain length was because pfsa have more negative atomic charges per oxygen atom due to resonance stabilization there was no difference between the perfluorinated pfsa and the polyfluorinated ftsa when using ps dvb resins p 0 05 nevertheless the partially fluorinated ftsa showed less affinity to polymethacrylate resins than pfsa and the pfesa with two negative charges i e nbp 4 was removed the most among the sulfonates fig 2b it suggests that the degree of fluorination the insert of ether group additional carboxylic group and the net charge of pfas had different extents of impact on their removal when interacting with different resin polymers fasaa showed the lowest removal among pfas with eight perfluorinated carbons fig 2c the rest of pfas groups including pfca pfsa ftsa and fasa had no significantly different removal by either ps dvb or polyacrylic resins p 0 05 polymethacrylate resins preferred removing pfsa ftsa and fasa over pfca and fasaa the lower removal of fasaa suggests that a larger molecular head might adversely affect the removal of the pfas with longer c f chains interestingly although fasa are neutral and zwitterions carry positive charges table s4 their removal by resins was not significantly lower than the other pfas groups in 15 min 3 1 2 2 adsorption in long contact time when the contact time increased to 2 h and 24 h pfas adsorption became less impacted by pfas structures but strongly affected by the resin polymer matrices fig 1b and c for ps dvb resins 90 removal was achieved for pfca pfsa pfea ftsa and fasa after 2 h with insignificant differences across these pfas groups p 0 05 and their removal was significantly higher than fasaa and zwitterions p 0 05 higgins and luthy 2006 also reported the lowest adsorption of n etfosaa to sediment compared to pfds and pfuna zwitterions showed a wide range of removal percentages 36 97 the lower removal of fasaa and zwitterions after a long contact time could not be explained by their hydrophobicity but may be attributed to steric effects caused by their large molecular sizes table s4 although short chain pfas were commonly perceived as hard to remove by adsorption our results show that the tested five ps dvb resins successfully removed 80 99 of pfas with ncf 6 within 2 h some studies have reported desorption of short chain pfas after initial adsorption due to long chain pfas displacement maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019b however this phenomenon was not observed in our study probably because the low pfas concentrations we tested made competitive adsorption less pronounced less than 1 resin capacity utilized by pfas by the end of the tests nevertheless desorption likely occurred for fasaa and zwitterions with all resins fig 1 the result implies that the adsorption of pfas to resins could be weakened with large head groups for polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins pfas removal at 2 h and 24 h was significantly influenced by the pfas group and ncf fig 1b and c pfas with sulfonate groups were removed more than those with carboxyl groups in agreement with previous studies park et al 2020 zaggia et al 2016 for example with the same ncf more pfsa was removed than pfca and more pfesa were removed than pfeca also the polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins preferably adsorbed perfluorinated compounds over the polyfluorinated ones for example pfsa vs ftsa with the same ncf this is because the electron withdrawing sulfonate group in ftsa is connected to the electron donating ch2 group while sulfonate in pfsa is connected to the electron withdrawing cf2 group resulting in higher polarization of ftsa and thus lower hydrophobicity lower logdow in table s4 than pfsa with the same ncf in addition increasing ncf increased the removal of pfas in the same group because pfea are replacements for legacy pfaa while studies focusing on pfea are limited pfea removal at near equilibrium i e 24 h is further discussed fig 3 and fig s2 wang et al 2019a reported that pfoa strongly competed for the sorption sites with genx on resins and activated carbon due to the longer chain length of pfoa than genx therefore we evaluated the effect of the ether group on pfas removal based on the same ncf fig 3 the influence of the ether group on pfas adsorption to ps dvb and polyacrylic resins was insignificant in our study fig 3 for example comparing pfhxa genx and pfo4da all containing five perfluorinated carbons and 0 1 and 4 ether groups respectively there is no statistical difference in their removal p 0 05 further analysis of the data suggests that removing pfas with carboxylic groups i e pfca and pfeca is independent of ncf degree of fluorination or head groups except for pfeca adsorption by polymethacrylate resins fig s2 demonstrated that pfeca removal by polymethacrylate resins was positively correlated to logdow and molecular volume while negatively related to the absolute values of charge density and the trends were consistent for both mono ethers and multi ethers since the molecular volume logdow and the charge density are all related to the size of the molecules the trends shown in fig s2 overall confirmed the importance of hydrophobic and van der waals interaction in pfeca uptake by polymethacrylate resins although dixit et al 2020 reported a seemingly opposite trend that increasing the absolute values of charge density of pfeca increased their adsorption the inconsistency is likely due to their calculation and resin polymer type dixit et al used the same initial mass concentration of pfeca but concluded the relationship between charge density and molar removal converting their removal to a mass basis in the study of dixit et al 2020 the removal of pmpa pepa and genx were similar park et al 2020 additionally dixit et al 2020 used polyacrylic resin and such results of similar removal agree with our polyacrylic resin results 3 2 regeneration approaches and pfas recovery the top five performers of the screening tests a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 were all ps dvb resins and they were used to further identify the optimal regeneration approaches practical for drinking water treatment noted that the resins used in our regeneration experiments had 1 capacity consumed by pfas fig s3 shows the regeneration recoveries mass of pfas released to the aqueous phase vs mass of pfas preloaded on the resins with different regenerants the effect of anion was examined by comparing the sodium brines in chloride bicarbonate and acetate forms all at 0 5 without adjusting the regenerant ph approximately 6 the first three regenerants in fig s3 demonstrate that chloride salts worked the best for our five tested ps dvb resins followed by bicarbonate and acetate salts this trend is consistent with the selectivity of strong anion exchange resins cl 1 0 hco3 0 4 ch3coo 0 2 crittenden et al 2012 as well as the molar concentrations of these salts at equal mass concentration such results suggest that although bicarbonate is more eco friendly and had similar regeneration results with chloride for resins loaded with nitrate maul et al 2014 it is not suitable for pfas treatment by ps dvb resins probably due to the different adsorption mechanisms between pfas and nitrate by ix resins though anions are typically considered the key factor for regeneration zaggia et al 2016 showed cations may also play a role and found that ammonium worked better than sodium salt when regenerating pfas spent ix resins comparing regeneration with nacl and nh4cl in fig s3 our results also demonstrate that cations could influence the pfas recovery from ix resins for example nh4 works slightly better for tan1 while na shows higher recoveries for some pfas from ira910 since chloride performed the best among the tested three anions we evaluated the effect of cation by using the chloride salts of sodium ammonium and the mixture of sodium and ammonium in 0 5 brines for a592e pfa694e and dowex1 there was no statistically significant difference between nacl and nh4cl p 0 05 and both regenerants gave slightly higher recoveries than using the mixture of nacl and nh4cl based on the values of medians fig s3 therefore we chose nh4cl as the optimal salt type for a592e and pfa694e and nacl for dowex1 for the following tests considering the outliners with high recoveries based on the median values the optimal salt types for tan1 and ira910 are nh4cl and nacl respectively fig s3 alkaline regenerant such as 4 10 naoh is also commonly used for regenerating strong anion exchange resins in practice to compare the effect of regenerant ph on pfas recovery without changing the brine concentration we used 0 0 4 naoh to adjust the regenerant ph up to 13 in either nacl or nh4cl solution while keeping the total salt concentration 0 5 increasing the ph had little influence on the recovery of a592e pfa694e and tan1 p 0 05 and slightly reduced the recovery of dowex1 and ira910 fig s4 since the concentration of nh4cl or nacl decreased when more naoh was added to increase the ph and the increase in naoh concentration was higher than the decrease of nh4cl or nacl concentration on a molar basis our results indicate that naoh is a weaker regenerant than nh4cl or nacl to recover pfas a similar trend was observed for genx regeneration from ira400 a ps dvb benzyl trimethyl quaternary amine resin where genx recovery decreased from 80 to approximately 50 when changing the regenerant from 0 5 nacl to 0 5 naoh wang et al 2019a our genx recovery from pfas loaded ira910 also decreased from 31 6 to 15 1 when increasing ph of the regenerant from 6 to 13 i e nacl concentration reduced from 0 5 to 0 1 by weight on the contrary zaggia et al 2016 reported better pfas recovery by the mixture of 0 5 nacl and 0 5 naoh than 5 nacl from a600e a ps dvb trimethyl quaternary amine resin and a520e a ps dvb triethyl quaternary amine resin nevertheless zaggia et al 2016 attributed the improvement to the lower brine concentration because pfas solubility reduces when the ionic strength increases as discussed below regenerating ix resins usually requires concentrated brines at approximately 10 to release the adsorbed chemicals for example dixit et al 2020 reported above 85 recovery of genx from a860 a polyacrylic quaternary amine resin by 10 nacl however high brine concentrations could also inhibit recovery of some pfas such as pfos and pfoa due to the reduced pfas solubility at high salinity deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 for example zaggia et al 2016 found a mixture of 0 5 naoh and 0 5 nacl showed better pfas regeneration than 5 nacl for resin a600e and a520e however the dilute brine did not improve regeneration of a532e a ps dvb bifunctional quaternary amine resin under the same condition indicating that different resins might respond differently to salinity hence we evaluated the regeneration of pfas loaded resins at brine concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 10 fig s5 shows that increasing brine concentrations enhanced the regeneration of all five tested ps dvb resins to various extents little pfas was released from any resin using 0 01 brine and the median average recoveries for a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 increased to 8 4 5 16 and 22 respectively by 10 brine fig s5 to find an efficient while practical regeneration approach less than 20 v v methanol was added into the 10 brine adding up to 20 methanol showed limited enhancement of pfas regeneration for dowex1 but led to no change for the rest four ps dvb resins fig s6 such results are consistent with previous reports that improvement in pfas release by adding organic solvents to the nacl regenerant was insignificant when the percentage of organic solvent was less than 50 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 because using high percentages of organic solvents is challenging in full scale water treatment using 10 simple chloride salts without organic solvents might be the most reasonable option for regenerating pfas loaded ps dvb resins fig 4 illustrates the regeneration recovery for each pfas and resin using a 10 brine the optimal condition found in our study the two gel type resins pfa694e and dowex1 show 50 recovery for almost all pfas especially for the pfas specific pfa694e which had the lowest recovery 25 in fig 4 meanwhile a few pfas compounds were released more than 50 back to the 10 nh4cl solution from the other pfas specific resin a592e ira910 showed the greatest regeneration recovery among the tested five resins followed by tan1 fig 4 our results suggest that macroporous resins are more regenerable than gel type potentially because the size exclusion effect in the gel type resins hindered the adsorbed pfas molecules from diffusing back to the bulk solution similarly using 0 5 nh4oh 0 5 nh4cl was reported successful in recovering 41 68 of legacy pfaa from the gel type resin a600e and 74 86 from the macroporous resin a520e zaggia et al 2016 furthermore the functional groups on resins could influence the regeneration as dimethyl ethanol ammonium has slightly better recovery than quaternary ammonium crittenden et al 2012 dow 2002 it explains the greatest pfas recoveries from ira910 macroporous dimethyl ethanol ammonium in our study overall our results suggest that resin regeneration for drinking water treatment might be limited for most pfas except short chain pfca and pfeca because the interactions between pfas and resins are too strong to be replaced by regenerant resin interaction regardless of the salt type concentration ph even with a small portion of organic solvent when the ncf is above 6 less than 50 recovery was achieved regardless of the pfas and resin types whereas pfas with shorter chain length had significantly higher recovery fig 4 the highest recoveries are 89 pfba from a592e 91 pfo3oa from tan1 and 94 nvhos from ira910 carter and farrell 2010 also observed a slightly better regeneration of pfbs 4 than pfos 0 36 using naoh as the regenerant contrarily zaggia et al 2016 reported higher pfoa and pfos recoveries than pfba and pfbs by a mixture of 0 5 nh4cl and 0 5 nh4oh from resins a600e and a520e and suggested that ion exchange was the primary mechanism for pfba and pfbs yet it could be the secondary interactions for pfoa based on the ratio of pfas adsorption to the released chloride from reacting ix resins meanwhile other pfas groups had limited recovery by the 10 brine even for the short chain compounds fig 4 additionally while fasaa and zwitterions show less affinity to ps dvb resins during screening tests fig 1 their recoveries from the pfas loaded resins were negligible combing the regeneration results with the adsorption results for fasaa and zwitterions it seems some molecules adsorbed on the resin surface and easily detached early during the loading stage fig 1c whereas the sustaining molecules diffused into the resin inner pores and could not be easily regenerated due to steric effects of their large head groups leading to such desorption hysteresis our systematical experiment results reveal that the regeneration recovery for pfas loaded resins strongly depends on the resin type and pfas chain length meanwhile the regenerant type ph and the percentage of organic solvent in a practical range had limited influence for regenerable resins the brine concentration and pfas structure could further determine the recovery during regeneration however some conflict findings remain between our results and literature such as whether diluted or concentrated brine works better and if long chain pfas are harder to regenerate since the resins reported in the literature are different from what we tested the regeneration recovery likely varies by resin properties notwithstanding the pfas specific resins are non regenerable in our study via the conventional regeneration approaches consistent with the manufacturer s recommendation of one time use however there are some novel regeneration ideas published recently for example activated persulfate oxidation is a promising in situ regeneration method for degrading pfca gao et al 2021 also sulfate usually is not used as the regenerant because its high affinity to strong base anion resins could hinder the following adsorption cycle while laura del moral et al 2020 showed higher pfas removal using resins in sulfate forms than in chloride forms these studies used regenerable resins while it is unclear whether the same approaches could regenerate pfas specific resins given that simple salt solutions do not effectively release pfas from resins and it is not practical to regenerate resins every cycle with organic solvents maybe a more practical operation is to regenerate resins with simple salt solutions to release other components in water major anions natural organic matter adsorbed together with pfas to release these sites for pfas uptake in the following round of application park et al 2020 after multiple cycles when the pfas uptake capacity diminishes it can be determined if it is more feasible to use organic solvents to completely restore the resin capacity for continuous use or dispose of the exhausted resins at that point rather than disposing of the resins after one use as suggested by some vendors in this study we tested various pfas by a large collection of resins trying to generalize the key impacts of both the adsorbents and adsorbates pfas removal and resin regeneration are complicated due to multiple electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions involved in these processes our results suggest that emerging pfas containing unique functional groups may interact with resins distinctively from legacy pfaa so it may not be accurate to use pfaa behaviors to predict the removal and regeneration of emerging pfas if additional emerging pfas are identified at levels threatening drinking water safety future studies may still be needed to examine the effectiveness of their removal by ix moreover while ix is demonstrated effective as an immediate solution for removing both legacy and emerging pfas destructive methods are still needed to solve the pfas problem in the long term 4 conclusion ix resins with ps dvb matrix showed the highest pfas uptake from groundwater as 35 of the tested 40 pfas compounds show above 90 removal under the tested conditions meanwhile polyacrylic resins showed the least pfas removal and evidence of desorption within 24 h increasing the fluorinated chain length i e ncf increased pfas adsorption to the resins and further influenced how other pfas properties affected adsorption before equilibrium with ncf 4 functional groups and charges of pfas had limited impacts on adsorption indicating the fluorinated tail plays an important role in the interaction with resins with ncf of 6 pfeca and zwitterions showed the highest uptake compared to other pfas groups likely due to longer total chain length counting non fluorinated carbon and ether groups however increasing the ncf to 8 fasaa with longer total chain length were uptaken less than other pfas groups removal of neutral and zwitterionic pfas was comparable to anionic pfas in 15 minute resin contact time indicating the electrostatic interactions might be minor during the initial sorption phase besides fasaa and zwitterions adsorbed on the resins may be replaced by other pfas past 15 min gel type resins demonstrated faster sorption than macroporous resins for ps dvb resins among the five ps dvb resins 10 brine could recover above 50 of adsorbed short chain pfca and pfeca from tan1 and ira910 while the pfas specific resin pfa694e is essentially non regenerable under all tested conditions increasing the brine concentration from 0 01 to 10 and using salts in the chloride form enhanced regeneration meanwhile changing the brine cation adjusting regenerant ph or adding less than 20 methanol had little enhancement on regeneration

16483,ion exchange ix is a promising technology to remove legacy anionic per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas from water as increasing numbers of per and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids pfea and other emerging pfas were detected in the environment it is necessary to understand how well ix resins remove these emerging pfas for drinking water treatment in this study nine commercially available ix resins were tested to treat a drinking water source spiked with 40 legacy and emerging pfas at 600 ng l including pfea perfluoroalkyl carboxylic and sulfonic acids fluorotelomer sulfonic acids perfluoroalkane sulfonamides perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoacetic acids and zwitterionic species with limited contact time 15 min pfas properties such as the fluorinated chain length charge and functional groups all affected pfas adsorption to resins however the impact of pfas properties on pfas removal became less pronounced when the contact time increased beyond 2 h while the resin polymer matrix became the critical factor for pfas removal all five tested polystyrene divinylbenzene ps dvb resins achieved more than 90 removal in 24 h of 35 pfas compounds while polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins achieved 90 removal for less than half of the compounds regenerating ps dvb resin was investigated using different salt species regenerant ph brine concentrations and methanol contents sodium chloride and ammonium chloride were found the best brines for regenerating the tested resins increasing brine concentrations enhanced the regeneration efficiency especially for short chain pfas using simple salt regenerants up to 94 of selected short chain pfas was released from resins designed for general water treatment but no meaningful regeneration was achieved for long chain pfas or pfas specific resins when the organic solvent content was less than 20 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords genx zwitterionic pfas neutral pfas pfea pfca pfsa 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas refer to a large group of fluorinated aliphatic chemicals with an estimated number of 5000 types existing over the globe itrc 2020 usepa 2019 because of their unique properties such as resistance to water oil and heat pfas have been intensively introduced to various industrials household products and firefighting applications itrc 2020 usepa 2019 the stability and wide use of pfas made them ubiquitous in the environment and accumulated in humans drinking pfas contaminated water is a significant exposure pathway to humans domingo and nadal 2019 usepa 2019 thus more strict pfas regulations are being adopted on drinking water nowadays adsorption by activated carbon or anion exchange ix resin is one of the few effective technologies for removing pfas among the drinking water treatment processes used in practice gagliano et al 2020 hopkins et al 2018 previous studies show that ix resins outperformed activated carbon in removing pfas especially short chain pfas gagliano et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 as a result studies using ix to remove pfas from contaminated water increased in these years dixit et al 2020 laura del moral et al 2020 maimaiti et al 2018 park et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b zaggia et al 2016 and manufacturers marketed resins with high selectivity for pfas e g purolite a592e

out of long chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos emerging pfas were manufactured to replace legacy pfaa compounds in the pfea group for example were identified at hundreds of ng l in the cape fear river basin near a fluoropolymers manufacturing plant in north carolina usa hopkins et al 2018 strynar et al 2015 sun et al 2016 as well as other places worldwide gebbink et al 2017 heydebreck et al 2015 compared to legacy pfaa literature focusing on removing pfea by ix is limited to date only nine publications reported the application of ix resins to remove pfas other than pfaa while six of them just included one or two emerging species boyer et al 2021 making it difficult to conclude how pfas properties affect their removal meanwhile research on emerging pfas mostly focused on genx and f 53b two alternatives for pfoa and pfos ateia et al 2019 dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019a however other pfea potentially present at much higher concentrations and more difficult to remove are overlooked similarly zwitterionic pfas associated with firefighting foams are absent from ix treatment studies fang et al 2021 itrc 2020 and may have very different removal performance from commonly studied anionic pfaa as more emerging pfas with different properties are identified in drinking water sources there is a need for evaluating the adsorption of pfas other than pfaa onto ix resins the performance of ix in removing pfas could be affected by the resin properties including polymer matrix porosity and functional groups gagliano et al 2020 nevertheless conclusions from previous studies regarding the role of resin properties are inconsistent for example one study showed more pfaa were adsorbed by polystyrene resin a520e from groundwater than polyacrylic resin a860 laura del moral et al 2020 while other studies reported higher capacity for genx pfoa and pfos onto polyacrylic resin ira67 and ira958 than polystyrene resin ira400 and ira900 deng et al 2010 wang et al 2019a moreover most previous studies evaluate the performance of just a couple of resins on pfas removal hence the results from one study are inadequate to conclude the critical role of resin properties meanwhile these studies were conducted with a wide range of initial pfas concentrations ng l to mg l in different water matrices making inter study comparison difficult thus the role of resin properties in adsorbing pfas remains obscure and it could increase the difficulty in determining the appropriate resin for water treatment facilities furthermore studies using pfas specific resins to remove pfas are limited dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021 hence a more systematic understanding of the key resin properties in removing pfas under ambient environmental conditions is needed regenerating pfas exhausted resins is challenging because of the high affinity of the resins for pfas and or the reduced solubility of pfas in concentrated brine and the regeneration recoveries and the appropriate strategies vary depending on the pfas and resin properties while some studies have achieved 80 recovery using simple brines dixit et al 2020 zaggia et al 2016 most studies failed to achieve more than 70 regeneration unless when 30 80 methanol or ethanol was used in the regenerant carter and farrell 2010 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 using a high percentage of organic solvents is not practical for water treatment from both the safety and cost perspectives yet whether regenerating the pfas exhausted resins by much lower solvent contents i e 20 is feasible remains a question in addition studies on regenerating resins loaded with pfas other than pfaa are limited to just genx f 53b and fluorotelomer sulfonic acids boyer et al 2021 while information on the release of other emerging pfas from resins is needed the objective of this study is to fill the knowledge gaps mentioned above for removing legacy and emerging pfas by ix we evaluated the effectiveness of nine commercially available ix resins with various properties in removing 40 legacy and emerging pfas from a drinking water source the best performing five resins were further tested for regeneration this study gives insights on 1 how effective ix is to remove emerging pfas 2 what properties of pfas and resins play important roles in pfas removal and 3 which practical regeneration conditions would work for spent resin and what the corresponding recovery of each pfas and resin could achieve under the optimal regeneration conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances eight groups of pfas were tested in this study including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfca perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsa fluorotelomer sulfonic acids ftsa per and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfeca per and polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids pfesa perfluoroalkane sulfonamides fasa perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoacetic acids fasaa and zwitterionic species associated with firefighting foams table 1 a total of forty pfas compounds were studied from these groups based on their occurrence in the drinking water sources in north carolina mccord and strynar 2019 availability of analytical standards and capability of our analytical methods the chemical structures of some emerging pfas are summarized in fig s1 in the supporting information si information on the chemicals used in this project is summarized in si 2 1 2 anion exchange resins nine commercially available anion exchange resins were assessed in our screening test table s2 these resins were chosen based on their good performance in removing pfas in previous studies deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 lundgren 2014 maimaiti et al 2018 besides the two purolite resins a592e and pfa694e are tested as novel pfas selective products on the market 2 1 3 water the matrix used in this study to test pfas removal was a drinking water source groundwater from a private well with known pfas contamination from a nearby fluorochemical manufactory in fayetteville nc the groundwater sample was collected on april 24 2019 and stored at 4 c until use due to the low ph of the raw groundwater around ph 3 8 sodium bicarbonate 50 mg l was used to adjust the ph to 7 0 0 2 the ph adjusted groundwater was filtered by 0 7 µm glass fiber membranes prior to use background pfas concentrations in the groundwater and other water characteristics are summarized in table s3 2 2 methods 2 2 1 screening tests screening tests were conducted in groundwater spiked with all pfas listed in table 1 to 600 ng l each except pmpa at 1161 ng l the original concentration in the groundwater table s3 the resins at a dose of 5 ml l and groundwater were mixed continuously at 150 rpm on an orbital shaker at room temperature around 21 c aqueous samples were collected after 15 min 2 h and 24 h of mixing the samples were filtered by 0 2 µm glass microfiber syringe filters and analyzed for pfas concentrations solution ph and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 little changes in solution ph and uv254 were observed hence these results are not presented all experiments were conducted in 50 ml polypropylene centrifugal tubes in duplicates the relative standard deviations of the duplicates are small 5 and thus the averages of the duplicates are presented and used for data analysis in the following content controls were conducted in 50 ml spiked groundwater without ix resins under the same conditions changes in pfas concentrations before and after the control tests were within 10 demonstrating little pfas loss or contamination in the test procedures 2 2 2 regeneration tests the best performing resins from the screening tests a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 were selected for regeneration pfas loaded resins were prepared by mixing 5 ml l resins with spiked groundwater at initial pfas concentrations of 1000 ng l each except pmpa at 1161 ng l for 24 h the mass of pfas on the resins was calculated using the initial and remaining aqueous phase pfas concentrations assuming a mass balance then the pfas loaded resins were mixed with regenerant solutions at 5 ml l for 3 h tested regeneration conditions include different salts nacl nh4cl nahco3 ch3coona and ch3coonh4 salt concentrations 0 01 10 by weight ph 6 9 11 and 13 and methanol contents 0 20 by volume 2 2 3 analytical method and data analysis the concentrations of pfas in the aqueous phase were analyzed by a liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry analysis of variance method was used to evaluate the statistical significance of pfas and resin properties for the adsorption details are described in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening tests 3 1 1 the impact of resin properties pfas removal from the spiked groundwater by the nine resins after 15 min 2 h and 24 h is illustrated in fig 1 the resin polymer matrix plays an important role in removing pfas since pfas removal by the polymethacrylate resin miex gold and the polymethacrylate dvb resin miex doc shows no significant difference p 0 05 the two resins are discussed in the same category despite the slight difference in their polymer matrices at 15 min polystyrene divinylbenzene ps dvb resins including a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 removed similar amounts of pfas as polymethacrylate resins miex gold and doc meanwhile the two polyacrylic resins ira67 and ira958 showed the least removal fig 1a with reaction time increased to 2 24 h the ps dvb resins outperformed the other two polymers fig 1b and c the significance of the polymer matrix in removing pfas was also observed in previous studies deng et al 2010 laura del moral et al 2020 wang et al 2019a because the ps dvb polymer aromatic hydrocarbon backbone is more hydrophobic than the polymethacrylate aliphatic ester backbone and polyacrylic matrices aliphatic carboxylic acid backbone purolite 2019 wang et al 2019a the higher pfas removal by ps dvb resins could be attributed to hydrophobic interactions this result agrees with previous studies where the ps dvb resins showed higher pfaa removal from groundwater than other resin polymers laura del moral et al 2020 maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 however deng et al 2010 observed faster kinetic and higher adsorption capacity of pfos to polyacrylic resins than to ps dvb resins in deionized water at ph 3 at much higher initial pfos concentrations 200 400 mg l notwithstanding pfos removal is heavily driven by hydrophobic interaction between pfos and water molecules aggregation among pfos molecules and air water interface enrichment comparably the pfos resin interactions become less important thus using pfos to compare performance of different resin polymers may be misleading in addition wang et al 2019a observed the impact of resin polymers on genx adsorption consistent with our observations at ph 2 6 8 and 10 but the opposite at ph 4 suggesting the role of resin polymers in determining pfas removal may also be affected by protonation of the amino functional groups maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019a in our screening tests the resin pore structure gel vs macroporous did not significantly influence pfas removal p 0 05 consistent with previous studies deng et al 2010 dudley 2012 zaggia et al 2016 similarly other resin properties including functional groups capacity and particle size had no significant impact on their pfas removal performance while the screening tests were not designed to systematically reveal pfas uptake kinetics results in fig 1a suggest that with a limited contact time gel type resins achieved higher pfas removal than macroporous resins among the five ps dvb resins for example between the two pfas selective resins pfa694e gel type removed above 50 of all the tested pfaa within 15 min while a592e macroporous only achieved 50 removal for 10 out of the 16 tested pfaa fig 1a similarly the average fasaa removal in 2 h is 36 by tan1 macroporous and 71 by dowex1 gel type fig 1b dudley et al 2015 also observed more rapid removal of pfas by gel type ps dvb resins compared to macroporous ones within 20 min and explained the observation with the smaller particle diameter or larger capacity of the gel type resins than macroporous resins in their study dudley et al 2015 similarly the faster removal by gel ps dvb resins in our study could result from the smaller particle diameter of pfa694e than a592e and the larger capacity of dowex1 than tan1 table s2 both contributing to more adsorption sites accessible to pfas the two polymethacrylate resins miex gold and doc adsorbed less short chain pfas compared to ps dvb resins after 2 h and no further adsorption was observed between 2 and 24 h fig 1b and c the removal of pfaa by miex doc in our study was 1 1 5 fold higher than what park et al 2020 reported at a higher resin dose 8 ml l from groundwater spiked with 300 ng l pfas since miex resins are typically used to remove dissolved organic carbon and mineral anions while the groundwater used by park et al 2020 contained 1 6 fold higher dissolved organic carbon and 1 3 fold higher ionic strength than in our groundwater the higher pfas removal in our study than the study of park et al 2020 was likely due to competition from these constituents polyacrylic resins ira67 and ira958 are deemed ineffective in removing pfas from groundwater based on results in fig 1 these resins not only showed the least pfas removal among the tested nine but also desorbed pfas after 2 h removal of long chain pfca pfsa ftsa pfeca fasa and fasaa decreased from above 50 at 2 h to less than 50 at 24 h fig 1b and c while the removal of the short chain compounds either did not change or increased slightly in a few case and the total pfas mass on each resin at 24 h was less than that at 2 h while the exact reason leading to the desorption of long chain pfas from these resins was unclear the results demonstrated the weak bonding of long chain pfas to the hydrophilic polyacrylic resins and indicate that the removals of long chain pfas and short chain pfas could be controlled by different mechanisms the impacts of pfas properties on ix removal will be discussed in the next section 3 1 2 the effect of pfas properties typically an anionic pfas molecule contains a non ionic hydrophobic fluorinated tail and an anionic functional group head the tail facilitates pfas non electrostatic adsorption via hydrophobic and van der waals interactions the head enables electrostatic adsorption with the anion exchange resins and the whole surfactant molecules exhibit additional removal mechanisms like molecular aggregation and air water interface enrichment boyer et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 meng et al 2014 wang et al 2019a zaggia et al 2016 thus pfas with different molecular structures behave differently in ix removal and the properties of pfas such as functional groups in the head and the number of fluorinated carbon atoms ncf in the tail could influence pfas removal by the resins table s4 3 1 2 1 adsorption in short contact time within limited contact time 15 min several pfas properties significantly affected the adsorption onto resins p 0 05 including the degree of fluorination perfluorinated vs polyfluorinated functional group and ncf increasing ncf in each pfas group increased adsorption regardless of the resin polymer matrix fig 1a consistent with previous adsorption studies gagliano et al 2020 park et al 2020 zaggia et al 2016 longer chains lead to greater hydrophobicity logdow and van der waals force which contributes to the higher affinity of pfas for the resins furthermore long chains pfas trend to partition into the air water interface in air bubbles which consequently are trapped by the resin and contribute to the observed removal from the aqueous phase meng et al 2014 long chain pfas removal may also be attributed to micelle hemimicelle and admicelle formation yu et al 2009 however this mechanism should not be important in this study since the tested pfas concentration 600 ng l was much lower than the critical micelle concentration at g l level yu et al 2009 at a given ncf pfas removal was further influenced by other properties when ncf 4 adsorption was almost the same across different pfas groups within each resin polymer type while pfsa and pfesa showed higher removal than other pfas groups by polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins fig 2 a even the neutral fbsa from the fasa group showed no significant difference compared to other anionic pfas with the same chain length such similarity implies that the physisorption determined by the fluorinated tail rather than the electrostatic force determined by the functional groups and charges drives short chain pfas adsorption because the electrostatic force is less important while the physisorption is not strong enough for short chain pfas the overall removal was low for pfas with ncf 4 increasing the ncf to 6 zwitterions and pfeca show the highest removal at the 15 minute contact time regardless of resin polymer types fig 2b the highest affinity of zwitterions and pfeca to resins could be associated with their longer total chain length contributed by the methylene or ether groups similarly pfeca showed higher adsorption than pfca with the same ncf by activated carbon possible because the ether oxygen atom shielded by the neighboring fluorine atoms cannot participate in hydrogen bonding thus the ether oxygen behaves more like carbon and essentially increases the chain length han et al 2021 du et al 2016 also reported higher adsorption of f 53b a chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate with the same ncf as pfos by activated carbon than pfos and the result was attributed to the ether group insertion in the f 53b molecules however the additional ch2 groups in ftsa did not improve adsorption as much as they did in the zwitterions suggesting the relative location between the methylene chain and the functional group also determines adsorption affinity among other pfas groups with ncf 6 sulfonates pfsa ftsa and pfesa were adsorbed more to polyacrylic resins than carboxylic acids pfca and sulfonamides fasa while pfesa shows slightly less adsorption to ps dvb resins than pfsa and ftsa park et al 2020 suspected that the higher adsorption of pfsa than pfca with the same chain length was because pfsa have more negative atomic charges per oxygen atom due to resonance stabilization there was no difference between the perfluorinated pfsa and the polyfluorinated ftsa when using ps dvb resins p 0 05 nevertheless the partially fluorinated ftsa showed less affinity to polymethacrylate resins than pfsa and the pfesa with two negative charges i e nbp 4 was removed the most among the sulfonates fig 2b it suggests that the degree of fluorination the insert of ether group additional carboxylic group and the net charge of pfas had different extents of impact on their removal when interacting with different resin polymers fasaa showed the lowest removal among pfas with eight perfluorinated carbons fig 2c the rest of pfas groups including pfca pfsa ftsa and fasa had no significantly different removal by either ps dvb or polyacrylic resins p 0 05 polymethacrylate resins preferred removing pfsa ftsa and fasa over pfca and fasaa the lower removal of fasaa suggests that a larger molecular head might adversely affect the removal of the pfas with longer c f chains interestingly although fasa are neutral and zwitterions carry positive charges table s4 their removal by resins was not significantly lower than the other pfas groups in 15 min 3 1 2 2 adsorption in long contact time when the contact time increased to 2 h and 24 h pfas adsorption became less impacted by pfas structures but strongly affected by the resin polymer matrices fig 1b and c for ps dvb resins 90 removal was achieved for pfca pfsa pfea ftsa and fasa after 2 h with insignificant differences across these pfas groups p 0 05 and their removal was significantly higher than fasaa and zwitterions p 0 05 higgins and luthy 2006 also reported the lowest adsorption of n etfosaa to sediment compared to pfds and pfuna zwitterions showed a wide range of removal percentages 36 97 the lower removal of fasaa and zwitterions after a long contact time could not be explained by their hydrophobicity but may be attributed to steric effects caused by their large molecular sizes table s4 although short chain pfas were commonly perceived as hard to remove by adsorption our results show that the tested five ps dvb resins successfully removed 80 99 of pfas with ncf 6 within 2 h some studies have reported desorption of short chain pfas after initial adsorption due to long chain pfas displacement maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019b however this phenomenon was not observed in our study probably because the low pfas concentrations we tested made competitive adsorption less pronounced less than 1 resin capacity utilized by pfas by the end of the tests nevertheless desorption likely occurred for fasaa and zwitterions with all resins fig 1 the result implies that the adsorption of pfas to resins could be weakened with large head groups for polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins pfas removal at 2 h and 24 h was significantly influenced by the pfas group and ncf fig 1b and c pfas with sulfonate groups were removed more than those with carboxyl groups in agreement with previous studies park et al 2020 zaggia et al 2016 for example with the same ncf more pfsa was removed than pfca and more pfesa were removed than pfeca also the polymethacrylate and polyacrylic resins preferably adsorbed perfluorinated compounds over the polyfluorinated ones for example pfsa vs ftsa with the same ncf this is because the electron withdrawing sulfonate group in ftsa is connected to the electron donating ch2 group while sulfonate in pfsa is connected to the electron withdrawing cf2 group resulting in higher polarization of ftsa and thus lower hydrophobicity lower logdow in table s4 than pfsa with the same ncf in addition increasing ncf increased the removal of pfas in the same group because pfea are replacements for legacy pfaa while studies focusing on pfea are limited pfea removal at near equilibrium i e 24 h is further discussed fig 3 and fig s2 wang et al 2019a reported that pfoa strongly competed for the sorption sites with genx on resins and activated carbon due to the longer chain length of pfoa than genx therefore we evaluated the effect of the ether group on pfas removal based on the same ncf fig 3 the influence of the ether group on pfas adsorption to ps dvb and polyacrylic resins was insignificant in our study fig 3 for example comparing pfhxa genx and pfo4da all containing five perfluorinated carbons and 0 1 and 4 ether groups respectively there is no statistical difference in their removal p 0 05 further analysis of the data suggests that removing pfas with carboxylic groups i e pfca and pfeca is independent of ncf degree of fluorination or head groups except for pfeca adsorption by polymethacrylate resins fig s2 demonstrated that pfeca removal by polymethacrylate resins was positively correlated to logdow and molecular volume while negatively related to the absolute values of charge density and the trends were consistent for both mono ethers and multi ethers since the molecular volume logdow and the charge density are all related to the size of the molecules the trends shown in fig s2 overall confirmed the importance of hydrophobic and van der waals interaction in pfeca uptake by polymethacrylate resins although dixit et al 2020 reported a seemingly opposite trend that increasing the absolute values of charge density of pfeca increased their adsorption the inconsistency is likely due to their calculation and resin polymer type dixit et al used the same initial mass concentration of pfeca but concluded the relationship between charge density and molar removal converting their removal to a mass basis in the study of dixit et al 2020 the removal of pmpa pepa and genx were similar park et al 2020 additionally dixit et al 2020 used polyacrylic resin and such results of similar removal agree with our polyacrylic resin results 3 2 regeneration approaches and pfas recovery the top five performers of the screening tests a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 were all ps dvb resins and they were used to further identify the optimal regeneration approaches practical for drinking water treatment noted that the resins used in our regeneration experiments had 1 capacity consumed by pfas fig s3 shows the regeneration recoveries mass of pfas released to the aqueous phase vs mass of pfas preloaded on the resins with different regenerants the effect of anion was examined by comparing the sodium brines in chloride bicarbonate and acetate forms all at 0 5 without adjusting the regenerant ph approximately 6 the first three regenerants in fig s3 demonstrate that chloride salts worked the best for our five tested ps dvb resins followed by bicarbonate and acetate salts this trend is consistent with the selectivity of strong anion exchange resins cl 1 0 hco3 0 4 ch3coo 0 2 crittenden et al 2012 as well as the molar concentrations of these salts at equal mass concentration such results suggest that although bicarbonate is more eco friendly and had similar regeneration results with chloride for resins loaded with nitrate maul et al 2014 it is not suitable for pfas treatment by ps dvb resins probably due to the different adsorption mechanisms between pfas and nitrate by ix resins though anions are typically considered the key factor for regeneration zaggia et al 2016 showed cations may also play a role and found that ammonium worked better than sodium salt when regenerating pfas spent ix resins comparing regeneration with nacl and nh4cl in fig s3 our results also demonstrate that cations could influence the pfas recovery from ix resins for example nh4 works slightly better for tan1 while na shows higher recoveries for some pfas from ira910 since chloride performed the best among the tested three anions we evaluated the effect of cation by using the chloride salts of sodium ammonium and the mixture of sodium and ammonium in 0 5 brines for a592e pfa694e and dowex1 there was no statistically significant difference between nacl and nh4cl p 0 05 and both regenerants gave slightly higher recoveries than using the mixture of nacl and nh4cl based on the values of medians fig s3 therefore we chose nh4cl as the optimal salt type for a592e and pfa694e and nacl for dowex1 for the following tests considering the outliners with high recoveries based on the median values the optimal salt types for tan1 and ira910 are nh4cl and nacl respectively fig s3 alkaline regenerant such as 4 10 naoh is also commonly used for regenerating strong anion exchange resins in practice to compare the effect of regenerant ph on pfas recovery without changing the brine concentration we used 0 0 4 naoh to adjust the regenerant ph up to 13 in either nacl or nh4cl solution while keeping the total salt concentration 0 5 increasing the ph had little influence on the recovery of a592e pfa694e and tan1 p 0 05 and slightly reduced the recovery of dowex1 and ira910 fig s4 since the concentration of nh4cl or nacl decreased when more naoh was added to increase the ph and the increase in naoh concentration was higher than the decrease of nh4cl or nacl concentration on a molar basis our results indicate that naoh is a weaker regenerant than nh4cl or nacl to recover pfas a similar trend was observed for genx regeneration from ira400 a ps dvb benzyl trimethyl quaternary amine resin where genx recovery decreased from 80 to approximately 50 when changing the regenerant from 0 5 nacl to 0 5 naoh wang et al 2019a our genx recovery from pfas loaded ira910 also decreased from 31 6 to 15 1 when increasing ph of the regenerant from 6 to 13 i e nacl concentration reduced from 0 5 to 0 1 by weight on the contrary zaggia et al 2016 reported better pfas recovery by the mixture of 0 5 nacl and 0 5 naoh than 5 nacl from a600e a ps dvb trimethyl quaternary amine resin and a520e a ps dvb triethyl quaternary amine resin nevertheless zaggia et al 2016 attributed the improvement to the lower brine concentration because pfas solubility reduces when the ionic strength increases as discussed below regenerating ix resins usually requires concentrated brines at approximately 10 to release the adsorbed chemicals for example dixit et al 2020 reported above 85 recovery of genx from a860 a polyacrylic quaternary amine resin by 10 nacl however high brine concentrations could also inhibit recovery of some pfas such as pfos and pfoa due to the reduced pfas solubility at high salinity deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 for example zaggia et al 2016 found a mixture of 0 5 naoh and 0 5 nacl showed better pfas regeneration than 5 nacl for resin a600e and a520e however the dilute brine did not improve regeneration of a532e a ps dvb bifunctional quaternary amine resin under the same condition indicating that different resins might respond differently to salinity hence we evaluated the regeneration of pfas loaded resins at brine concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 10 fig s5 shows that increasing brine concentrations enhanced the regeneration of all five tested ps dvb resins to various extents little pfas was released from any resin using 0 01 brine and the median average recoveries for a592e pfa694e dowex1 tan1 and ira910 increased to 8 4 5 16 and 22 respectively by 10 brine fig s5 to find an efficient while practical regeneration approach less than 20 v v methanol was added into the 10 brine adding up to 20 methanol showed limited enhancement of pfas regeneration for dowex1 but led to no change for the rest four ps dvb resins fig s6 such results are consistent with previous reports that improvement in pfas release by adding organic solvents to the nacl regenerant was insignificant when the percentage of organic solvent was less than 50 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 because using high percentages of organic solvents is challenging in full scale water treatment using 10 simple chloride salts without organic solvents might be the most reasonable option for regenerating pfas loaded ps dvb resins fig 4 illustrates the regeneration recovery for each pfas and resin using a 10 brine the optimal condition found in our study the two gel type resins pfa694e and dowex1 show 50 recovery for almost all pfas especially for the pfas specific pfa694e which had the lowest recovery 25 in fig 4 meanwhile a few pfas compounds were released more than 50 back to the 10 nh4cl solution from the other pfas specific resin a592e ira910 showed the greatest regeneration recovery among the tested five resins followed by tan1 fig 4 our results suggest that macroporous resins are more regenerable than gel type potentially because the size exclusion effect in the gel type resins hindered the adsorbed pfas molecules from diffusing back to the bulk solution similarly using 0 5 nh4oh 0 5 nh4cl was reported successful in recovering 41 68 of legacy pfaa from the gel type resin a600e and 74 86 from the macroporous resin a520e zaggia et al 2016 furthermore the functional groups on resins could influence the regeneration as dimethyl ethanol ammonium has slightly better recovery than quaternary ammonium crittenden et al 2012 dow 2002 it explains the greatest pfas recoveries from ira910 macroporous dimethyl ethanol ammonium in our study overall our results suggest that resin regeneration for drinking water treatment might be limited for most pfas except short chain pfca and pfeca because the interactions between pfas and resins are too strong to be replaced by regenerant resin interaction regardless of the salt type concentration ph even with a small portion of organic solvent when the ncf is above 6 less than 50 recovery was achieved regardless of the pfas and resin types whereas pfas with shorter chain length had significantly higher recovery fig 4 the highest recoveries are 89 pfba from a592e 91 pfo3oa from tan1 and 94 nvhos from ira910 carter and farrell 2010 also observed a slightly better regeneration of pfbs 4 than pfos 0 36 using naoh as the regenerant contrarily zaggia et al 2016 reported higher pfoa and pfos recoveries than pfba and pfbs by a mixture of 0 5 nh4cl and 0 5 nh4oh from resins a600e and a520e and suggested that ion exchange was the primary mechanism for pfba and pfbs yet it could be the secondary interactions for pfoa based on the ratio of pfas adsorption to the released chloride from reacting ix resins meanwhile other pfas groups had limited recovery by the 10 brine even for the short chain compounds fig 4 additionally while fasaa and zwitterions show less affinity to ps dvb resins during screening tests fig 1 their recoveries from the pfas loaded resins were negligible combing the regeneration results with the adsorption results for fasaa and zwitterions it seems some molecules adsorbed on the resin surface and easily detached early during the loading stage fig 1c whereas the sustaining molecules diffused into the resin inner pores and could not be easily regenerated due to steric effects of their large head groups leading to such desorption hysteresis our systematical experiment results reveal that the regeneration recovery for pfas loaded resins strongly depends on the resin type and pfas chain length meanwhile the regenerant type ph and the percentage of organic solvent in a practical range had limited influence for regenerable resins the brine concentration and pfas structure could further determine the recovery during regeneration however some conflict findings remain between our results and literature such as whether diluted or concentrated brine works better and if long chain pfas are harder to regenerate since the resins reported in the literature are different from what we tested the regeneration recovery likely varies by resin properties notwithstanding the pfas specific resins are non regenerable in our study via the conventional regeneration approaches consistent with the manufacturer s recommendation of one time use however there are some novel regeneration ideas published recently for example activated persulfate oxidation is a promising in situ regeneration method for degrading pfca gao et al 2021 also sulfate usually is not used as the regenerant because its high affinity to strong base anion resins could hinder the following adsorption cycle while laura del moral et al 2020 showed higher pfas removal using resins in sulfate forms than in chloride forms these studies used regenerable resins while it is unclear whether the same approaches could regenerate pfas specific resins given that simple salt solutions do not effectively release pfas from resins and it is not practical to regenerate resins every cycle with organic solvents maybe a more practical operation is to regenerate resins with simple salt solutions to release other components in water major anions natural organic matter adsorbed together with pfas to release these sites for pfas uptake in the following round of application park et al 2020 after multiple cycles when the pfas uptake capacity diminishes it can be determined if it is more feasible to use organic solvents to completely restore the resin capacity for continuous use or dispose of the exhausted resins at that point rather than disposing of the resins after one use as suggested by some vendors in this study we tested various pfas by a large collection of resins trying to generalize the key impacts of both the adsorbents and adsorbates pfas removal and resin regeneration are complicated due to multiple electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions involved in these processes our results suggest that emerging pfas containing unique functional groups may interact with resins distinctively from legacy pfaa so it may not be accurate to use pfaa behaviors to predict the removal and regeneration of emerging pfas if additional emerging pfas are identified at levels threatening drinking water safety future studies may still be needed to examine the effectiveness of their removal by ix moreover while ix is demonstrated effective as an immediate solution for removing both legacy and emerging pfas destructive methods are still needed to solve the pfas problem in the long term 4 conclusion ix resins with ps dvb matrix showed the highest pfas uptake from groundwater as 35 of the tested 40 pfas compounds show above 90 removal under the tested conditions meanwhile polyacrylic resins showed the least pfas removal and evidence of desorption within 24 h increasing the fluorinated chain length i e ncf increased pfas adsorption to the resins and further influenced how other pfas properties affected adsorption before equilibrium with ncf 4 functional groups and charges of pfas had limited impacts on adsorption indicating the fluorinated tail plays an important role in the interaction with resins with ncf of 6 pfeca and zwitterions showed the highest uptake compared to other pfas groups likely due to longer total chain length counting non fluorinated carbon and ether groups however increasing the ncf to 8 fasaa with longer total chain length were uptaken less than other pfas groups removal of neutral and zwitterionic pfas was comparable to anionic pfas in 15 minute resin contact time indicating the electrostatic interactions might be minor during the initial sorption phase besides fasaa and zwitterions adsorbed on the resins may be replaced by other pfas past 15 min gel type resins demonstrated faster sorption than macroporous resins for ps dvb resins among the five ps dvb resins 10 brine could recover above 50 of adsorbed short chain pfca and pfeca from tan1 and ira910 while the pfas specific resin pfa694e is essentially non regenerable under all tested conditions increasing the brine concentration from 0 01 to 10 and using salts in the chloride form enhanced regeneration meanwhile changing the brine cation adjusting regenerant ph or adding less than 20 methanol had little enhancement on regeneration

limiting manganese exposures and setting regulations requires consideration of both ingestion and inhalation of water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese inhalation ingestion ultrasonic humidifier indoor air 1 introduction 1 1 manganese in the environment manganese mn is essential for human health including supporting normal brain functions but also causes neurotoxicity in children and adults through inhalation and ingestion exposures iom 2001 the usepa 2016a drinking water exposure model establishes both ingestion and inhalation as important pathways for contaminants in tap water although interaction at the air water interface and the role of inhalation of tap water are seldom considered ultrasonic humidifiers are widely used consumer products which emit water vapor and respirable metal mineral particles present in fill water into breathing air and represent a previously unassessed source of inhalation exposure to mn health threats from mn inhalation and brain transport via the olfactory system were established by the mid 20th century for adults and in the 21st century mn in tap water is an increasing concern for neurotoxicity in children bouchard et al 2011 atsdr 2012 sanders et al 2015 leonhard et al 2019 globally mn is naturally present in ground water surface water and tap water additionally legacy manganese which accumulates in potable water distribution pipes and is periodically released as soluble or insoluble mn is a unique source for tap water brandhuber et al 2015 li et al 2019 global source and tap

containing from 1 6600 μg l mn prenatal exposure to 3000 μg l mn was positively associated with lower cognitive function in girls while boys appeared to be unaffected in denmark schullehner et al 2020 found significant positive association of exposure to increasing mn in drinking water with risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder compared to same sex individuals exposed to 5 μg l the

assessment study of 1 3 month old formula fed babies reported that cow s milk formula reconstituted with water containing 440 μg l mn and soy based formula reconstituted with water containing 220 μg l mn could pose an unacceptable risk to infants scher et al 2021 collectively these example studies corroborate the association of mn in drinking water with adverse cognitive effects in children although the studies do not indicate water use patterns 1 3 manganese in air and human inhalation exposure studies inhaled respirable mn is a more serious health threat than ingested inhaled mn can

5 ultrasonic humidifiers and emission of respirable aerosolized metals about 34 5 of the global humidifier market consists of ultrasonic units technavio 2017 that add moisture to relieve dry nose eyes and skin ultrasonic humidifiers emit fine respirable water droplets aerosols particulates and use about 2 5 l of water over an 8 h cycle nine out of ten manufacturers recommend tap or just water to fill an ultrasonic humidifier and such humidifiers are recommended for use with newborn babies children and adults yao et al 2020a indications are that consumers likely use local tap water for convenience davis et al 2016 and as health canada 2012 states tap water is fine in most cases as long as you change the water and clean your humidifier on a regular basis park et al 2014 who studied lung injuries and deaths in preschool 6 yr children and pregnant women from ultrasonic humidifier use showed 57 7 of the investigated population used a humidifier for 3 months 16 6 4 6 months 7 9 6 9 months 8 2 9 12 months and 7 7 greater than 12 months chang et al 2012 report the average humidifier usage rate was 7 3 h day and park et al 2018 report daily usage for most children while sleeping ultrasonic humidifiers filled with tap water emit a cool mist from which the water evaporates within seconds leaving essentially dried tap water particle of respirable size highsmith et al 1988 rodes et al 1990 roccaro and vagliasindi 2018 sain et al 2018 yao et al 2020a thus ultrasonic humidifies emit aerosols and particles that proportionately contain the same metals e g ca cu na mg mn zn present in fill water sain and dietrich 2015b yao et al 2020a and the size and number of particles emitted is influenced by the total dissolved solids tds concentration in the water with higher tds values generating higher particle counts and larger particle sizes sain et al 2018 park et al 2020 yao et al 2020b for example when the tds is increased from about 100 mg l to 700 mg l the count mean diameter and particle counts approximately double yao et al 2020b indoor air particle concentrations during humidifier use are uniformly distributed in a room and reach steady state concentrations sain et al 2018 yao et al 2020b that depend on room size and ventilation rates particle concentrations are acknowledged to readily exceed usepa ambient air particulate standards in part due to slow settling velocities resulting in residence times of hours to days yao et al 2020b these respirable particles deposit in the human respiratory tract yao et al 2020a b and have been associated with adverse health effects daftary and deterding 2011 reported a young infant experienced prolonged hypoxemia tachypnea and failure to thrive and the causal link identified was the mineral dust emitted from ultrasonic humidifier in the infant s bedroom in an indoor air particulate study three infants aged 0 1 year had nighttime exposures to 99 140 and 176 µg m3 particulates in their individual bedrooms the high particle mass concentrations were attributed to humidifiers filled with local tap water sloan et al 2017 1 6 objectives the goal of this research is to evaluate exposures and risk for inhalation of mn emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers for the susceptible population of infants children ages 3 months 6 years and compare with exposures and risk to adults the objectives of this study are to 1 predict indoor air mn concentrations from use of ultrasonic humidifier and fill water containing mn under four typical indoor room scenarios 2 quantify inhalation of humidifier particles i e average daily dose add for 8 h inhalation and daily ingestion from mn contaminated drinking water and calculate consequent inhalation and ingestion risks i e hazard quotients for 3 mo 12

methods 2 1 indoor air mn concentrations details of the experimental design room characteristics water quality and data for particle counts particle size distributions particle composition for metals under steady state conditions are provided in our previous publications sain and dietrich 2015b sain et al 2018 yao et al 2020a b 2021 and summarized here with expanded details presented in si text 1 the particle air mn concentrations were calculated when an ultrasonic humidifier was operated under four room scenarios table 1 of two room sizes and four air exchange rates aer of 0 2 0 8 1 2 and 1 5 h 1 these typical ventilation conditions for residential rooms encompass low aers of 0 1 0 2 h 1 observed when using the air conditioning in summer or heating in winter and median aers ranging from 0 7 to 1 2 h 1 yamamoto et al 2010 you et al 2012 aer 0 2 h 1 is a desirable energy efficient low ventilation rate while aer 1 5 h 1 represents a highly ventilated room the air mn concentrations are based on the steady state conditions when the local blacksburg va usa tap water of 95 mg l total dissolved solids was used as fill water for a 1 6 mhz ultrasonic humidifier purchased at a local store over an 8 h period of humidifier operation for each room scenario the emitted airborne particles were measured using tsi scanning mobility particle sizer model 3936 and aerotrak tsi model 9306 for size distributions and sioutas cascade impactor skc inc part no 225 370 for mass and collection of particles for determination of metals and elements by inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry icp ms the number and size of the particles varied with room condition and are presented in table 1 a linear relationship exists between aqueous metal concentrations and humidifier airborne metal concentrations fig 1 and like particle size and number varies with room size and ventilation rate the mathematical derivation of the predictive equation for mn table 1 for the small

addition to foods and beverages during preparation by consumers our study represents both formula fed and breastfed 12 mo young children formula fed children ingest tap water containing mn when tap water is used to prepare baby formula scher et al 2021 applying a physiological based pharmacokinetic model yoon et al 2019 predicted that mn in the brains of the fetus and neonate would receive mn

children and adults lyu et al 2018 manojkumar et al 2019 madureira et al 2020 the model inputs include inhaled ultrasonic humidifier particle properties at steady state including diameter and size distribution table 1 and human airway dosimetry including upper respiratory tract volume breathing frequency and tidal volume for infants children and adults table 3 in this model the human respiratory tract is divided into three regions head oral and nasal tracheobronchial tb and pulmonary the deposition fraction is the ratio of deposited airborne particle mass over inhaled particle mass a higher fraction indicates more mass deposited in the human respiratory tract the fraction is predicted based on inhaled particle properties e g diameter size distribution deposited mass is converted to deposited dose by division of deposited mass by the body weight of the corresponding age groups 3 results 3 1 indoor air mn concentrations emitted from ultrasonic humidifier the indoor air mn concentrations from ultrasonic humidifier use linearly increases with aqueous mn concentration in the fill water the resulting air mn concentration depends on the size and ventilation rate in the room fig 2 the small 33 5 m3 room with lowest 0 2 h aer has the highest air mn concentration and therefore is a worst case scenario in this study in all small room scenarios the air borne mn exceeded the usepa iris reference concentration of 0 05 µg m3 at aqueous concentrations below the usepa smlc of 50 µg l and reached ambient air levels associated with contaminated industrial sources at 120 µg l aqueous mn which is below the health canada mac table 4 presents the indoor air concentrations when an ultrasonic humidifier is filled with water containing mn at regulatory guidance levels when common concentrations of mn in tap water are used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers the mn concentration of the indoor air can exceed both the 0 05 µg m3 mn rfc usepa 2002 and the 0 3 µg m3 mn minimum risk level atsdr 2012 3 2 average daily dose and hazard quotient the inhalation reference average daily doses ref add in table 5 are calculated based on the air mn cair in eq 1 being at the usepa rfc of 0 05 µg m3 an exposure frequency of 24 h day and age dependent parameters in table 2 and thus are independent of room scenario the exposure frequency eqs 3 and 5 for ref add is assumed at 24 h day this humidifier study uses an 8 h day exposure frequency to represent inhalation exposure while sleeping in a bedroom with an ultrasonic humidifier the inhalation reference add µg kg day the second column in table 5 represents the age specific denominator in eq 4 table 6 shows the inhalation dose from 8 h humidifier exposure ingestion dose from drinking water and total inhalation and ingestion exposure dose for 3 mo child data for 12 mo child 28 mo child 6 yr child and adult are shown in tables s4 a b c d when water mn levels are at 50 80 and 120 µg l respectively the adds in fig 3 are calculated for water with 50 80 and 120 µg l mn the add for inhalation in the small room with 0 2 h aer substantially exceeds the ref add for all age groups even at only 50 µg l mn all small room scenarios exceed usepa rfc at 80 and 120 µg l aqueous mn the large well ventilated room scenario does not exceed usepa rfc at the three aqueous mn concentrations the hazard quotient hq for inhalation of mn containing humidifier particles only is calculated using eq 4 and shown in fig 4 when water mn was 50 µg l the small room with aer of 0 2 h had an hq 1 which indicates potential significant inhalation risk when water mn increased to 80 or 120 µg l the three small room scenarios each had an hq 1 but the large well ventilated room did not that ingesting water with 50 80 or 120 µg l mn had an hq 1 indicates that it presents less risk than inhalation fig 4 compares ratios of inhalation ingestion for hq and add and reveals dramatically different patterns the range of inhalation ingestion hq ratios fig 5 a is 3 20 19 84 indicating at least 3 times greater risk from inhalation than from ingestion exposure under the worst case scenario of the small room with 0 2 h aer the hq ratios for investigated age groups from 3 mo to adult are all higher than 10 indicating 10 fold greater exposure inhalation risk than ingestion when the drinking water mn is aerosolized by humidifier despite that the ratio of addinhalation addingestion fig 5b being 0 04 inhalation is the main contributor of total mn risk and thus a low inhalation dose of humidifier mn particles contributes a high risk to children and adults 3 3 deposited doses in respiratory tract from inhaling mn fig 6 shows the deposition fraction and deposited doses for investigated age groups and room scenarios and fig s2 reports the deposited mass for infants and children deposition fraction is greater than that of adults in the pulmonary region the deepest lung region and head region the deposited doses reveal greater amounts of mn containing humidifier particles in respiratory tract for infants and children compared to adults with the younger the age the greater the deposition doses and fraction in pulmonary region the deposition fractions for children are approximately twice those of adults for 3 mo infants the deposition fraction in the pulmonary region is the highest among the three respiratory tract regions indicating longest clearance time compared to other age groups the deposited doses illustrate that for the same age group there is approximately 2 5 3 8 times greater dose in the head and pulmonary regions in the small room with low energy efficient ventilation rates compared to the large well ventilated room the small room with 0 2 h aer causes almost identical deposited mn mass for infants and children in the same exposed room the deposited dose in head region in infants and children is approximately 3 9 5 2 times greater than adults and children s deposited dose in pulmonary region is 2 4 3 6 times greater than adults 4 discussion 4 1 indoor air mn concentrations emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers our study corroborates other studies that the smaller the room and or lower the ventilation the greater the indoor air exposure dose by design ultrasonic humidifiers emit fine respirable sized particles of dried tap water that are consequently inhaled and penetrate into the head and lung regions the numbers and mass of particles emitted by ultrasonic humidifiers routinely exceed health based guidance for pm2 5 and pm10 in ambient air park et al 2020 yao et al 2020b and for indoor air under usa occupational health and safety agency guidelines osha 2019 for industrial settings yao et al 2020b this current study further demonstrates that mn from drinking water emitted by ultrasonic humidifiers can exceed the 0 05 µg m3 usepa rfc for mn the 0 3 µg m3 minimal risk level atsdr 2012 and industrial sources known to adversely impact ambient air quality fig 2 under all four investigated room scenarios when fill water contains 50 µg l the indoor air mn concentrations exceed the 0 05 µg m3 usepa rfc and also the 0 13 µg m3 ambient air concentration associated with lower iq in exposed children riojas rodríguez et al 2010 at 50 µg l but 80 µg l who guideline or 120 µg l canadian mac the three small room scenarios had indoor air concentrations of 0 22 0 3 µg m3 which is equivalent to ambient air impacted by mining or industrial mn activities these high indoor air mn concentrations indicate the potential adverse effect of ultrasonic humidifiers on air quality and inhaled mn associated neurotoxicity especially for the susceptible population of children for whom humidifier use is recommended mn in drinking water and corresponding high levels of mn in biomarkers are associated with a higher risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes lucchini et al 2018 although mn exposure routes are not accounted for in most studies one predictive study concluded that long term exposure to aqueous mn during showering could result in olfactory uptake and neurotoxicity in children and adults thus rethinking mn exposure routes is warranted elsner and spangler 2005 likewise the current drinking water risk model indicates ingestion and inhalation exposure as critical pathways for contaminants in tap water usepa 2016a and thus consideration of inhaled tap water derive mn is essential for protecting human health for children exposure to mn poses greater health risk compared to adults due to their more vulnerable nervous systems kullar et al 2019 especially formula fed 12 mo young children scher et al 2021 who 2020 both exposure to mn in drinking water and high levels of human body burden mn are associated with a higher risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes lucchini et al 2018 using data collected from canadian studies kullar et al 2019 calculated benchmark concentrations bmc of mn in drinking water and 95 ci benchmark lower bounds bmcl that could result in 1 2 and 5 decreased performance iq for 5 9 13 7 year old school aged children table 7 using the benchmark aqueous concentrations to fill the ultrasonic humidifier the resulting indoor air mn concentrations were calculated for the small room aer 0 2 h 1 air concentrations met and greatly exceeded the usepa rfc of 0 05 µg m3 mn the ratios of air bmc or bmcl to the usepa rfc range from 0 8 84 8 which is much greater than the aqueous ratios of 0 18 7 8 for bmc or bmcl to the canadian mac 120 μg l additionally the inhalation ingestion ratio for hq was approximately 18 this analysis succinctly indicates that humidifying air with drinking water containing mn concentrations known to be associated with decreased iq in children results in indoor air mn concentrations capable of even more severe neurological risk to children recent studies identified relationships between low environmental exposure to inhaled mn and neurological hazards at similar concentrations to those when indoor air was humidified in case controlled studies racette et al 2021 found significant association between clinical parkinsonism in adults 40 years and older and airborne mn present in ambient pm2 5 in residential settings near an mn smelter mean value at 0 203 μg m3 mn bowler et al 2015 reported impaired tremor and motor function in residents of over 30 years from environmental exposure to airborne mn which ranged from 0 01 6 32 μg m3 mn with a mean of 0 88 μg m3 mn these conditions are comparable to ultrasonic humidifier particles which are mostly pm1 and respirable yao et al 2020b with concentrations of 0 2 μg m3 mn for the small room scenarios at fill water concentrations of 50 100 μg l mn fig 2 4 2 inhalation mn doses resulting from ultrasonic humidifier exposure inhalation of mn causes neurotoxicity in humans via olfactory brain transport therefore deposition of mn in the head is critical to assessing toxicity fig 6a demonstrates that a large fraction of ultrasonic humidifier particles is deposited in the head rather than the pulmonary region and the portion of particle deposited in the head is 1 2 to 2 fold higher for children than adults fig 6 to further link water mn and inhalation dose to the head table 8 provides water mn concentrations when deposited mn dose exceeds reference inhalation add i e hq 1 the water mn concentrations in the small room at 0 2 h 1 aer when total deposited mass exceeds ref add are 133 154 µg l for children and 270 µg l for adults hypothetically if it is assumed that the add applies solely to deposition in the head region then the water mn concentration in the fill water is 233 286 µg l for children and 780 µg l for adults these water mn concentrations in table 8 are readily observed in usa and global tap waters and could result in inhalation associated mn neurotoxicity when used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers furthermore park and berg 2018 estimated the benchmark doses of airborne mn associated with 1 excess risk of adverse neurobehavioral effects in adult workers were approximately 10 µg m3 in fumes and 25 µg m3 in dust over 5 yr exposure duration in our study under the worst case small room at 0 2 h aer the resulting air mn is 10 µg m3 when the water mn concentration is 2206 µg l which is within the measured range of tap water mn physiologically based pharmacokinetic pbpk models estimate mn levels in various body tissues including the brain of human children and adults through multiple exposure routes the globus pallidus area in the brain accumulates mn dorman et al 2006 and is a target tissue for mn related motor and cognitive function disruption in children and adults lao et al 2017 leonard et al 2019 ramoju et al 2017 while few studies report data for children several studies report brain level mn for adults exposed to mn containing particles in occupational settings these studies applied both pbpk and mppd models to mostly non respirable particle sizes 2 µm i e 2000 nm gentry et al 2017 schroeter et al 2011 and thus are not applicable to respirable particles emitted by ultrasonic humidifiers which are mostly fine particles of 129 179 nm median diameters in our study with fine humidifier particles the results show 0 08 deposition fraction in the head and 0 15 in tb pulmonary for adults the deposited mn in the head region is likely to transport through olfactory brain barrier and mn mass in the tb pulmonary regions enters blood circulation and may transport to the brain inhalation of humidifier particles alone may not cause an increase in the brain mn for adults but it contributes to total body burden of mn in combination of other exposure routes e g ingestion of drinking water low dose exposure to the submicron air mn particles from ultrasonic humidifiers can contribute to undesirable adverse health outcomes while this work adds to the limited literature on environmental exposure to mn from drinking water a limitation is the lack of toxicology investigation of manganese homeostasis e g adsorption metabolism and excretion in humans and thus the reversibility of mn exposure remains unclear after humidifier exposure for a certain period of time 4 3 strengths and implications inhalation of respirable mn containing particles deposition in the head and transport via the olfactory brain route present a much greater risk to neurotoxicity than ingestion when filled with tap water ultrasonic humidifiers generate respirable particles that are essentially dried tap water and contain mn if present at concentrations exceeding the ambient air pm2 5 standard the size and number of particles emitted depend on the type of tap water used with higher tds water emitting more and larger particles sain et al 2018 park et al 2020 yao et al 2020b in our study tap water with 95 mg l tds filled a commonly sold 1 6 mhz humidifier water the predictive equations indoor air mn concentrations and particle deposition in the respiratory tract of our study reflect the experimental conditions and typical room ventilation conditions used the same trends occur for other water qualities ultrasonic humidifiers room sizes and ventilation rates although the quantitative values will differ water containing mn should not be used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers as these consumer products always generate respirable particles that present risks even at concentrations as low as the usepa smcl of 50 µg l a level which 4 2 of us drinking waters exceeded in a 2018 nationwide survey eaton 2021 published studies for drinking water associated mn toxicity in children relate aqueous mn concentrations in drinking water with biomarkers reduced neurological development and neurotoxicity explicit in this approach is that children are exposed to any use of the tap water mn including both ingestion and inhalation the contribution from mn inhalation in ultrasonic humidifier aerosols particles should not be overlooked especially for young children for whom humidifier use is recommended to avoid mn contamination and toxicity distilled water or a water treated by a home reverse osmosis unit is recommended as fill water alternatively thermal evaporator type humidifiers that emit water vapor and not dried water particles can be used for humidification of room air 5 conclusions this study quantifies the exposure levels from ultrasonic humidifier emissions exposure doses for children and adults and risks associated with inhalation and ingestion hazard quotients confirm that 8 h daily inhalation of ultrasonic humidifier aerosols particles induces much greater risk than daily ingestion from drinking the same water room size and ventilation affect exposure levels i e air mn concentrations and consequently internal target tissue concentrations in human adults and children smaller and more confined rooms induce higher risks our findings reveal deposition of mn in the human respiratory tract and potential neurotoxicity via olfactory brain transport there are significant hazards associated with inhalation of mn containing humidifier particles for both adults and children the present work adds insights to inhalation neurotoxicity and the increased mn body burden from both inhalation and ingestion of water manganese this

limiting manganese exposures and setting regulations requires consideration of both ingestion and inhalation of water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese inhalation ingestion ultrasonic humidifier indoor air 1 introduction 1 1 manganese in the environment manganese mn is essential for human health including supporting normal brain functions but also causes neurotoxicity in children and adults through inhalation and ingestion exposures iom 2001 the usepa 2016a drinking water exposure model establishes both ingestion and inhalation as important pathways for contaminants in tap water although interaction at the air water interface and the role of inhalation of tap water are seldom considered ultrasonic humidifiers are widely used consumer products which emit water vapor and respirable metal mineral particles present in fill water into breathing air and represent a previously unassessed source of inhalation exposure to mn health threats from mn inhalation and brain transport via the olfactory system were established by the mid 20th century for adults and in the 21st century mn in tap water is an increasing concern for neurotoxicity in children bouchard et al 2011 atsdr 2012 sanders et al 2015 leonhard et al 2019 globally mn is naturally present in ground water surface water and tap water additionally legacy manganese which accumulates in potable water distribution pipes and is periodically released as soluble or insoluble mn is a unique source for tap water brandhuber et al 2015 li et al 2019 global source and tap waters routinely exceed health and esthetic based guidance for manganese with concentrations from 1 to thousands μg l mn and medians and means in the range of hundreds of μg l mn tables s1 and s2 1 2 manganese in drinking water regulations and human exposure studies manganese in tap water is increasingly associated with adverse cognitive neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects in babies and school aged children which are the populations at greatest risk for manganese neurotoxicity sanders et al 2015 iyare 2019 kullar et al 2019 leonhard et al 2019 health concerns from mn exposure in tap

2020 issued health based guideline for the susceptible subpopulation of bottle fed infants at 80 µg l mn with a tolerable daily intake tdi of 25 µg total mn kg body weight bw per day the usepa is considering its first health based mn drinking water regulation and currently monitoring mn occurrence usepa 2016b the older usepa 2004 health advisory level hal guidance for 1 day and 10 day acute oral exposure is 1000 µg l mn and lifetime hal of 300 µg l for acute exposure of infants younger than 6 months 300 µg l mn for a duration of 10 days is the upper limit usepa recommends non enforceable esthetic based secondary maximum contaminant level smcl at 50 µg l mn due to potential discoloration by manganese dioxide particles but not taste since neither soluble mn ii or particulate mn iv have

full scale performance and verbal scores for bangladeshi children wasserman et al 2006 rahman et al 2017 reported on bangladeshi school children from conception to 10 years old that drank water containing from 1 6600 μg l mn prenatal exposure to 3000 μg l mn was positively associated with lower cognitive function in girls while boys appeared to be unaffected in denmark schullehner et al 2020 found significant positive association of exposure to increasing mn in drinking water with risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder compared to same sex individuals exposed to 5 μg l the

assessment study of 1 3 month old formula fed babies reported that cow s milk formula reconstituted with water containing 440 μg l mn and soy based formula reconstituted with water containing 220 μg l mn could pose an unacceptable risk to infants scher et al 2021 collectively these example studies corroborate the association of mn in drinking water with adverse cognitive effects in children although the studies do not indicate water use patterns 1 3 manganese in air and human inhalation exposure studies inhaled respirable mn is a more serious health threat than ingested inhaled mn can

5 ultrasonic humidifiers and emission of respirable aerosolized metals about 34 5 of the global humidifier market consists of ultrasonic units technavio 2017 that add moisture to relieve dry nose eyes and skin ultrasonic humidifiers emit fine respirable water droplets aerosols particulates and use about 2 5 l of water over an 8 h cycle nine out of ten manufacturers recommend tap or just water to fill an ultrasonic humidifier and such humidifiers are recommended for use with newborn babies children and adults yao et al 2020a indications are that consumers likely use local tap water for convenience davis et al 2016 and as health canada 2012 states tap water is fine in most cases as long as you change the water and clean your humidifier on a regular basis park et al 2014 who studied lung injuries and deaths in preschool 6 yr children and pregnant women from ultrasonic humidifier use showed 57 7 of the investigated population used a humidifier for 3 months 16 6 4 6 months 7 9 6 9 months 8 2 9 12 months and 7 7 greater than 12 months chang et al 2012 report the average humidifier usage rate was 7 3 h day and park et al 2018 report daily usage for most children while sleeping ultrasonic humidifiers filled with tap water emit a cool mist from which the water evaporates within seconds leaving essentially dried tap water particle of respirable size highsmith et al 1988 rodes et al 1990 roccaro and vagliasindi 2018 sain et al 2018 yao et al 2020a thus ultrasonic humidifies emit aerosols and particles that proportionately contain the same metals e g ca cu na mg mn zn present in fill water sain and dietrich 2015b yao et al 2020a and the size and number of particles emitted is influenced by the total dissolved solids tds concentration in the water with higher tds values generating higher particle counts and larger particle sizes sain et al 2018 park et al 2020 yao et al 2020b for example when the tds is increased from about 100 mg l to 700 mg l the count mean diameter and particle counts approximately double yao et al 2020b indoor air particle concentrations during humidifier use are uniformly distributed in a room and reach steady state concentrations sain et al 2018 yao et al 2020b that depend on room size and ventilation rates particle concentrations are acknowledged to readily exceed usepa ambient air particulate standards in part due to slow settling velocities resulting in residence times of hours to days yao et al 2020b these respirable particles deposit in the human respiratory tract yao et al 2020a b and have been associated with adverse health effects daftary and deterding 2011 reported a young infant experienced prolonged hypoxemia tachypnea and failure to thrive and the causal link identified was the mineral dust emitted from ultrasonic humidifier in the infant s bedroom in an indoor air particulate study three infants aged 0 1 year had nighttime exposures to 99 140 and 176 µg m3 particulates in their individual bedrooms the high particle mass concentrations were attributed to humidifiers filled with local tap water sloan et al 2017 1 6 objectives the goal of this research is to evaluate exposures and risk for inhalation of mn emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers for the susceptible population of infants children ages 3 months 6 years and compare with exposures and risk to adults the objectives of this study are to 1 predict indoor air mn concentrations from use of ultrasonic humidifier and fill water containing mn under four typical indoor room scenarios 2 quantify inhalation of humidifier particles i e average daily dose add for 8 h inhalation and daily ingestion from mn contaminated drinking water and calculate consequent inhalation and ingestion risks i e hazard quotients for 3 mo 12

methods 2 1 indoor air mn concentrations details of the experimental design room characteristics water quality and data for particle counts particle size distributions particle composition for metals under steady state conditions are provided in our previous publications sain and dietrich 2015b sain et al 2018 yao et al 2020a b 2021 and summarized here with expanded details presented in si text 1 the particle air mn concentrations were calculated when an ultrasonic humidifier was operated under four room scenarios table 1 of two room sizes and four air exchange rates aer of 0 2 0 8 1 2 and 1 5 h 1 these typical ventilation conditions for residential rooms encompass low aers of 0 1 0 2 h 1 observed when using the air conditioning in summer or heating in winter and median aers ranging from 0 7 to 1 2 h 1 yamamoto et al 2010 you et al 2012 aer 0 2 h 1 is a desirable energy efficient low ventilation rate while aer 1 5 h 1 represents a highly ventilated room the air mn concentrations are based on the steady state conditions when the local blacksburg va usa tap water of 95 mg l total dissolved solids was used as fill water for a 1 6 mhz ultrasonic humidifier purchased at a local store over an 8 h period of humidifier operation for each room scenario the emitted airborne particles were measured using tsi scanning mobility particle sizer model 3936 and aerotrak tsi model 9306 for size distributions and sioutas cascade impactor skc inc part no 225 370 for mass and collection of particles for determination of metals and elements by inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry icp ms the number and size of the particles varied with room condition and are presented in table 1 a linear relationship exists between aqueous metal concentrations and humidifier airborne metal concentrations fig 1 and like particle size and number varies with room size and ventilation rate the mathematical derivation of the predictive equation for mn table 1 for the small

addition to foods and beverages during preparation by consumers our study represents both formula fed and breastfed 12 mo young children formula fed children ingest tap water containing mn when tap water is used to prepare baby formula scher et al 2021 applying a physiological based pharmacokinetic model yoon et al 2019 predicted that mn in the brains of the fetus and neonate would receive mn

predicted from the multi path particle dosimetry model mppd applied research associates 2020 which is widely used to calculate deposition of 0 001 to 100 µm diameter particles human airway for infants children and adults lyu et al 2018 manojkumar et al 2019 madureira et al 2020 the model inputs include inhaled ultrasonic humidifier particle properties at steady state including diameter and size distribution table 1 and human airway dosimetry including upper respiratory tract volume breathing frequency and tidal volume for infants children and adults table 3 in this model the human respiratory tract is divided into three regions head oral and nasal tracheobronchial tb and pulmonary the deposition fraction is the ratio of deposited airborne particle mass over inhaled particle mass a higher fraction indicates more mass deposited in the human respiratory tract the fraction is predicted based on inhaled particle properties e g diameter size distribution deposited mass is converted to deposited dose by division of deposited mass by the body weight of the corresponding age groups 3 results 3 1 indoor air mn concentrations emitted from ultrasonic humidifier the indoor air mn concentrations from ultrasonic humidifier use linearly increases with aqueous mn concentration in the fill water the resulting air mn concentration depends on the size and ventilation rate in the room fig 2 the small 33 5 m3 room with lowest 0 2 h aer has the highest air mn concentration and therefore is a worst case scenario in this study in all small room scenarios the air borne mn exceeded the usepa iris reference concentration of 0 05 µg m3 at aqueous concentrations below the usepa smlc of 50 µg l and reached ambient air levels associated with contaminated industrial sources at 120 µg l aqueous mn which is below the health canada mac table 4 presents the indoor air concentrations when an ultrasonic humidifier is filled with water containing mn at regulatory guidance levels when common concentrations of mn in tap water are used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers the mn concentration of the indoor air can exceed both the 0 05 µg m3 mn rfc usepa 2002 and the 0 3 µg m3 mn minimum risk level atsdr 2012 3 2 average daily dose and hazard quotient the inhalation reference average daily doses ref add in table 5 are calculated based on the air mn cair in eq 1 being at the usepa rfc of 0 05 µg m3 an exposure frequency of 24 h day and age dependent parameters in table 2 and thus are independent of room scenario the exposure frequency eqs 3 and 5 for ref add is assumed at 24 h day this humidifier study uses an 8 h day exposure frequency to represent inhalation exposure while sleeping in a bedroom with an ultrasonic humidifier the inhalation reference add µg kg day the second column in table 5 represents the age specific denominator in eq 4 table 6 shows the inhalation dose from 8 h humidifier exposure ingestion dose from drinking water and total inhalation and ingestion exposure dose for 3 mo child data for 12 mo child 28 mo child 6 yr child and adult are shown in tables s4 a b c d when water mn levels are at 50 80 and 120 µg l respectively the adds in fig 3 are calculated for water with 50 80 and 120 µg l mn the add for inhalation in the small room with 0 2 h aer substantially exceeds the ref add for all age groups even at only 50 µg l mn all small room scenarios exceed usepa rfc at 80 and 120 µg l aqueous mn the large well ventilated room scenario does not exceed usepa rfc at the three aqueous mn concentrations the hazard quotient hq for inhalation of mn containing humidifier particles only is calculated using eq 4 and shown in fig 4 when water mn was 50 µg l the small room with aer of 0 2 h had an hq 1 which indicates potential significant inhalation risk when water mn increased to 80 or 120 µg l the three small room scenarios each had an hq 1 but the large well ventilated room did not that ingesting water with 50 80 or 120 µg l mn had an hq 1 indicates that it presents less risk than inhalation fig 4 compares ratios of inhalation ingestion for hq and add and reveals dramatically different patterns the range of inhalation ingestion hq ratios fig 5 a is 3 20 19 84 indicating at least 3 times greater risk from inhalation than from ingestion exposure under the worst case scenario of the small room with 0 2 h aer the hq ratios for investigated age groups from 3 mo to adult are all higher than 10 indicating 10 fold greater exposure inhalation risk than ingestion when the drinking water mn is aerosolized by humidifier despite that the ratio of addinhalation addingestion fig 5b being 0 04 inhalation is the main contributor of total mn risk and thus a low inhalation dose of humidifier mn particles contributes a high risk to children and adults 3 3 deposited doses in respiratory tract from inhaling mn fig 6 shows the deposition fraction and deposited doses for investigated age groups and room scenarios and fig s2 reports the deposited mass for infants and children deposition fraction is greater than that of adults in the pulmonary region the deepest lung region and head region the deposited doses reveal greater amounts of mn containing humidifier particles in respiratory tract for infants and children compared to adults with the younger the age the greater the deposition doses and fraction in pulmonary region the deposition fractions for children are approximately twice those of adults for 3 mo infants the deposition fraction in the pulmonary region is the highest among the three respiratory tract regions indicating longest clearance time compared to other age groups the deposited doses illustrate that for the same age group there is approximately 2 5 3 8 times greater dose in the head and pulmonary regions in the small room with low energy efficient ventilation rates compared to the large well ventilated room the small room with 0 2 h aer causes almost identical deposited mn mass for infants and children in the same exposed room the deposited dose in head region in infants and children is approximately 3 9 5 2 times greater than adults and children s deposited dose in pulmonary region is 2 4 3 6 times greater than adults 4 discussion 4 1 indoor air mn concentrations emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers our study corroborates other studies that the smaller the room and or lower the ventilation the greater the indoor air exposure dose by design ultrasonic humidifiers emit fine respirable sized particles of dried tap water that are consequently inhaled and penetrate into the head and lung regions the numbers and mass of particles emitted by ultrasonic humidifiers routinely exceed health based guidance for pm2 5 and pm10 in ambient air park et al 2020 yao et al 2020b and for indoor air under usa occupational health and safety agency guidelines osha 2019 for industrial settings yao et al 2020b this current study further demonstrates that mn from drinking water emitted by ultrasonic humidifiers can exceed the 0 05 µg m3 usepa rfc for mn the 0 3 µg m3 minimal risk level atsdr 2012 and industrial sources known to adversely impact ambient air quality fig 2 under all four investigated room scenarios when fill water contains 50 µg l the indoor air mn concentrations exceed the 0 05 µg m3 usepa rfc and also the 0 13 µg m3 ambient air concentration associated with lower iq in exposed children riojas rodríguez et al 2010 at 50 µg l but 80 µg l who guideline or 120 µg l canadian mac the three small room scenarios had indoor air concentrations of 0 22 0 3 µg m3 which is equivalent to ambient air impacted by mining or industrial mn activities these high indoor air mn concentrations indicate the potential adverse effect of ultrasonic humidifiers on air quality and inhaled mn associated neurotoxicity especially for the susceptible population of children for whom humidifier use is recommended mn in drinking water and corresponding high levels of mn in biomarkers are associated with a higher risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes lucchini et al 2018 although mn exposure routes are not accounted for in most studies one predictive study concluded that long term exposure to aqueous mn during showering could result in olfactory uptake and neurotoxicity in children and adults thus rethinking mn exposure routes is warranted elsner and spangler 2005 likewise the current drinking water risk model indicates ingestion and inhalation exposure as critical pathways for contaminants in tap water usepa 2016a and thus consideration of inhaled tap water derive mn is essential for protecting human health for children exposure to mn poses greater health risk compared to adults due to their more vulnerable nervous systems kullar et al 2019 especially formula fed 12 mo young children scher et al 2021 who 2020 both exposure to mn in drinking water and high levels of human body burden mn are associated with a higher risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes lucchini et al 2018 using data collected from canadian studies kullar et al 2019 calculated benchmark concentrations bmc of mn in drinking water and 95 ci benchmark lower bounds bmcl that could result in 1 2 and 5 decreased performance iq for 5 9 13 7 year old school aged children table 7 using the benchmark aqueous concentrations to fill the ultrasonic humidifier the resulting indoor air mn concentrations were calculated for the small room aer 0 2 h 1 air concentrations met and greatly exceeded the usepa rfc of 0 05 µg m3 mn the ratios of air bmc or bmcl to the usepa rfc range from 0 8 84 8 which is much greater than the aqueous ratios of 0 18 7 8 for bmc or bmcl to the canadian mac 120 μg l additionally the inhalation ingestion ratio for hq was approximately 18 this analysis succinctly indicates that humidifying air with drinking water containing mn concentrations known to be associated with decreased iq in children results in indoor air mn concentrations capable of even more severe neurological risk to children recent studies identified relationships between low environmental exposure to inhaled mn and neurological hazards at similar concentrations to those when indoor air was humidified in case controlled studies racette et al 2021 found significant association between clinical parkinsonism in adults 40 years and older and airborne mn present in ambient pm2 5 in residential settings near an mn smelter mean value at 0 203 μg m3 mn bowler et al 2015 reported impaired tremor and motor function in residents of over 30 years from environmental exposure to airborne mn which ranged from 0 01 6 32 μg m3 mn with a mean of 0 88 μg m3 mn these conditions are comparable to ultrasonic humidifier particles which are mostly pm1 and respirable yao et al 2020b with concentrations of 0 2 μg m3 mn for the small room scenarios at fill water concentrations of 50 100 μg l mn fig 2 4 2 inhalation mn doses resulting from ultrasonic humidifier exposure inhalation of mn causes neurotoxicity in humans via olfactory brain transport therefore deposition of mn in the head is critical to assessing toxicity fig 6a demonstrates that a large fraction of ultrasonic humidifier particles is deposited in the head rather than the pulmonary region and the portion of particle deposited in the head is 1 2 to 2 fold higher for children than adults fig 6 to further link water mn and inhalation dose to the head table 8 provides water mn concentrations when deposited mn dose exceeds reference inhalation add i e hq 1 the water mn concentrations in the small room at 0 2 h 1 aer when total deposited mass exceeds ref add are 133 154 µg l for children and 270 µg l for adults hypothetically if it is assumed that the add applies solely to deposition in the head region then the water mn concentration in the fill water is 233 286 µg l for children and 780 µg l for adults these water mn concentrations in table 8 are readily observed in usa and global tap waters and could result in inhalation associated mn neurotoxicity when used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers furthermore park and berg 2018 estimated the benchmark doses of airborne mn associated with 1 excess risk of adverse neurobehavioral effects in adult workers were approximately 10 µg m3 in fumes and 25 µg m3 in dust over 5 yr exposure duration in our study under the worst case small room at 0 2 h aer the resulting air mn is 10 µg m3 when the water mn concentration is 2206 µg l which is within the measured range of tap water mn physiologically based pharmacokinetic pbpk models estimate mn levels in various body tissues including the brain of human children and adults through multiple exposure routes the globus pallidus area in the brain accumulates mn dorman et al 2006 and is a target tissue for mn related motor and cognitive function disruption in children and adults lao et al 2017 leonard et al 2019 ramoju et al 2017 while few studies report data for children several studies report brain level mn for adults exposed to mn containing particles in occupational settings these studies applied both pbpk and mppd models to mostly non respirable particle sizes 2 µm i e 2000 nm gentry et al 2017 schroeter et al 2011 and thus are not applicable to respirable particles emitted by ultrasonic humidifiers which are mostly fine particles of 129 179 nm median diameters in our study with fine humidifier particles the results show 0 08 deposition fraction in the head and 0 15 in tb pulmonary for adults the deposited mn in the head region is likely to transport through olfactory brain barrier and mn mass in the tb pulmonary regions enters blood circulation and may transport to the brain inhalation of humidifier particles alone may not cause an increase in the brain mn for adults but it contributes to total body burden of mn in combination of other exposure routes e g ingestion of drinking water low dose exposure to the submicron air mn particles from ultrasonic humidifiers can contribute to undesirable adverse health outcomes while this work adds to the limited literature on environmental exposure to mn from drinking water a limitation is the lack of toxicology investigation of manganese homeostasis e g adsorption metabolism and excretion in humans and thus the reversibility of mn exposure remains unclear after humidifier exposure for a certain period of time 4 3 strengths and implications inhalation of respirable mn containing particles deposition in the head and transport via the olfactory brain route present a much greater risk to neurotoxicity than ingestion when filled with tap water ultrasonic humidifiers generate respirable particles that are essentially dried tap water and contain mn if present at concentrations exceeding the ambient air pm2 5 standard the size and number of particles emitted depend on the type of tap water used with higher tds water emitting more and larger particles sain et al 2018 park et al 2020 yao et al 2020b in our study tap water with 95 mg l tds filled a commonly sold 1 6 mhz humidifier water the predictive equations indoor air mn concentrations and particle deposition in the respiratory tract of our study reflect the experimental conditions and typical room ventilation conditions used the same trends occur for other water qualities ultrasonic humidifiers room sizes and ventilation rates although the quantitative values will differ water containing mn should not be used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers as these consumer products always generate respirable particles that present risks even at concentrations as low as the usepa smcl of 50 µg l a level which 4 2 of us drinking waters exceeded in a 2018 nationwide survey eaton 2021 published studies for drinking water associated mn toxicity in children relate aqueous mn concentrations in drinking water with biomarkers reduced neurological development and neurotoxicity explicit in this approach is that children are exposed to any use of the tap water mn including both ingestion and inhalation the contribution from mn inhalation in ultrasonic humidifier aerosols particles should not be overlooked especially for young children for whom humidifier use is recommended to avoid mn contamination and toxicity distilled water or a water treated by a home reverse osmosis unit is recommended as fill water alternatively thermal evaporator type humidifiers that emit water vapor and not dried water particles can be used for humidification of room air 5 conclusions this study quantifies the exposure levels from ultrasonic humidifier emissions exposure doses for children and adults and risks associated with inhalation and ingestion hazard quotients confirm that 8 h daily inhalation of ultrasonic humidifier aerosols particles induces much greater risk than daily ingestion from drinking the same water room size and ventilation affect exposure levels i e air mn concentrations and consequently internal target tissue concentrations in human adults and children smaller and more confined rooms induce higher risks our findings reveal deposition of mn in the human respiratory tract and potential neurotoxicity via olfactory brain transport there are significant hazards associated with inhalation of mn containing humidifier particles for both adults and children the present work adds insights to inhalation neurotoxicity and the increased mn body burden from both inhalation and ingestion of water manganese this work contributes essential data for re thinking the current health based guidelines and regulation of mn in water and recommendations for humidifier use by consumers declaration of competing interest
