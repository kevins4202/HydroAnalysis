10755,the influence mechanism of heterogeneous nutrient distribution on compensatory growth of maize seedlings is a key topic in the interaction between crops and soil environment we evaluated the significance of root hydraulic conductance lp and related parameter changes in water uptake and growth regulation of plants under different nitrogen n conditions maize seedlings were grown in split root containers containing n solutions three n treatments were applied 1 full strength n control c in which both sub root systems received 4 0 mm n each sub root c44 2 partial n deficit d in which each sub root system received 2 0 mm n d42 or full strength n d44 and 3 partial n resupply s in which both sub root systems received 2 0 mm n for six days followed by 2 0 mm n s22 or full strength n s24 the shoot dry mass in d increased gradually with early development and was greater than that in c and s within 15 21 day suggesting that the superiority of partial n deficit d in term of maize seedling growth was apparent and caused compensatory growth moreover the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 between ψl vs lp and shoot n content vs lp were obviously greater than that in c44 s24 and s22 indicating that higher plant dry mass in d might be attributable to the maintenance of a similar ψl and improved shoot n content in addition the slopes and intercepts in d44 and d42 between lp vs root surface area and shoot n content vs root surface area were higher than that in s24 and s22 suggesting that compared with partial n resupply partial n deficit was more advantageous to root water uptake and n accumulation at the same level of root surface area thus resulted in higher dry mass of maize seedlings however partial n resupply significantly increased root cortex thickness diameter ratio and reduced root vessel diameter which resulted in lower lp ψl and shoot n content during 12 21 day unexpectedly at 21 day the shoot dry mass in s could recover to the level of control the regulation mechanisms in partial n resupply will be the focus of future studies thus when adopting the method of partial n application it is necessary to consider the soil n condition before partial application keywords leaf water potential partial n application plant growth root hydraulic conductance shoot n content root to shoot ratio 1 introduction maize zea mays l is an important cereal crop for food and animal feed worldwide godfray et al 2010 due to the uneven distribution of soil nutrients nutrient deficit is the key problem restricting the growth and production of maize in many countries including china mi et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 maize has a fine fibrous root system that is extremely plastic in response to heterogeneous nutrient distribution in terms of both morphology and physiology yu et al 2015 gao et al 2014 forde and lorenzo 2001 previous studies have shown that partial nutrient application which may be an effective way to improve nutrient use effiency and crop growth has been widely explored hodge 2004 jing et al 2010 we also previously showed that partial 2 mm n deficit improved shoot dry mass and n use efficiency even under partial 2 mm n resupply at 9 day after treatment niu et al 2019 the theoretical basis for benefits of partial n application is that plants can undergo compensatory growth therefore an in depth understanding of the mechanism of plant compensatory growth to heterogeneous nutrient distribution is necessary to regulate the interaction between crops and soil environments so as to achieve sustainable maize yields and higher water and nutrient use efficiencies evidence is accumulating that root hydraulic conductance lp which describes the water flow potential of intact root systems rieger and litvin 1999 supports the adjustment of water uptake by roots to meet the demands of shoots yan et al 2017 changes in lp usually precede stomatal responses or changes in plant growth clarkson et al 2000 meng and fricke 2017 yan et al 2017 which can be largely controlled by the activity of aquaporins plasma membrane intrinsic proteins pip moreover the response usually was rapid and reversible maurel et al 2010 vandeleur et al 2009 previous study found that soil nitrogen n concentrations affect water loss in plants via transpiration and growth conditions gloser et al 2007 yan et al 2017 particularly localized n application can improve a crop s capacity to explore soil and stimulate root proliferation in n rich patches reducing the over reliance on fertilizer hodge 2004 jing et al 2010 mou et al 2013 this systemic n signalling mechanism has important implications for agriculture as it allows crops to sense mineral nutrients in resource rich patches li et al 2014a 2014b however it is unclear how differences in the morphological and anatomical traits of the maize root system are related to changes in lp in response to partial n application roots are best known for their ability to affect plant physiology and crop adaptation under adverse soil conditions ultimately impacting crop yield and stability nazemi et al 2016 boughalleb et al 2014 lynch 2013 research has suggested that root hydraulic properties are associated with anatomical features of the root radial and axial paths in plants such as root cortex thickness root diameter presence of suberized exodermises and xylem vessel diameter prince et al 2017 schneider et al 2017 rieger and litvin 1999 saud et al 2017 in particular thinner root cortex is associated with higher lp whereas root diameter is a weaker determinant of lp rieger and litvin 1999 in a study of root phenes the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio was a better predictor of root penetration ability than root diameter chimungu et al 2015 therefore integrating root growth anatomical traits and physiological phenes could facilitate improvements to overall crop growth under heterogeneous soil conditions more studies indicated that root anatomical properties are associated with root growth and lp chimungu et al 2014 gao and lynch 2016 even developed direct computational method to quantify lp from anatomical properties passot et al 2019 meunier et al 2017 particularly direct computational methods have illustrated that root water uptake capacity depend on the environmental conditions tron et al 2015 leitner et al 2014 however under partial n application the relationship between root hydraulic response and overall plant growth of maize as well as its physiological mechanisms remain unclear we predicted that i the response of root morphology to partial n application in particular concerning root area and the root shoot dry mass ratio impacts on root lp and on the contribution of root anatomy to root water uptake ii root growth leaf water condition and root lp are intercorrelated to facilitate the coordination of the shoot response with the root response to partial n application and iii the root dry weight water uptake to shoot dry weight water loss ratio impacts on root lp using the results of the study we asked whether the growth responses of maize seedlings to partial n deficit and partial n resupply have the similar mechanism and revealed the internal relations between lp and maize compensatory growth these results will be helpful to elucidate the compensatory effect of maize to heterogeneous n application 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials we performed a hydroponic experiment on maize seedlings cultivated in split root containers under controlled environmental conditions with a light dark regime of 14 10 h 6 00 am dark light transition temperature of 25 28 c and relative humidity of 30 40 the basic nutrient solution contained 0 75 mm k2so4 0 25 mm kh2po4 0 1 mm kcl 0 6 mm mgso4 0 1 mm fe edta 1 0 10 3 mm h3bo3 1 0 10 3 mm mnso4 1 0 10 3 mm znso4 1 0 10 4 mm cuso4 and 3 5 10 4 mm na2moo4 n deficit was additionally provoked in the form of ca no3 2 the dissolved oxygen concentration in the nutrient solution was maintained at 8 10 mg l the well aerated nutrient solution was renewed every three days and the ph was adjusted to 5 7 6 0 by adding 0 1 m naoh or hcl as required maize seeds zea mays l hybrid cv aoyu no 3007 beijing origin seed technology inc beijing china were sown in a sandbox and incubated at 25 c for three days to induce germination once the seedlings reached the three leaf stage they were transplanted into split root containers 14 8 7 7 11 4 cm in length width height filled with nutrient solutions each container contained a single maize seedling since seminal root length was found to be unaffected by nutrient deficiency drew 1975 forde and lorenzo 2001 we removed seminal roots and sealed the wound with paraffin wax to prevent water entry the removal of seminal roots facilitated a uniform distribution of the remaining roots into the two compartments of the container and a more accurate comparison between the stressed and non stressed sub roots niu et al 2015 2019 2 2 experimental design at 0 day and 3 day after transplantation maize seedlings were supplied with full strength n nutrient solution 4 0 mm n thereafter at 6 day and 9 day the following n treatments were imposed full strength n control c in which both sub root systems were supplied with 4 0 mm n nutrient solution each sub root system c44 partial n deficit d in which both sub root systems received 4 0 mm n nutrient solution and partial n resupply s in which both sub root systems received 2 0 mm n nutrient solution at 12 day 15 day 18 day and 21 day for c treatment both sub root systems were continuously supplied with 4 0 mm n nutrient solution each sub root system c44 for d treatment half of the root system was exposed to 2 0 mm n nutrient solution deficit sub root system d42 and the other half was supplied with 4 0 mm n nutrient solution non deficit sub root system d44 for s treatment half of the root system was continuously supplied with 2 0 mm n nutrient solution deficit sub root system s22 and the other half received 4 0 mm n nutrient solution non deficit sub root system s24 in the whole experimental period the nutrient solution was renewed every three days unfortunately we did not measure the n concentration in the nutrient solution of the chamber the different treatment was shown in fig 1 the whole cultivation time was divided as three stages 21 day recovered stages 6 day pretreatment stages 6 day and formal treatment stages of partial n application 9 day the experiment was set up as a randomized complete block design comprising three treatments with 30 maize seedlings per treatment to enable dynamic sampling at 12 13 15 18 and 21 days 2 3 plant sampling six maize seedlings per treatment were obtained at each sampling interval for measuring plant parameters there were six replicates for the measurement of leaf water potential ψl shoot dry mass and n content as well as sub root dry mass surface area and anatomy however there were only three replicates for the lp of each sub root system as two maize seedlings were used separately to gain the lp of either non deficit or deficit sub roots because of the test method of lp the lp and ψl were first measured after which plant samples were separated into three parts shoots and the two sub root systems for the measurement of plant dry mass root surface area shoot n content and root anatomy 2 4 measurements of root hydraulic conductance and leaf water potential lp and ψl were both measured in the morning of the five sampling dates using a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co albany or usa for example ψl was measured at 7 00 am and root hydraulic conductance measured around 8 00 11 00 am for all treatments to measure the lp of each sub root system the other sub root and shoot were excised and the wound in the remaining sub root was sealed with paraffin wax then the sub root and a container filled with pure water were sealed in a pressure chamber and the cut stem was projected through a seal in the lid of the chamber according to miyamoto et al 2001 the lp m3 mpa s was measured using the method described by niu et al 2015 a balance pressure p0 which was the ex pressure when the sap exuded initially was determined at first pressure was increased from p0 mpa to p0 1 0 mpa at an interval of 0 2 mpa under each pressure after the flow rate was stabilized about 2 min the exuded sap v m3 was collected with absorbent cotton for 2 min the weight of the exuded sap was determined using an analytical balance with an accuracy of 0 1 mg the flow rate jv m3 s was calculated by jv v 120 s the lp m3 mpa s was determined from the slope of the regression line by plotting jv against hydrostatic pressure p0 1 0 mpa p0 i e lp jv δp the hydraulic conductance per root surface area lpr m mpa s was calculated as lpr lp m3 mpa s root surface area m2 the measurement of ψl was performed under excised conditions as described by turner 1988 completely expanded leaves were sampled from the upper part of maize seedlings 2 5 measurements of plant dry mass root surface area and shoot n content the dry mass of each plant part was measured after drying at 75 c in a forced draft oven until reaching a constant mass the total plant dry mass was calculated from the sum of the shoot dry mass and both sub root dry masses the root shoot ratio was estimated from the total root dry mass divided by the shoot dry mass sub root samples were scanned using a scanning device v700 epson japan and the root surface area was calculated with the winrhizo basic computer image analysis system winrhizo regent instruments inc quebec city quebec canada dried shoot samples were ground and digested in a heating block at 250 c with concentrated h2so4 h2o2 the n content in the digested solution was determined using automatic kjeldahl distillation kjeltec 2300 autoanalyzer foss tecator hoganas sweden shoot n concentration mg g shoot n content mg shoot dry mass g 2 6 measurements of root anatomy root segments were sampled at 3 8 cm from insertion to root tip cut tissues were fixed in freshly prepared formaldehyde glacial acetic acid 70 ethanol 5 5 90 by volume overnight at room temperature after washing with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 4 the samples were dehydrated with a tert butyl alcohol series 15 100 and embedded in warm 56 58 c paraffin the resulting blocks were then cut into 10 μm sections with a rotary microtome rm2235 leica germany and stained with 2 safranine o and fast green 0 2 observations were performed under a light microscope with a digital camera axio lab a1 zeiss germany root diameter μm root vessel diameter μm and root cortex thickness the radial distance from the root epidermis to the periderm μm were measured with an electronic ruler image j32 and the ratio of root cortex thickness to root diameter was calculated 2 7 data analysis growth rates in all treatments were calculated for the dry mass and surface area of each sub root system shoot and whole plant on a dry mass basis growth rate for each time interval t1 to t2 t2 to t3 etc was calculated as follows growth rate a2 a1 t2 t1 where a2 and a1 represent the dry mass surface area and anatomical parameters for each sub root system shoot and whole plant at sampling times t2 and t1 respectively to investigate the effects of n status prior to partial n application the relative amounts in all treatments compared with the control were calculated i e c c d c and s c statistical analysis was performed using spss16 0 statistics spss inc chicago il usa multiple comparisons of group means were performed using one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey hsd test at the 5 probability level 3 results 3 1 partial n application differentially affects root and shoot growth tables 1 and 2 showed that relative growth rates of each sub root dry mass and surface area had significant difference among different treatments compared with c d or s treatments resulted in a significant increase in root dry mass in d44 or s24 during 13 17 day whereas greatly decreased root dry mass in d42 during 13 15 and 17 21 day or in s22 during 12 21 day in addition compared with c44 there are higher root surface area in d44 during 15 17 day and in s24 during 12 17 day indicating that the occurrence time of root compensatory growth under partial n resupply was earlier than that under partial n deficit moreover compared with c44 d44 was 89 higher root dry mass and 315 higher root surface area during 15 17 day and s24 was 13 lower root dry mass and 40 higher root surface area during 11 13 day suggesting that root surface area was more sensitive to partial n deficit and n resupply compared with root dry mass compared with c the d and s treatments resulted in a significant increase in the relative growth rates of shoot and whole plant dry mass during 13 17 day and total root dry mass during 15 17 day indicating that partial n deficit and partial n resupply could stimulate the compensatory effect of overall maize growth table 1 in addition both shoot and whole plant relative growth rates were greater in s than d during 15 21 day table 1 the root shoot ratio in s was similar or even significantly higher than that in d during 12 21 day fig 2 a interestingly for s treatment shoot dry mass was always significantly lower than that in c and d during 12 21 day whereas for d treatment shoot dry mass was significantly increased at 15 day compared with c and s and until 21 day fig 2b suggesting that n deficit for 6 day in pretreatment stages inhibited the recovered degree of shoot growth under partial n resupply 3 2 leaf water potential shoot n content and shoot n concentration change under partial n application during 12 21 day there was no significant difference in ψl between d and c fig 3 a nonetheless a significantly lower ψl was observed in s compared with the former two treatments although the decrease rate gradually reduced over time the ψl in s did not recover to the level of c and d at 21 day suggesting that partial n deficit could maintain maize water status but partial n resupply could constrain maize water status to a certain degree shoot n content increased with plant growth although the rate of increase differed among the treatments resulting in inconsistent treatment effects at various time points fig 3b d had a higher increased rate of shoot n content than c during 12 13 day and significantly enhanced the shoot n content during 13 17 day whereas returned to the level of c at 21 day by contrast the shoot n content in s was markedly lower than c and d during 12 21 day and the difference became larger over time suggesting that the effect of partial n application on shoot n content was related to n level in nutrient solution before partial n application s had 8 5 higher shoot n concentration than c and d at 12 day fig 3c s and d significantly increased shoot n concentration compared with c at 13 day which arrived the peak point 57 3 and 51 1 mg g indicating that maize seedlings exhibited an adaptation reaction to n deficit though increased shoot n concentration which process was very rapid thereafter the shoot n concentration in d and s significantly decreased with time which remained higher than that in c during 13 17 day and 13 15 day respectively moreover during 13 21 day shoot n concentration in d was always significantly higher than that in s at 21 day compared with c d and s significantly reduced the shoot n concentration and s ranked the lowest at this time point 3 3 partial n application increases water conductance in the non deficit sub root lp and lpr exhibited similar increasing trends over time in all treatments fig 4 a b compared with c44 d44 and d42 exhibited significantly lower rates of increase for lp and lpr during 12 15 day followed by rapid increases after 15 day which resulted in similar parameter values as c44 during 17 21 day these results showed that partial n deficit had an obvious compensatory effect on lpr in non stressed sub root system the compensatory effect had started to occur after 15 day and until 21day by contrast when taking the average of s24 and s22 the lp and lpr were 36 3 and 38 0 lower than c44 at 12 day respectively the lp and lpr in s24 then recovered to the level of c44 during 13 15 day yet lower parameter values were observed after 17 day suggesting that partial n resupply could stimulate the occurrence of compensatory effect of root water uptake during 13 15 day but the duration time of compensatory effect was shorter than partial n deficit no significant difference was observed between d44 and d42 but lp and lpr were respectively 16 4 27 3 and 4 0 13 8 higher in s24 than s22 during 12 21 day the lp and lpr in s22 were consistently lower than those in c44 and s24 during 12 21 day although they were similar or greater than those in d44 and d42 during 13 15 day 3 4 root anatomy changes in response to partial n application compared with c44 the root diameter in d44 exhibited a larger increase during 13 17 day followed by a minor change at 21 day whereas the root diameter in d42 also showed a larger increase during 13 17 day but was lower than that in d44 table 3 additionally large significant increases in both root cortex thickness and vessel diameter were observed in d44 but not in d42 during 13 21 day d42 exhibited a much smaller root cortex thickness while no significant difference in root vessel diameter was observed in this treatment compared with c44 with increasing treatment duration the root cortex thickness and vessel diameter in both d44 and d42 showed no significant changes after 13 day except that root vessel diameter considerably increased in d44 at 21 day the root cortex thickness diameter ratio changed little in response to d44 during 13 17 day but it tended to increase at 21 day meanwhile the root cortex thickness diameter ratio was significantly lower in d42 than in d44 or c44 during 13 21 day although no significant difference was observed at 21 day these results showed that partial n deficit was beneficial to the increase of root diameter and root vessel diameter in non deficit sub root system during 13 17 day although the root cortex thickness in d42 was also significantly increased compared with that in c44 root cortex thickness diameter ratio in d42 had no significant different compared with that in c44 suggesting that partial n deficit did not affect the lateral transport of root moisture in non deficit sub root system during 13 17 day at 21 d partial n deficit could constrain the lateral transport of root moisture in non deficit sub root system to certain degree the root anatomical parameters in the deficit sub root system did not differ from c44 at 21 day at 13 and 21 day the root diameter in s24 was significantly reduced by 5 and 6 compared with c44 respectively which returned to the level of c44 during 15 17 day table 3 n deficit significantly increased the root cortex thickness and root cortex thickness diameter ratio by 27 5 and 48 5 in s24 and s22 compared with c44 at 12 day respectively however no significant difference was observed in root vessel diameter the root cortex thickness root vessel diameter and root cortex thickness diameter ratio in s24 were all higher than those in c44 during 13 21 day although they showed a slight reduction at 21 day compared with c44 during 12 17 day the root cortex thickness diameter ratio in s24 gradually decreased over time these results showed that partial n resupply significantly improved the root anatomy in non deficit sub root system but it could not reach the control level at 21 day compared with c44 and s24 the root diameter in s22 was significantly reduced after 17 day while the corresponding root cortex thickness and root cortex thickness diameter ratio markedly increased throughout the experimental period the s22 treatment did not affect root vessel diameter 3 5 correlations of plant parameters under partial n application figs 5 and 6 present the correlation plots of the examined plant parameters and tables 4 and 5 presents linear regression equations the correlation coefficients and p values root surface area was significantly positively correlated with lp in all treatments although the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 were obviously greater than that in s24 and s22 respectively and was also higher than that in c44 fig 5a table 4 particularly the lp in d24 was greater than that in d44 at an identical root surface area table 4 root diameter and lp were significantly positively correlated with each other but the slope and intercept in d42 were almost the same as that in c44 and were obviously greater than that in d44 s24 and s22 fig 5b table 4 lp was not correlated with the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio in c44 d44 and d42 but a significant negative correlation was observed with the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio in s24 and s22 fig 5c moreover the absolute values of slope and intercept in s24 between lp vs root cortex thickness root diameter ratio was higher than that in s22 table 4 lp was significantly negatively correlated with the root shoot ratio in all treatments fig 5d while the absolute values of slope and intercept in s24 and s22 were significantly decreased compared with that in c44 d44 and d42 table 4 lp was significantly positively correlated with the root vessel diameters in all treatments fig 5e lp in c44 and d44 in terms of root vessel diameters was very similar which was remarkably higher than that in s24 and s22 table 4 finally all treatments exhibited significant positive correlations between ψl vs lp shoot dry mass vs lp shoot dry mass vs ψl shoot n content vs lp shoot n content vs root surface area and shoot dry mass vs shoot n content figs 6a f the absolute values of slope and intercept in c44 d42 and d22 between ψl vs lp shoot dry mass vs ψl shoot n content vs lp and shoot n content vs root surface area were obviously greater than that in s24 and s22 table 5 however the slopes in c44 d42 and d22 between shoot dry mass vs lp and shoot dry mass vs shoot n content were obviously lower than that in s24 and s22 interestingly the absolute values of slope and intercept in d42 between ψl vs lp shoot n content vs lp shoot dry mass vs lp and shoot n content vs root surface area were similar with or obviously greater than that in d22 the absolute values of slope and intercept in s22 between shoot n content vs lp and shoot n content vs root surface area were obviously greater than that in s24 whereas there was a reverse trend between ψl vs lp and shoot dry mass vs lp 4 discussion 4 1 partial n application facilitates overall growth of maize seedling the superiority of partial n deficit d in term of maize seedling growth was apparent and caused compensatory growth the shoot dry mass in d increased gradually with early development and was greater than that in c within 15 21 day fig 2b moreover compared with c the d resulted in a significant increase in the relative growth rates of shoot and whole plant dry mass during 13 17 day table 1 higher plant dry mass might be attributable to the maintenance of a similar ψl and improved shoot n content d figs fig 33a b 6c f which is in agreement with previous studies showing that the improvements in ψl and shoot n content are closely related to plant growth and productivity faustino et al 2013 górska et al 2010 win et al 2016 unexpectedly for partial n resupply s a lower ψl and shoot n content were observed during 12 21 day fig 3a b but shoot dry mass could recover to the level of c at 21 day fig 2b however compared with d s significantly reduced the slope between shoot dry mass vs ψl and increased the slope between shoot dry mass vs shoot n content table 5 suggesting that compared with partial n resupply partial n deficit significantly stimulate the growth of maize seedlings even was higher than that in control treatment the mechanism need a further research 4 2 root hydraulic conductance in the context of water flow regulation and n accumulation in plants recent research has reported that changes in lp and ψl in response to salt n osmotic shock are part of a coupled process meng and fricke 2017 wang et al 2016 niu et al 2015 bucci et al 2006 our results showed that ψl was significantly correlated with lp in both sub root systems under partial n deficit fig 6a table 5 moreover the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 between ψl vs lp were obviously greater than that in c44 table 5 it can be concluded that the higher lp in non deficit and deficit sub root systems was one of the causes of higher ψl under partial n deficit furthermore the lp in s24 was similar to that in c44 while the lp in s22 was lower fig 4a resulting in a decreased ψl in s fig 3a therefore we speculate that the plant water status is determined by the hydraulic characteristics of both sub root systems niu et al 2015 increased shoot n content represents a compensatory mechanism in plants to partial n deficit fransen et al 1999 mou et al 2013 increases in the water uptake rate i e lp cause highly mobile nitrate ions to be transported via convection flow to the root surface which significantly contributes to the enhanced nitrate uptake gloser et al 2007 2010 hence shoot n content was highly and significantly correlated with the lp of both sub root systems in all treatments fig 6d table 5 a rapid increase in lp over time in the non deficit sub root system could enhance a plant s ability to absorb n and compensate for the negative effect of the n deficit sub root system on n uptake mou et al 2013 li et al 2014a 2014b young et al 2009 this may have explained the increase in shoot n concentration we observed in maize seedlings during 12 17 day under partial n deficit fig 3c measuring changes in the n concentration of both solutions in the split root chambers would lend support to our hypothesis by contrast the shoot n content in s was markedly lower than c and d during 12 21 day and the difference became larger over time fig 3b meanwhile the lp in s22 was significantly decreased compared with that in other treatments fig 4a the lower water uptake capacity might have been responsible for the n accumulation in plants and consequently the lower shoot dry mass during 12 17 day table 5 li et al 2014a 2014b the lp and shoot n content should be higher in plants with larger root surface area tables 4 5 suku et al 2014 therefore it will provide an explanation for the greater lp and shoot n content under partial n deficit though the research on root morphology 4 3 relationship between root hydraulic conductance shoot n content and root morphology or root shoot ratio in this study the root surface area growth rate in d44 markedly increased during 15 17 day table 2 while lp returned to the level of c44 at 17 day fig 4a even under partial n resupply s24 an increase in the root surface area growth rate was associated with the rebound of lp to the level of c44 during 13 15 day table 2 fig 4a moreover there was a significant positive correlation between lp and root surface area in all treatments fig 5a table 4 thus a higher root surface area may be advantageous for maize seedlings by facilitating root water uptake suku et al 2014 in addition the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 between lp vs root surface area were higher than that in s24 and s22 table 4 suggesting that compared with partial n resupply partial n deficit was more advantageous to root water uptake at the same level of root surface area hence lpr is extensively used to estimate water uptake through the root system adachi et al 2010 suku et al 2014 nagasuga et al 2011 in my study lpr in d44 and d42 was also higher than that in s24 and s22 fig 4b we also found that lp was significantly negatively correlated with the root shoot ratio in maize seedlings under partial n application fig 5d table 4 therefore more profuse root growth does not necessarily result in more water extraction because shoots must have an adequate water demand to enable root water uptake vadez 2014 the increase in the root shoot ratio in response to partial n deficit can be regarded as a mechanism explaining the plant water uptake water loss ratio meng and fricke 2017 ruggiero and angelino 2007 however lp had recovered to the control level e g d44 during 5 9 and s24 during 13 15 day plants have absorbed more water fig 4a b therefore the decreases in lp in n deficit plants can also be regarded as a means to facilitate an increased root shoot ratio rather than exhausting water in the root environment meng and fricke 2017 vadez 2014 lynch et al 2014 overall increasing the root shoot ratio under n deficit conditions can compensate for the adverse effects of lower lp on plant growth d44 and d42 significantly enhanced the slope and intercept between shoot n content vs root surface area compared with s24 and s22 thus resulted higher shoot n content and shoot dry mass table 5 figs fig 22b 3b from these results the larger root surface area in d than in s might be attributable to the greater accumulation of nitrogen by the former than the latter taylaran et al 2011 4 4 relationship between root anatomy and hydraulic conductance under partial n application understanding the anatomical changes of roots is of great significance in explaining the hydraulic changes of plants caused by n deficit and clarifying the mechanisms of plants adapting to heterogeneous nutrient conditions enstone et al 2002 rieger and litvin 1999 wang et al 2019 currently there is little information on the changes in root anatomy induced by partial n deficit we found that d44 maintained a root cortex thickness diameter ratio similar to that of c44 during 12 17 day table 3 although lp decreased during 12 15 day fig 4a however at 21 day we observed a greater root cortex thickness diameter ratio and a similar lp in d44 compared with c44 lp was not correlated with the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio in d44 table 4 in addition s24 and s22 considerably increased the root cortex thickness diameter ratio while decreasing the lp lpr and root diameter at 12 day fig 4a 4b table 3 root anatomy is critical in controlling radial water flow across roots ranathunge et al 2004 schreiber et al 2005 ranathunge et al 2011 under low nitrate availability the root hydraulic resistance increased resulting in lower lp and lpr this response has been observed over a period of several days or at least several hours and usually precedes stomatal responses or changes in growth gorska et al 2008a 2008b in my study lp and lpr in s24 and s22 were significantly reduced compared with that in c44 fig 4a b while the root cortex thickness diameter ratio remain higher than that in c44 table 3 the ability of roots to alter their anatomical properties in response to partial n resupply provides a mechanism for the decrease in lp and lpr in s24 and s22 these results also verified a negative correlation between the root cortex thickness diameter ratio and lp table 4 5 conclusions a higher compensatory growth effect of partial root zone n application partial n deficit accumulates larger n amounts and has a higher ψl than partial n resupply these properties of partial n deficit explain its higher dry matter production in short the higher dry mass of maize seedlings in partial n deficit appeared to result from both the greater shoot n content and the greater ψl than those in partial n resupply the characteristics of the increased lp and higher shoot n content even at the same level of lp might be caused by the larger root surface area and lower root shoot ratio in partial n deficit however partial n resupply significantly increased root cortex thickness diameter ratio and reduced root vessel diameter which resulted in lower lp ψl and shoot n content during 12 21 day unexpectedly at 21 day the shoot dry mass in s could recover to the level of control the regulation mechanisms in partial n resupply will be the focus of future studies thus when adopting the method of partial n application it is necessary to consider the soil n condition before partial application acknowledgements this work was funded

10755,the influence mechanism of heterogeneous nutrient distribution on compensatory growth of maize seedlings is a key topic in the interaction between crops and soil environment we evaluated the significance of root hydraulic conductance lp and related parameter changes in water uptake and growth regulation of plants under different nitrogen n conditions maize seedlings were grown in split root containers containing n solutions three n treatments were applied 1 full strength n control c in which both sub root systems received 4 0 mm n each sub root c44 2 partial n deficit d in which each sub root system received 2 0 mm n d42 or full strength n d44 and 3 partial n resupply s in which both sub root systems received 2 0 mm n for six days followed by 2 0 mm n s22 or full strength n s24 the shoot dry mass in d increased gradually with early development and was greater than that in c and s within 15 21 day suggesting that the superiority of partial n deficit d in term of maize seedling growth was apparent and caused compensatory growth moreover the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 between ψl vs lp and shoot n content vs lp were obviously greater than that in c44 s24 and s22 indicating that higher plant dry mass in d might be attributable to the maintenance of a similar ψl and improved shoot n content in addition the slopes and intercepts in d44 and d42 between lp vs root surface area and shoot n content vs root surface area were higher than that in s24 and s22 suggesting that compared with partial n resupply partial n deficit was more advantageous to root water uptake and n accumulation at the same level of root surface area thus resulted in higher dry mass of maize seedlings however partial n resupply significantly increased root cortex thickness diameter ratio and reduced root vessel diameter which resulted in lower lp ψl and shoot n content during 12 21 day unexpectedly at 21 day the shoot dry mass in s could recover to the level of control the regulation mechanisms in partial n resupply will be the focus of future studies thus when adopting the method of partial n application it is necessary to consider the soil n condition before partial application keywords leaf water potential partial n application plant growth root hydraulic conductance shoot n content root to shoot ratio 1 introduction maize zea mays l is an important cereal crop for food and animal feed worldwide godfray et al 2010 due to the uneven distribution of soil nutrients nutrient deficit is the key problem restricting the growth and production of maize in many countries including china mi et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 maize has a fine fibrous root system that is extremely plastic in response to heterogeneous nutrient distribution in terms of both morphology and physiology yu et al 2015 gao et al 2014 forde and lorenzo 2001 previous studies have shown that partial nutrient application which may be an effective way to improve nutrient use effiency and crop growth has been widely explored hodge 2004 jing et al 2010 we also previously showed that partial 2 mm n deficit improved shoot dry mass and n use efficiency even under partial 2 mm n resupply at 9 day after treatment niu et al 2019 the theoretical basis for benefits of partial n application is that plants can undergo compensatory growth therefore an in depth understanding of the mechanism of plant compensatory growth to heterogeneous nutrient distribution is necessary to regulate the interaction between crops and soil environments so as to achieve sustainable maize yields and higher water and nutrient use efficiencies evidence is accumulating that root hydraulic conductance lp which describes the water flow potential of intact root systems rieger and litvin 1999 supports the adjustment of water uptake by roots to meet the demands of shoots yan et al 2017 changes in lp usually precede stomatal responses or changes in plant growth clarkson et al 2000 meng and fricke 2017 yan et al 2017 which can be largely controlled by the activity of aquaporins plasma membrane intrinsic proteins pip moreover the response usually was rapid and reversible maurel et al 2010 vandeleur et al 2009 previous study found that soil nitrogen n concentrations affect water loss in plants via transpiration and growth conditions gloser et al 2007 yan et al 2017 particularly localized n application can improve a crop s capacity to explore soil and stimulate root proliferation in n rich patches reducing the over reliance on fertilizer hodge 2004 jing et al 2010 mou et al 2013 this systemic n signalling mechanism has important implications for agriculture as it allows crops to sense mineral nutrients in resource rich patches li et al 2014a 2014b however it is unclear how differences in the morphological and anatomical traits of the maize root system are related to changes in lp in response to partial n application roots are best known for their ability to affect plant physiology and crop adaptation under adverse soil conditions ultimately impacting crop yield and stability nazemi et al 2016 boughalleb et al 2014 lynch 2013 research has suggested that root hydraulic properties are associated with anatomical features of the root radial and axial paths in plants such as root cortex thickness root diameter presence of suberized exodermises and xylem vessel diameter prince et al 2017 schneider et al 2017 rieger and litvin 1999 saud et al 2017 in particular thinner root cortex is associated with higher lp whereas root diameter is a weaker determinant of lp rieger and litvin 1999 in a study of root phenes the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio was a better predictor of root penetration ability than root diameter chimungu et al 2015 therefore integrating root growth anatomical traits and physiological phenes could facilitate improvements to overall crop growth under heterogeneous soil conditions more studies indicated that root anatomical properties are associated with root growth and lp chimungu et al 2014 gao and lynch 2016 even developed direct computational method to quantify lp from anatomical properties passot et al 2019 meunier et al 2017 particularly direct computational methods have illustrated that root water uptake capacity depend on the environmental conditions tron et al 2015 leitner et al 2014 however under partial n application the relationship between root hydraulic response and overall plant growth of maize as well as its physiological mechanisms remain unclear we predicted that i the response of root morphology to partial n application in particular concerning root area and the root shoot dry mass ratio impacts on root lp and on the contribution of root anatomy to root water uptake ii root growth leaf water condition and root lp are intercorrelated to facilitate the coordination of the shoot response with the root response to partial n application and iii the root dry weight water uptake to shoot dry weight water loss ratio impacts on root lp using the results of the study we asked whether the growth responses of maize seedlings to partial n deficit and partial n resupply have the similar mechanism and revealed the internal relations between lp and maize compensatory growth these results will be helpful to elucidate the compensatory effect of maize to heterogeneous n application 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials we performed a hydroponic experiment on maize seedlings cultivated in split root containers under controlled environmental conditions with a light dark regime of 14 10 h 6 00 am dark light transition temperature of 25 28 c and relative humidity of 30 40 the basic nutrient solution contained 0 75 mm k2so4 0 25 mm kh2po4 0 1 mm kcl 0 6 mm mgso4 0 1 mm fe edta 1 0 10 3 mm h3bo3 1 0 10 3 mm mnso4 1 0 10 3 mm znso4 1 0 10 4 mm cuso4 and 3 5 10 4 mm na2moo4 n deficit was additionally provoked in the form of ca no3 2 the dissolved oxygen concentration in the nutrient solution was maintained at 8 10 mg l the well aerated nutrient solution was renewed every three days and the ph was adjusted to 5 7 6 0 by adding 0 1 m naoh or hcl as required maize seeds zea mays l hybrid cv aoyu no 3007 beijing origin seed technology inc beijing china were sown in a sandbox and incubated at 25 c for three days to induce germination once the seedlings reached the three leaf stage they were transplanted into split root containers 14 8 7 7 11 4 cm in length width height filled with nutrient solutions each container contained a single maize seedling since seminal root length was found to be unaffected by nutrient deficiency drew 1975 forde and lorenzo 2001 we removed seminal roots and sealed the wound with paraffin wax to prevent water entry the removal of seminal roots facilitated a uniform distribution of the remaining roots into the two compartments of the container and a more accurate comparison between the stressed and non stressed sub roots niu et al 2015 2019 2 2 experimental design at 0 day and 3 day after transplantation maize seedlings were supplied with full strength n nutrient solution 4 0 mm n thereafter at 6 day and 9 day the following n treatments were imposed full strength n control c in which both sub root systems were supplied with 4 0 mm n nutrient solution each sub root system c44 partial n deficit d in which both sub root systems received 4 0 mm n nutrient solution and partial n resupply s in which both sub root systems received 2 0 mm n nutrient solution at 12 day 15 day 18 day and 21 day for c treatment both sub root systems were continuously supplied with 4 0 mm n nutrient solution each sub root system c44 for d treatment half of the root system was exposed to 2 0 mm n nutrient solution deficit sub root system d42 and the other half was supplied with 4 0 mm n nutrient solution non deficit sub root system d44 for s treatment half of the root system was continuously supplied with 2 0 mm n nutrient solution deficit sub root system s22 and the other half received 4 0 mm n nutrient solution non deficit sub root system s24 in the whole experimental period the nutrient solution was renewed every three days unfortunately we did not measure the n concentration in the nutrient solution of the chamber the different treatment was shown in fig 1 the whole cultivation time was divided as three stages 21 day recovered stages 6 day pretreatment stages 6 day and formal treatment stages of partial n application 9 day the experiment was set up as a randomized complete block design comprising three treatments with 30 maize seedlings per treatment to enable dynamic sampling at 12 13 15 18 and 21 days 2 3 plant sampling six maize seedlings per treatment were obtained at each sampling interval for measuring plant parameters there were six replicates for the measurement of leaf water potential ψl shoot dry mass and n content as well as sub root dry mass surface area and anatomy however there were only three replicates for the lp of each sub root system as two maize seedlings were used separately to gain the lp of either non deficit or deficit sub roots because of the test method of lp the lp and ψl were first measured after which plant samples were separated into three parts shoots and the two sub root systems for the measurement of plant dry mass root surface area shoot n content and root anatomy 2 4 measurements of root hydraulic conductance and leaf water potential lp and ψl were both measured in the morning of the five sampling dates using a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co albany or usa for example ψl was measured at 7 00 am and root hydraulic conductance measured around 8 00 11 00 am for all treatments to measure the lp of each sub root system the other sub root and shoot were excised and the wound in the remaining sub root was sealed with paraffin wax then the sub root and a container filled with pure water were sealed in a pressure chamber and the cut stem was projected through a seal in the lid of the chamber according to miyamoto et al 2001 the lp m3 mpa s was measured using the method described by niu et al 2015 a balance pressure p0 which was the ex pressure when the sap exuded initially was determined at first pressure was increased from p0 mpa to p0 1 0 mpa at an interval of 0 2 mpa under each pressure after the flow rate was stabilized about 2 min the exuded sap v m3 was collected with absorbent cotton for 2 min the weight of the exuded sap was determined using an analytical balance with an accuracy of 0 1 mg the flow rate jv m3 s was calculated by jv v 120 s the lp m3 mpa s was determined from the slope of the regression line by plotting jv against hydrostatic pressure p0 1 0 mpa p0 i e lp jv δp the hydraulic conductance per root surface area lpr m mpa s was calculated as lpr lp m3 mpa s root surface area m2 the measurement of ψl was performed under excised conditions as described by turner 1988 completely expanded leaves were sampled from the upper part of maize seedlings 2 5 measurements of plant dry mass root surface area and shoot n content the dry mass of each plant part was measured after drying at 75 c in a forced draft oven until reaching a constant mass the total plant dry mass was calculated from the sum of the shoot dry mass and both sub root dry masses the root shoot ratio was estimated from the total root dry mass divided by the shoot dry mass sub root samples were scanned using a scanning device v700 epson japan and the root surface area was calculated with the winrhizo basic computer image analysis system winrhizo regent instruments inc quebec city quebec canada dried shoot samples were ground and digested in a heating block at 250 c with concentrated h2so4 h2o2 the n content in the digested solution was determined using automatic kjeldahl distillation kjeltec 2300 autoanalyzer foss tecator hoganas sweden shoot n concentration mg g shoot n content mg shoot dry mass g 2 6 measurements of root anatomy root segments were sampled at 3 8 cm from insertion to root tip cut tissues were fixed in freshly prepared formaldehyde glacial acetic acid 70 ethanol 5 5 90 by volume overnight at room temperature after washing with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 4 the samples were dehydrated with a tert butyl alcohol series 15 100 and embedded in warm 56 58 c paraffin the resulting blocks were then cut into 10 μm sections with a rotary microtome rm2235 leica germany and stained with 2 safranine o and fast green 0 2 observations were performed under a light microscope with a digital camera axio lab a1 zeiss germany root diameter μm root vessel diameter μm and root cortex thickness the radial distance from the root epidermis to the periderm μm were measured with an electronic ruler image j32 and the ratio of root cortex thickness to root diameter was calculated 2 7 data analysis growth rates in all treatments were calculated for the dry mass and surface area of each sub root system shoot and whole plant on a dry mass basis growth rate for each time interval t1 to t2 t2 to t3 etc was calculated as follows growth rate a2 a1 t2 t1 where a2 and a1 represent the dry mass surface area and anatomical parameters for each sub root system shoot and whole plant at sampling times t2 and t1 respectively to investigate the effects of n status prior to partial n application the relative amounts in all treatments compared with the control were calculated i e c c d c and s c statistical analysis was performed using spss16 0 statistics spss inc chicago il usa multiple comparisons of group means were performed using one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey hsd test at the 5 probability level 3 results 3 1 partial n application differentially affects root and shoot growth tables 1 and 2 showed that relative growth rates of each sub root dry mass and surface area had significant difference among different treatments compared with c d or s treatments resulted in a significant increase in root dry mass in d44 or s24 during 13 17 day whereas greatly decreased root dry mass in d42 during 13 15 and 17 21 day or in s22 during 12 21 day in addition compared with c44 there are higher root surface area in d44 during 15 17 day and in s24 during 12 17 day indicating that the occurrence time of root compensatory growth under partial n resupply was earlier than that under partial n deficit moreover compared with c44 d44 was 89 higher root dry mass and 315 higher root surface area during 15 17 day and s24 was 13 lower root dry mass and 40 higher root surface area during 11 13 day suggesting that root surface area was more sensitive to partial n deficit and n resupply compared with root dry mass compared with c the d and s treatments resulted in a significant increase in the relative growth rates of shoot and whole plant dry mass during 13 17 day and total root dry mass during 15 17 day indicating that partial n deficit and partial n resupply could stimulate the compensatory effect of overall maize growth table 1 in addition both shoot and whole plant relative growth rates were greater in s than d during 15 21 day table 1 the root shoot ratio in s was similar or even significantly higher than that in d during 12 21 day fig 2 a interestingly for s treatment shoot dry mass was always significantly lower than that in c and d during 12 21 day whereas for d treatment shoot dry mass was significantly increased at 15 day compared with c and s and until 21 day fig 2b suggesting that n deficit for 6 day in pretreatment stages inhibited the recovered degree of shoot growth under partial n resupply 3 2 leaf water potential shoot n content and shoot n concentration change under partial n application during 12 21 day there was no significant difference in ψl between d and c fig 3 a nonetheless a significantly lower ψl was observed in s compared with the former two treatments although the decrease rate gradually reduced over time the ψl in s did not recover to the level of c and d at 21 day suggesting that partial n deficit could maintain maize water status but partial n resupply could constrain maize water status to a certain degree shoot n content increased with plant growth although the rate of increase differed among the treatments resulting in inconsistent treatment effects at various time points fig 3b d had a higher increased rate of shoot n content than c during 12 13 day and significantly enhanced the shoot n content during 13 17 day whereas returned to the level of c at 21 day by contrast the shoot n content in s was markedly lower than c and d during 12 21 day and the difference became larger over time suggesting that the effect of partial n application on shoot n content was related to n level in nutrient solution before partial n application s had 8 5 higher shoot n concentration than c and d at 12 day fig 3c s and d significantly increased shoot n concentration compared with c at 13 day which arrived the peak point 57 3 and 51 1 mg g indicating that maize seedlings exhibited an adaptation reaction to n deficit though increased shoot n concentration which process was very rapid thereafter the shoot n concentration in d and s significantly decreased with time which remained higher than that in c during 13 17 day and 13 15 day respectively moreover during 13 21 day shoot n concentration in d was always significantly higher than that in s at 21 day compared with c d and s significantly reduced the shoot n concentration and s ranked the lowest at this time point 3 3 partial n application increases water conductance in the non deficit sub root lp and lpr exhibited similar increasing trends over time in all treatments fig 4 a b compared with c44 d44 and d42 exhibited significantly lower rates of increase for lp and lpr during 12 15 day followed by rapid increases after 15 day which resulted in similar parameter values as c44 during 17 21 day these results showed that partial n deficit had an obvious compensatory effect on lpr in non stressed sub root system the compensatory effect had started to occur after 15 day and until 21day by contrast when taking the average of s24 and s22 the lp and lpr were 36 3 and 38 0 lower than c44 at 12 day respectively the lp and lpr in s24 then recovered to the level of c44 during 13 15 day yet lower parameter values were observed after 17 day suggesting that partial n resupply could stimulate the occurrence of compensatory effect of root water uptake during 13 15 day but the duration time of compensatory effect was shorter than partial n deficit no significant difference was observed between d44 and d42 but lp and lpr were respectively 16 4 27 3 and 4 0 13 8 higher in s24 than s22 during 12 21 day the lp and lpr in s22 were consistently lower than those in c44 and s24 during 12 21 day although they were similar or greater than those in d44 and d42 during 13 15 day 3 4 root anatomy changes in response to partial n application compared with c44 the root diameter in d44 exhibited a larger increase during 13 17 day followed by a minor change at 21 day whereas the root diameter in d42 also showed a larger increase during 13 17 day but was lower than that in d44 table 3 additionally large significant increases in both root cortex thickness and vessel diameter were observed in d44 but not in d42 during 13 21 day d42 exhibited a much smaller root cortex thickness while no significant difference in root vessel diameter was observed in this treatment compared with c44 with increasing treatment duration the root cortex thickness and vessel diameter in both d44 and d42 showed no significant changes after 13 day except that root vessel diameter considerably increased in d44 at 21 day the root cortex thickness diameter ratio changed little in response to d44 during 13 17 day but it tended to increase at 21 day meanwhile the root cortex thickness diameter ratio was significantly lower in d42 than in d44 or c44 during 13 21 day although no significant difference was observed at 21 day these results showed that partial n deficit was beneficial to the increase of root diameter and root vessel diameter in non deficit sub root system during 13 17 day although the root cortex thickness in d42 was also significantly increased compared with that in c44 root cortex thickness diameter ratio in d42 had no significant different compared with that in c44 suggesting that partial n deficit did not affect the lateral transport of root moisture in non deficit sub root system during 13 17 day at 21 d partial n deficit could constrain the lateral transport of root moisture in non deficit sub root system to certain degree the root anatomical parameters in the deficit sub root system did not differ from c44 at 21 day at 13 and 21 day the root diameter in s24 was significantly reduced by 5 and 6 compared with c44 respectively which returned to the level of c44 during 15 17 day table 3 n deficit significantly increased the root cortex thickness and root cortex thickness diameter ratio by 27 5 and 48 5 in s24 and s22 compared with c44 at 12 day respectively however no significant difference was observed in root vessel diameter the root cortex thickness root vessel diameter and root cortex thickness diameter ratio in s24 were all higher than those in c44 during 13 21 day although they showed a slight reduction at 21 day compared with c44 during 12 17 day the root cortex thickness diameter ratio in s24 gradually decreased over time these results showed that partial n resupply significantly improved the root anatomy in non deficit sub root system but it could not reach the control level at 21 day compared with c44 and s24 the root diameter in s22 was significantly reduced after 17 day while the corresponding root cortex thickness and root cortex thickness diameter ratio markedly increased throughout the experimental period the s22 treatment did not affect root vessel diameter 3 5 correlations of plant parameters under partial n application figs 5 and 6 present the correlation plots of the examined plant parameters and tables 4 and 5 presents linear regression equations the correlation coefficients and p values root surface area was significantly positively correlated with lp in all treatments although the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 were obviously greater than that in s24 and s22 respectively and was also higher than that in c44 fig 5a table 4 particularly the lp in d24 was greater than that in d44 at an identical root surface area table 4 root diameter and lp were significantly positively correlated with each other but the slope and intercept in d42 were almost the same as that in c44 and were obviously greater than that in d44 s24 and s22 fig 5b table 4 lp was not correlated with the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio in c44 d44 and d42 but a significant negative correlation was observed with the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio in s24 and s22 fig 5c moreover the absolute values of slope and intercept in s24 between lp vs root cortex thickness root diameter ratio was higher than that in s22 table 4 lp was significantly negatively correlated with the root shoot ratio in all treatments fig 5d while the absolute values of slope and intercept in s24 and s22 were significantly decreased compared with that in c44 d44 and d42 table 4 lp was significantly positively correlated with the root vessel diameters in all treatments fig 5e lp in c44 and d44 in terms of root vessel diameters was very similar which was remarkably higher than that in s24 and s22 table 4 finally all treatments exhibited significant positive correlations between ψl vs lp shoot dry mass vs lp shoot dry mass vs ψl shoot n content vs lp shoot n content vs root surface area and shoot dry mass vs shoot n content figs 6a f the absolute values of slope and intercept in c44 d42 and d22 between ψl vs lp shoot dry mass vs ψl shoot n content vs lp and shoot n content vs root surface area were obviously greater than that in s24 and s22 table 5 however the slopes in c44 d42 and d22 between shoot dry mass vs lp and shoot dry mass vs shoot n content were obviously lower than that in s24 and s22 interestingly the absolute values of slope and intercept in d42 between ψl vs lp shoot n content vs lp shoot dry mass vs lp and shoot n content vs root surface area were similar with or obviously greater than that in d22 the absolute values of slope and intercept in s22 between shoot n content vs lp and shoot n content vs root surface area were obviously greater than that in s24 whereas there was a reverse trend between ψl vs lp and shoot dry mass vs lp 4 discussion 4 1 partial n application facilitates overall growth of maize seedling the superiority of partial n deficit d in term of maize seedling growth was apparent and caused compensatory growth the shoot dry mass in d increased gradually with early development and was greater than that in c within 15 21 day fig 2b moreover compared with c the d resulted in a significant increase in the relative growth rates of shoot and whole plant dry mass during 13 17 day table 1 higher plant dry mass might be attributable to the maintenance of a similar ψl and improved shoot n content d figs fig 33a b 6c f which is in agreement with previous studies showing that the improvements in ψl and shoot n content are closely related to plant growth and productivity faustino et al 2013 górska et al 2010 win et al 2016 unexpectedly for partial n resupply s a lower ψl and shoot n content were observed during 12 21 day fig 3a b but shoot dry mass could recover to the level of c at 21 day fig 2b however compared with d s significantly reduced the slope between shoot dry mass vs ψl and increased the slope between shoot dry mass vs shoot n content table 5 suggesting that compared with partial n resupply partial n deficit significantly stimulate the growth of maize seedlings even was higher than that in control treatment the mechanism need a further research 4 2 root hydraulic conductance in the context of water flow regulation and n accumulation in plants recent research has reported that changes in lp and ψl in response to salt n osmotic shock are part of a coupled process meng and fricke 2017 wang et al 2016 niu et al 2015 bucci et al 2006 our results showed that ψl was significantly correlated with lp in both sub root systems under partial n deficit fig 6a table 5 moreover the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 between ψl vs lp were obviously greater than that in c44 table 5 it can be concluded that the higher lp in non deficit and deficit sub root systems was one of the causes of higher ψl under partial n deficit furthermore the lp in s24 was similar to that in c44 while the lp in s22 was lower fig 4a resulting in a decreased ψl in s fig 3a therefore we speculate that the plant water status is determined by the hydraulic characteristics of both sub root systems niu et al 2015 increased shoot n content represents a compensatory mechanism in plants to partial n deficit fransen et al 1999 mou et al 2013 increases in the water uptake rate i e lp cause highly mobile nitrate ions to be transported via convection flow to the root surface which significantly contributes to the enhanced nitrate uptake gloser et al 2007 2010 hence shoot n content was highly and significantly correlated with the lp of both sub root systems in all treatments fig 6d table 5 a rapid increase in lp over time in the non deficit sub root system could enhance a plant s ability to absorb n and compensate for the negative effect of the n deficit sub root system on n uptake mou et al 2013 li et al 2014a 2014b young et al 2009 this may have explained the increase in shoot n concentration we observed in maize seedlings during 12 17 day under partial n deficit fig 3c measuring changes in the n concentration of both solutions in the split root chambers would lend support to our hypothesis by contrast the shoot n content in s was markedly lower than c and d during 12 21 day and the difference became larger over time fig 3b meanwhile the lp in s22 was significantly decreased compared with that in other treatments fig 4a the lower water uptake capacity might have been responsible for the n accumulation in plants and consequently the lower shoot dry mass during 12 17 day table 5 li et al 2014a 2014b the lp and shoot n content should be higher in plants with larger root surface area tables 4 5 suku et al 2014 therefore it will provide an explanation for the greater lp and shoot n content under partial n deficit though the research on root morphology 4 3 relationship between root hydraulic conductance shoot n content and root morphology or root shoot ratio in this study the root surface area growth rate in d44 markedly increased during 15 17 day table 2 while lp returned to the level of c44 at 17 day fig 4a even under partial n resupply s24 an increase in the root surface area growth rate was associated with the rebound of lp to the level of c44 during 13 15 day table 2 fig 4a moreover there was a significant positive correlation between lp and root surface area in all treatments fig 5a table 4 thus a higher root surface area may be advantageous for maize seedlings by facilitating root water uptake suku et al 2014 in addition the slope and intercept in d44 and d42 between lp vs root surface area were higher than that in s24 and s22 table 4 suggesting that compared with partial n resupply partial n deficit was more advantageous to root water uptake at the same level of root surface area hence lpr is extensively used to estimate water uptake through the root system adachi et al 2010 suku et al 2014 nagasuga et al 2011 in my study lpr in d44 and d42 was also higher than that in s24 and s22 fig 4b we also found that lp was significantly negatively correlated with the root shoot ratio in maize seedlings under partial n application fig 5d table 4 therefore more profuse root growth does not necessarily result in more water extraction because shoots must have an adequate water demand to enable root water uptake vadez 2014 the increase in the root shoot ratio in response to partial n deficit can be regarded as a mechanism explaining the plant water uptake water loss ratio meng and fricke 2017 ruggiero and angelino 2007 however lp had recovered to the control level e g d44 during 5 9 and s24 during 13 15 day plants have absorbed more water fig 4a b therefore the decreases in lp in n deficit plants can also be regarded as a means to facilitate an increased root shoot ratio rather than exhausting water in the root environment meng and fricke 2017 vadez 2014 lynch et al 2014 overall increasing the root shoot ratio under n deficit conditions can compensate for the adverse effects of lower lp on plant growth d44 and d42 significantly enhanced the slope and intercept between shoot n content vs root surface area compared with s24 and s22 thus resulted higher shoot n content and shoot dry mass table 5 figs fig 22b 3b from these results the larger root surface area in d than in s might be attributable to the greater accumulation of nitrogen by the former than the latter taylaran et al 2011 4 4 relationship between root anatomy and hydraulic conductance under partial n application understanding the anatomical changes of roots is of great significance in explaining the hydraulic changes of plants caused by n deficit and clarifying the mechanisms of plants adapting to heterogeneous nutrient conditions enstone et al 2002 rieger and litvin 1999 wang et al 2019 currently there is little information on the changes in root anatomy induced by partial n deficit we found that d44 maintained a root cortex thickness diameter ratio similar to that of c44 during 12 17 day table 3 although lp decreased during 12 15 day fig 4a however at 21 day we observed a greater root cortex thickness diameter ratio and a similar lp in d44 compared with c44 lp was not correlated with the root cortex thickness root diameter ratio in d44 table 4 in addition s24 and s22 considerably increased the root cortex thickness diameter ratio while decreasing the lp lpr and root diameter at 12 day fig 4a 4b table 3 root anatomy is critical in controlling radial water flow across roots ranathunge et al 2004 schreiber et al 2005 ranathunge et al 2011 under low nitrate availability the root hydraulic resistance increased resulting in lower lp and lpr this response has been observed over a period of several days or at least several hours and usually precedes stomatal responses or changes in growth gorska et al 2008a 2008b in my study lp and lpr in s24 and s22 were significantly reduced compared with that in c44 fig 4a b while the root cortex thickness diameter ratio remain higher than that in c44 table 3 the ability of roots to alter their anatomical properties in response to partial n resupply provides a mechanism for the decrease in lp and lpr in s24 and s22 these results also verified a negative correlation between the root cortex thickness diameter ratio and lp table 4 5 conclusions a higher compensatory growth effect of partial root zone n application partial n deficit accumulates larger n amounts and has a higher ψl than partial n resupply these properties of partial n deficit explain its higher dry matter production in short the higher dry mass of maize seedlings in partial n deficit appeared to result from both the greater shoot n content and the greater ψl than those in partial n resupply the characteristics of the increased lp and higher shoot n content even at the same level of lp might be caused by the larger root surface area and lower root shoot ratio in partial n deficit however partial n resupply significantly increased root cortex thickness diameter ratio and reduced root vessel diameter which resulted in lower lp ψl and shoot n content during 12 21 day unexpectedly at 21 day the shoot dry mass in s could recover to the level of control the regulation mechanisms in partial n resupply will be the focus of future studies thus when adopting the method of partial n application it is necessary to consider the soil n condition before partial application acknowledgements this work was funded

10756,small and large scale biochar based filtrations were conducted to investigate the potential of biochar as a low cost renewable filtration medium in aquaponics the small scale experimental design investigated the effects of 2 biochar media sizes 1 3 mm referred to as fine biochar and 3 5 mm referred to as coarse biochar 3 biochar bed heights 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 cm and 3 loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d on particle size distribution as well as turbidity removal efficiency both biochar sizes fine and coarse were able to clarify fish effluent however fine biochar led to better filtration characteristics compared to coarse biochar results indicated that biochar filter bed heights and loading rates affected the filtration performances using deeper filters combined with lower loading rates led to greater removal of suspended particles and turbidity compared to shallower filters and or higher loading rates results from the large scale filtration using a mixture of fine and coarse biochar media size of 1 5 mm revealed that the ideal loading rate for maximizing the removal of turbidity from fish effluent in high intensity aquaponic system for production of nile tilapia and greenhouse plants with 80 m3 total volume of water 40 kg m3 average stocking density and 15 kg d feeding rate was 10 m3 m2 d this study suggests that biochar based filtration could be incorporated into aquaponics as a polishing step before sending the water to plant growth systems keywords aquaponics biochar filtration particle size distribution turbidity 1 introduction the aquaculture industry is one of the fastest growing food producing sectors in the world according to the most recent estimates by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the global aquaculture production both marine and inland reached 80 million tons in 2016 fao 2018 which accounted for 50 of the total seafood supply abate et al 2016 despite its considerable positive economic impacts fish farming is associated with several environmental challenges such as significant water consumption and discharge of biologically unstable solid waste and nutrient rich effluent turcios and papenbrock 2014 wang et al 2016 in order to alleviate these issues more environmentally friendly and sustainable fish farming technologies have been proposed including recirculating aquaculture systems ras and aquaponics ebeling and timmons 2012 khiari et al 2019 savidov et al 2007 recirculating aquaculture systems ras represent a technology for intensive fish farming where the water is recirculated to the fish culture tanks after mechanical and biological treatments badiola et al 2012 van rijn 2013 ras are capable of recycling more than 90 of the water badiola et al 2012 which leads to reduction in both water consumption and effluent discharge biological filtration though mandatory is not sufficient on its own to guarantee adequate water quality for fish farming and therefore other treatment processes such as ozonation are often required to remove organic carbon and turbidity gonçalves and gagnon 2011 aquaponics on the other hand is a technology based on the co production of fish and plants in one integrated system khiari et al 2019 savidov et al 2007 in aquaponics fish provide the required nutrients for plant growth and in turn plants absorb these nutrients decreasing their concentrations in the water which is subsequently recycled back to the fish tanks medina et al 2016 biologically aquaponics is an integrated multi trophic system which mimics the same interactions as those in natural ecosystems nichols and savidov 2012 nitrification is just one of the processes in such ecosystems where aerobic microorganisms convert ammonia a toxic metabolite for fish into nitrite and ultimately nitrate which is considered the preferred form of nitrogen for plant growth khiari et al 2019 the most significant benefits of aquaponics compared to ras include increased revenue through the production of marketable vegetable crops savidov et al 2007 as well as the reduced release of plant nutrients into the environment since ras require about 5 10 daily effluent discharge and fresh water renewal to lower the concentration of nitrate and other soluble minerals which would otherwise accumulate in recirculated fish effluent van bussel et al 2012 in this regard several research studies indicated that plant based removal of nutrients from fish effluent through aquaponics leads to more than 60 reduction in nitrate concertation and over 80 decrease in phosphorus level adler et al 2003 adler et al 2000a adler et al 2000b the introduction of ras and aquaponics into aquaculture practices resulted in significant advantages to the aquaculture industry and the environment however in order to achieve maximum ras and aquaponics performance a careful system design a strict water quality control program and an optimum waste management strategy are required van rijn 2013 wang et al 2016 in both systems ammonia removal and solids capture are the most critical treatment processes in current industrial operations ammonia removal is achieved through aerobic biological conversion to nitrate while solids are separated from the water through mechanical filtration such as drum and screen filters floating bed filters and submerged high pressure sand filters the presence of organic solids can be extremely problematic for aquaponics for instance the biological decay of unconsumed feed and fecal matter lowers the oxygen level and generates toxic metabolites rakocy 1994 in addition the accumulation of organic debris in soilless crop production such as aquaponic rafts and vertical towers can plug the pipes and hinder drainage somerville et al 2014 the problem of particle accumulation can be even more damaging on the root zone of the plants as clogging the roots deprives them of adequate oxygen supply due to anaerobic decomposition of trapped debris rakocy et al 2006 2011 rakocy 1994 this in turn leads to severe plant stress and less resistance to root borne diseases such as pithum causing the ultimate failure of the plant production system although large sized particles in fish effluent 30 μm can be removed using conventional filtration methods the challenge lies in the removal of smaller suspended micro and nano particles wang et al 2016 typically particles below 30 μm are chemically removed through coagulation and or flocculation tociu et al 2014 ozonation can also remove small particles however ozone application leads to the removal of dissolved organic compounds gonçalves and gagnon 2011 and thus deprives plants from important nutrients present in fish effluent so far there is no available technology which can efficiently remove suspended particles from aquaculture effluents while retaining valuable plant nutrients biochar also termed charcoal or biomass derived black carbon is a carbonaceous material produced from organic feedstock through pyrolysis meyer et al 2011 the pyrolysis process leads to formation of a highly stable material with a complex network of interspersed tunnels with various pore sizes biochar porosity has been recognized as a desirable characteristic for numerous industrial applications however there was no in depth study on biochar application for the removal of micro particles and as a soilless growing medium until early 2000s when research investigations carried out by savidov and nichols 2010 nichols et al 2010 and khan et al 2015 indicated that biochar was not just a viable alternative to existing growing materials but also exceeded them in terms of durability and crop yields in addition to its role as a soilless growing medium biochar can also function as a micro filter when used in grow bags in aquaponics and organic hydroponics savidov 2013 another study also demonstrated the value of biochar in integrated fish and plant systems legault and savidov 2015 the following work is a continuation of unpublished work conducted at the aquaculture centre of excellence lethbridge college demonstrating and defining the microfiltration properties of biochar the aims of this work were to 1 investigate biochar as a potential low cost renewable filtration medium in aquaponics 2 optimize the biochar based filtration process in a small scale experimental set up and 3 verify the outcomes in a large scale biochar filter incorporated within a high intensity industrial aquaponic system 2 material and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 fish effluent fish effluent was obtained from a high intensity aquaponic system of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus in this system fish effluent was first filtered through a drum filter p r a manufacturing ltd nanaimo bc canada which separated the liquid fraction i e fish effluent rich in ammonia from solid particulates i e manure comprising unconsumed feed and fecal matter ammonia rich fish effluent underwent a nitrification step within the fluidized sand biofilter biological filtration through aerobic nitrifying bacteria mainly nitrosomonas and nitrobacter this step initially converted ammonia into nitrite and subsequently into nitrate plants in the greenhouse absorbed nitrate and other soluble minerals reducing their concentrations in water which was circulated back to the fish tank after oxygenation the total volume of the water in this system was about 80 m3 and the average stocking density weight of fish per unit volume of water was approximately 40 kg m3 the feeding rate of the fish was 15 kg

after passing through the fluidized sand biofilter and before delivery to the greenhouse 2 1 2 biochar bamboo biochars referred to as fine with a particle size of 1 3 mm and coarse with a particle size of 3 5 mm were separately used as filtration media biochar samples were prepared from the same bamboo feedstock and were divided after pyrolysis into different sizes fine and coarse using an industrial sieving machine the biochars used in this study were prepared by sungro bioresource bioenergy technologies corp edmonton ab canada and supplied by pure life global inc calgary ab canada 2 2

sydney ns canada 2 2 3 biochar based filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics 2 2 3 1 filter set up for the small scale experiments 3 biochar filters with various bed heights 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 cm were prepared for both fine and coarse biochars each filter was constructed using a polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe cap with an internal diameter of 16 0 cm an opening with a diameter of 2 0 cm was drilled in the center of pvc pipe cap which served as the filter outlet port figure s1 a supplementary material the internal surface of the filter was covered with a commercial landscaping polypropylene fabric in order to prevent the biochar from escaping the large scale biochar filter consisted of a cylindrical fiberglass tank with a diameter of 2 4 m an opening on the bottom center of the tank with a diameter of 7 6 cm was used as the outlet port figure s1 b supplementary material the internal surface of the tank was covered with the same commercial landscaping polypropylene fabric that was used for the small scale filters the tank was filled with equal amounts of fine and coarse biochars ratio 50 50 resulting in a biochar mixture with a size of 1 5 mm to a height of 1 0 m based on literature for sand filters which suggested an effective filtration media size of 2 4 mm and a recommended filter depth of 1 2 m zouboulis et al 2007 2 2 3 2 filtration conditions before performing the filtration experiments 10 l of deionized water was loaded onto each small scale filter while the large scale filter was sprinkled with tap water this pre treatment operation was carried out to moisten and pack the biochar media as well as to flush out any residual dust and impurities fish effluent samples obtained after undergoing a biological treatment in the fluidized sand biofilter were used in this study for both small and large scale biochar filtrations 3 different loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d were assessed the loading rate was calculated as the flow rate divided by the surface area of the filter m2 as follows 2 l o a d i n g r a t e m 3 m 2 d f l o w r a t e π r a d i u s o f t h e f i l t e r 2 a series of valves were used to control the filtration at the desired loading rate adjustable micro sprayers for small scale filters and mini spray nozzle sprinklers for the large scale filter were used to uniformly apply the fish effluent on the top surface of the filters fish effluent was allowed to pass through the filters then samples were collected in 50 ml plastic tubes and analyzed within 2 hours after collection 2 2 4 characterization of biochar based filtration 2 2

liquid module with a 12 ml working volume data of the particles size distribution with size ranging from 0 375 to 2000 μm were obtained by beckman coulter particle characterization software version 6

of nine runs was performed for each biochar size fine and coarse the experimental design comprised all possible combinations of values for each factor table 1 the filtration experiments both small scale and large scale were replicated three times on three different occasions 3 independent trials new biochar filters were prepared for each replicate during small scale filtrations while for large scale filtrations the biochar bed was turned over before each trial each analysis was performed in triplicate for each trial analysis of variance anova was used and multiple range test tukey s honestly significant difference p 0 05 was conducted to determine differences between means in small scale experiments the model tested the filtration conditions biochar size biochar bed height and loading rate as fixed effects in large scale experiments the model tested the loading rate as a fixed effect for both scales small and large the filtration day filtration replicate was considered as a random effect all statistical analyses were performed using statistical analysis software sas university edition sas institute inc cary nc and letter groupings were obtained using the sas pdmix800 macro saxton 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar characterization 3 1 1 physical properties of bamboo biochars the density and porosity of fine and coarse bamboo biochars are summarized in table 2 the bulk density is an important characteristic that is indicative of the presence of pores and reflects the ability of biochar to sink or float in water given the pores are air filled brewer et al 2014 the bulk density of fine biochar 0 366 g cm3 was two times greater than that of coarse biochar 0 176 g cm3 which was mainly due to differences in size and shape in fact as the size of particles increases the bulk density decreases bitra et al 2009 true density in which the volume of intra particle pores and voids between particles are excluded hung et al 2017 indicated that the 2 sizes of bamboo biochar were fairly similar this was expected because both biochar samples were prepared from the same feedstock at the same pyrolysis conditions when comparing porosity coarse biochar had greater total porosity 89 1 than fine biochar 76 2 since both biochar samples had similar true density the lower total porosity in fine biochar could be attributed to less voids between particles inter pores compared to coarse biochar 3 1 2 scanning electron microscopy sem fig 1 shows typical sem micrographs of the external morphology of a randomly selected bamboo biochar sample at 3 different magnification levels sem images revealed the porous structure of bamboo biochar with relatively uniform pores in micrometer range forming a honeycomb like morphology and reflecting a typical structure of xylem tissue in general the pyrolysis process leads to the release of volatile components in the feedstock and the non volatile matter is converted into porous biochar with voids of various shapes and sizes liew et al 2018 the sem analysis was in agreement with the porosity result which indicated that bamboo biochar was mainly composed of a porous structure with the majority of pores between 30 and 60 microns both intra pores and inter pores of bamboo biochar could play a major role in filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics in this respect the removal of particulate matter and turbidity could be achieved by either trapping the particles within the intra pores of biochar wedging them between convex surfaces of two biochar grains i e retention in crevice sites holding them in a sheltered areas developed by several biochar grains i e retention in cavern sites or a combination of these processes benamar et al 2007 herzig et al 1970 zamani and maini 2009 it is important to note that several factors such as shape size and density of the particles the grain size and porosity of biochar the chemical properties and flow rate of the effluent as well as the interaction forces between the particles and biochar media significantly affect the retention of particles and therefore significantly affect the overall filtration through porous media such as biochar gao 2007 herzig et al 1970 sabiri et al 2017 3 2 small scale biochar based filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics 3 2 1 particle size distribution fig 2 shows the particle size distribution curves of fish effluent before and after small scale biochar filtration while table 3 presents the particle size data of fish effluent after small scale biochar filtration using fine and coarse biochars for all loading rates and all biochar bed heights it was clear that the particle size distribution of the inflow water before filtration was significantly greater than the outflow water after filtration fig 2 for all loading rates tested in this study the inflow water had a broad fraction of larger size particles with d 4 3 varying from 71 0 to 75 3 μm dv10 ranging from 14 1 to 14 5 μm dv50 varying from 47 8 to 51 9 μm dv90 ranging from 165 4 to 172 1 μm and rsf extending from 3 0 to 3 2 after biochar filtration the particle size distribution of outflow significantly decreased p 0 05 compared to the inflow at all loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d and for all biochar bed heights 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 cm the size of biochar fine and coarse the loading rate the biochar bed height as well as their interactions had statistically significant effects on the particle size distribution of the outflow table 3 when considering the sole effect of biochar size fine and coarse the results indicated that biochar size impacted the particle distribution characteristics of the outflow using fine biochar resulted in outflow with significantly lower d 4 3 dv10 dv50 dv90 and rsf compared to coarse biochar table 3 the better particle size characteristics of the outflow obtained with fine biochar could be attributed to the porosity of fine biochar as discussed in section 3 1 1 where the smaller inter pore size between fine biochar grains could have retained more particles suspended in fish effluent in addition the surface area of fine biochar may also have played a role in improving particle capture efficiency in this regard fine biochar is believed to possess greater surface area compared to coarse biochar as size reduction increases surface area peterson et al 2012 which may have resulted in greater adsorption of particles zheng et al 2012 increasing the loading rate decreased dv10 and increased d 4 3 dv50 dv90 and rsf of the outflow table 3 the effect of increasing the loading rate on filtration performances was more profound for coarse biochar compared to fine biochar fig 2 and table 3 this phenomenon i e decrease of filtration performance at higher loading rates was previously reported for the filtration of wastewater duran ros et al 2009 williams et al 2007 and was attributed to reduction of transport time due to higher velocities as well as to the decline of particle attachment efficiency as a result of hydrodynamic forces williams et al 2007 in addition high loading rates can result in the dissociation of attached particles and the breakage of large particles because of shear forces boller and blaser 1998 kim and lawler 2012 which consequently may have affected the particle size distribution as depicted in fig 2 and table 3 unlike the loading rate increasing the height of biochar bed from 2 5 cm to 5 0 cm decreased the range of particle size distribution fig 2 as well as the particle size data table 3 similar trends i e enhancement of filtration performance with higher filter bed have been observed for the removal of particulate matter and contaminants using activated carbon areerachakul et al 2007 pumice a porous volcanic rock farizoglu et al 2003 and sand torrens et al 2009 subsequent increase of biochar filter bed height from 5 0 cm to 10 0 cm did not result in improvement of fish effluent filtration the enhanced removal of larger particles with deeper biochar bed could be due to a greater detention time as well as higher surface area for the retention of particles farizoglu et al 2003 3 2 2 turbidity removal efficiency turbidity reflects the presence of suspended and dissolved solids that absorb or scatter light as a water quality parameter turbidity has a great significance in aquaculture and aquaponics because high turbidity reduces dissolved oxygen henley et al 2000 and consequently turbid environments lose their ability to maintain healthy plants and aquatic organisms bisinoti et al 2007 the inflow in this study had a turbidity value of 77 44 2 01 ftu results from the turbidity measurement turbidity values and turbidity removal percentages of outflow after biochar filtration are presented in table 4 the turbidity values ranged from 15 22 to 31 11 ftu while the turbidity removal efficiencies varied from 60 47 to 80 66 depending on biochar size loading rate and biochar bed height when comparing the effect of 2 biochar sizes it was found that using fine biochar led to lower turbidity values and better turbidity removal percentages compared to coarse biochar this could be attributed to the lower total porosity and the greater surface properties of fine biochar which may have resulted in better capture of particles in fact particle removal during filtration occurs through the transport of particulate matter and suspended solids from the inflow into the filtration media followed by their capture by either adsorption due to brownian motion and electrostatic interactions between the particles and the surface of the pores size exclusion straining due to size difference between the particles and the pore openings and or sedimentation gravity settling due to density difference between the particles and the carrying effluent gao 2007 results also indicated that increasing the loading rate and or decreasing the biochar bed height negatively impacted the turbidity removal efficiency for filtration using fine biochar the lowest turbidity value and the greatest turbidity removal percentage 15 22 ftu and 80 66 respectively were obtained at the lowest loading rate 5 m3 m2 d and the highest bed height 10 0 cm table 4 while the lowest turbidity values 24 22 24 33 ftu and the greatest turbidity removal efficiencies 69 08 69 22 for coarse biochar were observed at 5 m3 m2 d using 5 0 and 10 0 cm biochar bed heights table 4 increasing the loading rate and or decreasing the bed height caused the opposite effect table 4 in this regards the greatest turbidity values and the lowest turbidity removal efficiencies for fine and coarse biochars were observed at 10 and 15 m3 m2 d using 2 5 cm bed height after filtration all waters were visually clear with light yellowish brownish color which was most probably due to the presence of dissolved humic matter the turbidity results strongly indicated that biochar possessed the capacity to retain particles and clarify aquaponic effluents 3 3 large scale biochar based filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics fig 3 and table 5 show respectively the particle size distribution curves and particle size distribution data for fish effluent after filtration using the large scale biochar filter at 3 loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d particle size analysis of the inflow water for large scale biochar filtration indicated that d 4 3 varied from 64 9 to 72 6 μm dv10 ranged from 13 4 to 14 2 μm dv50 varied from 38 0 to 46 6 μm dv90 ranged from 162 6 to 177 0 μm and rsf extended from 3 5 to 3 9 similar to small scale outcomes large scale biochar filtration resulted in significant reduction of particle size distributions of fish effluent fig 3 for all loading rates d 4 3 was reduced by more than 90 dv10 and dv90 dropped by more than 94 while dv50 decreased by more than 84 increasing the loading rate from 5 m3 m2 d to 10 m3 m2 d and subsequently to 15 m3 m2 d broadened the particle distribution of the outflow fig 3 and significantly increased the values of the mean median and the two percentiles dv10 and dv90 as well as the rsf table 5 the loading rate in the large scale biochar based filtration also significantly affected the turbidity values and the turbidity removal efficiencies in this respect increasing the loading rate from 5 m3 m2 d to 15 m3 m2 d significantly increased the turbidity values from 12 89 to 16 89 ftu and lowered the turbidity removal efficiencies from 83 35 to 78 18 table 6 the turbidity value 13 78 ftu and the turbidity removal efficiency 82 20 at 10 m3 m2 d were slightly lower than that obtained using a loading rate of 5 m3 m2 d table 6 however the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 regardless of the loading rate the turbidity of the outflow from large scale biochar filter ranged from 12 89 0 60 to 16 89 0 78 ftu these turbidity values indicated that biochar filtered fish effluents were suitable for re use in aquaculture as their turbidity fell within the acceptable range 5 25 ntu ftu for domestic use drever 2002 and did not exceed the maximum allowable value of 25 ntu ftu for aquaculture use epa 1988 outcomes from the large scale filtration experiments indicated that using a biochar filter with a media size of 1 5 mm a mixture of fine and coarse biochars at a loading rate of 10 m3 m2 d were the ideal conditions for the removal of suspended particles and turbidity in high intensity fish farming aquaponic operations biochar based filtration in such systems could most suitably be incorporated as a polishing process before sending the water back to the plant growth systems such as raft media bed and vertical tower as shown in fig 4 it is important to note however that these recommendations are only applicable for aquaponic systems running under similar operational conditions as fish species feed composition feeding rate stocking density and water treatment processes can all affect total suspended solids and particulate density and nature 4 conclusion based on the present study biochar represents a promising potential low cost renewable biomass for aquaponic effluent filtration the porous structure of biochar makes it very suitable for the retention of suspended particles and removal of turbidity the quality of filter outflow in terms of particle and turbidity removal efficiencies clearly demonstrated that biochar based filtration can be used in aquaponics to clarify fish effluent most appropriately as a water polishing step before sending the treated water plant growth systems especially for fish species with higher demand for water quality such as salmonids results also indicated that the performance of biochar based filtration depends on the operational conditions biochar media size biochar filter bed height and loading rate despite these positive findings further research is still required to fully confirm the advantages of biochar based effluent filtration in highly intensive aquaponic productions 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10756,small and large scale biochar based filtrations were conducted to investigate the potential of biochar as a low cost renewable filtration medium in aquaponics the small scale experimental design investigated the effects of 2 biochar media sizes 1 3 mm referred to as fine biochar and 3 5 mm referred to as coarse biochar 3 biochar bed heights 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 cm and 3 loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d on particle size distribution as well as turbidity removal efficiency both biochar sizes fine and coarse were able to clarify fish effluent however fine biochar led to better filtration characteristics compared to coarse biochar results indicated that biochar filter bed heights and loading rates affected the filtration performances using deeper filters combined with lower loading rates led to greater removal of suspended particles and turbidity compared to shallower filters and or higher loading rates results from the large scale filtration using a mixture of fine and coarse biochar media size of 1 5 mm revealed that the ideal loading rate for maximizing the removal of turbidity from fish effluent in high intensity aquaponic system for production of nile tilapia and greenhouse plants with 80 m3 total volume of water 40 kg m3 average stocking density and 15 kg d feeding rate was 10 m3 m2 d this study suggests that biochar based filtration could be incorporated into aquaponics as a polishing step before sending the water to plant growth systems keywords aquaponics biochar filtration particle size distribution turbidity 1 introduction the aquaculture industry is one of the fastest growing food producing sectors in the world according to the most recent estimates by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the global aquaculture production both marine and inland reached 80 million tons in 2016 fao 2018 which accounted for 50 of the total seafood supply abate et al 2016 despite its considerable positive economic impacts fish farming is associated with several environmental challenges such as significant water consumption and discharge of biologically unstable solid waste and nutrient rich effluent turcios and papenbrock 2014 wang et al 2016 in order to alleviate these issues more environmentally friendly and sustainable fish farming technologies have been proposed including recirculating aquaculture systems ras and aquaponics ebeling and timmons 2012 khiari et al 2019 savidov et al 2007 recirculating aquaculture systems ras represent a technology for intensive fish farming where the water is recirculated to the fish culture tanks after mechanical and biological treatments badiola et al 2012 van rijn 2013 ras are capable of recycling more than 90 of the water badiola et al 2012 which leads to reduction in both water consumption and effluent discharge biological filtration though mandatory is not sufficient on its own to guarantee adequate water quality for fish farming and therefore other treatment processes such as ozonation are often required to remove organic carbon and turbidity gonçalves and gagnon 2011 aquaponics on the other hand is a technology based on the co production of fish and plants in one integrated system khiari et al 2019 savidov et al 2007 in aquaponics fish provide the required nutrients for plant growth and in turn plants absorb these nutrients decreasing their concentrations in the water which is subsequently recycled back to the fish tanks medina et al 2016 biologically aquaponics is an integrated multi trophic system which mimics the same interactions as those in natural ecosystems nichols and savidov 2012 nitrification is just one of the processes in such ecosystems where aerobic microorganisms convert ammonia a toxic metabolite for fish into nitrite and ultimately nitrate which is considered the preferred form of nitrogen for plant growth khiari et al 2019 the most significant benefits of aquaponics compared to ras include increased revenue through the production of marketable vegetable crops savidov et al 2007 as well as the reduced release of plant nutrients into the environment since ras require about 5 10 daily effluent discharge and fresh water renewal to lower the concentration of nitrate and other soluble minerals which would otherwise accumulate in recirculated fish effluent van bussel et al 2012 in this regard several research studies indicated that plant based removal of nutrients from fish effluent through aquaponics leads to more than 60 reduction in nitrate concertation and over 80 decrease in phosphorus level adler et al 2003 adler et al 2000a adler et al 2000b the introduction of ras and aquaponics into aquaculture practices resulted in significant advantages to the aquaculture industry and the environment however in order to achieve maximum ras and aquaponics performance a careful system design a strict water quality control program and an optimum waste management strategy are required van rijn 2013 wang et al 2016 in both systems ammonia removal and solids capture are the most critical treatment processes in current industrial operations ammonia removal is achieved through aerobic biological conversion to nitrate while solids are separated from the water through mechanical filtration such as drum and screen filters floating bed filters and submerged high pressure sand filters the presence of organic solids can be extremely problematic for aquaponics for instance the biological decay of unconsumed feed and fecal matter lowers the oxygen level and generates toxic metabolites rakocy 1994 in addition the accumulation of organic debris in soilless crop production such as aquaponic rafts and vertical towers can plug the pipes and hinder drainage somerville et al 2014 the problem of particle accumulation can be even more damaging on the root zone of the plants as clogging the roots deprives them of adequate oxygen supply due to anaerobic decomposition of trapped debris rakocy et al 2006 2011 rakocy 1994 this in turn leads to severe plant stress and less resistance to root borne diseases such as pithum causing the ultimate failure of the plant production system although large sized particles in fish effluent 30 μm can be removed using conventional filtration methods the challenge lies in the removal of smaller suspended micro and nano particles wang et al 2016 typically particles below 30 μm are chemically removed through coagulation and or flocculation tociu et al 2014 ozonation can also remove small particles however ozone application leads to the removal of dissolved organic compounds gonçalves and gagnon 2011 and thus deprives plants from important nutrients present in fish effluent so far there is no available technology which can efficiently remove suspended particles from aquaculture effluents while retaining valuable plant nutrients biochar also termed charcoal or biomass derived black carbon is a carbonaceous material produced from organic feedstock through pyrolysis meyer et al 2011 the pyrolysis process leads to formation of a highly stable material with a complex network of interspersed tunnels with various pore sizes biochar porosity has been recognized as a desirable characteristic for numerous industrial applications however there was no in depth study on biochar application for the removal of micro particles and as a soilless growing medium until early 2000s when research investigations carried out by savidov and nichols 2010 nichols et al 2010 and khan et al 2015 indicated that biochar was not just a viable alternative to existing growing materials but also exceeded them in terms of durability and crop yields in addition to its role as a soilless growing medium biochar can also function as a micro filter when used in grow bags in aquaponics and organic hydroponics savidov 2013 another study also demonstrated the value of biochar in integrated fish and plant systems legault and savidov 2015 the following work is a continuation of unpublished work conducted at the aquaculture centre of excellence lethbridge college demonstrating and defining the microfiltration properties of biochar the aims of this work were to 1 investigate biochar as a potential low cost renewable filtration medium in aquaponics 2 optimize the biochar based filtration process in a small scale experimental set up and 3 verify the outcomes in a large scale biochar filter incorporated within a high intensity industrial aquaponic system 2 material and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 fish effluent fish effluent was obtained from a high intensity aquaponic system of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus in this system fish effluent was first filtered through a drum filter p r a manufacturing ltd nanaimo bc canada which separated the liquid fraction i e fish effluent rich in ammonia from solid particulates i e manure comprising unconsumed feed and fecal matter ammonia rich fish effluent underwent a nitrification step within the fluidized sand biofilter biological filtration through aerobic nitrifying bacteria mainly nitrosomonas and nitrobacter this step initially converted ammonia into nitrite and subsequently into nitrate plants in the greenhouse absorbed nitrate and other soluble minerals reducing their concentrations in water which was circulated back to the fish tank after oxygenation the total volume of the water in this system was about 80 m3 and the average stocking density weight of fish per unit volume of water was approximately 40 kg m3 the feeding rate of the fish was 15 kg d with a fish feed tilapia float 3 5 mm comprising 40 crude protein 9 crude fat and 10 ash skretting vancouver bc canada for the small and large scale filtration experiments the water was collected after passing through the fluidized sand biofilter and before delivery to the greenhouse 2 1 2 biochar bamboo biochars referred to as fine with a particle size of 1 3 mm and coarse with a particle size of 3 5 mm were separately used as filtration media biochar samples were prepared from the same bamboo feedstock and were divided after pyrolysis into different sizes fine and coarse using an industrial sieving machine the biochars used in this study were prepared by sungro bioresource bioenergy technologies corp edmonton ab canada and supplied by pure life global inc calgary ab canada 2 2

microscope pemtron ps 230 seoul korea biochar samples were first fixed using a double sided carbon adhesive tape on an aluminum stub then gold coated by sputter coater and viewed at an acceleration voltage of 10 0 kv ghaffar et al 2015 the scanning electron microscopy sem analysis was carried out at the verschuren centre for sustainability in energy and the environment at cape breton university sydney ns canada 2 2 3 biochar based filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics 2 2 3 1 filter set up for the small scale experiments 3 biochar filters with various bed heights 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 cm were prepared for both fine and coarse biochars each filter was constructed using a polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe cap with an internal diameter of 16 0 cm an opening with a diameter of 2 0 cm was drilled in the center of pvc pipe cap which served as the filter outlet port figure s1 a supplementary material the internal surface of the filter was covered with a commercial landscaping polypropylene fabric in order to prevent the biochar from escaping the large scale biochar filter consisted of a cylindrical fiberglass tank with a diameter of 2 4 m an opening on the bottom center of the tank with a diameter of 7 6 cm was used as the outlet port figure s1 b supplementary material the internal surface of the tank was covered with the same commercial landscaping polypropylene fabric that was used for the small scale filters the tank was filled with equal amounts of fine and coarse biochars ratio 50 50 resulting in a biochar mixture with a size of 1 5 mm to a height of 1 0 m based on literature for sand filters which suggested an effective filtration media size of 2 4 mm and a recommended filter depth of 1 2 m zouboulis et al 2007 2 2 3 2 filtration conditions before performing the filtration experiments 10 l of deionized water was loaded onto each small scale filter while the large scale filter was sprinkled with tap water this pre treatment operation was carried out to moisten and pack the biochar media as well as to flush out any residual dust and impurities fish effluent samples obtained after undergoing a biological treatment in the fluidized sand biofilter were used in this study for both small and large scale biochar filtrations 3 different loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d were assessed the loading rate was calculated as the flow rate divided by the surface area of the filter m2 as follows 2 l o a d i n g r a t e m 3 m 2 d f l o w r a t e π r a d i u s o f t h e f i l t e r 2 a series of valves were used to control the filtration at the desired loading rate adjustable micro sprayers for small scale filters and mini spray nozzle sprinklers for the large scale filter were used to uniformly apply the fish effluent on the top surface of the filters fish effluent was allowed to pass through the filters then samples were collected in 50 ml plastic tubes and analyzed within 2 hours after collection 2 2 4 characterization of biochar based filtration 2 2

liquid module with a 12 ml working volume data of the particles size distribution with size ranging from 0 375 to 2000 μm were obtained by beckman coulter particle characterization software version 6 01 several particle size data were reported in this study including the volume weighted mean diameter de broukere mean d 4 3 which denotes the weighted average volume diameter assuming spherical particles of the same volume as the real particles byrn et al 2017 as well as dv10 dv50 volume median diameter and dv90 which respectively represent the size below which 10 50 and 90 of the sample volume exists in order to describe the particle size distribution the relative span factor rsf which is a dimensionless parameter reflecting the uniformity of the particle size distribution

of nine runs was performed for each biochar size fine and coarse the experimental design comprised all possible combinations of values for each factor table 1 the filtration experiments both small scale and large scale were replicated three times on three different occasions 3 independent trials new biochar filters were prepared for each replicate during small scale filtrations while for large scale filtrations the biochar bed was turned over before each trial each analysis was performed in triplicate for each trial analysis of variance anova was used and multiple range test tukey s honestly significant difference p 0 05 was conducted to determine differences between means in small scale experiments the model tested the filtration conditions biochar size biochar bed height and loading rate as fixed effects in large scale experiments the model tested the loading rate as a fixed effect for both scales small and large the filtration day filtration replicate was considered as a random effect all statistical analyses were performed using statistical analysis software sas university edition sas institute inc cary nc and letter groupings were obtained using the sas pdmix800 macro saxton 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar characterization 3 1 1 physical properties of bamboo biochars the density and porosity of fine and coarse bamboo biochars are summarized in table 2 the bulk density is an important characteristic that is indicative of the presence of pores and reflects the ability of biochar to sink or float in water given the pores are air filled brewer et al 2014 the bulk density of fine biochar 0 366 g cm3 was two times greater than that of coarse biochar 0 176 g cm3 which was mainly due to differences in size and shape in fact as the size of particles increases the bulk density decreases bitra et al 2009 true density in which the volume of intra particle pores and voids between particles are excluded hung et al 2017 indicated that the 2 sizes of bamboo biochar were fairly similar this was expected because both biochar samples were prepared from the same feedstock at the same pyrolysis conditions when comparing porosity coarse biochar had greater total porosity 89 1 than fine biochar 76 2 since both biochar samples had similar true density the lower total porosity in fine biochar could be attributed to less voids between particles inter pores compared to coarse biochar 3 1 2 scanning electron microscopy sem fig 1 shows typical sem micrographs of the external morphology of a randomly selected bamboo biochar sample at 3 different magnification levels sem images revealed the porous structure of bamboo biochar with relatively uniform pores in micrometer range forming a honeycomb like morphology and reflecting a typical structure of xylem tissue in general the pyrolysis process leads to the release of volatile components in the feedstock and the non volatile matter is converted into porous biochar with voids of various shapes and sizes liew et al 2018 the sem analysis was in agreement with the porosity result which indicated that bamboo biochar was mainly composed of a porous structure with the majority of pores between 30 and 60 microns both intra pores and inter pores of bamboo biochar could play a major role in filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics in this respect the removal of particulate matter and turbidity could be achieved by either trapping the particles within the intra pores of biochar wedging them between convex surfaces of two biochar grains i e retention in crevice sites holding them in a sheltered areas developed by several biochar grains i e retention in cavern sites or a combination of these processes benamar et al 2007 herzig et al 1970 zamani and maini 2009 it is important to note that several factors such as shape size and density of the particles the grain size and porosity of biochar the chemical properties and flow rate of the effluent as well as the interaction forces between the particles and biochar media significantly affect the retention of particles and therefore significantly affect the overall filtration through porous media such as biochar gao 2007 herzig et al 1970 sabiri et al 2017 3 2 small scale biochar based filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics 3 2 1 particle size distribution fig 2 shows the particle size distribution curves of fish effluent before and after small scale biochar filtration while table 3 presents the particle size data of fish effluent after small scale biochar filtration using fine and coarse biochars for all loading rates and all biochar bed heights it was clear that the particle size distribution of the inflow water before filtration was significantly greater than the outflow water after filtration fig 2 for all loading rates tested in this study the inflow water had a broad fraction of larger size particles with d 4 3 varying from 71 0 to 75 3 μm dv10 ranging from 14 1 to 14 5 μm dv50 varying from 47 8 to 51 9 μm dv90 ranging from 165 4 to 172 1 μm and rsf extending from 3 0 to 3 2 after biochar filtration the particle size distribution of outflow significantly decreased p 0 05 compared to the inflow at all loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d and for all biochar bed heights 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 cm the size of biochar fine and coarse the loading rate the biochar bed height as well as their interactions had statistically significant effects on the particle size distribution of the outflow table 3 when considering the sole effect of biochar size fine and coarse the results indicated that biochar size impacted the particle distribution characteristics of the outflow using fine biochar resulted in outflow with significantly lower d 4 3 dv10 dv50 dv90 and rsf compared to coarse biochar table 3 the better particle size characteristics of the outflow obtained with fine biochar could be attributed to the porosity of fine biochar as discussed in section 3 1 1 where the smaller inter pore size between fine biochar grains could have retained more particles suspended in fish effluent in addition the surface area of fine biochar may also have played a role in improving particle capture efficiency in this regard fine biochar is believed to possess greater surface area compared to coarse biochar as size reduction increases surface area peterson et al 2012 which may have resulted in greater adsorption of particles zheng et al 2012 increasing the loading rate decreased dv10 and increased d 4 3 dv50 dv90 and rsf of the outflow table 3 the effect of increasing the loading rate on filtration performances was more profound for coarse biochar compared to fine biochar fig 2 and table 3 this phenomenon i e decrease of filtration performance at higher loading rates was previously reported for the filtration of wastewater duran ros et al 2009 williams et al 2007 and was attributed to reduction of transport time due to higher velocities as well as to the decline of particle attachment efficiency as a result of hydrodynamic forces williams et al 2007 in addition high loading rates can result in the dissociation of attached particles and the breakage of large particles because of shear forces boller and blaser 1998 kim and lawler 2012 which consequently may have affected the particle size distribution as depicted in fig 2 and table 3 unlike the loading rate increasing the height of biochar bed from 2 5 cm to 5 0 cm decreased the range of particle size distribution fig 2 as well as the particle size data table 3 similar trends i e enhancement of filtration performance with higher filter bed have been observed for the removal of particulate matter and contaminants using activated carbon areerachakul et al 2007 pumice a porous volcanic rock farizoglu et al 2003 and sand torrens et al 2009 subsequent increase of biochar filter bed height from 5 0 cm to 10 0 cm did not result in improvement of fish effluent filtration the enhanced removal of larger particles with deeper biochar bed could be due to a greater detention time as well as higher surface area for the retention of particles farizoglu et al 2003 3 2 2 turbidity removal efficiency turbidity reflects the presence of suspended and dissolved solids that absorb or scatter light as a water quality parameter turbidity has a great significance in aquaculture and aquaponics because high turbidity reduces dissolved oxygen henley et al 2000 and consequently turbid environments lose their ability to maintain healthy plants and aquatic organisms bisinoti et al 2007 the inflow in this study had a turbidity value of 77 44 2 01 ftu results from the turbidity measurement turbidity values and turbidity removal percentages of outflow after biochar filtration are presented in table 4 the turbidity values ranged from 15 22 to 31 11 ftu while the turbidity removal efficiencies varied from 60 47 to 80 66 depending on biochar size loading rate and biochar bed height when comparing the effect of 2 biochar sizes it was found that using fine biochar led to lower turbidity values and better turbidity removal percentages compared to coarse biochar this could be attributed to the lower total porosity and the greater surface properties of fine biochar which may have resulted in better capture of particles in fact particle removal during filtration occurs through the transport of particulate matter and suspended solids from the inflow into the filtration media followed by their capture by either adsorption due to brownian motion and electrostatic interactions between the particles and the surface of the pores size exclusion straining due to size difference between the particles and the pore openings and or sedimentation gravity settling due to density difference between the particles and the carrying effluent gao 2007 results also indicated that increasing the loading rate and or decreasing the biochar bed height negatively impacted the turbidity removal efficiency for filtration using fine biochar the lowest turbidity value and the greatest turbidity removal percentage 15 22 ftu and 80 66 respectively were obtained at the lowest loading rate 5 m3 m2 d and the highest bed height 10 0 cm table 4 while the lowest turbidity values 24 22 24 33 ftu and the greatest turbidity removal efficiencies 69 08 69 22 for coarse biochar were observed at 5 m3 m2 d using 5 0 and 10 0 cm biochar bed heights table 4 increasing the loading rate and or decreasing the bed height caused the opposite effect table 4 in this regards the greatest turbidity values and the lowest turbidity removal efficiencies for fine and coarse biochars were observed at 10 and 15 m3 m2 d using 2 5 cm bed height after filtration all waters were visually clear with light yellowish brownish color which was most probably due to the presence of dissolved humic matter the turbidity results strongly indicated that biochar possessed the capacity to retain particles and clarify aquaponic effluents 3 3 large scale biochar based filtration of fish effluent in aquaponics fig 3 and table 5 show respectively the particle size distribution curves and particle size distribution data for fish effluent after filtration using the large scale biochar filter at 3 loading rates 5 10 and 15 m3 m2 d particle size analysis of the inflow water for large scale biochar filtration indicated that d 4 3 varied from 64 9 to 72 6 μm dv10 ranged from 13 4 to 14 2 μm dv50 varied from 38 0 to 46 6 μm dv90 ranged from 162 6 to 177 0 μm and rsf extended from 3 5 to 3 9 similar to small scale outcomes large scale biochar filtration resulted in significant reduction of particle size distributions of fish effluent fig 3 for all loading rates d 4 3 was reduced by more than 90 dv10 and dv90 dropped by more than 94 while dv50 decreased by more than 84 increasing the loading rate from 5 m3 m2 d to 10 m3 m2 d and subsequently to 15 m3 m2 d broadened the particle distribution of the outflow fig 3 and significantly increased the values of the mean median and the two percentiles dv10 and dv90 as well as the rsf table 5 the loading rate in the large scale biochar based filtration also significantly affected the turbidity values and the turbidity removal efficiencies in this respect increasing the loading rate from 5 m3 m2 d to 15 m3 m2 d significantly increased the turbidity values from 12 89 to 16 89 ftu and lowered the turbidity removal efficiencies from 83 35 to 78 18 table 6 the turbidity value 13 78 ftu and the turbidity removal efficiency 82 20 at 10 m3 m2 d were slightly lower than that obtained using a loading rate of 5 m3 m2 d table 6 however the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 regardless of the loading rate the turbidity of the outflow from large scale biochar filter ranged from 12 89 0 60 to 16 89 0 78 ftu these turbidity values indicated that biochar filtered fish effluents were suitable for re use in aquaculture as their turbidity fell within the acceptable range 5 25 ntu ftu for domestic use drever 2002 and did not exceed the maximum allowable value of 25 ntu ftu for aquaculture use epa 1988 outcomes from the large scale filtration experiments indicated that using a biochar filter with a media size of 1 5 mm a mixture of fine and coarse biochars at a loading rate of 10 m3 m2 d were the ideal conditions for the removal of suspended particles and turbidity in high intensity fish farming aquaponic operations biochar based filtration in such systems could most suitably be incorporated as a polishing process before sending the water back to the plant growth systems such as raft media bed and vertical tower as shown in fig 4 it is important to note however that these recommendations are only applicable for aquaponic systems running under similar operational conditions as fish species feed composition feeding rate stocking density and water treatment processes can all affect total suspended solids and particulate density and nature 4 conclusion based on the present study biochar represents a promising potential low cost renewable biomass for aquaponic effluent filtration the porous structure of biochar makes it very suitable for the retention of suspended particles and removal of turbidity the quality of filter outflow in terms of particle and turbidity removal efficiencies clearly demonstrated that biochar based filtration can be used in aquaponics to clarify fish effluent most appropriately as a water polishing step before sending the treated water plant growth systems especially for fish species with higher demand for water quality such as salmonids results also indicated that the performance of biochar based filtration depends on the operational conditions biochar media size biochar filter bed height and loading rate despite these positive findings further research is still required to fully confirm the advantages of biochar based effluent filtration in highly intensive aquaponic productions 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10757,an experiment was carried out in a semi arid area of spain albacete with the objective of quantifying the transpiration of grapevine cv tempranillo measurements of transpiration were taken in a weighing lysimeter over five years 2012 2016 the soil surface was covered with a waterproof canvas to avoid the evaporative component of evapotranspiration the sample frequency was 1 s and a mean value was recorded with a datalogger cr10x campbell scientific every 15 min which allowed for measuring the transpiration every quarter of an hour and therefore identify night time enight and daytime transpiration eday the results show values of enight between 3 of total daily transpiration in the days with the highest soil water content and 35 in the days in which the value of eday and the soil water content were very low although most days it was 12 we highlight the enight in the period after sunset more than we do that in predawn although in this last period it was higher close to sunrise finally enight was analysed throughout the growing season and from veraison to harvest was the period with the highest values keywords sunset transpiration predawn transpiration irrigation tempranillo 1 introduction until recently it had been commonly assumed that plant stomata close at night preventing water loss through transpiration during non photosynthetic periods novick et al 2009 numerous studies have shown that nocturnal transpiration enight occurs in plants and has been measured in woody crops daley and phillips 2006 kavanagh et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 zeppel et al 2010 buckley et al 2011 barbeta et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 brito et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and herbaceous species ogle et al 2012 o keefe and nippert 2018 ramirez et al 2018 however despite having been measured by many authors enight displays conflicting patterns and knowledge about the factors that affect those traits is still not available possible negative implications have been studied for the phenomenon such as absolute water loss and therefore affecting for example water use efficiency escalona et al 2013 nevertheless it has also been postulated to have several benefits some of them related to nutrition snyder et al 2003 scholz et al 2007 snyder et al 2008 burkhardt and hunsche 2013 and others related to supplying o2 daley and phillips 2006 or even the prevention of co2 build up in leaves marks and lechowicz 2007 what seems to be clear and agreed upon among all the authors who have measured it is that enight constitutes a significant yet poorly understood component of the global water cycle zeppel et al 2014 resco de dios et al 2015 2018 indeed enight accounts for 10 30 of the total daily transpiration e flux novick et al 2009 montoro et al 2016 or between 5 and 15 of daytime transpiration rates eday caird et al 2007a although higher rates have been reported in some extremes cases snyder et al 2003 forster 2014 most land surface models assume the non existence of enight kowalczyk et al 2006 but including nocturnal transpiration in land surface models leads to reductions of up to 50 of the projected available soil moisture in semiarid environments lombardozzi et al 2017 therefore estimates of enight should be including in such global models zeppel et al 2014 especially when negative effects can be exacerbated by the projections of climate change climate change is anticipated to cause a general reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature with the last one observed more markedly at nighttime in the mediterranean basin ipcc 2013 where a large proportion of the world s vineyard area is located another methodology that could be affected in certain conditions if enight is considered is the predawn water potential which has been taken as a water status descriptor assuming that during the night the plant and soil are in equilibrium due to transpiration preclusion caused by stomatal closure tourneux et al 2003 rolando et al 2015 transpiration in grapevine has been commonly measured at the leaf level by using portable equipment to detect leaf gas exchange rates which facilitates the measurement snyder et al 2003 ogle et al 2012 escalona et al 2013 however when those measurements are compared to the daily integrals or whole plant estimations there is not always a good correlation as show in the study by medrano et al 2017 with different genotypes tempranillo grenache malvasia of banyalbufar and cabernet sauvignon during three consecutive years or in the study of brito et al 2018 in olea europaea which affirmed

earliest year 2015 and the latest year 2012 flowering was initiated approximately 55 days later veraison was reached with a 15 day difference among years harvest happened around day 260 and there was little difference among years in reaching that phenological state regarding the soil fig 6 shows the soil water content to 0 4 m depth the lowest values of soil moisture were reached in 2015 and before starting the irrigation after that the humidity was maintained close to 40 mm without differences between years we highlight 2012 because it was the year in which there was a greater oscillation between the maximum and minimum values of soil moisture between irrigations table 2 shows some main meteorological parameters measured during the study total precipitation was different among years oscillating between 480 mm 2012 2013 hydrological year and 173 mm 2013 2014 but the rainfall registered throughout the growing season was more similar among years with the maximum measured in 2013 171 mm and minimum in 2014 93 mm the maximum temperature was approximately 40 c the minimum temperature ranged between 6 c 2015 and 2016 and 9 c 2012 and it always happened between december and february the evaporative demand calculated though the et0 allen et al 1988 in the growing season had similar values in the first three years approximately 850 mm and was higher than this approximately 1020 mm in the last two years 3 2 night time transpiration versus daytime transpiration relationship between enight and eday in the five years of study is shown in fig 7 fig 7a shows the absolute values or the transpiration in mm the minimum values were 0 09 mm and 0 87 mm for enight and eday respectively when the values of eday were between 1 and 3 5 mm the enight reached high and low values indistinctly in contrast exceeding the value of 3 5 mm eday the enight was increasing fig 7b shows the same values but in relative units of percentage of enight which shows clearly that the highest values of enight corresponded with days in which the value of the eday had been very low and in contrast the days with an eday higher than 4 mm had an enight between 5 and 10 the study of enight throughout the growing season represented in fig 7b will explain in section 3 4 fig 8 shows the relationship between enight and eday in values of percentage in the same graphic the frequency at which the event occurs is represented through the size of the spheres the minimum value of enight was 3 and the maximum 35 the graphic highlights the number of times that enight reaches values close to 10 as well as the average of values reached 12 of enight which correspond with the 88 of eday the analysis of transpiration through the day for the three main periods of the growing season is shown in fig 9 which presents the values throughout the day for the three main periods of the growing season in intervals of one hour for the five years of study the highest e values are reached from flowering to veraison 0 10 0 029 mm per hour the first period stands out due to a greater dispersion of values and the last one due to the symmetrical rise and fall of the curve being practically a gaussian bell shape 3 3 pre dawn transpiration versus transpiration after sunset enight was analysed in the two periods of night time close to the transitions from the daytime fig 9 shows in black columns the nocturnal transpiration highlighting the highest values in the period after sunset fig 10 represents the percentage of enight for every period of night the values present a tendency towards asenight more than pdenight the largest number of data points are found with pdenight values between 1 and 5 which correspond with asenight values between 2 and 14 three points stand out in the same figure due to being very different from the rest and they correspond to three consecutive days in september of 2012 when the et0 was highest among the previous days and abnormal for the time of year the asenight in the first day 23rd september was high and it continued after 0 00 h therefore on the next day 24th september the pdenight was also more elevated than on a normal day and finally on the third day 25th september it approximates the average value 3 4 daytime and night time transpiration throughout the growing season the percentages of night time transpiration through the main phenological states are shown in fig 11 the first stage analysed is from budburst to flowering and this period is characterized by random values of enight oscillating from 8 to 27 the second period starts in flowering and ends in veraison and despite being a period in which the meteorological conditions can be very variable the behaviour of the enight is very similar among the days reaching the minimum values with most days between 3 and 10 the third period from veraison to harvest is the most variable of all in this phase enight reaches the maximum values 35 and in general the transpiration in the night is higher than in other periods the study of enight throughout the growing season is completed with the results that are shown in fig 7b which is presenting the percentage of enight for each eday until flowering the evaporative demand of the atmosphere should be low therefore the values of eday are under 2 mm and as already mentioned in the previous paragraph the enight reaches different values a similar behaviour is shown with the data from veraison to harvest for those days on which the eday is low the enight can be high or low and for the days with an eday higher than 2 mm the tendency is to have an inferior enight in contrast in the period from flowering to veraison although the eday will be under 2 mm the enight is always under 15 table 3 shows the average values of e in the three main periods of phenology and per hour it highlights the non significance among the stages from 0 00 h to 3 00 h and from 20 00 to 21 00 as well as the hour of transition of sunset from 19 00 h to 20 h the highest value in the periods hours when there were significant differences occurred between budburst and floraison until 9 00 h and between floraison and veraison until 18 00 h in the night period the highest values were before floraison 4 discussion this study has been carried out over 5 years which as we have shown in table 2 have been different from each other especially in terms of recorded precipitation the absolute values of the maximum and minimum temperature varied little between years the big variation was produced in the month which those values were reached for example in the third year of study the maximum temperature was reached in july and in the last year it was in september these annual changes in meteorological conditions are common and the fact that they have been different over the 5 years gives more value to the replication of the study in determining enight this agrees with the results of numerous authors who have observed enight in different ecosystems and with different climates such as tropical savannas bucci et al 2004 temperate forests barbour et al 2005 tropical rainforests wallace and mcjannet 2010 siddiq and cao 2018 deserts ogle et al 2012 mediterranean climates escalona et al 2013 tropical montane cloud forests alvarado barrientos et al 2015 and mid continental climates o keefe and nippert 2018 to cite some examples in our study the highest values of enight have corresponded with days in which the values of soil water content fig 6 and the eday fig 7 b have been very low similar to the results that were found by forster 2014 in which they observed the higher nocturnal sap flow during the dry season over the wet season in 98 different species this was also similar to the study of brito et al 2018 in olea europaea where the water stressed plants had higher enight during the first hours of darkness and for a number of tropical tree species siddiq and cao 2018 in contrast other authors howard and donovan 2007 dawson et al 2007 ogle et al 2012 flexas et al 2010 escalona et al 2013 fuentes et al 2014 ramírez et al 2018 found the highest rates during periods of high water availability which suggests that plant water status is a critical determinant of nocturnal water loss however o keefe and nippert 2018 while affirming the same results as the previous authors also found that enight was only weakly related to soil moisture content most values of enight expressed as a percentage of eday were found to be approximately 10 fig 8 which exhibits plasticity in source water use based on changes in soil water availability nippert and knapp 2007a b global syntheses have found the percentage of enight to eday transpiration in woody plants to be 12 siddiq and cao 2018 other authors found between 7 and 11 in solanaceae crops caird et al 2007b ramírez et al 2018 35 55 in roses blom zandstra et al 1995 14 55 in wheat schoppach et al 2014 5 in eucalyptus grandis benyon 1999 6 in malus sylvestris l and 19 in actinidia deliciosa chev green et al 1989 all of these values are increased in tropical evergreen tree species to 40 89 siddiq and cao 2018 and for example those in hyeronima reach extremely high values which can be as much as 80 of the maximum daytime transpiration rate for the lowland forest rosado et al 2012 the differences in enight among species could be due to plasticity stomatal conductance hydraulic conductivity wood density since species with low density have more sapwood water storage litvak et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2015 it has been suggested that predawn stomatal conductance in the night is related to the degree of circadian control that determines plant readiness to anticipate the beginning of the day resco de dios et al 2016 with important influences on the control of enight resco de dios et al 2015 and that is what our observations show fig 5 which is that after a period of no transpiration from 2 15 to 4 00 enight starts just hours before sunrise progressive increases in stomatal conductance and therefore enight from early night hours to dawn were reported previously by escalona et al 2013 our results indicate substantial enight occurring after sunset figs 9 and 10 and it could be due to a greater vapour pressure deficit in the period after sunset than in the predawn montoro et al 2017 similar results were found by siddiq and cao 2018 but to some extent this appeared to counter the notion that plants maximize carbon gain and minimize water loss cowan 1977 in a previous study siddiq and cao 2016 found that the loss of water at night was mainly due to the ability of a tree to access a stable water source both in the wet and dry seasons the relationship between phenology and enight has not been very well studied and some authors ramírez et al 2018 have concluded that future studies must assess stomatal conductance in the night and enight throughout the growing season not restricted to the season of maximum physiological performance in order to determine the relationship with the circadian resonance in almost all of the few publications on this topic they found similar results to those we have described in this work fig 11 o keefe and nippert 2018 studying nocturnal transpiration in grasses forbs and shrubs in a tallgrass prairie found greater rates of nocturnal water loss generally occurring earlier and later during the growing seasons as in our study but they did not explain the cause an explanation for it could be due to both periods being characterized by vegetative growth and by a greater number of green stems in the final phase of the crop wang et al 2018 revealed that the night time water use and the percentage of night day sap flow of photosynthetic stem species were greater than those of non photosynthetic stem species other authors thought that enight could be affected by the intra and interspecific variation in physiological traits such as wood density which determines the water storage and transport meinzer et al 2009 chave et al 2009 and changes throughout the growing season 5 conclusion the results show values of enight between 3 in the days with the highest soil water content and 35 in days in which the value of eday and the soil water content was very low most days it was 12 we highlight that the enight in the period after sunset was greater than that in the predawn although in this last period it was higher closer to sunrise finally enight was analysed throughout the growing season and it exhibited the highest values in the period from veraison to harvest our observation of differential eday and enight supports the idea that they should be parameterized separately considering the rates of enight observed in some conditions we encourage future model parameterizations to also include enight and to delve into the factors that affect enight because they may need to be changed for future water management in ecosystems

10757,an experiment was carried out in a semi arid area of spain albacete with the objective of quantifying the transpiration of grapevine cv tempranillo measurements of transpiration were taken in a weighing lysimeter over five years 2012 2016 the soil surface was covered with a waterproof canvas to avoid the evaporative component of evapotranspiration the sample frequency was 1 s and a mean value was recorded with a datalogger cr10x campbell scientific every 15 min which allowed for measuring the transpiration every quarter of an hour and therefore identify night time enight and daytime transpiration eday the results show values of enight between 3 of total daily transpiration in the days with the highest soil water content and 35 in the days in which the value of eday and the soil water content were very low although most days it was 12 we highlight the enight in the period after sunset more than we do that in predawn although in this last period it was higher close to sunrise finally enight was analysed throughout the growing season and from veraison to harvest was the period with the highest values keywords sunset transpiration predawn transpiration irrigation tempranillo 1 introduction until recently it had been commonly assumed that plant stomata close at night preventing water loss through transpiration during non photosynthetic periods novick et al 2009 numerous studies have shown that nocturnal transpiration enight occurs in plants and has been measured in woody crops daley and phillips 2006 kavanagh et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 zeppel et al 2010 buckley et al 2011 barbeta et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 brito et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and herbaceous species ogle et al 2012 o keefe and nippert 2018 ramirez et al 2018 however despite having been measured by many authors enight displays conflicting patterns and knowledge about the factors that affect those traits is still not available possible negative implications have been studied for the phenomenon such as absolute water loss and therefore affecting for example water use efficiency escalona et al 2013 nevertheless it has also been postulated to have several benefits some of them related to nutrition snyder et al 2003 scholz et al 2007 snyder et al 2008 burkhardt and hunsche 2013 and others related to supplying o2 daley and phillips 2006 or even the prevention of co2 build up in leaves marks and lechowicz 2007 what seems to be clear and agreed upon among all the authors who have measured it is that enight constitutes a significant yet poorly understood component of the global water cycle zeppel et al 2014 resco de dios et al 2015 2018 indeed enight accounts for 10 30 of the total daily transpiration e flux novick et al 2009 montoro et al 2016 or between 5 and 15 of daytime transpiration rates eday caird et al 2007a although higher rates have been reported in some extremes cases snyder et al 2003 forster 2014 most land surface models assume the non existence of enight kowalczyk et al 2006 but including nocturnal transpiration in land surface models leads to reductions of up to 50 of the projected available soil moisture in semiarid environments lombardozzi et al 2017 therefore estimates of enight should be including in such global models zeppel et al 2014 especially when negative effects can be exacerbated by the projections of climate change climate change is anticipated to cause a general reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature with the last one observed more markedly at nighttime in the mediterranean basin ipcc 2013 where a large proportion of the world s vineyard area is located another methodology that could be affected in certain conditions if enight is considered is the predawn water potential which has been taken as a water status descriptor assuming that during the night the plant and soil are in equilibrium due to transpiration preclusion caused by stomatal closure tourneux et al 2003 rolando et al 2015 transpiration in grapevine has been commonly measured at the leaf level by using portable equipment to detect leaf gas exchange rates which facilitates the measurement snyder et al 2003 ogle et al 2012 escalona et al 2013 however when those measurements are compared to the daily integrals or whole plant estimations there is not always a good correlation as show in the study by medrano et al 2017 with different genotypes tempranillo grenache malvasia of banyalbufar and cabernet sauvignon during three consecutive years or in the study of brito et al 2018 in olea europaea which affirmed that gas exchange measurements may underestimate the water losses other authors have obtained measures of enight through the technique of sap flow rosado et al 2012 fuentes et al 2013 2014 yu et al 2018 siddiq and cao 2018 with eddy covariance novick et al 2009 and even with a bowen ratio energy balance system radiation and energy balance systems rebs inc bellevue wa irmak 2011 but none of these

absolute values or the transpiration in mm the minimum values were 0 09 mm and 0 87 mm for enight and eday respectively when the values of eday were between 1 and 3 5 mm the enight reached high and low values indistinctly in contrast exceeding the value of 3 5 mm eday the enight was increasing fig 7b shows the same values but in relative units of percentage of enight which shows clearly that the highest values of enight corresponded with days in which the value of the eday had been very low and in contrast the days with an eday higher than 4 mm had an enight between 5 and 10 the study of enight throughout the growing season represented in fig 7b will explain in section 3 4 fig 8 shows the relationship between enight and eday in values of percentage in the same graphic the frequency at which the event occurs is represented through the size of the spheres the minimum value of enight was 3 and the maximum 35 the graphic highlights the number of times that enight reaches values close to 10 as well as the average of values reached 12 of enight which correspond with the 88 of eday the analysis of transpiration through the day for the three main periods of the growing season is shown in fig 9 which presents the values throughout the day for the three main periods of the growing season in intervals of one hour for the five years of study the highest e values are reached from flowering to veraison 0 10 0 029 mm per hour the first period stands out due to a greater dispersion of values and the last one due to the symmetrical rise and fall of the curve being practically a gaussian bell shape 3 3 pre dawn transpiration versus transpiration after sunset enight was analysed in the two periods of night time close to the transitions from the daytime fig 9 shows in black columns the nocturnal transpiration highlighting the highest values in the period after sunset fig 10 represents the percentage of enight for every period of night the values present a tendency towards asenight more than pdenight the largest number of data points are found with pdenight values between 1 and 5 which correspond with asenight values between 2 and 14 three points stand out in the same figure due to being very different from the rest and they correspond to three consecutive days in september of 2012 when the et0 was highest among the previous days and abnormal for the time of year the asenight in the first day 23rd september was high and it continued after 0 00 h therefore on the next day 24th september the pdenight was also more elevated than on a normal day and finally on the third day 25th september it approximates the average value 3 4 daytime and night time transpiration throughout the growing season the percentages of night time transpiration through the main phenological states are shown in fig 11 the first stage analysed is from budburst to flowering and this period is characterized by random values of enight oscillating from 8 to 27 the second period starts in flowering and ends in veraison and despite being a period in which the meteorological conditions can be very variable the behaviour of the enight is very similar among the days reaching the minimum values with most days between 3 and 10 the third period from veraison to harvest is the most variable of all in this phase enight reaches the maximum values 35 and in general the transpiration in the night is higher than in other periods the study of enight throughout the growing season is completed with the results that are shown in fig 7b which is presenting the percentage of enight for each eday until flowering the evaporative demand of the atmosphere should be low therefore the values of eday are under 2 mm and as already mentioned in the previous paragraph the enight reaches different values a similar behaviour is shown with the data from veraison to harvest for those days on which the eday is low the enight can be high or low and for the days with an eday higher than 2 mm the tendency is to have an inferior enight in contrast in the period from flowering to veraison although the eday will be under 2 mm the enight is always under 15 table 3 shows the average values of e in the three main periods of phenology and per hour it highlights the non significance among the stages from 0 00 h to 3 00 h and from 20 00 to 21 00 as well as the hour of transition of sunset from 19 00 h to 20 h the highest value in the periods hours when there were significant differences occurred between budburst and floraison until 9 00 h and between floraison and veraison until 18 00 h in the night period the highest values were before floraison 4 discussion this study has been carried out over 5 years which as we have shown in table 2 have been different from each other especially in terms of recorded precipitation the absolute values of the maximum and minimum temperature varied little between years the big variation was produced in the month which those values were reached for example in the third year of study the maximum temperature was reached in july and in the last year it was in september these annual changes in meteorological conditions are common and the fact that they have been different over the 5 years gives more value to the replication of the study in determining enight this agrees with the results of numerous authors who have observed enight in different ecosystems and with different climates such as tropical savannas bucci et al 2004 temperate forests barbour et al 2005 tropical rainforests wallace and mcjannet 2010 siddiq and cao 2018 deserts ogle et al 2012 mediterranean climates escalona et al 2013 tropical montane cloud forests alvarado barrientos et al 2015 and mid continental climates o keefe and nippert 2018 to cite some examples in our study the highest values of enight have corresponded with days in which the values of soil water content fig 6 and the eday fig 7 b have been very low similar to the results that were found by forster 2014 in which they observed the higher nocturnal sap flow during the dry season over the wet season in 98 different species this was also similar to the study of brito et al 2018 in olea europaea where the water stressed plants had higher enight during the first hours of darkness and for a number of tropical tree species siddiq and cao 2018 in contrast other authors howard and donovan 2007 dawson et al 2007 ogle et al 2012 flexas et al 2010 escalona et al 2013 fuentes et al 2014 ramírez et al 2018 found the highest rates during periods of high water availability which suggests that plant water status is a critical determinant of nocturnal water loss however o keefe and nippert 2018 while affirming the same results as the previous authors also found that enight was only weakly related to soil moisture content most values of enight expressed as a percentage of eday were found to be approximately 10 fig 8 which exhibits plasticity in source water use based on changes in soil water availability nippert and knapp 2007a b global syntheses have found the percentage of enight to eday transpiration in woody plants to be 12 siddiq and cao 2018 other authors found between 7 and 11 in solanaceae crops caird et al 2007b ramírez et al 2018 35 55 in roses blom zandstra et al 1995 14 55 in wheat schoppach et al 2014 5 in eucalyptus grandis benyon 1999 6 in malus sylvestris l and 19 in actinidia deliciosa chev green et al 1989 all of these values are increased in tropical evergreen tree species to 40 89 siddiq and cao 2018 and for example those in hyeronima reach extremely high values which can be as much as 80 of the maximum daytime transpiration rate for the lowland forest rosado et al 2012 the differences in enight among species could be due to plasticity stomatal conductance hydraulic conductivity wood density since species with low density have more sapwood water storage litvak et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2015 it has been suggested that predawn stomatal conductance in the night is related to the degree of circadian control that determines plant readiness to anticipate the beginning of the day resco de dios et al 2016 with important influences on the control of enight resco de dios et al 2015 and that is what our observations show fig 5 which is that after a period of no transpiration from 2 15 to 4 00 enight starts just hours before sunrise progressive increases in stomatal conductance and therefore enight from early night hours to dawn were reported previously by escalona et al 2013 our results indicate substantial enight occurring after sunset figs 9 and 10 and it could be due to a greater vapour pressure deficit in the period after sunset than in the predawn montoro et al 2017 similar results were found by siddiq and cao 2018 but to some extent this appeared to counter the notion that plants maximize carbon gain and minimize water loss cowan 1977 in a previous study siddiq and cao 2016 found that the loss of water at night was mainly due to the ability of a tree to access a stable water source both in the wet and dry seasons the relationship between phenology and enight has not been very well studied and some authors ramírez et al 2018 have concluded that future studies must assess stomatal conductance in the night and enight throughout the growing season not restricted to the season of maximum physiological performance in order to determine the relationship with the circadian resonance in almost all of the few publications on this topic they found similar results to those we have described in this work fig 11 o keefe and nippert 2018 studying nocturnal transpiration in grasses forbs and shrubs in a tallgrass prairie found greater rates of nocturnal water loss generally occurring earlier and later during the growing seasons as in our study but they did not explain the cause an explanation for it could be due to both periods being characterized by vegetative growth and by a greater number of green stems in the final phase of the crop wang et al 2018 revealed that the night time water use and the percentage of night day sap flow of photosynthetic stem species were greater than those of non photosynthetic stem species other authors thought that enight could be affected by the intra and interspecific variation in physiological traits such as wood density which determines the water storage and transport meinzer et al 2009 chave et al 2009 and changes throughout the growing season 5 conclusion the results show values of enight between 3 in the days with the highest soil water content and 35 in days in which the value of eday and the soil water content was very low most days it was 12 we highlight that the enight in the period after sunset was greater than that in the predawn although in this last period it was higher closer to sunrise finally enight was analysed throughout the growing season and it exhibited the highest values in the period from veraison to harvest our observation of differential eday and enight supports the idea that they should be parameterized separately considering the rates of enight observed in some conditions we encourage future model parameterizations to also include enight and to delve into the factors that affect enight because they may need to be changed for future water management in ecosystems

10758,the use of saline water is one likely option for sustainable cultivation of ornamental plants particularly in water scarce regions to assess the feasibility of sustainable cultivation under saline irrigation water nacl at 4000 ppm in such regions a field experiment was conducted at the nursery of the ornamental horticulture department faculty of agriculture cairo university egypt during the seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in which five different management treatments humic acid proline gypsum leaching and magnetite were studied to evaluate their effectiveness on alleviating adverse salinity effects on terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn seedling growth photosynthetic pigment concentration and leaf chemical constituents generally compared to seedlings irrigated with saline water most of the treatments caused significant increases in plant height number of leaves and main roots plant stem diameter leaf area fresh and dry weights of leaves and main stem and branches as well as the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b total carotenoids n p k ca and proline moreover the parameters for treated plants receiving the different management treatments were close to those of plants irrigated with tap water na and cl concentrations were significantly decreased by most of the treatments in comparison to saline water the most beneficial treatment among all in reducing negative salinity impacts was humic acid followed by proline gypsum leaching and magnetite the results of our study indicate positive effects of all treatments which can be useful in counteracting the negative consequences of the irrigating with saline water such treatments moreover may prove to be promising approaches in confronting the challenge of achieving sustainable cultivation under saline irrigation water in arid and semi arid regions keywords humic acid proline gypsum leaching magnetic iron element constituent 1 introduction dry climate limited rainfall and improper water management in arid and semi arid regions have resulted in large saline areas wang et al 2012 salinization is a major agricultural problem that will increase over time as the intensity of land use increases wang

gabriel et al 2012 bacilio et al 2016 as it drastically affects plant growth productivity and or quality the steady decrease of fresh water on the other hand is also becoming a major issue in many irrigated areas of the world particularly countries in the middle east parts of north and south america and europe and substantial parts of north africa choudhary et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 this considerable risk is forcing farmers to use alternative water resources such as brackish and saline water for crop irrigation choudhary et al 2011 kiremit and arslan 2016 surendran et al 2016 despite the detrimental effects associated with the use of such poor quality water the fact remains that they are a valuable resource choudhary et al 2011 the main question is how to stabilize agricultural production in saline environments year to year keeping it sustainable on the long term without causing additional threats and at the same time in a cost effective manner strategies for sustainable agriculture under saline irrigation water should mainly aim at improving soil physical and chemical properties controlling salinity buildup and at the same time minimizing the rise of water tables choudhary et al 2011 singh 2014 various practical approaches have been suggested including the selection of suitable irrigation strategies appropriate field drainage and salt tolerant crops choudhary et al 2011 kiremit and arslan 2016 among the proposed approaches management treatments as described in this study are quite innovative such treatments not only help in reducing the negative effects of salinity but may also contribute to maintaining sustainable cultivation under adverse conditions moreover they could help in increasing the yield per unit of land offsetting any increasing in the cultivated area thus protecting the environment additional negative impacts humic acid ha one of the proposed management treatments is a principal component of humic substances which comprise more than 60 of the soil organic matter sani 2014 canellas et al 2015 it can modify the soil characteristics rose et al 2014 improve plant metabolic processes rose et al 2014 canellas et al 2015 bacilio et

saline irrigation water on soil properties choudhary et al 2011 wang et al 2012 another important key to salinity control irrigation sustainability and cost reduction is leaching wang et al 2012 leaching lea the net downward movement of soil water and its excessive salts is likely the fastest opportunity for maintaining root zone salinity by the application of extra irrigation water choudhary et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 leaching requirement is the minimal fraction of total water applied that must pass through the root zone to prevent the reduction in crop yield below the acceptable level choudhary et al 2011 it depends on crop growth irrigation methods and soil physical properties wang et al 2012 in addition to the previous management treatments magnetite mag magnetic iron fe3o4 has attracted much attention due to its fine magnetic properties and application in modern science it is considered a low cost environmentally friendly soil amendment surendran et al 2016 magnetite is one of two naturally magnetic rocks that have high iron contents it plays an important role on plant nutrient uptake khalil and abou leila 2016 iron is known to play an essential role in plant

past studies have indicated the possibly beneficial effects of management treatments on plant growth and other related parameters little information is available so far on their effects on the arjuna

significant or significant for all studied growth traits except for number of leaves and main roots plant and leaves fresh weight non significantly different among all treatments mean of squares highly significant differences were shown for all growth traits the interaction of treatments and seasons on the other hand showed non significant different mean of squares for all studied traits data presented in table 4 generally show that all growth parameters of terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn were significantly increased by all the management treatments as compared to saline water negative control over the combined seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 3 1 1 plant height cm plant height data reveal significant increases for all the management treatments tested in comparison to the negative control among treatments ha recorded the highest increment percentage of plant height 49 while the lowest increment percentage was recorded by mag 30 treating t arjuna with pro lea and gyp also gave taller plants than the negative control with height increment percentages ranging from 36 to 44 the heights of treated plants were closer to those of plants irrigated with tw than if irrigated with sw plants treated with ha pro and lea were only 2 6 and 8 shorter than those irrigated with tw gyp and mag treatments on the other hand were the least effective treatments for alleviating the effect of salinity giving plants that were 11 and 15 shorter compared to the positive control 3 1 2 number of leaves and main roots plant ha pro gyp lea and mag increased the number of leaves and main roots plant over both seasons as compared to sw t arjuna irrigated with tw had the highest number of leaves 1069 33 and main roots 20 17 3 1 3 stem diameter mm t arjuna irrigated with sw had the least stem diameter over both seasons 34 59 mm in contrast treating plants with ha pro gyp lea and mag markedly reduced the negative effects of saline irrigation water giving plants with significantly thicker stems with mean diameters of 44 52 49 42 mm the thickest stems among all treatments were those of plants irrigated with tw 51 12 mm 3 1 4 leaf area cm2 in comparison to the negative and positive controls analysis of the leaf area data over both seasons show that ha caused the highest increase in leaf area compared to the sw treatment followed by pro gyp lea and mag table 4 these treatments enhanced leaf enlargement resulting in leaves with areas close to those of plants irrigated with tw plants receiving the different management treatments had leaf areas ranging from 44 24 to 54 96 cm2 compared to 40 93 cm2 for sw and 57 98 cm2 for tw 3 1 5 leaves fresh and dry weights g plant management treatments significantly improved both the fresh weight fw and dry weight dw of leaves plant compared to sw in the following descending order ha followed by pro gyp lea and mag plants receiving these treatments gave values that were lower than those of the positive control tw which was the most effective treatment but were significantly higher than those of the negative control sw the least effective treatment 3 1 6 main stem and branches fresh and dry weights g plant main stem and branches fw and dws also followed the same order and trend in response to the different treatments the increment percentage range of main stem and branches fw as a result of applying the studied management treatments in comparison to sw was 88 108 while the increment percentages range of main stem and branches dw in comparison to sw was 91 109 it is also worth noting that the main stem and branches fw and dw recorded on plants receiving these treatments were only 3 12 and 2 11 lower respectively compared with plants irrigated with tw plant growth is adversely affected by saline irrigation water primarily through the impacts of excessive salts that lower the osmotic potential of the soil solution which cause water deficiency for plants and in turn growth inhibition choudhary et al 2011 boari et al 2016 garcía caparrós et al 2016 mansour and ali 2017 under the current field study conditions the detrimental effects of water salinity resulted in smaller plants in order to achieve better plant growth the adverse effect of salinity can be partly counteracted by using ha pro gyp lea and mag such treatments cause direct impact on the soil characteristics and in turn enhance t arjuna plant growth as follows 1 ha as an organic material has been reported to reduce soil bulk density and increase its porosity within the root zone yupeng et al 2018 in addition to

alleviates the deleterious effects of salinity by creating an electromagnetic field that helps in increasing soil electrical conductivity and water holding capacity reducing soil ph and increasing the ability of plant to absorb water khalil and abou leila 2016 surendran et al 2016 thus enabling growth to take place under saline conditions as expected t arjuna irrigated with tw showed the best growth as they were not subjected to salinity stress these results agree with those reported in the literature in which adverse effects of salinity on several growth parameters were mitigated by the application of these different management treatments e g hatami et al 2018 alleviated saline irrigation water by using humic acid that helped in increasing the soluble proteins and enzymes synthesis in almond rootstocks and increased its tolerance to salinity kahlaoui et al 2018 concluded that foliar spray of proline can increase the tolerance of tomato cultivars to saline water under field conditions kiremit and arslan 2016 suggested that slightly saline water can be used for irrigating allium porrum l if appropriate leaching and drainage systems are applied with minimal decreases in growth and yield ahmed et al 2016 enhanced the tolerance of acalypha wilkesiana transplants growth traits to soil salinity by the application of magnetite 3 2 photosynthetic pigment concentration data of the combined analysis of variance presented in table 5 show that mean of squares of photosynthetic pigments due to both the seasons and treatments were highly significant whereas their interaction showed non significant differences table 6 show that the chlorophyll a and b concentrations of terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn leaves were increased whereas the total carotenoids concentration was decreased by the addition of different management treatments compared to that of sw negative control leaves over the combined seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 3 2 1 chlorophylls a and b mg g the chlorophyll chl a and b concentrations of plants treated with ha pro gyp lea or mag were considerably higher a range of 0 878 1 140 mg g for chl a and a range of 0 185 0 317 mg g for chl b than those found in plants irrigated with sw with chl a and b concentrations of 0 750 and 0 146 mg g respectively with ha pro and gyp treatments the recorded values were close to those recorded in plants irrigated with tw with chl a and b concentrations of 1 182 and 0 366 mg g respectively 3 2 2 total carotenoids mg g the total carotenoids car concentration followed an opposite trend compared to that recorded for the chl a and b concentrations plants irrigated with sw had the highest total car concentrations whereas the lowest concentrations were recorded in plants irrigated with tw among the different management treatments the highest total car concentration was obtained in t arjuna leaves treated with mag followed by lea gyp pro and ha respectively chlorophyll is the main photosynthetic pigment that can be a significant indicator of plant stress li et al 2016 boari et al 2016 and kiremit and arslan 2016 reported that the reduction in chlorophyll concentration is associated with the reduction of water uptake by plants in this study this was clearly observed in plants irrigated with sw negative control however the lack of significant differences in many cases between the photosynthetic pigment concentration of plants irrigated with saline water in the presence of the management treatments and that of plants irrigated with tw positive control may be due to the effects of the treatments in enhancing t arjuna tolerance to salinity ha the most effective management treatment in increasing both chlorophyll a and b concentrations in leaves was reported to increase the absorption of iron hatami et al 2018 which is essential for the maintenance of chloroplast structure and function and is involved in chlorophyll synthesis rout and sahoo 2015 this effect could also be clearly noticed in t arjuna plants treated with mag magnetic iron the effects of the different management treatments on plants photosynthetic pigment concentration under salinity conditions are in agreement with the previous findings of bacilio et al 2016 who treated capsicum annuum l with humic acid kiremit and arslan 2016 who studied the effect of leaching on allium porrum l and ahmed et al 2016 who applied magnetic iron to acalypha wilkesiana 3 3 leaf chemical constituents data of the combined analysis of variance presented in table 5 show that mean of squares of leaf chemical constituents due to both the seasons and treatments were highly significant or significant whereas their interaction showed non significant differences data presented in table 6 show that both the total leaf elements and proline concentrations of terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn were favorably influenced by most of the different management treatments in comparison to sw over the combined seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 3 3 1 total element concentrations n p k ca na and cl ha proved to be the most effective management treatment giving the highest concentrations of n and p in the leaves followed by pro gyp lea and mag respectively in contrast the sw negative control treatment reduced the n and p concentrations in leaves giving the lowest values n at 1 34 and p at 0 10 on the other hand the tw positive control treatment gave the highest values among all treatments n at 2 46 and p at 0 34 treating plants with gyp pro and ha significantly increased the k and ca concentrations in leaves giving k concentrations ranging from 3 13 to 4 22 and ca concentrations ranging from 3 12 to 3 52 compared to plants irrigated with tw which gave k concentration of 2 73 and ca concentration of 2 88 or sw with k concentration of 2 67 and ca concentration of 2 85 the lea and mag treatments on the other hand gave the lowest k concentrations however the lea treatment increased the ca concentration giving a value of 2 95 whereas the mag treatment decreased it giving a value of 1 24 as compared to the controls the use of lea ha pro mag and gyp treatments on the other hand decreased the na concentrations in leaves by 3 19 32 42 and 48 for the five treatments respectively compared to plants irrigated with sw which had the highest na concentrations similarly these five treatments decreased the cl concentrations by 3 26 36 47 and 52 respectively compared to plants irrigated with sw which had the highest cl concentrations in contrast leaves of plants irrigated with tw had the lowest na and cl concentrations among all treatments over both seasons 3 3 2 proline concentrations mg g regarding the proline concentrations in t arjuna leaves significant differences were observed between most of the studied management treatments and the negative and positive controls table 6 spraying of proline on shoots increased its concentration in leaves and gave the highest pro concentration among all treatments 0 75 mg g plants treated with lea mag gyp and ha contained lower pro concentrations with values ranging from 0 14 to 0 35 mg g when compared to plants irrigated with sw that contained the second highest pro values plants irrigated with tw had the lowest pro concentrations the disruption in both total element and proline concentrations of t arjuna leaves caused by sw may be a result of the excessive concentration and absorption of na cl those may cause toxicity specific ion injury and or retard the absorption of other essential plant nutrients choudhary et al 2011 sastre conde et al 2015 stamford et al 2015 bacilio et al 2016 boari et al 2016 garcía caparrós et al 2016 mansour and ali 2017 the management treatments beneficially mitigated the salt induced injury on t arjuna leaf chemical constituents thorough 1 ha as an organic matter stimulated the absorption of mineral elements sani 2014 canellas et al 2015 hatami et al 2018 through enhancing the soil structure in addition to inducing atp activity that energizes ion transporters canellas et al 2015 thus reflecting on the elements concentration 2 the favorable effect of pro is related to reducing na and cl and increasing proline biosynthesis garcía caparrós et al 2016 which serves as an excellent means of storing energy and or a valuable resource either in the stress acclimation or relief zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 exogenously supplied proline provides osmoprotection by improving water balance thus protecting plant tissues from plasmolysis mansour and ali

furthermore the calcium is used to remove the exchangeable sodium in the saline soil choudhary et al 2011 wang et al 2012 theint et al 2015 also it improves the potassium and decreases the sodium concentrations in plants theint et al 2015 which helps in alleviating the salinity effects 4 doubling the amount of saline water through the lea treatment possibly helped in diluting the na and cl concentrations in the soil by washing choudhary et al 2011 letey et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 sastre conde et al 2015 which in turn reflected on t arjuna element concentrations 5 the addition of a natural mineral product such as mag magnetic iron is reported to improve soil water holding and cation exchange capacities as well as its magnetic effect that reduces the absorption of na and cl and improves the transportation of nutrients khalil and abou leila 2016 surendran et al 2016 which in turn affects the element concentrations plants irrigated with tw on the other hand showed no imbalance neither in total leaf elements nor proline concentrations as they were not subjected to any sort of stress the ameliorative effects of the management treatments on leaf chemical constituents under salinity conditions are in agreement with the observations of bacilio et al 2016 who detected an increase in ca concentration in capsicum annuum l treated with humic acid kahlaoui et al 2018 who reported an increase in the proline concentration in tomato plants that had been sprayed with proline wang et al 2017 who found that treating cucumber plants with gypsum decreases na toxicities and increased plant ca concentration and ahmed et al 2016 who reported an increase in n p k cl and proline concentrations in acalypha wilkesiana and a decrease in its na concentration as a result of magnetite application 4 conclusions recommendations and future research directions this eighteen months field study presents strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and mitigate plant growth risks resulting from the use of saline irrigation water by giving examples of environmentally friendly practices that can be used for reducing negative salinity impacts more specifically the findings reveal that using the management treatments humic acid proline gypsum leaching and magnetite improved terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn plant growth photosynthetic pigment concentration and leaf chemical constituents in comparison to the negative control seedlings irrigated with saline water only in addition all management treatments not only alleviated the negative effects of saline irrigation water on the plant attributes but also their effects were remarkably close to that of tap water which in turn may help in ensuring sustainability under saline conditions by applying commercial and cost effective treatments the results of this study moreover lead to the following recommendations 1 utilization of low quality water for agricultural production if combined with management treatment as such approach provides economic benefits essential for sustainable agriculture in dry lands which in turn permits the conservation of fresh water for high value purposes 2 selection of a salt tolerant tree species to withstand the salinity negative impacts which may also help in reclaiming saline lands and 3 this study may also be a part of more comprehensive sustainability protocols under soil and groundwater protection systems using constructed wetlands planted with halophytes to prevent excessive salinization if applied to large areas in arid and semi arid regions although t arjuna growth response to saline irrigation water was improved under the study conditions further research is needed to shed more light on the safe use of saline water in manners that support sustainability taking into consideration 1 the effectiveness of magnetic field usage either by magnetite or saline water magnetization which is still a controversial subject and has not been completely confirmed scientifically 2 the feasibility of combining two or more salinity management treatments 3 the impact of the treatments on a larger scale such as farms regions irrigation systems and river basins 4 the feasibility of integrating saline aquaculture in such areas and 5 sub surface drainage installation and costs finally it would be important to develop recommendations and to determine the constraints and standards that influence the selection and adoption of a certain technology or practice for agriculture sustainability which mainly vary according to the region its economic development and environmental resources and conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgment the authors extend their gratitude to prof dr hazem a mansour ornamental horticulture department faculty of agriculture cairo university for his valuable comments and helpful suggestions 
10758,the use of saline water is one likely option for sustainable cultivation of ornamental plants particularly in water scarce regions to assess the feasibility of sustainable cultivation under saline irrigation water nacl at 4000 ppm in such regions a field experiment was conducted at the nursery of the ornamental horticulture department faculty of agriculture cairo university egypt during the seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in which five different management treatments humic acid proline gypsum leaching and magnetite were studied to evaluate their effectiveness on alleviating adverse salinity effects on terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn seedling growth photosynthetic pigment concentration and leaf chemical constituents generally compared to seedlings irrigated with saline water most of the treatments caused significant increases in plant height number of leaves and main roots plant stem diameter leaf area fresh and dry weights of leaves and main stem and branches as well as the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b total carotenoids n p k ca and proline moreover the parameters for treated plants receiving the different management treatments were close to those of plants irrigated with tap water na and cl concentrations were significantly decreased by most of the treatments in comparison to saline water the most beneficial treatment among all in reducing negative salinity impacts was humic acid followed by proline gypsum leaching and magnetite the results of our study indicate positive effects of all treatments which can be useful in counteracting the negative consequences of the irrigating with saline water such treatments moreover may prove to be promising approaches in confronting the challenge of achieving sustainable cultivation under saline irrigation water in arid and semi arid regions keywords humic acid proline gypsum leaching magnetic iron element constituent 1 introduction dry climate limited rainfall and improper water management in arid and semi arid regions have resulted in large saline areas wang et al 2012 salinization is a major agricultural problem that will increase over time as the intensity of land use increases wang et al 2012 bacilio et al 2016 worldwide over 930 million hectares are salinated bacilio et al 2016 salinity of the irrigation water or soil is a principal cause of land degradation and yield reduction gabriel et al 2012 bacilio et al 2016 as it drastically affects plant growth productivity and or quality the steady decrease of fresh water on the other hand is also becoming a major issue in many irrigated areas of the world particularly countries in the middle east parts of north and south america and europe and substantial parts of north africa choudhary et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 this considerable risk is forcing farmers to use alternative water resources such as brackish and saline water for crop irrigation choudhary et al 2011 kiremit and arslan 2016 surendran et al 2016 despite the detrimental effects associated with the use of such poor quality water the fact remains that they are a valuable resource choudhary et al 2011 the main question is how to stabilize agricultural production in saline environments year to year keeping it sustainable on the long term without causing additional threats and at the same time in a cost effective manner strategies for sustainable agriculture under saline irrigation water should mainly aim at improving soil physical and chemical properties controlling salinity buildup and at the same time minimizing the rise of water tables choudhary et al 2011 singh 2014 various practical approaches have been suggested including the selection of suitable irrigation strategies appropriate field drainage and salt tolerant crops choudhary et al 2011 kiremit and arslan 2016 among the proposed approaches management treatments as described in this study are quite innovative such treatments not only help in reducing the negative effects of salinity but may also contribute to maintaining sustainable cultivation under adverse conditions moreover they could help in increasing the yield per unit of land offsetting any increasing in the cultivated area thus protecting the environment additional negative impacts humic acid ha one of the proposed management treatments is a principal component of humic substances which comprise more than 60 of the soil organic matter sani 2014 canellas et al 2015 it can modify the soil characteristics rose et al 2014 improve plant metabolic processes rose et al 2014 canellas et al 2015 bacilio et al 2016 and reduce negative effects of salinity on plant growth bacilio et al 2016 hatami et al 2018 nowadays ha is increasingly becoming available as a commercial supplement for plant improvement rose et al 2014 it can be extracted from any material containing well decomposed organic matter sani 2014 canellas et al 2015 it is the major component of organic fertilizers and is known to contain significant amounts of nutrients canellas et al 2015 proline pro on the other hand is the most common amino acid produced in a wide range of plant species as a metabolic response to salinity stress mansour and ali 2017 kahlaoui et al 2018 it plays an important role in osmotic adjustment osmoprotection mansour and ali 2017 kahlaoui et al 2018 and ion homeostasis thereby enhancing plant tolerance to salinity mansour and ali 2017 gypsum gyp caso4 2h2o the most common soil chemical amendment is also widely used worldwide due to its low cost stamford et al 2015 it mitigates the adverse effects of saline irrigation water on soil properties choudhary et al 2011 wang et al 2012 another important key to salinity control irrigation sustainability and cost reduction is leaching wang et al 2012 leaching lea the net downward movement of soil water and its excessive salts is likely the fastest opportunity for maintaining root zone salinity by the application of extra irrigation water choudhary et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 leaching requirement is the minimal fraction of total water applied that must pass through the root zone to prevent the reduction in crop yield below the acceptable level choudhary et al 2011 it depends on crop growth irrigation methods and soil physical properties wang et al 2012 in addition to the previous management treatments magnetite mag magnetic iron fe3o4 has attracted much attention due to its fine magnetic properties and application in modern science it is considered a low cost environmentally friendly soil amendment surendran et al 2016 magnetite is one of two naturally magnetic rocks that have high iron contents it plays an important role on plant nutrient uptake khalil and abou leila 2016 iron is known to play an essential role in plant physiological processes especially photosynthesis li et al 2016 under saline conditions the creation of an electromagnetic field helps in reducing the negative effects of salinity on plant growth khalil and abou leila 2016 surendran et al 2016 cultivation of a salt tolerant tree species may also be an appropriate alternative option for reclaiming saline affected lands capacity by enhancing many of their productive and ecological functions gupta and dagar 2016 and thereby ensuring agricultural sustainability terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn is an evergreen tree belongs to combretaceae family singh et al 2016 and is commonly known as arjuna amalraj and gopi 2017 it has several medicinal applications e g the treatment of coughs fractures ulcers hypertension and heart diseases it is also used against acne inflammation allergy bacteria asthma fungi and oxidation and as a food supplement singh et al 2016 amalraj and gopi 2017 moreover it is widely cultivated in gardens and roadsides for ornamental purposes shade and salinity tolerance and is also used for erosion and pollution control considering the challenges of fresh water shortage and the availability of saline water as an alternative irrigation water resource in addition to the promising results reported in improving growth and yield of different crops using various management treatments under saline conditions stamford et al 2015 bacilio et al 2016 kiremit and arslan 2016 hatami et al 2018 kahlaoui et al 2018 as well as the great economic importance of t arjuna this study was carried out although past studies have indicated the possibly beneficial effects of management treatments on plant growth and other related parameters little information is available so far on their effects on the arjuna tree furthermore there is a lack of research carried out investigating their effects on plant growth under open field conditions this study was therefore conducted with the aim of investigating 1 the effectiveness of humic acid proline gypsum leaching and magnetite on improving terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn seedling growth photosynthetic pigment concentration and leaf chemical constituents in comparison to tap water and saline nacl irrigation water under field conditions 2 which of these treatments might be optimal for the cultivation of t arjuna seedlings under saline irrigation water and accordingly could be considered for achieving sustainability under such conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site preparation plant cultivation and soil characteristics the present field study was

humidity in both seasons were 33 and 20 c and 55 respectively in the summer and 23 and 13 c and 60 respectively in the winter at the beginning of each season the soil physical and chemical characteristics were determined by collecting three soil samples from different locations in the experimental area mixing them then analyzing them as one sample the soil physical and chemical characteristics were average over the two seasons and the average values are shown in table 1 2 2 management treatments and irrigation scheduling the management treatments studied were humic acid ha

university east lansing mc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth traits data of the combined analysis of variance presented in table 3 show that mean of squares due to seasons were highly significant or significant for all studied growth traits except for number of leaves and main roots plant and leaves fresh weight non significantly different among all treatments mean of squares highly significant differences were shown for all growth traits the interaction of treatments and seasons on the other hand showed non significant different mean of squares for all studied traits data presented in table 4 generally show that all growth parameters of terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn were significantly increased by all the management treatments as compared to saline water negative control over the combined seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 3 1 1 plant height cm plant height data reveal significant increases for all the management treatments tested in comparison to the negative control among treatments ha recorded the highest increment percentage of plant height 49 while the lowest increment percentage was recorded by mag 30 treating t arjuna with pro lea and gyp also gave taller plants than the negative control with height increment percentages ranging from 36 to 44 the heights of treated plants were closer to those of plants irrigated with tw than if irrigated with sw plants treated with ha pro and lea were only 2 6 and 8 shorter than those irrigated with tw gyp and mag treatments on the other hand were the least effective treatments for alleviating the effect of salinity giving plants that were 11 and 15 shorter compared to the positive control 3 1 2 number of leaves and main roots plant ha pro gyp lea and mag increased the number of leaves and main roots plant over both seasons as compared to sw t arjuna irrigated with tw had the highest number of leaves 1069 33 and main roots 20 17 3 1 3 stem diameter mm t arjuna irrigated with sw had the least stem diameter over both seasons 34 59 mm in contrast treating plants with ha pro gyp lea and mag markedly reduced the negative effects of saline irrigation water giving plants with significantly thicker stems with mean diameters of 44 52 49 42 mm the thickest stems among all treatments were those of plants irrigated with tw 51 12 mm 3 1 4 leaf area cm2 in comparison to the negative and positive controls analysis of the leaf area data over both seasons show that ha caused the highest increase in leaf area compared to the sw treatment followed by pro gyp lea and mag table 4 these treatments enhanced leaf enlargement resulting in leaves with areas close to those of plants irrigated with tw plants receiving the different management treatments had leaf areas ranging from 44 24 to 54 96 cm2 compared to 40 93 cm2 for sw and 57 98 cm2 for tw 3 1 5 leaves fresh and dry weights g plant management treatments significantly improved both the fresh weight fw and dry weight dw of leaves plant compared to sw in the following descending order ha followed by pro gyp lea and mag plants receiving these treatments gave values that were lower than those of the positive control tw which was the most effective treatment but were significantly higher than those of the negative control sw the least effective treatment 3 1 6 main stem and branches fresh and dry weights g plant main stem and branches fw and dws also followed the same order and trend in response to the different treatments the increment percentage range of main stem and branches fw as a result of applying the studied management treatments in comparison to sw was 88 108 while the increment percentages range of main stem and branches dw in comparison to sw was 91 109 it is also worth noting that the main stem and branches fw and dw recorded on plants receiving these treatments were only 3 12 and 2 11 lower respectively compared with plants irrigated with tw plant growth is adversely affected by saline irrigation water primarily through the impacts of excessive salts that lower the osmotic potential of the soil solution which cause water deficiency for plants and in turn growth inhibition choudhary et al 2011 boari et al 2016 garcía caparrós et al 2016 mansour and ali 2017 under the current field study conditions the detrimental effects of water salinity resulted in smaller plants in order to achieve better plant growth the adverse effect of salinity can be partly counteracted by using ha pro gyp lea and mag such treatments cause direct impact on the soil characteristics and in turn enhance t arjuna plant growth as follows 1 ha as an organic material has been reported to reduce soil bulk density and increase its porosity within the root zone yupeng et al 2018 in addition to increasing ph buffering and cation exchange capacities rose et al 2014 as well as plant protein synthesis hatami et al 2018 ha interacts with plant membrane transporters canellas et al 2015 improves root growth and reduces na transduction to the plant aerial parts bacilio et al 2016 hatami et al 2018 thus improving both the plant growth and stress tolerance 2 pro as an amino acid has an important function in the osmotic adjustment acts as an osmoprotectant and enables plant to maintain low water potentials mansour and ali 2017 kahlaoui et al 2018 thus enhancing plant growth under water salinity stress 3 gyp the commonly used chemical amendment is effective for enhancing soil infiltration rate and increasing cation exchange capacity na by ca2 choudhary et al 2011 wang et al 2012 which positively affects plant growth 4 lea as a common practice promotes the removal of na and cl below the root zone by doubling the amount of saline water added to the soil thus preventing excessive accumulation of salts choudhary et al 2011 letey et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 sastre conde et al 2015 and indirectly improving growth of t arjuna 5 mag as a source of magnetic iron alleviates the deleterious effects of salinity by creating an electromagnetic field that helps in increasing soil electrical conductivity and water holding capacity reducing soil ph and increasing the ability of plant to absorb water khalil and abou leila 2016 surendran et al 2016 thus enabling growth to take place under saline conditions as expected t arjuna irrigated with tw showed the best growth as they were not subjected to salinity stress these results agree with those reported in the literature in which adverse effects of salinity on several growth parameters were mitigated by the application of these different management treatments e g hatami et al 2018 alleviated saline irrigation water by using humic acid that helped in increasing the soluble proteins and enzymes synthesis in almond rootstocks and increased its tolerance to salinity kahlaoui et al 2018 concluded that foliar spray of proline can increase the tolerance of tomato cultivars to saline water under field conditions kiremit and arslan 2016 suggested that slightly saline water can be used for irrigating allium porrum l if appropriate leaching and drainage systems are applied with minimal decreases in growth and yield ahmed et al 2016 enhanced the tolerance of acalypha wilkesiana transplants growth traits to soil salinity by the application of magnetite 3 2 photosynthetic pigment concentration data of the combined analysis of variance presented in table 5 show that mean of squares of photosynthetic pigments due to both the seasons and treatments were highly significant whereas their interaction showed non significant differences table 6 show that the chlorophyll a and b concentrations of terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn leaves were increased whereas the total carotenoids concentration was decreased by the addition of different management treatments compared to that of sw negative control leaves over the combined seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 3 2 1 chlorophylls a and b mg g the chlorophyll chl a and b concentrations of plants treated with ha pro gyp lea or mag were considerably higher a range of 0 878 1 140 mg g for chl a and a range of 0 185 0 317 mg g for chl b than those found in plants irrigated with sw with chl a and b concentrations of 0 750 and 0 146 mg g respectively with ha pro and gyp treatments the recorded values were close to those recorded in plants irrigated with tw with chl a and b concentrations of 1 182 and 0 366 mg g respectively 3 2 2 total carotenoids mg g the total carotenoids car concentration followed an opposite trend compared to that recorded for the chl a and b concentrations plants irrigated with sw had the highest total car concentrations whereas the lowest concentrations were recorded in plants irrigated with tw among the different management treatments the highest total car concentration was obtained in t arjuna leaves treated with mag followed by lea gyp pro and ha respectively chlorophyll is the main photosynthetic pigment that can be a significant indicator of plant stress li et al 2016 boari et al 2016 and kiremit and arslan 2016 reported that the reduction in chlorophyll concentration is associated with the reduction of water uptake by plants in this study this was clearly observed in plants irrigated with sw negative control however the lack of significant differences in many cases between the photosynthetic pigment concentration of plants irrigated with saline water in the presence of the management treatments and that of plants irrigated with tw positive control may be due to the effects of the treatments in enhancing t arjuna tolerance to salinity ha the most effective management treatment in increasing both chlorophyll a and b concentrations in leaves was reported to increase the absorption of iron hatami et al 2018 which is essential for the maintenance of chloroplast structure and function and is involved in chlorophyll synthesis rout and sahoo 2015 this effect could also be clearly noticed in t arjuna plants treated with mag magnetic iron the effects of the different management treatments on plants photosynthetic pigment concentration under salinity conditions are in agreement with the previous findings of bacilio et al 2016 who treated capsicum annuum l with humic acid kiremit and arslan 2016 who studied the effect of leaching on allium porrum l and ahmed et al 2016 who applied magnetic iron to acalypha wilkesiana 3 3 leaf chemical constituents data of the combined analysis of variance presented in table 5 show that mean of squares of leaf chemical constituents due to both the seasons and treatments were highly significant or significant whereas their interaction showed non significant differences data presented in table 6 show that both the total leaf elements and proline concentrations of terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn were favorably influenced by most of the different management treatments in comparison to sw over the combined seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 3 3 1 total element concentrations n p k ca na and cl ha proved to be the most effective management treatment giving the highest concentrations of n and p in the leaves followed by pro gyp lea and mag respectively in contrast the sw negative control treatment reduced the n and p concentrations in leaves giving the lowest values n at 1 34 and p at 0 10 on the other hand the tw positive control treatment gave the highest values among all treatments n at 2 46 and p at 0 34 treating plants with gyp pro and ha significantly increased the k and ca concentrations in leaves giving k concentrations ranging from 3 13 to 4 22 and ca concentrations ranging from 3 12 to 3 52 compared to plants irrigated with tw which gave k concentration of 2 73 and ca concentration of 2 88 or sw with k concentration of 2 67 and ca concentration of 2 85 the lea and mag treatments on the other hand gave the lowest k concentrations however the lea treatment increased the ca concentration giving a value of 2 95 whereas the mag treatment decreased it giving a value of 1 24 as compared to the controls the use of lea ha pro mag and gyp treatments on the other hand decreased the na concentrations in leaves by 3 19 32 42 and 48 for the five treatments respectively compared to plants irrigated with sw which had the highest na concentrations similarly these five treatments decreased the cl concentrations by 3 26 36 47 and 52 respectively compared to plants irrigated with sw which had the highest cl concentrations in contrast leaves of plants irrigated with tw had the lowest na and cl concentrations among all treatments over both seasons 3 3 2 proline concentrations mg g regarding the proline concentrations in t arjuna leaves significant differences were observed between most of the studied management treatments and the negative and positive controls table 6 spraying of proline on shoots increased its concentration in leaves and gave the highest pro concentration among all treatments 0 75 mg g plants treated with lea mag gyp and ha contained lower pro concentrations with values ranging from 0 14 to 0 35 mg g when compared to plants irrigated with sw that contained the second highest pro values plants irrigated with tw had the lowest pro concentrations the disruption in both total element and proline concentrations of t arjuna leaves caused by sw may be a result of the excessive concentration and absorption of na cl those may cause toxicity specific ion injury and or retard the absorption of other essential plant nutrients choudhary et al 2011 sastre conde et al 2015 stamford et al 2015 bacilio et al 2016 boari et al 2016 garcía caparrós et al 2016 mansour and ali 2017 the management treatments beneficially mitigated the salt induced injury on t arjuna leaf chemical constituents thorough 1 ha as an organic matter stimulated the absorption of mineral elements sani 2014 canellas et al 2015 hatami et al 2018 through enhancing the soil structure in addition to inducing atp activity that energizes ion transporters canellas et al 2015 thus reflecting on the elements concentration 2 the favorable effect of pro is related to reducing na and cl and increasing proline biosynthesis garcía caparrós et al 2016 which serves as an excellent means of storing energy and or a valuable resource either in the stress acclimation or relief zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 exogenously supplied proline provides osmoprotection by improving water balance thus protecting plant tissues from plasmolysis mansour and ali

furthermore the calcium is used to remove the exchangeable sodium in the saline soil choudhary et al 2011 wang et al 2012 theint et al 2015 also it improves the potassium and decreases the sodium concentrations in plants theint et al 2015 which helps in alleviating the salinity effects 4 doubling the amount of saline water through the lea treatment possibly helped in diluting the na and cl concentrations in the soil by washing choudhary et al 2011 letey et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 sastre conde et al 2015 which in turn reflected on t arjuna element concentrations 5 the addition of a natural mineral product such as mag magnetic iron is reported to improve soil water holding and cation exchange capacities as well as its magnetic effect that reduces the absorption of na and cl and improves the transportation of nutrients khalil and abou leila 2016 surendran et al 2016 which in turn affects the element concentrations plants irrigated with tw on the other hand showed no imbalance neither in total leaf elements nor proline concentrations as they were not subjected to any sort of stress the ameliorative effects of the management treatments on leaf chemical constituents under salinity conditions are in agreement with the observations of bacilio et al 2016 who detected an increase in ca concentration in capsicum annuum l treated with humic acid kahlaoui et al 2018 who reported an increase in the proline concentration in tomato plants that had been sprayed with proline wang et al 2017 who found that treating cucumber plants with gypsum decreases na toxicities and increased plant ca concentration and ahmed et al 2016 who reported an increase in n p k cl and proline concentrations in acalypha wilkesiana and a decrease in its na concentration as a result of magnetite application 4 conclusions recommendations and future research directions this eighteen months field study presents strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and mitigate plant growth risks resulting from the use of saline irrigation water by giving examples of environmentally friendly practices that can be used for reducing negative salinity impacts more specifically the findings reveal that using the management treatments humic acid proline gypsum leaching and magnetite improved terminalia arjuna roxb wight arn plant growth photosynthetic pigment concentration and leaf chemical constituents in comparison to the negative control seedlings irrigated with saline water only in addition all management treatments not only alleviated the negative effects of saline irrigation water on the plant attributes but also their effects were remarkably close to that of tap water which in turn may help in ensuring sustainability under saline conditions by applying commercial and cost effective treatments the results of this study moreover lead to the following recommendations 1 utilization of low quality water for agricultural production if combined with management treatment as such approach provides economic benefits essential for sustainable agriculture in dry lands which in turn permits the conservation of fresh water for high value purposes 2 selection of a salt tolerant tree species to withstand the salinity negative impacts which may also help in reclaiming saline lands and 3 this study may also be a part of more comprehensive sustainability protocols under soil and groundwater protection systems using constructed wetlands planted with halophytes to prevent excessive salinization if applied to large areas in arid and semi arid regions although t arjuna growth response to saline irrigation water was improved under the study conditions further research is needed to shed more light on the safe use of saline water in manners that support sustainability taking into consideration 1 the effectiveness of magnetic field usage either by magnetite or saline water magnetization which is still a controversial subject and has not been completely confirmed scientifically 2 the feasibility of combining two or more salinity management treatments 3 the impact of the treatments on a larger scale such as farms regions irrigation systems and river basins 4 the feasibility of integrating saline aquaculture in such areas and 5 sub surface drainage installation and costs finally it would be important to develop recommendations and to determine the constraints and standards that influence the selection and adoption of a certain technology or practice for agriculture sustainability which mainly vary according to the region its economic development and environmental resources and conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgment the

10759,the yield of avocado trees planted on clayey soils decreases due to irrigation with treated waste water tww we hypothesized that the main cause for this yield reduction is the reduction in water uptake by the trees roots the aim of this numerical study was to identify the main soil factors that control the reduction in water uptake by the trees roots and to test various soil substrate based and water based management schemes design to counterweigh the water uptake reduction the study relies on physically based three dimensional 3 d simulations of flow and transport in variably saturated

tuff water uptake 1 introduction decreasing yields of orchards planted on clayey soils with relatively high clay content and irrigated with low quality treated waste water tww have been reported in several publications in the last decade assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 pedrero et al 2013 in israel the effect of irrigation with tww on the response of various orchards was studied recently in controlled field experiments e g assouline and narkis 2013 lado et al 2012 paudel et al 2018 the results of these studies indicated a common phenomenon namely significant changes in soil indices i e salt accumulation and an increase in the soil sodium adsorption ratio sar and in plant indices i e a decrease in water potential a decrease in root growth and an increase in chloride and sodium concentrations in the leaves and roots recent studies e g assouline et al 2015 paudel et al 2018 suggested that the damage to orchards irrigated with tww may be caused by a few factors and or by a combination of these factors the factors are i a salinity problem that affects trees due to the osmotic potential of the soil solution paudel et al 2016a 2016b ii specific toxicity of ions paudel et al 2016a yermiyahu et al 2010 and iii aeration assouline and narkis 2013 yalin et al 2017 and water flow problems assouline and narkis 2011 2013 lado and ben hur

bardhan et al 2016 erel et al 2019 schacht and marschner 2015 and or suspended particles and dissolved organic matter properties lado and ben hur 2010 levy et al 2014 leuther et al 2019 rahav et al 2017 or the combined effect of dissolved organic matter and sar suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 the negative effects of low quality saline irrigation water on plant water uptake and transpiration and eventually on yields are well known see e g bernstein 1975 from the agronomic point of view the challenge raised by irrigation with saline water is how to cope with these negative effects while maintaining acceptable crop yields the widely applied solution to this problem is based on the leaching requirement lr concept see e g ayers and wetscot 1985 this concept promotes salt removal from the soil by applying excess amount of irrigation water for a given water quality it determines the amount of water required to maintain a salinity level that allows a relatively low drop in crop yield salinity control by drip irrigation regulation e g wan et al 2007 li et al 2015 also uses excess amount of irrigation water in this approach whenever the pressure head at a given soil depth below the drip emitters exceeds a critical predetermined threshold value an excess user controlled amount of irrigation water is applied it should be emphasized however that the aforementioned approaches for salinity control suffer from two substantial limitations i they may increase the load of the salt moving below the root zone towards the groundwater and ii they may create poor soil aeration in the main root zone leading to insufficient supply of oxygen to the plant roots particularly in clayey soils in order to find agro technical solutions to the damage to orchards planted on clayey soils and irrigated with tww an experimental plot was established recently in the avocado plantation of kibbutz yassur located in the western galilee israel tarchitzki et al 2019 the experimental setup includes few treatments in which the agro technical solutions for prevention and or minimization of the negative effects of irrigation with tww in clayey soils were examined the results of this field study suggested that as compared with the reference treatment irrigation with tww in all treatments sodium and chloride concentrations in the soil profile decreased furthermore except for the treatment that includes aeration trenches all treatments showed a sharp reduction in oxygen concentrations after an irrigation event the treatment that includes irrigation with fresh water yielded the highest water uptake by the trees roots given the damage to perennial crops planted on clayey soils and irrigated with tww the specific objectives of the present study are i to assess the long term effects of irrigation with tww on the response of the flow system with emphasis on water uptake by the trees roots and solute leaching below the root zone ii to identify the main soil factors i e salinity sodicity aeration that control these effects and iii to test various soil substrate based and water based management solutions designed to counterweigh the water uptake reduction and to assess their long term effect on the response of the flow system numerical simulations of water flow and solute transport in realistic flow systems regarded as numerical experiments may serve as an efficient tool to study processes and to evaluate the response of the flow system to different plausible scenarios see e g russo et al 2005 2006 the numerical experiments may provide detailed information that is unaffected by uncertainty due to measurement errors or inadequate sampling than is attainable in practice from field studies at the price of reduced generality they circumvent most of the stringent assumptions of analytical studies and facilitate analysis of simplified yet realistic situations at a fraction of the cost of physical experiments to pursue the objectives of this study therefore water flow and solute transport in a realistic 3 d spatially heterogeneous variably saturated flow system under cropped conditions are analyzed here by means of numerical simulations the simulations rely on physically based models of water flow and transport of mixed ion salt considering the coupling between the flow and the transport through the dependence of the hydraulic properties on soil solution composition and ions concentrations realistic features of the flow system taken into account in the simulations include the irrigation water quantity and quality the spatial configuration of the irrigation system and the trees the spatial variability of the relevant soil properties and the initial flow controlled attributes the spatial pattern of trees roots and the time dependent atmospheric forcing conditions imposed on the soil surface it should be emphasized that the simulation approach undertaken here is a single realization approach e g ababou 1988 russo 1991 polmann et al 1991 russo 1995 1998 2001 tseng and jury 1994 among others successful application of this approach requires a flow domain that spans a sufficient number of correlation scales of the relevant soil properties dagan 1989 in addition preserving details of the heterogeneity field requires the size of the numerical cells to be small as compared with the correlation length scale of the soil heterogeneity ababou 1988 2 materials methods and theoretical considerations 2 1 the physical domain and its parametrization an avocado orchard irrigated with tww using a drip irrigation system is considered here the orchard is planted on a clay soil dominated by montmorillonite at the yassur site located in the western galilee israel tarchitzki et al 2019 with a typical mediterranean climate characterized by relatively long dry season requiring irrigation and a distinct rainy period during the winter the planting spacing of the orchard is 6 m 3 5 m with trees 3 5 m apart along the trees rows each trees row is planted on a windrow 1 6 m wide 0 4 m high and is irrigated with a set of two drip line laterals located along both sides of the trees row 0 9 m apart each lateral consists of a set of drippers with emitter discharge of 1 6 ℓ h 0 5 m apart in the soil substrate based treatment under each lateral an aeration trench 0 3 m wide 0 3 m deep whose center coincides with drip lateral filled with a tuff soil is taken into account the experimental site 1 7 ha in size was sampled to a depth of 1 2 m at five different boreholes the soil cores were analyzed for different soil properties i e soil texture bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity lime content exchangeable cations and soil cation exchange capacity and flow controlled variables i e water content soil solution concentrations of chloride sodium and calcium for each of the five boreholes 0 3 m segments of the soil core extending to a depth of 1 2 m were analyzed for grain size distribution using the traditional hydrometer and sieves method and the laser diffraction method eshel et al 2004 and for bulk density ρb for more details see tarchitzki et al 2019 the grain size distribution data obtained by the laser diffraction method were used in order to determine the soil pore size distribution psd following russo et al 2015 and bardhan et al 2016 employing the young laplace equation for a sufficiently narrow tube of circular cross section it is assumed here that locally the cumulative soil psd may describe the soil water pressure head soil water saturation relationships consequently either the unimodal van genuchten 1980 model vg or the composite bimodal model vgd durner 1994 may describe the soil psd locally the shape parameters of the vg model α and m and those of the vgd model α1 m1 α2 and m2 and the weighting factors for the two sub curves of the latter model w1 and w2 1 w1 were estimated by minimizing a generalized least squares criterion the levenberg marquardt method was used to ensure that the optimization proceeded in a descent direction for a model discrimination test use was made of the akaika information criterion hippel 1981 the results of the analyses suggest that in contrast to the mizra site russo et al 2015 in the case of the yassur site the performance expressed in terms of accuracy and consistency with the grain size distribution data of the more complicated vgd model was not better than that of the vg model the latter model therefore was selected to represent the local constitutive relationships for unsaturated flow in the yassur site i e the retention θ ψ x and the hydraulic conductivity k k ψ x functions where θ is the volumetric water content ψ ψ x t is the pressure head and x is the spatial coordinate vector values of the parameters of the vg model from each of the soil cores estimated by the aforementioned optimization procedure averaged over the soil cores in turn were used to provide estimates of the mean values of the parameters of the vg model based on previous studies e g russo and bouton 1992 russo et al 1997 it is assumed here that each of the vg parameters is a secondorder stationary statistically anisotropic random space function characterized by a constant mean and a two point covariance parameters of the latter the variance and the correlation length scales were adopted from russo and bouton 1992 considering a cartesian coordinate system x1 x2 x3 where x1 is directed downwards a subplot of this orchard consisting of a 3 d spatially heterogeneous variably saturated flow domain which extends over l1 3 m l2 15 m and l3 10 m along the x1 x2 and x3 axes respectively is addressed here the subplot includes two adjacent tree rows located 6 m apart with four trees located 3 5 m apart along each row the flow domain was discretized into uniform numerical cells ω measuing δ1 0 05 m in the vertical direction and δ2 0 15 m and δ3 0 25 m in the horizontal directions consider the correlation length scales of logks in the verical direction i1 0 25 m and in the horizontal directions i2 i3 1 m russo and bouton 1992 adopted here the ratios li ii i 1 2 3 may be considered as large enough to ensure that the results of the simulations which in turn are based on a single realization of the soil input properties and the applied weather pattern can be used for inference of ensemble statistics dagan 1989 furthermore the ratios ii δi i 1 2 3 may be considered as large enough to preserve details of the spatial structure of the soil properties ababou 1988 for more details see russo et al 2006 the turning bands method tompson et al 1989 in combination with the multi variate normal distribution function method mood and graybill 1963 were used to generate cross correlated realizations of the vg parametrs for each of the numerical cells constituing the flow domain taking into account the linear cross correlation coefficients between the various soil parameters for more details see russo et al 2006 in the case of the aeration trenches deterministic vg parameters table 1 were assigned to the numerical cells constituing the treanches mean values and coefficients of variation cv of the resultant vg parameters are given in table 1 the numerical grid used for the generation of the 3 d vg parameter field was modified in order to account for the application of water by the drip irrigation system during the irrigation periods in this modification within the soil layer which extends from x1 0 the top of the windrows to x1 0 4 m the bottom of the windrows and for 0 x2 l2 0 x3 l3 a finer grid size was constructed i e δ1 0 025 m in the vertical direction and δ2 0 075 m and δ3 0 125 m in the horizontal directions notice that the existence of windrows creates a flow domain in which the soil elevation z x2 is z 0 for l21i x2 l22i i 1 2 and z 0 4 m elsewhere where l211 4 2 m l221 5 8 m l212 10 2 and l222 11 8 m consequently in the simulations the numerical cells above the elevation z x2 were considered as inactive for the flow and the transport furthermore the vertical boundaries of the windrows at x l21i and x2 l22i i 1 2 were considered as seepage planes the finer grid size in the horizontal directions was maintained for the entire vertical extent of the flow domain on the contrary the vertical grid size varied with soil depth in order to maintain a smoothly varying grid a transition zone which extends over a verical distance of 0 3 m below the bottom of the windrow was created within this zone the vertical grid size increased by a simple streacing method in which each successive cell differs from the previous one by a factor r 1 1 below the transition zone the original vertical grid size was maintained using the 3 d vg parameter field generated on the original grid points a 3 d linear interpolation scheme was employed in order to obtain estimates of the vg parameters on the new grid points in addition pore scale dispersion tensor with longitudinal dispersivity λl 2 10 3m and transverse dispersivity λt 1 10 4m perkins and johnston 1963 were considered in the simulations root distribution data adopted from salagado and cautin 2008 were employed in order to construct a time invariant normalized root depth distribution function for the avocado trees 2 2 the flow and the transport model generally the transport of tsw in the vadose zone should be treated as a multi component reactive transport of solutes and gases and should consider dissolved organic matter in order to simplify matters following russo et al 2004 2015 and russo 2013 the investigation is focused on the simple but practical soil water system containing na ca and cl ions only i e ion precipitation and or dissolution and the dissolution of organic matter are not taken into account considering water uptake by plant roots water flow and solute na ca cl transport in the 3 d variably saturated spatially heterogeneous flow system were simulated employing numerical solutions of the 3 d richards equation and the 3 d single region advection dispersion equation respectively described in russo et al 2004 and russo 2013 in order to be consistent with the computation of the coupling interaction parameters based on the diffuse double layer theory see e g russo 1988 the concentrations of calcium and magnesium were considered jointly i e cca cca cmg the coupling between the flow and the transport was taken into account through the dependence of the soil hydraulic functions on the soil solution concentration c cna cca and the sodium adsorption ratio sar cna cca 2 the estimated hydraulic functions θ ψ x and k ψ x were considered as representative of a rigid stable reference state in which the changes in the psd due to soil solution soil matrix ss sm interactions are negligibly small i e when sar 0 and c to account for the coupling between the flow and the transport following russo et al 2004 we define θr θr c sar ψ x and kr kr c sar ψ x as relative retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions respectively resulting from the effect of the ss sm interactions on the soil psd the modelling of the local darcy scale relative hydraulic functions θr c sar ψ x and kr c sar ψ x adopted here is based on the theoretical framework described in russo and bresler 1977b and russo 1988 the theoretical approach combines the planar mixed ion diffuse double layer theory the structure and organization of the clay particles and hydrodynamic principles relevant to the pore scale with a conceptual model of the porous medium and experimental data of the soil s psd the resultant soil solution concentration and composition dependent hydraulic functions are given by 1a θ c sar ψ x θr c sar ψ x θ ψ x 1b k c sar ψ x kr c sar ψ x k ψ x the flow and the transport model that takes into account the coupling between the flow and the transport russo et al 2004 russo 2013 allows quantitative analyses of water flow and solute transport in a clayey variably saturated soils that may contain aggregates with spatially heterogeneous hydraulic properties the model was modified to account for irrigation by drippers russo et al 2015 the iterative procedure described in russo et al 2006 was employed in order to determine the size of the time dependent ponding area that may develop around the drippers at the soil surface during an irrigation event details of the flow and the transport equations and the numerical schemes employed to solve them are given elsewhere russo et al 2004 2015 russo 2013 for the sake of coherence and completeness the governing equations and the procedures used to solve them are briefly presented in appendix a in the present study the flow and the transport model was modified to account for the conditions pertinent to the avocado orchard in yassur i e the trees rows are planted on a relatively high windrows with aeration trenches along their axis in addition as compared with russo et al 2015 in the present study the sink term representing water uptake by the plant roots which appears on the right hand side of the richards equation was modified to account for the effect of the oxygen availability on the water uptake 2 3 the modified water sink term neglecting chloride uptake by the plant roots assuming that the effects of salinity stress and water stress on the plants are additive e g nimah and hanks 1973 bresler 1987 and considering the effect of the oxygen availability on the water uptake the sink term representing water uptake by plant roots is 2a sw x t γ x t re x t k c sar ψ x ψr t ψt x t where k c sar ψ x is the soil hydraulic conductivity ψr t is the pressure head at the root soil interface respectively ψt x t ψ x t π x t and π x t are the total water pressure head and the osmotic pressure head of the soil solution respectively re x t is the root effectiveness function proportional to the specific area of the soil root interface and inversely proportional to the impedance of the soil root interface and γ x t is the oxygen availability coefficient derived from the relative oxygen diffusivity function naasz et al 2008 i e γ x t 1 θ x t θ0 x 2b γ x t 1 f x t 1 1 f x t p q 2 θ0 x θ x t θ1 x γ x t 0 θ x t θ1 x where f x t θ x t θ0 x θ1 x θ0 x θ x t is the soil water content θ0 x θs x θac and θ1 x θs x θsc with θac 0 15 and θsc 0 01 are the soil water contents corresponding to zero and 3 oxygen respectively θs x is the saturated soil water content p 0 7 and q 1 p equation 2 suggests that as soil water content approaches saturation i e as θ x t θ0 x γ x t vanishes and water uptake by the roots ceases because of poor soil aeration and insufficient supply of oxygen to the roots as soil water content decreases γ x t increases rapidly approaching unity as water content reduces to 70 of its value at saturation i e as θ x t θ1 x in other words at intermediate water contents i e when θ0 x θ x t θ1 x the adverse effect of insufficient soil aeration on water uptake by the roots decreases rapidly with decreasing water content for water contents below θ1 x γ x t 1 i e soil aeration is no longer a limiting factor for the water uptake by the plant roots the sink term 2 shows that for a given root density distribution the rate of water uptake by the roots is proportional to the water content dependent hydraulic conductivity and the oxygen availability and to the difference between the total pressure head at the root soil interface ψr t and the total water pressure head of the soil ψt x t notice that under frequent irrigation and in particular when low quality water is used for irrigation the osmotic pressure head of the soil solution dominates ψt x t 2 4 the management schemes the management schemes considered in this study consist of i a reference case which includes the local soil only and tww is used for the irrigation ref ii same as i but fresh water is used for the irrigation fw iii same as i but with trenches that are filled with tuff substrate tuf iv same as iii but using pulse irrigation tufp v same as iii but the aeration trenches are filled with a hypothetical finer textured soil whose hydraulic properties are determined by an optimization procedure saop vi same as i but the irrigation water quality is alternated between treated waste water tww and desalinized water dsw using a data driven scheme adw the schemes i to iii relate to the treatments examined in the field experiment at the yassur orchard the results of this field experiment suggest that relative to the reference case ref the treatment associated with aeration trenches containing coarse textured tuff soil tuf only slightly improve water uptake by the trees roots this finding is attributed to the rapid decrease in the hydraulic conductivity as the water content of the tuff soil decreases schemes iv and v therefore are suggested as soil substrate based means designed to restrain the rapid decrease in k within the active root zone and consequently to improve water uptake by the trees roots relative to scheme iii scheme iv considers the aeration trenches containing tuff and attempts to solve the problem by applying the irrigation in pulses the number of pulses needed to maximize the rate of water uptake by the trees roots was tested by a series of flow and transport simulations the results of these simulations suggested that there is no advantage in applying water in more than four pulses the latter agrees with the maximum number of pulses possible in practical applications scheme v attempts to solve the problem by using aeration trenches filled with a soil material whose texture is finer than that of the tuff soil its hydraulic properties are determined by an optimization procedure whose objective function is the maximization of the rate of water uptake by the trees roots adopting the van genuchten 1980 model for the hydraulic functions of the required soil material with θs 0 41 and θr 0 06 being constants the optimization procedure see appendix b yielded ks 15 52 m d α 0 94 m 1 and n 4 in other words as compared with the tuff soil table 1 the optimization procedure yielded a soil material characterized by a substntially lower conductance and by substantially larger capillary forces the results of the yassur experiment suggest that irrigation with fresh water yielded the highest water uptake by the trees roots scheme vi therefore is a water based scheme which attempts to further increase the water uptake by the trees roots by reducing soil salinity at the active root zone the scheme vi is essentially the data driven scheme for soil salinity control suggested by russo et al 2015 referred to as the adw scheme the scheme is based on alternating irrigation water quality between tww and desalinated seawater dsw guided by the salinity at a soil depth corresponding to the vertical position of the centroid of the soil volume active in water uptake zup t russo et al 2006 see equation 4 below when c zup t t exceeds a predetermined user controlled critical value ccr the tww is replaced by the dsw and vice versa when c zup t t decreases to a level below ccr based on the analyses of russo et al 2015 the value of ccr was adopted here 2 5 implementation meteorological data collected in the yassur orchard provided data of rainfall rates and amounts as well as daily mean temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation that were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration et0 t using penman monteith method potential evapotranspiration rates εtp t were estimated from the et0 t data using the time dependent crop coefficients actually used in the yassur site assuming that the wetted soil surface area of the windrows is completely covered by the trees canopy a negligibly small soil evaporation rate εp t i e τp t ετp t was adopted for the surface area of the windrows the maximization iterative mi approach suggested by neuman et al 1975 and implemented in 3 d spatially heterogeneous flow domains by russo 1998 was used to implement water uptake by the trees roots the latter in turn determines the actual transpiration rate τa t for the soil surface area between the windrows outside the rooted zone assuming that τp t is negligibly small i e εp t ετp t actual rates of water loss by evaporation εa t were implemented by a similar mi approach for more details see russo et al 2006 starting at the beginning of the irrigation season may 1st for each of the aforementioned management schemes flow and transport simulations proceeded for a period of three successive years using a sequence of irrigation rainfall and potential evapotranspiration records from the year 2018 as a surrogate for the extended period annual cumulative depths of irrigation rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were 750 mm 595 mm and 1067 mm respectively in schemes iii and v irrigations were applied every day while in schemes i ii and vi irrigations were applied every two days in scheme iv irrigations were applied in pulses the concentrations c0k of chloride k 1 sodium k 2 and calcium k 3 in the irrigation waters were c0k 12 5 6 3 and 6 2 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively for the tww and c0k 8 6 1 5 and 7 1 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively for the fw and c0k 0 42 0 3 and 0 12 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively for the dsw in the rainfall water their concentrations were c0k 1 5 0 4 and 1 1 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively the values of the sodium adsorption ratio sar c02 c03 2 for the treated waste fresh desalinized and rainfall waters are sar 3 6 0 83 1 22 and 0 54 meq ℓ 1 2 respectively appropriate initial conditions for the present analyses were created by considering measured water content and solutes concentrations profiles obtained prior to the irrigation season for the flow second type upper boundary condition was imposed on the top boundary x1 0 with flux that is determined by the time dependent irrigation and rainfall fluxes associated with entry zone whose size vary between the irrigation and the rainfall seasons and by the time dependent potential evaporation flux a unit head gradient boundary was specified at the bottom boundary x1 l1 for the transport first type upper boundary condition was imposed on the top boundary with inlet concentrations c0k k 1 3 that vary between the irrigation and the rainfall seasons a zero gradient boundary was specified at the bottom boundary 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical profiles of the flow controlled attributes the results of the numerical simulations are expressed in terms of the vertical profiles of the horizontally averaged mean value μ μ x1 and standard deviation sd σ σ x1 of selected flow controlled attributes i e 3a μ x 1 0 l 3 a 0 l 2 a f x 1 x

extents of the averaging domain along the x2 and the x3 axes respectively notice that the averaging domain used for the calculations of μ x1 and σ x1 which is the inner core of the horizontal plane of the flow domain l2a l3a in size consists of two adjacent windrows each planted with one trees row and each row includes three trees each windrow is irrigated with a set of two drip line laterals located along both sides of the trees row as described in section 2 1 in other words the averaging domain used to produce the profiles presented in figs 1 5 took into account the spatial configuration of the irrigation system and the trees the spatial variability of the relevant soil properties and the flow controlled attributes and the spatial pattern of trees roots profiles of the mean value μ x1 and the standard deviation σ x1 of the water content the oxygen availability coefficient the chloride concentration and the sar in the soil solution and the relative hydraulic conductivity at a given time during the irrigation season of the second year just after an irrigation event are depicted in figs 1 5 respectively results depict for the management schemes tested in the yassur orchard a and for the proposed schemes b notice that in order to increase the resolution in the upper part of the soil profile only the upper half of its vertical extent is presented in these figures furthermore the trends shown in these figures maintain during the third year this stems from the fact that the sequence of irrigation rainfall and potential evapotranspiration records from year 2018 were used as a surrogate for the subsequent years furthermore the distinct rainy period during the winter with significant amounts of water 595 mm substantially enhances water flow and solute transport below the root zone see fig 11 below consequently at end of the second year the flow system is essentially brought to its state prior to the second irrigation season fig 1 shows that as expected in comparison with the reference case ref the schemes associated with the aeration trenches tuf tufp and saop substantially reduce the mean value of the water content θ in the upper part of the soil profile and significantly increase its sd furthermore fig 1 shows that compared with the reference case ref the water based scheme fw and even more so the proposed water based scheme adw slightly decrease the mean value of θ and increase its sd in the upper part of the root zone this stems from the reduced soil salinity associated with the fw scheme and particularly with the adw scheme see fig 3 below and the interaction between soil salinity water uptake by the trees roots and soil water content notice that the results depicted in fig 1 for the reference case ref and the tuf and the fw schemes are in qualitative agreement with the observations in the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 as expected the effect of the different schemes on the water content decreases significantly at soil depths below the root zone regarding the rainfall seasons the results of our analyses not shown here suggest that the trends depicted in fig 1 exist also during the rainfall seasons this happens in spite that characteristics of the conditions imposed on the soil surface during the latter season differ significantly from their counterparts that prevail during the irrigation season during the rainfall seasons the water flux is imposed on the entire soil surface the duration of the storm events and the time interval between successive storms are time dependent and the chloride concentration in the rainfall water is very low fig 2 shows the horizontally averaged mean and sd profiles of the water content dependent oxygen availability coefficient γ γ θ x t this coefficient 0 γ 1 quantifies the effect of soil aeration i e the ability of the soil to supply oxygen to the roots on the water uptake by the trees roots fig 2 suggests that as expected in the case of the reference case ref relatively poor soil aeration in the upper part of the soil profile and insufficient supply of oxygen to the roots may reduce the rate of the water uptake substantially this result is in qualitative agreement with the results of assouline and narkis 2013 as compared with the ref case the water based scheme fw and even more so the proposed water based scheme adw slightly improve the soil aeration at the upper part of the root zone in addition as expected relative to the reference case the soil substrate based management scheme that represents the treatment examined in the yassur experiment tuf and the proposed soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop substantially improve the soil aeration in the upper part of the soil profile it should be emphasized that the effect of the soil substrate based management schemes on the soil aeration at the upper part of the root zone generally persists during the rainfall seasons fig 3 demonstrates that for all schemes examined at a given soil depth the solute concentration sd values are in the same order of magnitude as the concentration mean values the substantial sd values reflect the considerable range of concentration values about the concentration mean value at a given soil depth the latter in turn stems from the spatial distribution of the irrigation flux imposed on the soil surface the 3 d pattern of the trees roots the spatial distribution of relevant soil properties and consequently the spatial distribution of the flow controlled attributes that affect water uptake notice that in the case of the reference case ref in the upper part of the windrows midway between the two adjacent drip line laterals the chloride concentration may exceed the value of 60 meq ℓ not shown here this salt accumulation zone is typical to clay soils like the local soil in the yassur orchard irrigated with drip irrigation system the local soil is associated with relatively low saturated conductivity and appreciable capillary forces table 1 which in turn may lead to appreciable lateral pressure head gradients and concurrently to appreciable lateral solute mass fluxes the latter in turn may substantially increase the interaction between the adjacent drip line laterals leading to salt accumulation zone midway between the drip line laterals in each of the windrows as expected the use of aeration trenches with significantly coarser soil material schemes saop and particularly tuf and tufp reduces the lateral extent of the salt accumulation zone and its concentration peak the use of less saline irrigation water schemes fw and particularly adw achieves similar results these trends are clearly demonstrated in fig 3 this figure shows that relative to the reference case ref the schemes that represent the treatments carried out in the yassur experiment tuf and fw reduce the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil profile these results are in qualitative agreement with the observations in the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 among the proposed management schemes as expected the water based scheme adw substantially reduced the horizontally averaged mean and sd of the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil profile on the contrary the soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop perform slightly worse than the tuf scheme this is expected inasmuch as in the upper part of the soil profile the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the water content and consequently of the vertical velocity associated with the tufp and the saop schemes are lower than their counterparts associated with the tuf scheme fig 1 fig 3 shows that although the effect of the different management schemes on the chloride concentration decreases with increasing depth it persists to a relatively deep soil layers far below the root zone particularly in response to the water based schemes during the rainfall seasons the spatial and the temporal distribution of the chloride concentrations in the upper part of the soil profile is determined by the series of the rainfall events with very low chloride concentration imposed on the entire soil surface the results of our analyses not shown here suggest that as expected during the rainfall seasons the effect of the water based schemes fw and particularly adw on the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil diminishes with increasing time on the contrary the soil substrate based schemes tuf tufp and particularly saop reduce the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil profile regarding the deep soil layers far below the root zone the results of our analyses suggest that the effect of the different schemes particularly the water based schemes on the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the chloride concentrations depicted in fig 3 persists during the rainfall seasons also fig 4 shows the horizontally averaged mean and sd profiles of the soil solution sar sar x t notice that the relatively large sar values at soil depths below x1 1 5 m are in agreement with the initial sar profile below the windrows depth x1 0 5 m because of the relatively low sar values in the irrigation waters sodium with less affinity for the exchange complex is exchanged by the preferentially adsorbed calcium consequently the vertical position of the na ca exchange front increases slowly with time resulting in relatively low sar values in the upper part of the soil profile particularly within the windrows i e for x1 0 5 m considering the management schemes that represent the treatments carried out in the yassur experiment the tuf and fw schemes first fig 4 shows that relative to the reference case ref both the tuff scheme and particularly the fw scheme reduce both the mean value and the sd of the sar in the upper part of the soil profile this is expected in view of the lower sar of the irrigation water associated with the fw scheme notice that the mean sar profiles depicted in fig 4 for the reference state ref and the fw scheme are in qualitative agreement with the results of assouline and narkis 2011 fig 4 also shows that the proposed water based scheme adw performs similar to its counterpart the fw scheme while the proposed soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop perform similar to their counterpart the tuf scheme furthermore fig 4 suggests that although the effect of the management schemes on the soil solution sar decreases with soil depth it persists to a considerable soil depth far below the root zone notice that in the case of the reference case ref the soil solution sar in the upper part of each of the windrows midway between the two adjacent drip line laterals may exceed the value of 5 meq ℓ 1 2 this sodium accumulation zone is similar to the salt accumulation zone discussed earlier however because of the nonlinearity of the na ca exchange isotherm which in turn increases with increasing sar and decreasing chloride concentration c russo et al 2004 the rate at which the sodium accumulation zone is developed is substantially slower as compared with the rate at which the salt accumulation zone is developed during the rainfall seasons the effect of the management schemes on the soil solution sar in the upper part of the soil profile is blur by the rainfall events at relatively deep soil layers far below the root zone however the effect of the schemes particularly the water based schemes on the soil solution sar persists during the rainfall season the clayey soil of yassur is characterized by a significant specific surface area and consequently by substantial ss sm interactions whose magnitude increases with increasing sar and decreasing c in the soil solution the latter may change the soil psd substantially and consequently may reduce the soil hydraulic conductivity considerably e g russo and bresler 1977a 1977b russo 1988 fig 5 shows the horizontally averaged mean and sd profiles of the relative hydraulic conductivity kr c sar ψ x k c sar ψ x k ψ x addressing the schemes that represent the treatments examined in the yassur experiment first fig 5 shows that the water based scheme fw performed similar to the reference case ref while the soil substrate based scheme tuf slightly increases the relative hydraulic conductivity kr in the upper part of the root zone notice that the latter results contradict the results of assouline and narkis 2011 see their fig 2 this disagreement can be explained based on the disparity between the ion concentrations of the irrigation waters associated with their analyses the acre site and those associated with our analyses the yassur site in both sites the fw and the tww have similar sar values 0 8 and 3 6 meq ℓ 1 2 respectively while their salinity is significantly higher in the yassur site ccl 8 6 and 12 5 meq ℓ respectively as compared with ccl 2 0 and 6 2 meq ℓ respectively in the acre site in other words in contrast with the yassur site the salinity of the tww in the acre site is not high enough to compensate for the adverse effects of higher sar on the soil hydraulic conductivity furthermore the results of assouline and narkis 2011 expressed in terms of the profiles of ks rather than in terms of the horizontally averaged profiles of the pressure head dependent relative conductivity kr kr ψ x1 t fig 5 are based only on two disturbed samples at a given soil depth regarding the proposed management schemes fig 5 shows that as expected the proposed water based scheme adw which substantially reduces the chloride concentration in the upper part of the root zone but only slightly reduces its sar significantly reduces kr in the upper part of the root zone fig 5 also shows that the effect of the proposed soil substrate based schemes saop and the tufp on kr is similar to the effect of their counterpart the tuf scheme furthermore fig 5 suggests that below the depth of the root zone the effect of the management schemes on kr decreases with increasing soil depth regarding the irrigation of orchards planted on clayey soil with treated waste water tww and fresh water fw the results of our simulations presented in figs 1 5 suggest that as compared with irrigation with fw irrigation with tww may lead to significant changes in soil indices i e an increase in soil salinity and consequently a decrease in soil aeration and an increase in the soil solution sar these results are in qualitative agreement with the results of recent field studies e g lado et al 2012 assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 paudel et al 2018 tarchitzki et al 2019 3 2 long term behavior of the hydraulic conductivity fig 5 showed that the most substantial effects of the ss sm interactions on the hydraulic conductivity occur in vicinity of the soil surface the temporal dependence of the horizontally averaged mean value of the relative hydraulic conductivity kr c sar ψ x at the top 0 05 m soil layer are depicted in fig 6 clearly the mean kr exhibits time dependency attributed to the temporal changes in the soil solution concentration and composition and the water content the latter in turn are attributed to the time dependent forcing conditions imposed on the soil surface the results depicted in fig 6 are in agreement with the results of the analyses of russo et al 2015 considering a citrus orchard planted on a structured clay soil associated with a high water table and irrigated with tww and fw addressing the schemes that represent the treatments carried out in the yassur experiment ref tuf and fw first fig 6a demonstrates the limited decrease in the mean kr during the irrigation seasons associated with relatively concentrated soil solution and the more substantial decrease in the mean kr during the rainfall seasons associated with more diluted soil solution the reference case ref and the water based scheme fw lead to a similar temporal pattern with slightly smaller values of kr in the case of fw on the contrary the soil substrate based scheme tuf restrains the decrease in the kr values particularly during the rainfall seasons among the proposed management schemes fig 6b as expected the water based scheme adw which relies on alternating of the irrigation water quality between tww and dsw leads to a periodic behavior of the kr values during the irrigation seasons the lowest amplitude values of the periodic kr values during these seasons are substantially lower than their counterparts associated with the reference case ref during the rainfall seasons however as expected the two schemes lead to a similar temporal pattern of the kr values furthermore as expected the soil substrate based proposed schemes tufp and saop perform very similar to the tuf scheme the cyclic behavior of the mean kr depicted in fig 6a b is in agreement with the results reported by russo et al 2015 considering a citrus orchard planted on a structured clay soil associated with a high water table irrigated with tww and fw this cyclic behavior suggests that the considerable reduction in the soil hydraulic conductivity during the rainfall periods recovers during the irrigation periods the reversible cyclic behavior may persist as long as the soil exchangeable sodium percentage esp f c sar does not exceed a soil dependent threshold value espc e g espc 15 shainberg and kaiserman 1969 for esp espc a breakdown of the clay particle domains and the subsequent relocation of the clay particles may lead to a continuous decrease in the soil hydraulic conductivity and eventually to an unrecoverable situation in which most of the soil surface is essentially sealed the fact that the value of espc value was not reached during the period of three years considered in the present study see the sar profiles in fig 4 is expected in view of the values of c and sar associated with tww and particularly with the fresh water the fw scheme furthermore fig 6 a suggests that the effect of both irrigation waters tww with larger c and sar and consequently larger soil esp as compared with fw on the mean kr at the top 0 05 m of the soil is similar this stems from the fact that larger c may compensate in part for the adverse effects of larger sar and consequently of larger soil esp on the soil hydraulic conductivity 3 3 root zone flow regime and water uptake by the trees roots regarding the soil substrate based management schemes which make use of aeration trenches filled with relatively coarse textured soil material as indicated earlier section 1 the results of the yassur experiment suggested that the tuff filled trenches only slightly improve water uptake by the trees roots this finding is attribute to the rapid decrease in the hydraulic conductivity as the water content of the tuff soil decreases it is important therefore to analyze the effect of the soil substrate based management schemes on the temporal variations of the flow controlled attributes that affect water uptake by the trees roots in the most active part of the root zone following russo et al 2005 the vertical position of the centroid of the soil volume from which most of the water is extracted by plant roots zup t given by 4 below is adopted here as a characteristic vertical length scale of the active root zone i e 4a z up t 1 w u t x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 0 l r 0 t s w x τ d τ x 1 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 where s w x t is the daily average rate of water uptake by plant roots and wu t is the volume of water extracted by the plant roots till time t given by 4b w u t x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 0 l r 0 t s w x τ dτ d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 notice that the rate of water uptake by the trees roots sw x t equation 2 and concurrently s w x t and zup t are affected by the spatial and the temporal distribution of the water content i e soil aeration pressure head and solute concentration the latter in turn depend on the spatial and the temporal distribution of the soil hydraulic properties on the conditions imposed on the upper boundary of the flow domain and on the initial conditions equation 4 with lr 0 5 m was evaluated over the inner core of the horizontal plane of the flow domain i e x 2 x 2 10 5 m and x 3 x 3 7 6 m which includes six trees and over the irrigation season of the second year the resultant time average values of zup t are zup zup t 0 12 0 13 and 0 24 m for the ref fw and the tuf management schemes respectively and zup 0 10 0 15 and 0 14 m for the proposed schemes tupp saop and adw respectively in other words increasing irrigation water quality led to a slightly deeper active root zone while aeration furrows with coarser soil texture led to a substantially deeper active root zone notice that as expected the pulse irrigation the tufp scheme led to a considerably shallower active root zone the relatively large value of zup associated with the tuff filled aeration trenches the tuf scheme suggests that in this case water uptake by the trees roots takes place also from the local soil below the aeration trenches this attributes to the very weak capillary forces of the tuff material table 1 and consequently to the rapid decrease in water content and hydraulic conductivity with decreasing soil water pressure this is not the case in the other schemes associated with aeration trenches i e saop and in particular tufp taking into consideration the sink term representing the rate of water uptake by the plant roots equation 2 in the following mean values of the flow controlled attributes on the right hand side of 2 i e vi ψ x t c x t k x t and γ x t for i 1 4 respectively are evaluated at zup by averaging vi x2k x3k zup t over the trees in the inner core of the flow domain here x2k and x3k k 1 to np are the coordinate locations of the k th tree at the soil surface and np 6 fig 7 a b show the temporal changes in the mean values of the pressure head and the chloride concentration at zup ψ zup t and c zup t respectively during the daylight hours after an irrigation event notice that the origin t 0 in fig 7 and also in figs 8 and 9 below corresponds to july 1st 60days after the start of the irrigation season the irrigation event started at t 0 and ceased at t 0 095d and t 0 19d for the 1 day and the 2 day irrigation intervals respectively results are depicted for the reference management scheme ref and for the original tuf and the proposed tufp and saop soil substrate based management schemes and for original fw and the proposed adw water based management schemes fig 7a shows that in the case of the reference case ref ψ zup t decreases with increasing time at a rate that initially increases with time reaches a maximum at time t tmax1 before the time corresponding to midday t05 0 55d and then decreases slowly with increasing t here tmax1 is the time at which max dψ zup t dt occurs considering the soil substrate based schemes first in the case of the tuf scheme since zup is located in the vicinity of the bottom of the aeration trench the ψ zup t associated with the tuf scheme exhibits temporal behavior similar to the ref scheme with relatively lower more negative values fig 7a shows that as compared with the ref and the tuf schemes the proposed management schemes saop and in particular tufp lead to substantially higher values of ψ zup t which in turn decrease with increasing time at a substantially slower rate regarding the water based schemes fig 7a shows that as compared with the reference case the water based management schemes fw and in particular adw lead to lower values of ψ zup t the gap between ψ zup t associated with the different schemes increases with increasing time furthermore as compared with the ref case the water based management schemes fw and in particular adw lead to larger values of tmax1 fig 7b shows that in the case of the ref case c zup t increases with increasing time t at a rate that initially for t t05 increases with t reaches a maximum at tmax2 before t05 and then decreases slowly with increasing t here tmax2 is the time at which max dc zup t dt occurs the c zup t associated with the tuf scheme exhibits a similar temporal behavior with substantially lower values fig 7b shows that as expected the proposed tufp scheme leads to a cyclic behavior of c zup t with a range of values comparable with its counterpart associated with the ref case on the contrary as compared with the ref case the proposed saop scheme initially when t t05 leads to a substantially lower c zup t values which in turn increase considerably in the vicinity of t05 and for t t05 converge to values slightly lower than those of its counterpart associated with the ref case fig 7b also shows that as compared with the ref case the water based schemes fw and particularly adw lead to substantially lower c zup t values and larger values of tmax2 fig 7a b demonstrate that as expected under frequent irrigations in all schemes examined the contribution of the pressure head to the total pressure head of the soil solution is rather small the latter is controlled mainly by the osmotic pressure head of the soil solution which in turn is linearly related to the chloride concentration in the soil solution fig 8a b show the temporal changes in the mean values of the soil hydraulic conductivity k zup t and the oxygen availability coefficient γ zup t during the daylight hours in the irrigation season for the same schemes as in fig 7 regarding the soil substrate based schemes first fig 8a shows that as compared with the ref case the k zup t associated with the tuf scheme is smaller by an order of magnitude a gap that further increases with increasing time t furthermore fig 8a shows the substantial increase in k zup t when a pulse irrigation is combined with the tuff filled aeration trenches the tufp scheme and particularly when the aeration trenches are filled with a soil material whose texture is finer and in turn does not require irrigation in pulses the saop scheme regarding the water based schemes fig 8a shows that the k zup t associated with the fw scheme exhibits similar temporal behavior as its counterpart associated with the ref case on the contrary the adw scheme leads to substantially lower values of k zup t as compared with the ref case fig 8b shows that in the ref case after the cessation of an irrigation event γ zup t is relatively small indicating relatively poor soil aeration and restricted oxygen supply to the trees roots as time increases and water uptake starts with a peak around midday t05 water content in the active root zone decreases and concurrently γ zup t increases with increasing time indicating an improved oxygen supply to the trees roots regarding the soil substrate based schemes in the case of the tuff filled aeration trenches the tuf scheme because in this case water extraction by the roots takes place also from the soil beneath the aeration trenches the γ zup t associated with the tuf scheme likewise its counterpart associated with the ref case indicates a relatively poor aeration just after the end of the irrigation notice that initially when t t05 γ zup t associated with the tuf scheme recovers with time slower than its counterpart associated with the ref case while the opposite is true for t t05 fig 8b also shows that for both of the suggested schemes tufp and saop γ zup t remains unity during the entire daylight hours suggesting that in these cases oxygen availability does not limit water uptake by the trees roots at all furthermore fig 8b shows that as compared with the ref case as expected fig 7a b the water based schemes fw for t t0 5 and particularly adw for the entire daylight time lead to a larger γ zup t values indicating a better supply of oxygen to the trees roots in a qualitative agreement with the results of assouline and narkis 2013 figs 7 and 8 clearly demonstrate the effect of the management schemes on the temporal variations of flow controlled attributes that affect water uptake by the trees roots in the most active part of the root zone these figures suggest that in the case of the ref case adverse effects due to soil salinity and soil aeration which in turn are interrelated are the main factors that restrict the rate of water uptake by the trees roots while the soil hydraulic conductivity is of a lesser significance in the case of the soil substrate based tuf scheme in which the adverse effects of the osmotic potential of the soil solution reduce substantially the very low hydraulic conductivity associated with the tuff material is the major factor that restricts the rate of water uptake by the trees roots poor soil aeration also might reduce the rate of water uptake particularly during the first few hours after the cession of an irrigation event in the case of the proposed soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop soil aeration is not a limiting factor while soil salinity particularly in the case of the tufp scheme might be a factor that restricts the rate of water uptake by the trees roots on the contrary the substantially higher hydraulic conductivity particularly in the case of the saop scheme might increase the rate of water uptake by the trees roots relative to the ref case the water based schemes fw and particularly adw reduce the adverse effects due to soil salinity and soil aeration the favorable effect of the adw scheme however may be compensate in part by the decrease in the soil hydraulic conductivity fig 8a the latter is attributed to the decrease in water content or pressure head fig 7a and to the relatively low soil solution chloride concentration fig 7b which in turn magnify the effect of the ss sm interactions to reduce the soil hydraulic conductivity fig 9 depicts the temporal changes in the rate of the water uptake by the trees roots during the daylight hours evaluated at x1 zup taking into account the np trees in the inner core of the flow domain i e wur t zup np sw x2k x3k zup t here sw x t is given by equation 2 x2k and x3k k 1 to np are the coordinate locations of the k th tree at the soil surface and np 6 clearly the combined trends depicted in figs 7 and 8 manifest themselves in fig 9 regarding the soil substrate based schemes first fig 9 clearly demonstrates the advantage of using a pulse irrigation in combination with the tuff filled aeration trenches the tufp scheme and in particular of using aeration trenches filled with a soil material of a finer texture that does not require a pulse irrigation the saop scheme the tufp scheme increases the water uptake rate at several times throughout the daylight hours including near the peak of the potential transpiration while the saop scheme increases water uptake rate near the peak of the potential transpiration fig 9 also shows that as expected decreasing soil solution concentration by irrigation with water of better quality the fw scheme or in particular by alternating irrigation water quality between tww and dsw the adw scheme may lead to an increase in the rate of the water uptake by the trees roots the results depicted in fig 9 suggest that in the latter case the favorable effects of the adw scheme lower soil salinity and consequently better soil aeration figs 7a and 8 b prevail over its unfavorable effect lower hydraulic conductivity fig 8a the aforementioned trends are further demonstrate in fig 10 which depicts the relative transpiration rate τr t τa t τp t where τa t sw x1 x2 x3 t dx1dx2dx3 is the actual transpiration rate and τp t is the potential transpiration rate the results in fig 10 are depicted for an irrigation period of 120d during the second year for the original top and the proposed bottom management schemes notice that the pattern of the τr t functions associated with the different schemes depicted in fig 10 persists during the irrigation season of the third year notice also that in the reference case ref the cumulative water uptake during the irrigation season obtained by integration of the pertinent τr t function in fig 10 over time does not exceed 52 of the cumulative potential transpiration during that period fig 10 shows that relative to the ref case the management schemes that represent the treatments examined in the yassur experiment tuf and fw moderately improve the water extraction by the trees roots during the irrigation season by 9 5 and 12 3 respectively these results are in relatively good agreement with their counterparts measured at the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 in contrast the proposed soil substrate based management schemes the pulse irrigation combined with the tuff filled aeration trenches and in particular the aeration trenches filled with soil material of finer texture that does not require irrigation in pulses the saop scheme substantially improve the rate of water uptake by the trees roots during the irrigation season by 28 4 and 35 2 respectively in addition the advantage of the proposed water based management scheme adw which alternates the irrigation water quality between tww and dsw according to the soil salinity at zup is apparent relative to the ref case the adw scheme increases the rate of water uptake by the trees roots during the irrigation season by 20 5 requiring the substitution of 40 of the cumulative volume of tww by dsw 3 4 water drainage and chloride leaching important attributes related to groundwater contamination and or salinization are the longitudinal vertical components of the water volume flux vector qw1 x t and the solute mass flux vector qs1 x t given by qw1 x t k x t ψ x t x1 1 and qs1 x t j 1 3 d1j c x t x1 qw1 x t c x t respectively monitored at a given horizontal control plane cp located far enough below the root zone here d1j is the longitudinal components of the pore scale dispersion tensor dij i j 1 3 see eq a3 in appendix a mean water volume flux qw1 l t and mean chloride mass flux qs1 l t crossing a horizontal cp located at soil depth l 2 5 m are depicted in fig 11 for a sequence of three years including irrigation and rainfall seasons the mean fluxes are determined by integrating the longitudinal components of the water volume flux qw1 x t and the solute mass flux qs1 x t vectors respectively over the inner core of the horizontal cp i e qw1 l t qw1 x1 l x2x3 t dx2dx3 aic and qs1 l t qs1 x1 l x2x3 t dx2dx3 aic respectively where aic is the horizontal cross section of the inner core given by aic l2a l3a fig 11a b clearly demonstrate the seasonal effect on both qw1 l t and qs1 l t which in turn are highly correlated during the irrigation events relativly concentrted solution invades the flow system through a portion of the soil surface in the proximaty of the trees where most of the water uptake takes place on the contrary during the rainfall events relatively diluted solution enters the flow system through the entire soil surface consequently regions far from the trees which in turn are associated with negligibly small water uptake are more affected by the local high conductance preferential flow paths in the heterogeneous soil and thus enhance water flow and solute transport below the root zone furthermore it is clearly shown in fig 11a b that the effect of the management schemes on qs1 l t and particularly on qw1 l t is masked during the rainfall seasons fig 11a shows that the mean water volume flux qw1 l t far below the root zone is affected by the management schemes particularly during the irrigation seasons as compared with the ref case the soil substrate based schemes tuf and tufp and to a lesser extent saop increase qw1 l t this is expected in view of the relatively high hydraulic conductivity associated with the soil substrate based schemes during the irrigation and the rainfall events on the contrary the water based schemes fw and particularly adw decrease qw1 l t this is expected in view of the enhanced rate of water uptake by the trees roots associated with these schemes figs 9 and 10 and consequently the decrease in water content fig 1 and concurrently in the water content dependent soil hydraulic conductivity notice that in the case of the adw scheme the decrease in the soil solution chloride concentration fig 3 which in turn magnify the effect of the ss sm interactions on the soil hydraulic conductivity fig 5 further decreases qw1 x t and concurrently qw1 l t after a period of three years for the soil substrate based tuf tufp and saop schemes and the water based fw and adw schemes the cumulative volumes of water drained below the horizontal cp located at l 2 5 m are 1 14 1 13 1 05 0 97 and 0 92 respectively of their counterpart associated with the reference case fig 11b shows that the mean chloride mass flux qs1 l t far below the root zone is affected by the soil management schemes as compared with ref case the soil substrate based schemes saop tuf and particularly tufp increase slightly qs1 l t this is expected in view of the effect of the soil substrate based schemes on qw1 l t on the contrary the water based schemes fw and particularly adw substantially decrease qs1 l t this is also expected in view of the effect of the water based schemes on qw1 l t and the lower solute concentrations associated with these schemes entering the flow system during the irrigation events after a period of three years for the soil substrate based tuf tufp and saop schemes and the water based fw and adw schemes the cumulative masses of chloride leached through the horizontal cp located at l 2 5 m are 1 051 1 063 1 02 0 81 and 0 60 respectively of their counterpart associated with the reference case 4 summary and concluding remarks a physically based water flow and solute transport model that takes into account the interaction between the fluid and the soil is used to simulate flow and transport in a realistic three dimensional spatially heterogeneous flow system representing an avocado orchard planted on a clayey soil and irrigated with treated waste water tww the simulations conducted for three consecutive years including rainfall during the winter and irrigations throughout the rest of the year the main findings of this study summarize as follows i the long term effect of irrigation with tww on the response of the flow system is attribute to the salinity of the tww and not to its sodium adsorption ratio sar ii the water based management schemes fw and particularly the proposed adw reduce soil salinity and concurrently increase the rate of water uptake by the trees roots decrease soil water content and increase soil aeration consequently over an irrigation season the fw and the adw schemes increase water uptake by the trees roots by 12 3 and 20 5 respectively relative to the reference ref case furthermore relative to the reference case for a period of three years the water based schemes fw and particularly adw decrease the cumulative volume of water drained by 3 and 8 respectively and to a larger extent decrease the cumulative mass of chloride leached by 19 and 40 respectively far below the root zone iii the soil substrate based management tuf scheme reduces soil salinity but may fail to maintain the water fluxes in the active root zone required to meet the transpiration demand consequently over an irrigation season the tuf scheme only slightly increases water uptake by the trees roots by 9 5 relative to the ref case furthermore the tuf scheme increases the cumulative volume of water drained and to a lesser extent increases cumulative mass of chloride leached relatively far below the root zone by 14 and 5 respectively relative to the ref case iv the proposed soil substrate based management schemes tufp and particularly saop designed to overcome the drawbacks of the tuf scheme substantially improve water fluxes and soil aeration in the active root zone consequently over an irrigation season both schemes substantially increase water uptake by the trees roots by 28 4 and 35 4 respectively relative to the reference case furthermore relative to the tuf scheme the tupp scheme essentially does not affect the cumulative volume of water drained far below the root zone on the contrary the saop scheme reduces the cumulative volume of water drained and to a lesser extent reduces the cumulative mass of chloride leached far below the root zone by 9 2 and 3 respectively the findings of this study are explained by the effect of the irrigation water salinity on the soil salinity by the mutual relationships between soil salinity soil water content soil aeration and water extraction by the plant roots and their effect on water volume fluxes and solute mass fluxes below the root zone and by the relationships between the soil texture and the response of the flow system to the water sources i e irrigation flux at the soil surface and sinks i e rate of water uptake by the plant roots imposed on the flow system we would like to emphasize that finding i of this study is restricted to cases in which the salinity of the tww is high enough to reduce water uptake by the plant roots and to compensate for the adverse effects of the relatively high sar of the tww on the soil hydraulic conductivity this is the case in the mizra site analyzed by russo et al 2015 but probably not in the case in the acre site analyzed by assouline and narkis 2011 finding ii restricted to the fw scheme and finding iii of this study are in agreement with the results from the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 before conclusion we would like to emphasize that the results of this study rely on physically based numerical simulations of flow and transport the latter in turn provide detailed information that generally is not attainable in practice from physical experiments on the consequences of soil crop irrigation and meteorological characteristics for water flow and transport of interacting solutes under relatively realistic conditions the findings of this study however are restricted to a particular sitespecific application with given characteristics of the soil crop weather irrigation system and the irrigation waters furthermore the results presented here are limited by the simplifying assumptions engaged in the present study see russo et al 2005 russo 2013 and russo et al 2015 most significant are the reliance on a single realization approach a rigorous analysis of the assumptions employed here however is beyond the limited scope of this study based on russo et al 2006 we may conclude that the single realization approach might be sufficiently accurate to indicate appropriate trends furthermore the qualitative agreement between the results of this study and the results from the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 are encouraging we believe that the scope of this study is timely and relevant to regions throughout the world in which declining water resources impose usage of low quality water for irrigation the present study should be considered as an application of well established methodologies it is based on previous studies e g russo et al 2005 2015 russo 2013 and relies on powerful tools i e 3 d numerical codes of water flow and solute transport in variably saturated spatially heterogeneous flow systems described in details in the cited papers and elsewhere innovative features of the present study include the proposition and analyses of water based and soil substrate based management

flow and transport of interacting mixed na ca salts in a realistic 3 d spatially heterogeneous variably saturated flow system requires quantification of the coupling interaction parameters cips which include the relative soil hydraulic conductivity kr the relative soil water content θr the retardation factors for na and ca rf na and rf ca respectively and the elution factor for cl ef all as functions of the pressure head the concentration and the composition of the soil solution and the spatial coordinate vector x the approach adopted in this study to quantify the cips is based on the theoretical framework developed in the past russo and bresler 1977b bresler 1987 russo 1988 and is described in details in russo et al 2004 and russo 2013 the measurable macroscopic spatially heterogeneous soil properties required to quantify the cips are the soil bulk density the soil cation exchange capacity the soil specific surface area and the constitutive relationships for unsaturated flow in a rigid stable reference state following russo et al 2004 and russo 2013 it is assumed here that water flow is described locally by the 3 d richards equation the physical parameters of which are viewed as realizations of 3 d second order stationary random space functions characterized completely by a constant mean and a two point spatial covariance it is further assumed that the transport of each of the ions of the mixed na ca salt is described locally by the classical one region 3 d advection dispersion equation ade when the ions in the soil solution interact with the soil matrix the properties of the spatially heterogeneous soil that affect the flow and the transport are expressed as functions of the spatial coordinate vector x the pressure head ψ the sum of the molar concentration of the cations c0 cna cca molℓ 1 and the ratio between the molar concentration of the mono and the divalent cations r cna cca in the soil solution in a cartesian coordinate system x1 x2 x3 where x1 is directed vertically downwards assuming local isotropy considering water uptake by the plant roots and neglecting both the effect of osmotic gradients on the flow and local anisotropy the richards equation governing flow in a non rigid 3 d variably saturated spatially heterogeneous soil russo et al 2004 is a1 θ r θ t i 1 3 x i k r k ψ x i k r k x 1 s w where t

the mixed form of richards equation governing flow in a three dimensional domain a1 was approximated by a fully implicit euler scheme with a truncation error of o δt δx1 2 δx2 2 δx3 2 this scheme is convergent and unconditionally stable for the linear diffusion equation it has been found appropriate for flow problems in highly heterogeneous porous media in which both steep gradients and saturated regions can be developed the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations with respect to the pressure head ψ is solved iteratively by applying the so called modified picard method celia et al 1990 picard external iterations are applied for both capillary and gravity terms and the resulting system of linear algebraic equations is solved by the polynomial preconditioned conjugate gradient ppcg method e g hageman and young 1981 the hydraulic conductivity between the numerical cells the so called inter block conductivity employed in the solution was estimated by means of a modified version of the asymptotic weighting scheme proposed by zaidel and russo 1992 the modified scheme avoids the smearing of steep wetting fronts and does not create oscillations for gravity dominated flow and therefore is appropriate for flow problems in highly heterogeneous combined flow systems associated with steep gradients and or saturated regions to account for irrigation by drippers the iterative procedure described in russo et al 2006 was employed in order to determine the size of the time dependent ponding area that may develop around the drippers at the soil surface during an irrigation event the iterative procedure continues until a prescribed error tolerance is met or until the number of iterations has exceeded a predetermined limit the numerical scheme employed for the solution of eq a2 was design to minimize numerical dispersion for advection dominated transport problems similar to the third order total variation diminishing tvd scheme implemented in the mt3d code

the coupling between the flow equation and the transport equations through the dependence of k ψ and θ ψ on c0 and r are described in details in russo et al 2004 and russo 2013 appendix b determination of the soil parameters for the aeration trenches given the objective of maximizing water uptake by the trees roots the desired soil material of the aeration trenches should maintain relatively high conductance and sufficient soil aeration in the range of water contents that prevail in the root zone during the period at which most of the water uptake by the tree s roots takes place this means a soil material with a relatively high conductance and significant capillary forces considering the parameters θs and θr as constants the determination of the three soil parameters pi i 1 2 3 for ks α and n respectively for the aeration trenches is performed in an iterative manner an initial simulation of flow and transport is performed over a period of several irrigation cycles

10759,the yield of avocado trees planted on clayey soils decreases due to irrigation with treated waste water tww we hypothesized that the main cause for this yield reduction is the reduction in water uptake by the trees roots the aim of this numerical study was to identify the main soil factors that control the reduction in water uptake by the trees roots and to test various soil substrate based and water based management schemes design to counterweigh the water uptake reduction the study relies on physically based three dimensional 3 d simulations of flow and transport in variably saturated spatially heterogeneous flow domain conducted for three successive years the main findings of this study suggest that i the long term effect of irrigation with tww on the response of the flow system

tuff water uptake 1 introduction decreasing yields of orchards planted on clayey soils with relatively high clay content and irrigated with low quality treated waste water tww have been reported in several publications in the last decade assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 pedrero et al 2013 in israel the effect of irrigation with tww on the response of various orchards was studied recently in controlled field experiments e g assouline and narkis 2013 lado et al 2012 paudel et al 2018 the results of these studies indicated a common phenomenon namely significant changes in soil indices i e salt accumulation and an increase in the soil sodium adsorption ratio sar and in plant indices i e a decrease in water potential a decrease in root growth and an increase in chloride and sodium concentrations in the leaves and roots recent studies e g assouline et al 2015 paudel et al 2018 suggested that the damage to orchards irrigated with tww may be caused by a few factors and or by a combination of these factors the factors are i a salinity problem that affects trees due to the osmotic potential of the soil solution paudel et al 2016a 2016b ii specific toxicity of ions paudel et al 2016a yermiyahu et al 2010 and iii aeration assouline and narkis 2013 yalin et al 2017 and water flow problems assouline and narkis 2011 2013 lado and ben hur 2010 levy and assouline 2011 due to a damage to soil structure and concurrently to soil hydraulic conductivity caused by relatively high sar values assouline and narkis 2011 2013 lado and ben hur 2010 bardhan et al 2016 erel et al 2019 schacht and marschner 2015 and or suspended particles and dissolved organic matter properties lado and ben hur 2010 levy et al 2014 leuther et al 2019 rahav et al 2017 or the combined effect of dissolved organic matter and sar suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 the negative effects of low quality saline irrigation water on plant water uptake and transpiration and eventually on yields are well known see e g bernstein 1975 from the agronomic point of view the challenge raised by irrigation with saline water is how to cope with these negative effects while maintaining acceptable crop yields the widely applied solution to this problem is based on the leaching requirement lr concept see e g ayers and wetscot 1985 this concept promotes salt removal from the soil by applying excess amount of irrigation water for a given water quality it determines the amount of water required to maintain a salinity level that allows a relatively low drop in crop yield salinity control by drip irrigation regulation e g wan et al 2007 li et al 2015 also uses excess amount of irrigation water in this approach whenever the pressure head at a given soil depth below the drip emitters exceeds a critical predetermined threshold value an excess user controlled amount of irrigation water is applied it should be emphasized however that the aforementioned approaches for salinity control suffer from two substantial limitations i they may increase the load of the salt moving below the root zone towards the groundwater and ii they may create poor soil aeration in the main root zone leading to insufficient supply of oxygen to the plant roots particularly in clayey soils in order to find agro technical solutions to the damage to orchards planted on clayey soils and irrigated with tww an experimental plot was established recently in the avocado plantation of kibbutz yassur located in the western galilee israel tarchitzki et al 2019 the experimental setup includes few treatments in which the agro technical solutions for prevention and or minimization of the negative effects of irrigation with tww in clayey soils were examined the results of this field study suggested that as compared with the reference treatment irrigation with tww in all treatments sodium and chloride concentrations in the soil profile decreased furthermore except for the treatment that includes aeration trenches all treatments showed a sharp reduction in oxygen concentrations after an irrigation event the treatment that includes irrigation with fresh water yielded the highest water uptake by the trees roots given the damage to perennial crops planted on clayey soils and irrigated with tww the specific objectives of the present study are i to assess the long term effects of irrigation with tww on the response of the flow system with emphasis on water uptake by the trees roots and solute leaching below the root zone ii to identify the main soil factors i e salinity sodicity aeration that control these effects and iii to test various soil substrate based and water based management solutions designed to counterweigh the water uptake reduction and to assess their long term effect on the response of the flow system numerical simulations of water flow and solute transport in realistic flow systems regarded as numerical experiments may serve as an efficient tool to study processes and to evaluate the response of the flow system to different plausible scenarios see e g russo et al 2005 2006 the numerical experiments may provide detailed information that is unaffected by uncertainty due to measurement errors or inadequate sampling than is attainable in practice from field studies at the price of reduced generality they circumvent most of the stringent assumptions of analytical studies and facilitate analysis of simplified yet realistic situations at a fraction of the cost of physical experiments to pursue the objectives of this study therefore water flow and solute transport in a realistic 3 d spatially heterogeneous variably saturated flow system under cropped conditions are analyzed here by means of numerical simulations the simulations rely on physically based models of water flow and transport of mixed ion salt considering the coupling between the flow and the transport through the dependence of the hydraulic properties on soil solution composition and ions concentrations realistic features of the flow system taken into account in the simulations include the irrigation water quantity and quality the spatial configuration of the irrigation system and the trees the spatial variability of the relevant soil properties and the initial flow controlled attributes the spatial pattern of trees roots and the time dependent atmospheric forcing conditions imposed on the soil surface it should be emphasized that the simulation approach undertaken here is a single realization approach e g ababou 1988 russo 1991 polmann et al 1991 russo 1995 1998 2001 tseng and jury 1994 among others successful application of this approach requires a flow domain that spans a sufficient number of correlation scales of the relevant soil properties dagan 1989 in addition preserving details of the heterogeneity field requires the size of the numerical cells to be small as compared with the correlation length scale of the soil heterogeneity ababou 1988 2 materials methods and theoretical considerations 2 1 the physical domain and its parametrization an avocado orchard irrigated with tww using a drip irrigation system is considered here the orchard is planted on a clay soil dominated by montmorillonite at the yassur site located in the western galilee israel tarchitzki et al 2019 with a typical mediterranean climate characterized by relatively long dry season requiring irrigation and a distinct rainy period during the winter the planting spacing of the orchard is 6 m 3 5 m with trees 3 5 m apart along the trees rows each trees row is planted on a windrow 1 6 m wide 0 4 m high and is irrigated with a set of two drip line laterals located along both sides of the trees row 0 9 m apart each lateral consists of a set of drippers with emitter discharge of 1 6 ℓ h 0 5 m apart in the soil substrate based treatment under each lateral an aeration trench 0 3 m wide 0 3 m deep whose center coincides with drip lateral filled with a tuff soil is taken into account the experimental site 1 7 ha in size was sampled to a depth of 1 2 m at five different boreholes the soil cores were analyzed for different soil properties i e soil texture bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity lime content exchangeable cations and soil cation exchange capacity and flow controlled variables i e water content soil solution concentrations of chloride sodium and calcium for each of the five boreholes 0 3 m segments of the soil core extending to a depth of 1 2 m were analyzed for grain size distribution using the traditional hydrometer and sieves method and the laser diffraction method eshel et al 2004 and for bulk density ρb for more details see tarchitzki et al 2019 the grain size distribution data obtained by the laser diffraction method were used in order to determine the soil pore size distribution psd following russo et al 2015 and bardhan et al 2016 employing the young laplace equation for a sufficiently narrow tube of circular cross section it is assumed here that locally the cumulative soil psd may describe the soil water pressure head soil water saturation relationships consequently either the unimodal van genuchten 1980 model vg or the composite bimodal model vgd durner 1994 may describe the soil psd locally the shape parameters of the vg model α and m and those of the vgd model α1 m1 α2 and m2 and the weighting factors for the two sub curves of the latter model w1 and w2 1 w1 were estimated by minimizing a generalized least squares criterion the levenberg marquardt method was used to ensure that the optimization proceeded in a descent direction for a model discrimination test use was made of the akaika information criterion hippel 1981 the results of the analyses suggest that in contrast to the mizra site russo et al 2015 in the case of the yassur site the performance expressed in terms of accuracy and consistency with the grain size distribution data of the more complicated vgd model was not better than that of the vg model the latter model therefore was selected to represent the local constitutive relationships for unsaturated flow in the yassur site i e the retention θ ψ x and the hydraulic conductivity k k ψ x functions where θ is the volumetric water content ψ ψ x t is the pressure head and x is the spatial coordinate vector values of the parameters of the vg model from each of the soil cores estimated by the aforementioned optimization procedure averaged over the soil cores in turn were used to provide estimates of the mean values of the parameters of the vg model based on previous studies e g russo and bouton 1992 russo et al 1997 it is assumed here that each of the vg parameters is a secondorder stationary statistically anisotropic random space function characterized by a constant mean and a two point covariance parameters of the latter the variance and the correlation length scales were adopted from russo and bouton 1992 considering a cartesian coordinate system x1 x2 x3 where x1 is directed downwards a subplot of this orchard consisting of a 3 d spatially heterogeneous variably saturated flow domain which extends over l1 3 m l2 15 m and l3 10 m along the x1 x2 and x3 axes respectively is addressed here the subplot includes two adjacent tree rows located 6 m apart with four trees located 3 5 m apart along each row the flow domain was discretized into uniform numerical cells ω measuing δ1 0 05 m in the vertical direction and δ2 0 15 m and δ3 0 25 m in the horizontal directions consider the correlation length scales of logks in the verical direction i1 0 25 m and in the horizontal directions i2 i3 1 m russo and bouton 1992 adopted here the ratios li ii i 1 2 3 may be considered as large enough to ensure that the results of the simulations which in turn are based on a single realization of the soil input properties and the applied weather pattern can be used for inference of ensemble statistics dagan 1989 furthermore the ratios ii δi i 1 2 3 may be considered as large enough to preserve details of the spatial structure of the soil properties ababou 1988 for more details see russo et al 2006 the turning bands method tompson et al 1989 in combination with the multi variate normal distribution function method mood and graybill 1963 were used to generate cross correlated realizations of the vg parametrs for each of the numerical cells constituing the flow domain taking into account the linear cross correlation coefficients between the various soil parameters for more details see russo et al 2006 in the case of the aeration trenches deterministic vg parameters table 1 were assigned to the numerical cells constituing the treanches mean values and coefficients of variation cv of the resultant vg parameters are given in table 1 the numerical grid used for the generation of the 3 d vg parameter field was modified in order to account for the application of water by the drip irrigation system during the irrigation periods in this modification within the soil layer which extends from x1 0 the top of the windrows to x1 0 4 m the bottom of the windrows and for 0 x2 l2 0 x3 l3 a finer grid size was constructed i e δ1 0 025 m in the vertical direction and δ2 0 075 m and δ3 0 125 m in the horizontal directions notice that the existence of windrows creates a flow domain in which the soil elevation z x2 is z 0 for l21i x2 l22i i 1 2 and z 0 4 m elsewhere where l211 4 2 m l221 5 8 m l212 10 2 and l222 11 8 m consequently in the simulations the numerical cells above the elevation z x2 were considered as inactive for the flow and the transport furthermore the vertical boundaries of the windrows at x l21i and x2 l22i i 1 2 were considered as seepage planes the finer grid size in the horizontal directions was maintained for the entire vertical extent of the flow domain on the contrary the vertical grid size varied with soil depth in order to maintain a smoothly varying grid a transition zone which extends over a verical distance of 0 3 m below the bottom of the windrow was created within this zone the vertical grid size increased by a simple streacing method in which each successive cell differs from the previous one by a factor r 1 1 below the transition zone the original vertical grid size was maintained using the 3 d vg parameter field generated on the original grid points a 3 d linear interpolation scheme was employed in order to obtain estimates of the vg parameters on the new grid points in addition pore scale dispersion tensor with longitudinal dispersivity λl 2 10 3m and transverse dispersivity λt 1 10 4m perkins and johnston 1963 were considered in the simulations root distribution data adopted from salagado and cautin 2008 were employed in order to construct a time invariant normalized root depth distribution function for the avocado trees 2 2 the flow and the transport model generally the transport of tsw in the vadose zone should be treated as a multi component reactive transport of solutes and gases and should consider dissolved organic matter in order to simplify matters following russo et al 2004 2015 and russo 2013 the investigation is focused on the simple but practical soil water system containing na ca and cl ions only i e ion precipitation and or dissolution and the dissolution of organic matter are not taken into account considering water uptake by plant roots water flow and solute na ca cl transport in the 3 d variably saturated spatially heterogeneous flow system were simulated employing numerical solutions of the 3 d richards equation and the 3 d single region advection dispersion equation respectively described in russo et al 2004 and russo 2013 in order to be consistent with the computation of the coupling interaction parameters based on the diffuse double layer theory see e g russo 1988 the concentrations of calcium and magnesium were considered jointly i e cca cca cmg the coupling between the flow and the transport was taken into account through the dependence of the soil hydraulic functions on the soil solution concentration c cna cca and the sodium adsorption ratio sar cna cca 2 the estimated hydraulic functions θ ψ x and k ψ x were considered as representative of a rigid stable reference state in which the changes in the psd due to soil solution soil matrix ss sm interactions are negligibly small i e when sar 0 and c to account for the coupling between the flow and the transport following russo et al 2004 we define θr θr c sar ψ x and kr kr c sar ψ x as relative retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions respectively resulting from the effect of the ss sm interactions on the soil psd the modelling of the local darcy scale relative hydraulic functions θr c sar ψ x and kr c sar ψ x adopted here is based on the theoretical framework described in russo and bresler 1977b and russo 1988 the theoretical approach combines the planar mixed ion diffuse double layer theory the structure and organization of the clay particles and hydrodynamic principles relevant to the pore scale with a conceptual model of the porous medium and experimental data of the soil s psd the resultant soil solution concentration and composition dependent hydraulic functions are given by 1a θ c sar ψ x θr c sar ψ x θ ψ x 1b k c sar ψ x kr c sar ψ x k

in a clayey variably saturated soils that may contain aggregates with spatially heterogeneous hydraulic properties the model was modified to account for irrigation by drippers russo et al 2015 the iterative procedure described in russo et al 2006 was employed in order to determine the size of the time dependent ponding area that may develop around the drippers at the soil surface during an irrigation event details of the flow and the transport equations and the numerical schemes employed to solve them are given elsewhere russo et al 2004 2015 russo 2013 for the sake of coherence and completeness the governing equations and the procedures used to solve them are briefly presented in appendix a in the present study the flow and the transport model was modified to account for the conditions pertinent to the avocado orchard in yassur i e the trees rows are planted on a relatively high windrows with aeration trenches along their axis in addition as compared with russo et al 2015 in the present study the sink term representing water uptake by the plant roots which appears on the right hand side of the richards equation was modified to account for the effect of the oxygen availability on the water uptake 2 3 the modified water sink term neglecting chloride uptake by the plant roots assuming that the effects of salinity stress and water stress on the plants are additive e g nimah and hanks 1973 bresler 1987 and considering the effect of the oxygen availability on the water uptake the sink term representing water uptake by plant roots is 2a sw x t γ x t re x t k c sar ψ x ψr t ψt x t where k c sar ψ x is the soil hydraulic conductivity ψr t is the pressure head at the root soil interface respectively ψt x t ψ x t π x t and π x t are the total water pressure head and the osmotic pressure head of the soil solution respectively re x t is the root effectiveness function proportional to the specific area of the soil root interface and inversely proportional to the impedance of the soil root interface and γ x t is the oxygen availability coefficient derived from the relative oxygen diffusivity function naasz et al 2008 i e γ x t 1 θ x t θ0 x 2b γ x t 1 f x t 1 1 f x t p q 2 θ0 x θ x t θ1 x γ x t 0 θ x t θ1 x where f x t θ x t θ0 x θ1 x θ0 x θ x t is the soil water content θ0 x θs x θac and θ1 x θs x θsc with θac 0 15 and θsc 0 01 are the soil water contents corresponding to zero and 3 oxygen respectively θs x is the saturated soil water content p 0 7 and q 1 p equation 2 suggests that as soil water content approaches saturation i e as θ x t θ0 x γ x t vanishes and water uptake by the roots ceases because of poor soil aeration and insufficient supply of oxygen to the roots as soil water content decreases γ x t increases rapidly approaching unity as water content reduces to 70 of its value at saturation i e as θ x t θ1 x in other words at intermediate water contents i e when θ0 x θ x t θ1 x the adverse effect of insufficient soil aeration on water uptake by the roots decreases rapidly with decreasing water content for water contents below θ1 x γ x t 1 i e soil aeration is no longer a limiting factor for the water uptake by the plant roots the sink term 2 shows that for a given root density distribution the rate of water uptake by the roots is proportional to the water content dependent hydraulic conductivity and the oxygen availability and to the difference between the total pressure head at the root soil interface ψr t and the total water pressure head of the soil ψt x t notice that under frequent irrigation and in particular when low quality water is used for irrigation the osmotic pressure head of the soil solution dominates ψt x t 2 4 the management schemes the management schemes considered in this study consist of i a reference case which includes the local soil only and tww is used for the irrigation ref ii same as i but fresh water is used for the irrigation fw iii same as i but with trenches that are filled with tuff substrate tuf iv same as iii but using pulse irrigation tufp v same as iii but the aeration trenches are filled with a hypothetical finer textured soil whose hydraulic properties are determined by an optimization procedure saop vi same as i but the irrigation water quality is alternated between treated waste water tww and desalinized water dsw using a data driven scheme adw the schemes i to iii relate to the treatments examined in the field experiment at the yassur orchard the results of this field experiment suggest that relative to the reference case ref the treatment associated with aeration trenches containing coarse textured tuff soil tuf only slightly improve water uptake by the trees roots this finding is attributed to the rapid decrease in the hydraulic conductivity as the water content of the tuff soil decreases schemes iv and v therefore are suggested as soil substrate based means designed to restrain the rapid decrease in k within the active root zone and consequently to improve water uptake by the trees roots relative to scheme iii scheme iv considers the aeration trenches containing tuff and attempts to solve the problem by applying the irrigation in pulses the number of pulses needed to maximize the rate of water uptake by the trees roots was tested by a series of flow and transport simulations the results of these simulations suggested that there is no advantage in applying water in more than four pulses the latter agrees with the maximum number of pulses possible in practical applications scheme v attempts to solve the problem by using aeration trenches filled with a soil material whose texture is finer than that of the tuff soil its hydraulic properties are determined by an optimization procedure whose objective function is the maximization of the rate of water uptake by the trees roots adopting the van genuchten 1980 model for the hydraulic functions of the required soil material with θs 0 41 and θr 0 06 being constants the optimization procedure see appendix b yielded ks 15 52 m d α 0 94 m 1 and n 4 in other words as compared with the tuff soil table 1 the optimization procedure yielded a soil material characterized by a substntially lower conductance and by substantially larger capillary forces the results of the yassur experiment suggest that irrigation with fresh water yielded the highest water uptake by the trees roots scheme vi therefore is a water based scheme which attempts to further increase the water uptake by the trees roots by reducing soil salinity at the active root zone the scheme vi is essentially the data driven scheme for soil salinity control suggested by russo et al 2015 referred to as the adw scheme the scheme is based on alternating irrigation water quality between tww and desalinated seawater dsw guided by the salinity at a soil depth corresponding to the vertical position of the centroid of the soil volume active in water uptake zup t russo et al 2006 see equation 4 below when c zup t t exceeds a predetermined user controlled critical value ccr the tww is replaced by the dsw and vice versa when c zup t t decreases to a level below ccr based on the analyses of russo et al 2015 the value of ccr was adopted here 2 5 implementation meteorological data collected in the yassur orchard provided data of rainfall rates and amounts as well as daily mean temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation that were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration et0 t using penman monteith method potential evapotranspiration rates εtp t were estimated from the et0 t data using the time dependent crop coefficients actually used in the yassur site assuming that the wetted soil surface area of the windrows is completely covered by the trees canopy a negligibly small soil evaporation rate εp t i e τp t ετp t was adopted for the surface area of the windrows the maximization iterative mi approach suggested by neuman et al 1975 and implemented in 3 d spatially heterogeneous flow domains by russo 1998 was used to implement water uptake by the trees roots the latter in turn determines the actual transpiration rate τa t for the soil surface area between the windrows outside the rooted zone assuming that τp t is negligibly small i e εp t ετp t actual rates of water loss by evaporation εa t were implemented by a similar mi approach for more details see russo et al 2006 starting at the beginning of the irrigation season may 1st for each of the aforementioned management schemes flow and transport simulations proceeded for a period of three successive years using a sequence of irrigation rainfall and potential evapotranspiration records from the year 2018 as a surrogate for the extended period annual cumulative depths of irrigation rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were 750 mm 595 mm and 1067 mm respectively in schemes iii and v irrigations were applied every day while in schemes i ii and vi irrigations were applied every two days in scheme iv irrigations were applied in pulses the concentrations c0k of chloride k 1 sodium k 2 and calcium k 3 in the irrigation waters were c0k 12 5 6 3 and 6 2 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively for the tww and c0k 8 6 1 5 and 7 1 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively for the fw and c0k 0 42 0 3 and 0 12 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively for the dsw in the rainfall water their concentrations were c0k 1 5 0 4 and 1 1 meq ℓ for k 1 2 3 respectively the values of the sodium adsorption ratio sar c02 c03 2 for the treated waste fresh desalinized and rainfall waters are sar 3 6 0 83 1 22 and 0 54 meq ℓ 1 2 respectively appropriate initial conditions for the present analyses were created by considering measured water content and solutes concentrations profiles obtained prior to the irrigation season for the flow second type upper boundary condition was imposed on the top boundary x1 0 with flux that is determined by the time dependent irrigation and rainfall fluxes associated with entry zone whose size vary between the irrigation and the rainfall seasons and by the time dependent potential evaporation flux a unit head gradient boundary was specified at the bottom boundary x1 l1 for the transport first type upper boundary condition was imposed on the top boundary with inlet concentrations c0k k 1 3 that vary between the irrigation and the rainfall seasons a zero gradient boundary was specified at the bottom boundary 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical profiles of the flow controlled attributes the results of the numerical simulations are expressed in terms of the vertical profiles of the horizontally averaged mean value μ μ x1 and standard deviation sd σ σ x1 of selected flow controlled attributes i e 3a μ x 1 0 l 3 a 0 l 2 a f x 1 x

extents of the averaging domain along the x2 and the x3 axes respectively notice that the averaging domain used for the calculations of μ x1 and σ x1 which is the inner core of the horizontal plane of the flow domain l2a l3a in size consists of two adjacent windrows each planted with one trees row and each row includes three trees each windrow is irrigated with a set of two drip line laterals located along both sides of the trees row as described in section 2 1 in other words the averaging domain used to produce the profiles presented in figs 1 5 took into account the spatial configuration of the irrigation system and the trees the spatial variability of the relevant soil properties and the flow controlled attributes and the spatial pattern of trees roots profiles of the mean value μ x1 and the standard deviation σ x1 of the water content the oxygen availability coefficient the chloride concentration and the sar in the soil solution and the relative hydraulic conductivity at a given time during the irrigation season of the second year just after an irrigation event are depicted in figs 1 5 respectively results depict for the management schemes tested in the yassur orchard a and for the proposed schemes b notice that in order to increase the resolution in the upper part of the soil profile only the upper half of its vertical extent is presented in these figures furthermore the trends shown in these figures maintain during the third year this stems from the fact that the sequence of irrigation rainfall and potential evapotranspiration records from year 2018 were used as a surrogate for the subsequent years furthermore the distinct rainy period during the winter with significant amounts of water 595 mm substantially enhances water flow and solute transport below the root zone see fig 11 below consequently at end of the second year the flow system is essentially brought to its state prior to the second irrigation season fig 1 shows that as expected in comparison with the reference case ref the schemes associated with the aeration trenches tuf tufp and saop substantially reduce the mean value of the water content θ in the upper part of the soil profile and significantly increase its sd furthermore fig 1 shows that compared with the reference case ref the water based scheme fw and even more so the proposed water based scheme adw slightly decrease the mean value of θ and increase its sd in the upper part of the root zone this stems from the reduced soil salinity associated with the fw scheme and particularly with the adw scheme see fig 3 below and the interaction between soil salinity water uptake by the trees roots and soil water content notice that the results depicted in fig 1 for the reference case ref and the tuf and the fw schemes are in qualitative agreement with the observations in the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 as expected the effect of the different schemes on the water content decreases significantly at soil depths below the root zone regarding the rainfall seasons the results of our analyses not shown here suggest that the trends depicted in fig 1 exist also during the rainfall seasons this happens in spite that characteristics of the conditions imposed on the soil surface during the latter season differ significantly from their counterparts that prevail during the irrigation season during the rainfall seasons the water flux is imposed on the entire soil surface the duration of the storm events and the time interval between successive storms are time dependent and the chloride concentration in the rainfall water is very low fig 2 shows the horizontally averaged mean and sd profiles of the water content dependent oxygen availability coefficient γ γ θ x t this coefficient 0 γ 1 quantifies the effect of soil aeration i e the ability of the soil to supply oxygen to the roots on the water uptake by the trees roots fig 2 suggests that as expected in the case of the reference case ref relatively poor soil aeration in the upper part of the soil profile and insufficient supply of oxygen to the roots may reduce the rate of the water uptake substantially this result is in qualitative agreement with the results of assouline and narkis 2013 as compared with the ref case the water based scheme fw and even more so the proposed water based scheme adw slightly improve the soil aeration at the upper part of the root zone in addition as expected relative to the reference case the soil substrate based management scheme that represents the treatment examined in the yassur experiment tuf and the proposed soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop substantially improve the soil aeration in the upper part of the soil profile it should be emphasized that the effect of the soil substrate based management schemes on the soil aeration at the upper part of the root zone generally persists during the rainfall seasons fig 3 demonstrates that for all schemes examined at a given soil depth the solute concentration sd values are in the same order of magnitude as the concentration mean values the substantial sd values reflect the considerable range of concentration values about the concentration mean value at a given soil depth the latter in turn stems from the spatial distribution of the irrigation flux imposed on the soil surface the 3 d pattern of the trees roots the spatial distribution of relevant soil properties and consequently the spatial distribution of the flow controlled attributes that affect water uptake notice that in the case of the reference case ref in the upper part of the windrows midway between the two adjacent drip line laterals the chloride concentration may exceed the value of 60 meq ℓ not shown here this salt accumulation zone is typical to clay soils like the local soil in the yassur orchard irrigated with drip irrigation system the local soil is associated with relatively low saturated conductivity and appreciable capillary forces table 1 which in turn may lead to appreciable lateral pressure head gradients and concurrently to appreciable lateral solute mass fluxes the latter in turn may substantially increase the interaction between the adjacent drip line laterals leading to salt accumulation zone midway between the drip line laterals in each of the windrows as expected the use of aeration trenches with significantly coarser soil material schemes saop and particularly tuf and tufp reduces the lateral extent of the salt accumulation zone and its concentration peak the use of less saline irrigation water schemes fw and particularly adw achieves similar results these trends are clearly demonstrated in fig 3 this figure shows that relative to the reference case ref the schemes that represent the treatments carried out in the yassur experiment tuf and fw reduce the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil profile these results are in qualitative agreement with the observations in the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 among the proposed management schemes as expected the water based scheme adw substantially reduced the horizontally averaged mean and sd of the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil profile on the contrary the soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop perform slightly worse than the tuf scheme this is expected inasmuch as in the upper part of the soil profile the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the water content and consequently of the vertical velocity associated with the tufp and the saop schemes are lower than their counterparts associated with the tuf scheme fig 1 fig 3 shows that although the effect of the different management schemes on the chloride concentration decreases with increasing depth it persists to a relatively deep soil layers far below the root zone particularly in response to the water based schemes during the rainfall seasons the spatial and the temporal distribution of the chloride concentrations in the upper part of the soil profile is determined by the series of the rainfall events with very low chloride concentration imposed on the entire soil surface the results of our analyses not shown here suggest that as expected during the rainfall seasons the effect of the water based schemes fw and particularly adw on the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil diminishes with increasing time on the contrary the soil substrate based schemes tuf tufp and particularly saop reduce the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the chloride concentration in the upper part of the soil profile regarding the deep soil layers far below the root zone the results of our analyses suggest that the effect of the different schemes particularly the water based schemes on the horizontally averaged mean value and sd of the chloride concentrations depicted in fig 3 persists during the rainfall seasons also fig 4 shows the horizontally averaged mean and sd profiles of the soil solution sar sar x t notice that the relatively large sar values at soil depths below x1 1 5 m are in agreement with the initial sar profile below the windrows depth x1 0 5 m because of the relatively low sar values in the irrigation waters sodium with less affinity for the exchange complex is exchanged by the preferentially adsorbed calcium consequently the vertical position of the na ca exchange front increases slowly with time resulting in relatively low sar values in the upper part of the soil profile particularly within the windrows i e for x1 0 5 m considering the management schemes that represent the treatments carried out in the yassur experiment the tuf and fw schemes first fig 4 shows that relative to the reference case ref both the tuff scheme and particularly the fw scheme reduce both the mean value and the sd of the sar in the upper part of the soil profile this is expected in view of the lower sar of the irrigation water associated with the fw scheme notice that the mean sar profiles depicted in fig 4 for the reference state ref and the fw scheme are in qualitative agreement with the results of assouline and narkis 2011 fig 4 also shows that the proposed water based scheme adw performs similar to its counterpart the fw scheme while the proposed soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop perform similar to their counterpart the tuf scheme furthermore fig 4 suggests that although the effect of the management schemes on the soil solution sar decreases with soil depth it persists to a considerable soil depth far below the root zone notice that in the case of the reference case ref the soil solution sar in the upper part of each of the windrows midway between the two adjacent drip line laterals may exceed the value of 5 meq ℓ 1 2 this sodium accumulation zone is similar to the salt accumulation zone discussed earlier however because of the nonlinearity of the na ca exchange isotherm which in turn increases with increasing sar and decreasing chloride concentration c russo et al 2004 the rate at which the sodium accumulation zone is developed is substantially slower as compared with the rate at which the salt accumulation zone is developed during the rainfall seasons the effect of the management schemes on the soil solution sar in the upper part of the soil profile is blur by the rainfall events at relatively deep soil layers far below the root zone however the effect of the schemes particularly the water based schemes on the soil solution sar persists during the rainfall season the clayey soil of yassur is characterized by a significant specific surface area and consequently by substantial ss sm interactions whose magnitude increases with increasing sar and decreasing c in the soil solution the latter may change the soil psd substantially and consequently may reduce the soil hydraulic conductivity considerably e g russo and bresler 1977a 1977b russo 1988 fig 5 shows the horizontally averaged mean and sd profiles of the relative hydraulic conductivity kr c sar ψ x k c sar ψ x k ψ x addressing the schemes that represent the treatments examined in the yassur experiment first fig 5 shows that the water based scheme fw performed similar to the reference case ref while the soil substrate based scheme tuf slightly increases the relative hydraulic conductivity kr in the upper part of the root zone notice that the latter results contradict the results of assouline and narkis 2011 see their fig 2 this disagreement can be explained based on the disparity between the ion concentrations of the irrigation waters associated with their analyses the acre site and those associated with our analyses the yassur site in both sites the fw and the tww have similar sar values 0 8 and 3 6 meq ℓ 1 2 respectively while their salinity is significantly higher in the yassur site ccl 8 6 and 12 5 meq ℓ respectively as compared with ccl 2 0 and 6 2 meq ℓ respectively in the acre site in other words in contrast with the yassur site the salinity of the tww in the acre site is not high enough to compensate for the adverse effects of higher sar on the soil hydraulic conductivity furthermore the results of assouline and narkis 2011 expressed in terms of the profiles of ks rather than in terms of the horizontally averaged profiles of the pressure head dependent relative conductivity kr kr ψ x1 t fig 5 are based only on two disturbed samples at a given soil depth regarding the proposed management schemes fig 5 shows that as expected the proposed water based scheme adw which substantially reduces the chloride concentration in the upper part of the root zone but only slightly reduces its sar significantly reduces kr in the upper part of the root zone fig 5 also shows that the effect of the proposed soil substrate based schemes saop and the tufp on kr is similar to the effect of their counterpart the tuf scheme furthermore fig 5 suggests that below the depth of the root zone the effect of the management schemes on kr decreases with increasing soil depth regarding the irrigation of orchards planted on clayey soil with treated waste water tww and fresh water fw the results of our simulations presented in figs 1 5 suggest that as compared with irrigation with fw irrigation with tww may lead to significant changes in soil indices i e an increase in soil salinity and consequently a decrease in soil aeration and an increase in the soil solution sar these results are in qualitative agreement with the results of recent field studies e g lado et al 2012 assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 paudel et al 2018 tarchitzki et al 2019 3 2 long term behavior of the hydraulic conductivity fig 5 showed that the most substantial effects of the ss sm interactions on the hydraulic conductivity occur in vicinity of the soil surface the temporal dependence of the horizontally averaged mean value of the relative hydraulic conductivity kr c sar ψ x at the top 0 05 m soil layer are depicted in fig 6 clearly the mean kr exhibits time dependency attributed to the temporal changes in the soil solution concentration and composition and the water content the latter in turn are attributed to the time dependent forcing conditions imposed on the soil surface the results depicted in fig 6 are in agreement with the results of the analyses of russo et al 2015 considering a citrus orchard planted on a structured clay soil associated with a high water table and irrigated with tww and fw addressing the schemes that represent the treatments carried out in the yassur experiment ref tuf and fw first fig 6a demonstrates the limited decrease in the mean kr during the irrigation seasons associated with relatively concentrated soil solution and the more substantial decrease in the mean kr during the rainfall seasons associated with more diluted soil solution the reference case ref and the water based scheme fw lead to a similar temporal pattern with slightly smaller values of kr in the case of fw on the contrary the soil substrate based scheme tuf restrains the decrease in the kr values particularly during the rainfall seasons among the proposed management schemes fig 6b as expected the water based scheme adw which relies on alternating of the irrigation water quality between tww and dsw leads to a periodic behavior of the kr values during the irrigation seasons the lowest amplitude values of the periodic kr values during these seasons are substantially lower than their counterparts associated with the reference case ref during the rainfall seasons however as expected the two schemes lead to a similar temporal pattern of the kr values furthermore as expected the soil substrate based proposed schemes tufp and saop perform very similar to the tuf scheme the cyclic behavior of the mean kr depicted in fig 6a b is in agreement with the results reported by russo et al 2015 considering a citrus orchard planted on a structured clay soil associated with a high water table irrigated with tww and fw this cyclic behavior suggests that the considerable reduction in the soil hydraulic conductivity during the rainfall periods recovers during the irrigation periods the reversible cyclic behavior may persist as long as the soil exchangeable sodium percentage esp f c sar does not exceed a soil dependent threshold value espc e g espc 15 shainberg and kaiserman 1969 for esp espc a breakdown of the clay particle domains and the subsequent relocation of the clay particles may lead to a continuous decrease in the soil hydraulic conductivity and eventually to an unrecoverable situation in which most of the soil surface is essentially sealed the fact that the value of espc value was not reached during the period of three years considered in the present study see the sar profiles in fig 4 is expected in view of the values of c and sar associated with tww and particularly with the fresh water the fw scheme furthermore fig 6 a suggests that the effect of both irrigation waters tww with larger c and sar and consequently larger soil esp as compared with fw on the mean kr at the top 0 05 m of the soil is similar this stems from the fact that larger c may compensate in part for the adverse effects of larger sar and consequently of larger soil esp on the soil hydraulic conductivity 3 3 root zone flow regime and water uptake by the trees roots regarding the soil substrate based management schemes which make use of aeration trenches filled with relatively coarse textured soil material as indicated earlier section 1 the results of the yassur experiment suggested that the tuff filled trenches only slightly improve water uptake by the trees roots this finding is attribute to the rapid decrease in the hydraulic conductivity as the water content of the tuff soil decreases it is important therefore to analyze the effect of the soil substrate based management schemes on the temporal variations of the flow controlled attributes that affect water uptake by the trees roots in the most active part of the root zone following russo et al 2005 the vertical position of the centroid of the soil volume from which most of the water is extracted by plant roots zup t given by 4 below is adopted here as a characteristic vertical length scale of the active root zone i e 4a z up t 1 w u t x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 0 l r 0 t s w x τ d τ x 1 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 where s w x t is the daily average rate of water uptake by plant roots and wu t is the volume of water extracted by the plant roots till time t given by 4b w u t x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 0 l r 0 t s w x τ dτ d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 notice that the rate of water uptake by the trees roots sw x t equation 2 and concurrently s w x t and zup t are affected by the spatial and the temporal distribution of the water content i e soil aeration pressure head and solute concentration the latter in turn depend on the spatial and the temporal distribution of the soil hydraulic properties on the conditions imposed on the upper boundary of the flow domain and on the initial conditions equation 4 with lr 0 5 m was evaluated over the inner core of the horizontal plane of the flow domain i e x 2 x 2 10 5 m and x 3 x 3 7 6 m which includes six trees and over the irrigation season of the second year the resultant time average values of zup t are zup zup t 0 12 0 13 and 0 24 m for the ref fw and the tuf management schemes respectively and zup 0 10 0 15 and 0 14 m for the proposed schemes tupp saop and adw respectively in other words increasing irrigation water quality led to a slightly deeper active root zone while aeration furrows with coarser soil texture led to a substantially deeper active root zone notice that as expected the pulse irrigation the tufp scheme led to a considerably shallower active root zone the relatively large value of zup associated with the tuff filled aeration trenches the tuf scheme suggests that in this case water uptake by the trees roots takes place also from the local soil below the aeration trenches this attributes to the very weak capillary forces of the tuff material table 1 and consequently to the rapid decrease in water content and hydraulic conductivity with decreasing soil water pressure this is not the case in the other schemes associated with aeration trenches i e saop and in particular tufp taking into consideration the sink term representing the rate of water uptake by the plant roots equation 2 in the following mean values of the flow controlled attributes on the right hand side of 2 i e vi ψ x t c x t k x t and γ x t for i 1 4 respectively are evaluated at zup by averaging vi x2k x3k zup t over the trees in the inner core of the flow domain here x2k and x3k k 1 to np are the coordinate locations of the k th tree at the soil surface and np 6 fig 7 a b show the temporal changes in the mean values of the pressure head and the chloride concentration at zup ψ zup t and c zup t respectively during the daylight hours after an irrigation event notice that the origin t 0 in fig 7 and also in figs 8 and 9 below corresponds to july 1st 60days after the start of the irrigation season the irrigation event started at t 0 and ceased at t 0 095d and t 0 19d for the 1 day and the 2 day irrigation intervals respectively results are depicted for the reference management scheme ref and for the original tuf and the proposed tufp and saop soil substrate based management schemes and for original fw and the proposed adw water based management schemes fig 7a shows that in the case of the reference case ref ψ zup t decreases with increasing time at a rate that initially increases with time reaches a maximum at time t tmax1 before the time corresponding to midday t05 0 55d and then decreases slowly with increasing t here tmax1 is the time at which max dψ zup t dt occurs considering the soil substrate based schemes first in the case of the tuf scheme since zup is located in the vicinity of the bottom of the aeration trench the ψ zup t associated with the tuf scheme exhibits temporal behavior similar to the ref scheme with relatively lower more negative values fig 7a shows that as compared with the ref and the tuf schemes the proposed management schemes saop and in particular tufp lead to substantially higher values of ψ zup t which in turn decrease with increasing time at a substantially slower rate regarding the water based schemes fig 7a shows that as compared with the reference case the water based management schemes fw and in particular adw lead to lower values of ψ zup t the gap between ψ zup t associated with the different schemes increases with increasing time furthermore as compared with the ref case the water based management schemes fw and in particular adw lead to larger values of tmax1 fig 7b shows that in the case of the ref case c zup t increases with increasing time t at a rate that initially for t t05 increases with t reaches a maximum at tmax2 before t05 and then decreases slowly with increasing t here tmax2 is the time at which max dc zup t dt occurs the c zup t associated with the tuf scheme exhibits a similar temporal behavior with substantially lower values fig 7b shows that as expected the proposed tufp scheme leads to a cyclic behavior of c zup t with a range of values comparable with its counterpart associated with the ref case on the contrary as compared with the ref case the proposed saop scheme initially when t t05 leads to a substantially lower c zup t values which in turn increase considerably in the vicinity of t05 and for t t05 converge to values slightly lower than those of its counterpart associated with the ref case fig 7b also shows that as compared with the ref case the water based schemes fw and particularly adw lead to substantially lower c zup t values and larger values of tmax2 fig 7a b demonstrate that as expected under frequent irrigations in all schemes examined the contribution of the pressure head to the total pressure head of the soil solution is rather small the latter is controlled mainly by the osmotic pressure head of the soil solution which in turn is linearly related to the chloride concentration in the soil solution fig 8a b show the temporal changes in the mean values of the soil hydraulic conductivity k zup t and the oxygen availability coefficient γ zup t during the daylight hours in the irrigation season for the same schemes as in fig 7 regarding the soil substrate based schemes first fig 8a shows that as compared with the ref case the k zup t associated with the tuf scheme is smaller by an order of magnitude a gap that further increases with increasing time t furthermore fig 8a shows the substantial increase in k zup t when a pulse irrigation is combined with the tuff filled aeration trenches the tufp scheme and particularly when the aeration trenches are filled with a soil material whose texture is finer and in turn does not require irrigation in pulses the saop scheme regarding the water based schemes fig 8a shows that the k zup t associated with the fw scheme exhibits similar temporal behavior as its counterpart associated with the ref case on the contrary the adw scheme leads to substantially lower values of k zup t as compared with the ref case fig 8b shows that in the ref case after the cessation of an irrigation event γ zup t is relatively small indicating relatively poor soil aeration and restricted oxygen supply to the trees roots as time increases and water uptake starts with a peak around midday t05 water content in the active root zone decreases and concurrently γ zup t increases with increasing time indicating an improved oxygen supply to the trees roots regarding the soil substrate based schemes in the case of the tuff filled aeration trenches the tuf scheme because in this case water extraction by the roots takes place also from the soil beneath the aeration trenches the γ zup t associated with the tuf scheme likewise its counterpart associated with the ref case indicates a relatively poor aeration just after the end of the irrigation notice that initially when t t05 γ zup t associated with the tuf scheme recovers with time slower than its counterpart associated with the ref case while the opposite is true for t t05 fig 8b also shows that for both of the suggested schemes tufp and saop γ zup t remains unity during the entire daylight hours suggesting that in these cases oxygen availability does not limit water uptake by the trees roots at all furthermore fig 8b shows that as compared with the ref case as expected fig 7a b the water based schemes fw for t t0 5 and particularly adw for the entire daylight time lead to a larger γ zup t values indicating a better supply of oxygen to the trees roots in a qualitative agreement with the results of assouline and narkis 2013 figs 7 and 8 clearly demonstrate the effect of the management schemes on the temporal variations of flow controlled attributes that affect water uptake by the trees roots in the most active part of the root zone these figures suggest that in the case of the ref case adverse effects due to soil salinity and soil aeration which in turn are interrelated are the main factors that restrict the rate of water uptake by the trees roots while the soil hydraulic conductivity is of a lesser significance in the case of the soil substrate based tuf scheme in which the adverse effects of the osmotic potential of the soil solution reduce substantially the very low hydraulic conductivity associated with the tuff material is the major factor that restricts the rate of water uptake by the trees roots poor soil aeration also might reduce the rate of water uptake particularly during the first few hours after the cession of an irrigation event in the case of the proposed soil substrate based schemes tufp and saop soil aeration is not a limiting factor while soil salinity particularly in the case of the tufp scheme might be a factor that restricts the rate of water uptake by the trees roots on the contrary the substantially higher hydraulic conductivity particularly in the case of the saop scheme might increase the rate of water uptake by the trees roots relative to the ref case the water based schemes fw and particularly adw reduce the adverse effects due to soil salinity and soil aeration the favorable effect of the adw scheme however may be compensate in part by the decrease in the soil hydraulic conductivity fig 8a the latter is attributed to the decrease in water content or pressure head fig 7a and to the relatively low soil solution chloride concentration fig 7b which in turn magnify the effect of the ss sm interactions to reduce the soil hydraulic conductivity fig 9 depicts the temporal changes in the rate of the water uptake by the trees roots during the daylight hours evaluated at x1 zup taking into account the np trees in the inner core of the flow domain i e wur t zup np sw x2k x3k zup t here sw x t is given by equation 2 x2k and x3k k 1 to np are the coordinate locations of the k th tree at the soil surface and np 6 clearly the combined trends depicted in figs 7 and 8 manifest themselves in fig 9 regarding the soil substrate based schemes first fig 9 clearly demonstrates the advantage of using a pulse irrigation in combination with the tuff filled aeration trenches the tufp scheme and in particular of using aeration trenches filled with a soil material of a finer texture that does not require a pulse irrigation the saop scheme the tufp scheme increases the water uptake rate at several times throughout the daylight hours including near the peak of the potential transpiration while the saop scheme increases water uptake rate near the peak of the potential transpiration fig 9 also shows that as expected decreasing soil solution concentration by irrigation with water of better quality the fw scheme or in particular by alternating irrigation water quality between tww and dsw the adw scheme may lead to an increase in the rate of the water uptake by the trees roots the results depicted in fig 9 suggest that in the latter case the favorable effects of the adw scheme lower soil salinity and consequently better soil aeration figs 7a and 8 b prevail over its unfavorable effect lower hydraulic conductivity fig 8a the aforementioned trends are further demonstrate in fig 10 which depicts the relative transpiration rate τr t τa t τp t where τa t sw x1 x2 x3 t dx1dx2dx3 is the actual transpiration rate and τp t is the potential transpiration rate the results in fig 10 are depicted for an irrigation period of 120d during the second year for the original top and the proposed bottom management schemes notice that the pattern of the τr t functions associated with the different schemes depicted in fig 10 persists during the irrigation season of the third year notice also that in the reference case ref the cumulative water uptake during the irrigation season obtained by integration of the pertinent τr t function in fig 10 over time does not exceed 52 of the cumulative potential transpiration during that period fig 10 shows that relative to the ref case the management schemes that represent the treatments examined in the yassur experiment tuf and fw moderately improve the water extraction by the trees roots during the irrigation season by 9 5 and 12 3 respectively these results are in relatively good agreement with their counterparts measured at the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 in contrast the proposed soil substrate based management schemes the pulse irrigation combined with the tuff filled aeration trenches and in particular the aeration trenches filled with soil material of finer texture that does not require irrigation in pulses the saop scheme substantially improve the rate of water uptake by the trees roots during the irrigation season by 28 4 and 35 2 respectively in addition the advantage of the proposed water based management scheme adw which alternates the irrigation water quality between tww and dsw according to the soil salinity at zup is apparent relative to the ref case the adw scheme increases the rate of water uptake by the trees roots during the irrigation season by 20 5 requiring the substitution of 40 of the cumulative volume of tww by dsw 3 4 water drainage and chloride leaching important attributes related to groundwater contamination and or salinization are the longitudinal vertical components of the water volume flux vector qw1 x t and the solute mass flux vector qs1 x t given by qw1 x t k x t ψ x t x1 1 and qs1 x t j 1 3 d1j c x t x1 qw1 x t c x t respectively monitored at a given horizontal control plane cp located far enough below the root zone here d1j is the longitudinal components of the pore scale dispersion tensor dij i j 1 3 see eq a3 in appendix a mean water volume flux qw1 l t and mean chloride mass flux qs1 l t crossing a horizontal cp located at soil depth l 2 5 m are depicted in fig 11 for a sequence of three years including irrigation and rainfall seasons the mean fluxes are determined by integrating the longitudinal components of the water volume flux qw1 x t and the solute mass flux qs1 x t vectors respectively over the inner core of the horizontal cp i e qw1 l t qw1 x1 l x2x3 t dx2dx3 aic and qs1 l t qs1 x1 l x2x3 t dx2dx3 aic respectively where aic is the horizontal cross section of the inner core given by aic l2a l3a fig 11a b clearly demonstrate the seasonal effect on both qw1 l t and qs1 l t which in turn are highly correlated during the irrigation events relativly concentrted solution invades the flow system through a portion of the soil surface in the proximaty of the trees where most of the water uptake takes place on the contrary during the rainfall events relatively diluted solution enters the flow system through the entire soil surface consequently regions far from the trees which in turn are associated with negligibly small water uptake are more affected by the local high conductance preferential flow paths in the heterogeneous soil and thus enhance water flow and solute transport below the root zone furthermore it is clearly shown in fig 11a b that the effect of the management schemes on qs1 l t and particularly on qw1 l t is masked during the rainfall seasons fig 11a shows that the mean water volume flux qw1 l t far below the root zone is affected by the management schemes particularly during the irrigation seasons as compared with the ref case the soil substrate based schemes tuf and tufp and to a lesser extent saop increase qw1 l t this is expected in view of the relatively high hydraulic conductivity associated with the soil substrate based schemes during the irrigation and the rainfall events on the contrary the water based schemes fw and particularly adw decrease qw1 l t this is expected in view of the enhanced rate of water uptake by the trees roots associated with these schemes figs 9 and 10 and consequently the decrease in water content fig 1 and concurrently in the water content dependent soil hydraulic conductivity notice that in the case of the adw scheme the decrease in the soil solution chloride concentration fig 3 which in turn magnify the effect of the ss sm interactions on the soil hydraulic conductivity fig 5 further decreases qw1 x t and concurrently qw1 l t after a period of three years for the soil substrate based tuf tufp and saop schemes and the water based fw and adw schemes the cumulative volumes of water drained below the horizontal cp located at l 2 5 m are 1 14 1 13 1 05 0 97 and 0 92 respectively of their counterpart associated with the reference case fig 11b shows that the mean chloride mass flux qs1 l t far below the root zone is affected by the soil management schemes as compared with ref case the soil substrate based schemes saop tuf and particularly tufp increase slightly qs1 l t this is expected in view of the effect of the soil substrate based schemes on qw1 l t on the contrary the water based schemes fw and particularly adw substantially decrease qs1 l t this is also expected in view of the effect of the water based schemes on qw1 l t and the lower solute concentrations associated with these schemes entering the flow system during the irrigation events after a period of three years for the soil substrate based tuf tufp and saop schemes and the water based fw and adw schemes the cumulative masses of chloride leached through the horizontal cp located at l 2 5 m are 1 051 1 063 1 02 0 81 and 0 60 respectively of their counterpart associated with the reference case 4 summary and concluding remarks a physically based water flow and solute transport model that takes into account the interaction between the fluid and the soil is used to simulate flow and transport in a realistic three dimensional spatially heterogeneous flow system representing an avocado orchard planted on a clayey soil and irrigated with treated waste water tww the simulations conducted for three consecutive years including rainfall during the winter and irrigations throughout the rest of the year the main findings of this study summarize as follows i the long term effect of irrigation with tww on the response of the flow system is attribute to the salinity of the tww and not to its sodium adsorption ratio sar ii the water based management schemes fw and particularly the proposed adw reduce soil salinity and concurrently increase the rate of water uptake by the trees roots decrease soil water content and increase soil aeration consequently over an irrigation season the fw and the adw schemes increase water uptake by the trees roots by 12 3 and 20 5 respectively relative to the reference ref case furthermore relative to the reference case for a period of three years the water based schemes fw and particularly adw decrease the cumulative volume of water drained by 3 and 8 respectively and to a larger extent decrease the cumulative mass of chloride leached by 19 and 40 respectively far below the root zone iii the soil substrate based management tuf scheme reduces soil salinity but may fail to maintain the water fluxes in the active root zone required to meet the transpiration demand consequently over an irrigation season the tuf scheme only slightly increases water uptake by the trees roots by 9 5 relative to the ref case furthermore the tuf scheme increases the cumulative volume of water drained and to a lesser extent increases cumulative mass of chloride leached relatively far below the root zone by 14 and 5 respectively relative to the ref case iv the proposed soil substrate based management schemes tufp and particularly saop designed to overcome the drawbacks of the tuf scheme substantially improve water fluxes and soil aeration in the active root zone consequently over an irrigation season both schemes substantially increase water uptake by the trees roots by 28 4 and 35 4 respectively relative to the reference case furthermore relative to the tuf scheme the tupp scheme essentially does not affect the cumulative volume of water drained far below the root zone on the contrary the saop scheme reduces the cumulative volume of water drained and to a lesser extent reduces the cumulative mass of chloride leached far below the root zone by 9 2 and 3 respectively the findings of this study are explained by the effect of the irrigation water salinity on the soil salinity by the mutual relationships between soil salinity soil water content soil aeration and water extraction by the plant roots and their effect on water volume fluxes and solute mass fluxes below the root zone and by the relationships between the soil texture and the response of the flow system to the water sources i e irrigation flux at the soil surface and sinks i e rate of water uptake by the plant roots imposed on the flow system we would like to emphasize that finding i of this study is restricted to cases in which the salinity of the tww is high enough to reduce water uptake by the plant roots and to compensate for the adverse effects of the relatively high sar of the tww on the soil hydraulic conductivity this is the case in the mizra site analyzed by russo et al 2015 but probably not in the case in the acre site analyzed by assouline and narkis 2011 finding ii restricted to the fw scheme and finding iii of this study are in agreement with the results from the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 before conclusion we would like to emphasize that the results of this study rely on physically based numerical simulations of flow and transport the latter in turn provide detailed information that generally is not attainable in practice from physical experiments on the consequences of soil crop irrigation and meteorological characteristics for water flow and transport of interacting solutes under relatively realistic conditions the findings of this study however are restricted to a particular sitespecific application with given characteristics of the soil crop weather irrigation system and the irrigation waters furthermore the results presented here are limited by the simplifying assumptions engaged in the present study see russo et al 2005 russo 2013 and russo et al 2015 most significant are the reliance on a single realization approach a rigorous analysis of the assumptions employed here however is beyond the limited scope of this study based on russo et al 2006 we may conclude that the single realization approach might be sufficiently accurate to indicate appropriate trends furthermore the qualitative agreement between the results of this study and the results from the yassur experiment tarchitzki et al 2019 are encouraging we believe that the scope of this study is timely and relevant to regions throughout the world in which declining water resources impose usage of low quality water for irrigation the present study should be considered as an application of well established methodologies it is based on previous studies e g russo et al 2005 2015 russo 2013 and relies on powerful tools i e 3 d numerical codes of water flow and solute transport in variably saturated spatially heterogeneous

functions of the pressure head the concentration and the composition of the soil solution and the spatial coordinate vector x the approach adopted in this study to quantify the cips is based on the theoretical framework developed in the past russo and bresler 1977b bresler 1987 russo 1988 and is described in details in russo et al 2004 and russo 2013 the measurable macroscopic spatially heterogeneous soil properties required to quantify the cips are the soil bulk density the soil cation exchange capacity the soil specific surface area and the constitutive relationships for unsaturated flow in a rigid stable reference state following russo et al 2004 and russo 2013 it is assumed here that water flow is described locally by the 3 d richards equation the physical parameters of which are viewed as realizations of 3 d second order stationary random space functions characterized completely by a constant mean and a two point spatial covariance it is further assumed that the transport of each of the ions of the mixed na ca salt is described locally by the classical one region 3 d advection dispersion equation ade when the ions in the soil solution interact with the soil matrix the properties of the spatially heterogeneous soil that affect the flow and the transport are expressed as functions of the spatial coordinate vector x the pressure head

the mixed form of richards equation governing flow in a three dimensional domain a1 was approximated by a fully implicit euler scheme with a truncation error of o δt δx1 2 δx2 2 δx3 2 this scheme is convergent and unconditionally stable for the linear diffusion equation it has been found appropriate for flow problems in highly heterogeneous porous media in which both steep gradients and saturated regions can be developed the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations with respect to the pressure head ψ is solved iteratively by applying the so called modified picard method celia et al 1990 picard external iterations are applied for both capillary and gravity terms and the resulting system of linear algebraic equations is solved by the polynomial preconditioned conjugate gradient ppcg method e g hageman and young 1981 the hydraulic conductivity between the numerical cells the so called inter block conductivity employed in the solution was estimated by means of a modified version of the asymptotic weighting scheme proposed by zaidel and russo 1992 the modified scheme avoids the smearing of steep wetting fronts and does not create oscillations for gravity dominated flow and therefore is appropriate for flow problems in highly heterogeneous combined flow systems associated with steep gradients and or saturated regions to account for irrigation by drippers the iterative procedure described in russo et al 2006 was employed in order to determine the size of the time dependent ponding area that may develop around the drippers at the soil surface during an irrigation event the iterative procedure continues until a prescribed error tolerance is met or until the number of iterations has exceeded a predetermined limit the numerical scheme employed for the solution of eq a2 was design to minimize numerical dispersion for advection dominated transport problems similar to the third order total variation diminishing tvd scheme implemented in the mt3d code

determination of the soil parameters for the aeration trenches given the objective of maximizing water uptake by the trees roots the desired soil material of the aeration trenches should maintain

place this means a soil material with a relatively high conductance and significant capillary forces considering the parameters θs and θr as constants the determination of the three soil parameters pi
