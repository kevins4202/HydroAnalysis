16030,dam construction has a far reaching impact on trace metal accumulation and the metal induced quality of the aquatic environment however the long term impacts of dam construction and impoundments on the spatial distribution of trace metals and water quality remain poorly understood here we found that the concentrations of trace metals in the mainstream water of the world s largest reservoir three gorges reservoir tgr decreased after impoundment while their concentrations and contamination in the sediments of the water level fluctuation zone increased significantly especially for anthropogenic sources of metals such as cadmium lead and zinc the spatial and temporal variations of anthropogenic metals in the sediments revealed increased anthropogenic dominance in their distribution under current hydrological management especially for the urban area of the upper tgr sediment fluxes particle composition and extreme climate modulated the distribution of trace metals in the sediments the results demonstrate that human activities have increasingly determined the distribution and contamination state of trace metals in the mainstream tgr however in contrast to our previously thought the anthropogenic discharge of trace metals did not adversely affect water quality our results indicate that dam construction in riverine systems attenuates trace metal contamination in water through sediment sorting and deposition graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words trace metal contamination spatiotemporal variation sedimentary dynamics surface water fluvial sediments large reservoir 1 introduction dam construction can evidently modulate the accumulation distribution and transportation of trace metals in riverine systems by altering factors such as the flow velocity sediment discharge deposition retention and sorting nilsson et al 2005 grill et al 2015 wang et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 this can potentially affect water quality and human health in the catchment yang et al 2012 huang et al 2021 according to the international commission on large dams icold more than 58 000 large dams had been built on the world s major rivers by 2020 and 40 6 of dams in china is large dam the yangtze river is one of asia s largest rivers a large number of dams have been built in the upper yangtze river in the last few decades and more dams are under construction or being planned yang et al 2011 xu et al 2013 tian et al 2021 the three gorges dam tgd in the upper yangtze river is the world s largest hydroelectric dam and the construction of the tgd has posed a profound impact on material transfer and the aquatic environment in the three gorges reservoir tgr as well as downstream in the yangtze river feng et al 2014 he et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 one of the main characteristics of the tgr is the anti seasonal water level operation which features the lowest water level 145 m in the summer and wet seasons and the highest 175 m in the winter and dry seasons this results in a marked difference in the discharge of water and sediment into the reservoir relative to other flow managed and free flowing rivers tang et al 2018a grill et al 2019 moreover the anti seasonal water level operation forms a unique geomorphological unit of the water level fluctuation wlf zone which is characterized by a vertical height of 30 m and a total area of 349 km2 and is one of the main zones for sediment accumulation in the tgr bao et al 2015 specifically the impoundment stage in the winter and dry seasons can facilitate clear dispersal and deposition of sediments in the wlf zone relative to the recession stage in the summer and wet seasons which features a relatively higher duration frequency and magnitude of flooding although water recession may scour the riverbed and carry away a certain amount of sediment that was originally deposited at the impoundment stage the wlf zone tends to maintain a stable and relatively high sediment trapping rate tang et al 2016 2018b in addition to the variable sediment loads the special flow regime under dam operation also affects sediment sorting and thus modulates sediment redistribution in the wlf zone for example the preferential settling of coaster particles has been observed in backwater sections that have a relatively low flow velocity bing et al 2019a tang et al 2018b sediments are the predominant sinks of trace metals in rivers and their dynamics and fluxes determine the biological availability distribution and environmental accessibility of trace metals in aquatic environment to a large extent du laing et al 2009 baborowski et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 under annual cyclic exposure and inundation the wlf zone in the tgr mainstream faces many strong anthropogenic and natural disturbances such as secondary geological disasters soil erosion and tillage bao et al 2015 xu et al 2013 which may cause the migration of accumulated sediments from the wlf zone and increase the release of trace metals to the overlying water moreover sediment fluxes in the wlf zone are appreciably influenced by sediment management strategies in the tgr such as the cascade reservoirs that were constructed in the upper yangtze river sediment regulation policies and soil and water conservation projects in the catchment yang et al 2018 ren et al 2020 ren 2021 relative to the pre dam period the sediment input into the tgr decreased sharply from 2003 to 2012 and decreased further to approximately zero from 2013 to 2017 yang et al 2011 2014 dai et al 2014 tian et al 2021 this potentially determines the distribution and ecological risk of trace metals in the sediments gao et al 2019 bing et al 2019a in addition the ecological environmental and geomorphological conditions in the wlf zone of the tgr mainstream over the post dam period are still highly dynamic under the special flow regime and increasing anthropogenic disturbance bao et al 2015 which directly affects sediment dynamics and the metals associated with them a recent modeling study predicted that it would take 320 560 years to reach the sedimentation balance in the tgr under current water sediment conditions chen et al 2021 therefore a long term and continuous focus on trace metal contamination in sediments is necessary to control the water quality in the tgr anthropogenic disturbances along rivers are distinctly position dependent yet current frameworks or models of environmental impact assessment generally render all river reaches equally important irrespective of habitat suitability or local human influence xenopoulos and lodge 2006 grill et al 2015 which may cause uncertainty in the prediction of dam induced environmental impacts spatiotemporal information on trace metal contamination in riverine systems provides a proxy for anthropogenic disturbance because of its non degradation and toxicity to aquatic organisms and human health the contamination of trace metals in the aquatic environment of the tgr has been a concern since the construction of the tgd yang et al 2012 many previous studies have found that after the full operation of the tgr trace metals such as cd cr cu pb and zn in the water did not exceed the quality standards of drinking water and or surface water in china whereas the contamination of some metals such as cd pb and zn in the sediments reached a moderate or even high level bing et al 2016 gao et al 2016 lin et al 2020 meanwhile the spatial distribution of trace metals in the sediments has changed markedly with periodic flow management moreover the changes in geomorphological characteristics local human activities and sediment fluxes in the wlf zone have been regarded as the main drivers of spatial variations in trace metal distribution bing et al 2019a gao et al 2019 lin et al 2020 however the majority of these studies mainly consider either a short time scale i e one or two impoundment periods or the relatively small spatial scale as the study unit thereby overlooking the long term and large scale spatial variations in the contamination of trace metals in the water and or sediments at all phases of the dam s life as such the direction and magnitude of trace metal contamination in space and time as well as the underlying drivers are still unclear and deserve to be comprehensively explored in addition extreme climate and flooding in the upper basin of the yangtze river have become increasingly anomalous and more frequent in recent years li et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 this is believed to not only affect the river runoff and sediment transfer but also regulate the distribution and contamination of trace metals in the wlf zone of the tgr overall in terms of the global surge in dam construction grill et al 2015 zarfl et al 2015 it is of paramount importance to consider the spatial and temporal variations of trace metal contamination in the water and sediments of dammed rivers over the long term in order to improve aquatic quality this would also provide insights into the dynamics of trace metals in the water sediment system under long term and periodic flow management as well as extreme climate change in combination with other short term or single monitoring of trace metals in the water and or sediments of the tgr mainstream this study explored the impact of long term hydrological management with tgd construction on the dynamics of trace metals in the sediments and overlying water to achieve this the wlf zone in the entire mainstream of the tgr was selected to measure six trace metals including cd cr cu ni pb and zn in the water and sediments during 2014 2020 the main objectives were to 1 plumb the spatial and temporal variations in the distribution and contamination of trace metals in the water and sediments 2 identify the anthropogenic effects on the accumulation of trace metals by the spatiotemporal distribution and pb isotopic ratios and 3 decipher the effects of sedimentary dynamics on the variations in trace metals and aquatic environment quality we expected that local anthropogenic sources of trace metals would become increasingly dominant in the aquatic environment because of decreasing sediment inputs from the upper yangtze river as a result the increased trace metals might negatively affect the quality of the overlying water however the particle composition could play a vital role in regulating the contamination of trace metals in the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the region of the tgr 28 28 31 44 n 105 49 110 12 e covers the upper yangtze river between chongqing and yichang with a total water surface area of 1080 km2 and a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 at a water level of 175 m fu et al 2010 the study area spanned the entire mainstream of the tgr with a length of more than 660 km figure s1 the climate in the tgr region is mainly controlled by a humid subtropical monsoon with the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation of 16 19 c and 1000 1200 mm respectively there were three major types of bedrock in the study area purple and red rocks 74 carbonate 19 and other rocks 7 bao et al 2015 tang et al 2016 2 2 sample collection and preparation in the summer season at the time of the lowest water level 145 m in 2014 2016 2018 and 2020 the same sites except one site banan in 2014 in the wlf zone below 150 m were campaigned to collect surface sediments 0 20 cm a two year sampling interval allowed us to obtain the newly deposited sediments because of the high sedimentation rate and flow regulation in the tgr tang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 at each site at least three 10 5 m plots were randomly selected with the distance between each greater than 20 m and at each plot five samples were collected with a plastic shovel and mixed into one sample on site to remove the sediments below 20 cm we first collected sediment blocks with 10 5 20 cm and then excluded the sediments below 20 cm in total 312 sediment samples comprising 81 63 78 and 90 in 2014 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively were collected in the wlf zone in 2016 2018 and 2020 one background site zhutuo outside the tgr was selected to sample additional sediments n 3 per year according to the same method all samples were stored at 4 c in the field and after returning to the laboratory the samples were freeze dried and sieved to 2 mm to remove coarse particles and plant residues one portion of the sample was used to analyze the sediment properties and the other was pulverized using an agate mortar to pass through a 100 mesh nylon screen for the analysis of element concentrations and trace metal fractions surface water samples were collected in the tgr mainstream when collecting the sediment samples in 2016 n 18 and 2020 n 29 three repeated samples 0 50 cm were collected at each site using a depth keeping water sampler made of polymethyl methacrylate and then mixed into one sample on site the samples were acidified with hno3 solution volume ratio of water hno3 100 1 and stored in polyethylene bottles at 4 c according to the technical regulation of the preservation and handling of samples of china hj 493 2009 once in the laboratory the water samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter membrane for further analysis of the dissolved metal concentrations 2 3 chemical analysis sediment grain sizes clay 4 μm silt 4 64 μm sand 64 μm were measured using a mastersizer 2000 laser grain size meter after the removal of carbonates and organic matter using hcl and h2o2 respectively a grain size of less than 64 μm was defined as fine particles the ph was analyzed using a ph meter after mixing the sediments and deionized water at a ratio of 1 2 5 for 30 min the organic matter content was determined using the loss on ignition loi test a known amount of sample was burned at 550 c for 4 h in a muffle furnace and the percentage of weight loss was recorded the fractions of trace metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn in the sediments were analyzed following the european standard measurements and testing program formerly the community bureau of reference bcr method which includes acid soluble or exchangeable and carbonate bound fraction reducible oxidizable and residual fractions rauret et al 1999 the acid soluble fraction of trace metals defined as the labile fraction was analyzed in this study to reveal the metals mobility and ecological risk in sediments the sediment samples used for the analysis of total metal concentrations were digested with a mixture of concentrated acids comprising hf hno3 hclo4 and hcl bing et al 2014 the concentrations of the major elements al ca fe mg mn and ti in the digestion solution were measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and the concentrations of trace metals were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms quality control was ensured by the analysis of blanks duplicate samples and reference materials gsd 9 and gsd 11 the precision and accuracy were routinely below 5 according to the relative standard deviation rsd of the repeated samples and standard reference materials the concentrations of the trace metals in the filtered water were measured using icp ms the calibration blank and independent verification standard were analyzed every five samples to calibrate the precision of the instrument the concentration of the blanks was 1 for all metals and the analysis precision of the triplicate samples was 5 for the rsd the pb isotopic ratios of 208pb 206pb and 206pb 207pb in the sediments were determined using icp ms agilent 7700 to identify the anthropogenic contribution to pb and the metals that had similar sources as pb standard reference materials from the united states national institute of standards and technology srm 981 208pb 206pb 2 1681 0 0008 207pb 206pb 0 9146 0 0003 were used for instrument calibration and quality control with multiple measurements of the standard srm 981 208pb 206pb 2 135 0 0016 and 207pb 206pb 0 869 0 0009 were analyzed with a precision rsd of 0 07 and 0 12 respectively 2 4 contamination indices the geoaccumulation index igeo was used to assess the contamination levels of trace metals in the sediments muller 1969 1 i g e o l o g 2 c i 1 5 c 0 where ci is the concentration of a metal c0 is its

background influence loska et al 2004 seven classes were divided according to igeo uncontaminated igeo 0 uncontaminated to moderately contaminated 0 igeo 1 moderately contaminated 1 igeo 2 moderately to heavily contaminated 2 igeo 3 heavily contaminated 3 igeo 4 heavily to extremely contaminated 4 igeo 5 or extremely contaminated igeo 5 the integrated pollution load index pli was used to assess the overall contamination state of the sediments by all the metals luo et al 2012 2 p l i p i 1 p i 2 p i 3 p i n 1 n where pi ci c0 and n is the metal number contamination was classified as

highly contaminated pli 5 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was applied to examine the differences in the concentrations and contamination levels of trace metals in the sediments and water while the spearman correlation analysis two tailed and regression analysis were applied to establish the relationships between the studied variables fisher s test was used to examine significant differences at p 0 05 finally linear and non linear regression were used to display the spatial distribution patterns of sediment properties and the concentrations and contamination indices of trace metals in the water and sediments all statistical analyses were performed using the spss 19 0 and origin 8 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 basic characteristics of sediments the basic properties of the sediments including grain size organic matter ph and major elements during 2014 2020 are presented in table s1 relative to other properties in the sediments we observed marked spatiotemporal variations in the contents of grain size al and fe specifically fine particles including clay and silt dominated the grain sizes of the sediments and their contents increased from 2014 to 2018 but then decreased in 2020 to the levels of 2014 and 2016 fig 1 a similarly the concentrations of al and fe in the sediments also increased evidently from 2014 to 2018 and then decreased in 2020 fig 1b c spatially the contents of fine particles al and fe showed an evident increase towards the dam and their contents increased markedly from 2014 to 2018 with increasing distance towards the dam although they decreased again in 2020 fig 1d e f 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of trace metals in the sediments and surface water compared with the early stage of the impoundment in 2010 the concentrations of trace metals especially cd pb and zn in the sediments increased markedly since the full operation of the tgr since 2012 although a slight fluctuation in the concentrations existed for specific metals fig 2 among the four years in this study significantly higher concentrations were observed for cd in 2018 cu in 2014 and ni in 2018 and 2020 while lower values were observed for cr in 2016 and zn in 2014 no significant changes in pb concentrations were observed over the four years in contrast there was marked spatial variation in the metal concentrations in the sediments during 2014 2020 fig 3 in 2014 the concentrations of all trace metals except cu showed an increasing trend towards the dam however although the concentrations of cr except in 2016 and ni continued to increase towards the dam following 2016 other trace metals changed their spatial distribution patterns in 2016 and 2020 the concentrations of cd cu pb and zn showed an increasing trend in the upper section of the tgr approximately 550 km away from the dam and then decreased appreciably despite a slight increase in the wlf zone near the dam in 2018 cu did not show a marked variation along the tgr while a significant decrease in the concentrations of cd pb and zn towards the dam was observed owing to the low mobility of cr and ni in the sediments the concentrations and percentages of labile cr 1 0 mg kg and 1 of total cr and ni 2 0 mg kg and 5 of total ni were very low according to the bcr method thus we only displayed the spatiotemporal variations in the concentrations and percentages of labile cd cu pb and zn the labile cd concentrations showed an increasing trend from 2014 to 2018 and then decreased in 2020 the percentage of labile cd to total cd exceeded 50 and was significantly higher in 2016 and 2018 followed by 2020 and then 2014 fig 4 a the labile cu concentrations decreased from 2014 to 2020 and the percentage showed a similar trend as its concentrations varying between 10 and 15 in 2014 and between 5 and 10 in other years the labile pb concentrations were significantly higher in 2014 and 2018 followed by 2016 and then 2020 and its percentage was higher in 2014 5 than in other years 5 the labile zn concentrations were significantly higher in 2016 2018 and 2020 than in 2014 while its percentage was higher in 2016 and 2018 15 20 than in 2014 and 2020 10 15 spatially the distribution of labile metals was similar to that of the total metals fig 4b except for cu pb and zn in 2014 which were relatively higher in the upper section of the tgr the concentrations of trace metals in the surface water were very low in 2016 and 2020 far below the standards of drinking water quality and surface water quality i type in china table 1 meanwhile the concentrations of trace metals decreased notably from 2008 to 2020 except for zn which exhibited marked annual fluctuations spatially the concentrations of trace metals in the water were generally consistent with their concentrations in the sediments figure s2 the concentrations of cd cu pb and zn were relatively higher in the upper section of the tgr except pb in 2020 while an increasing trend of cr and ni towards the dam was observed despite the marked decrease in their concentrations in 2020 similar spatial distribution patterns of trace metals existed in the water and sediments whereas a significant correlation of the concentrations between the water and the sediments was not observed except for zn adj r2 0 110 p 0 013 in contrast the concentrations of cd cu pb and zn in water were significantly correlated with their labile fractions in the sediments figure s3 3 3 contamination state of trace metals in the sediments according to the igeo cd contamination was significantly higher moderate to high level than other metals followed by zn moderate level and cr cu ni and pb with nil to moderate contamination table 2 compared with other years the contamination of trace metals was evidently higher for cd high level in 2018 cr and ni in 2018 and 2020 cu in 2014 and zn in 2016 2018 and 2020 while pb contamination did not show a temporal difference moreover the spatial distribution of igeo was generally similar to that of the metal concentrations figure s4 the pli results showed that the sediments were moderately to highly contaminated by all metals and the contamination in 2018 was relatively higher than that in 2016 and 2020 spatially the contamination increased significantly towards the dam in 2014 yet the opposite case was observed in 2018 in 2016 and 2020 the contamination increased towards the dam in the upper section of the tgr and then decreased markedly fig 5 the percentage of labile metal concentration to its total concentration known as the risk assessment code rac provides an index to assess the risk of trace metals in the sediments for aquatic organisms singh et al 2005 the rac classification was defined as 1 no risk 1 10 low risk 10 30 moderate risk 30 50 high risk 50 extremely high risk according to this classification the risk of cd in the sediments for aquatic organisms reached an extremely high level each year zn had a moderate risk cu except in 2014 moderate risk ni and pb had a low risk level and cr had no risk fig 4a 3 4 isotopic ratios of pb in the sediments although the concentrations of pb in the sediments did not show a significant difference during 2014 2020 its isotopic ratios were relatively low for 206pb 207pb in 2020 and 208pb 206pb in 2018 table s2 meanwhile there was a marked spatial variation in the pb isotopic ratios among the four years the ratio of 206pb 207pb did not change significantly along the mainstream in 2014 p 0 114 despite the relatively low values in the upper section while it showed significantly different distribution patterns in the other three years p 0 001 fig 6 a particularly the ratio of 206pb 207pb in 2016 evidently decreased from the upper section and then increased again in the area near the dam while the ratio in 2018 displayed a prominent increase towards the dam further the ratio in 2020 decreased largely in the upper section increased again in the middle section and then remained stable according to the diagram of 206pb 207pb versus 208pb 206pb in the sediments and potential source materials we observed three main characteristics fig 6b first there was a significant correlation between 206pb 207pb and 208pb 206pb over the four years and the significance increased markedly from 2014 to 2020 indicating a much clearer anthropogenic versus natural signal in the sediments second the absolute slopes of the fitting lines evidently increased from 2014 to 2020 and according to the pb isotopic ratios more plots with much lower 206pb 207pb and higher 208pb 206pb were close to anthropogenic endmembers in 2018 and 2020 than in the other years see the sub figure in fig 6b third the ratios in most of the plots overlapped with those in ores coal emissions and air dust or aerosols in southern china but not in natural endmembers e g background soils in southern china s mountains or vehicle emissions meanwhile the ratios of 206pb 207pb and 208pb 206pb in the sediments especially in 2018 and 2020 were close to those in the mosses from southern china s mountains where pb was identified from anthropogenic sources bing et al 2019b furthermore because the 206pb 207pb ratio has been widely used to identify pb sources in the environment chen et al 2005 cheng and hu 2010 we also compiled the ratios from various archives in southern and southwestern china the results further support that pb in the sediments was mainly from anthropogenic sources including ore mining and smelting fossil fuel combustion and atmospheric deposition table s2 3 5 relationship of trace metals with sediment variables there was a clear difference in the correlation of trace metals in the sediments between sampling years fig 7 although a significant correlation was observed between trace metals except cr and zn in 2014 in 2014 and 2016 the correlation coefficients between cd cu pb and zn increased significantly in 2016 in 2018 cd pb and zn were significantly and positively correlated with each other whereas they showed a negative or non significant correlation with cr and ni which correlated significantly with each other a positive correlation between cu and all other metals except cd was observed in 2018 in 2020 the correlations of cd pb and zn were still significant and a similar case was also observed for cr and ni however the correlations of cd pb and zn with cr and ni were not significant except for a weak correlation between cr and pb copper showed a significant positive correlation with all other metals in 2020 the correlation between trace metals and sediment properties was metal and year specific fig 7 except for cd and zn in 2014 which were positively correlated with fine particles cd pb and zn showed a non significant or negative correlation with fine particles and they did not positively correlate with loi and ph except pb in 2014 in any year moreover cd pb and zn had no or a negative correlation with other major elements except mn in the sediments sampled from 2016 to 2020 whereas they showed a significant and positive correlation with al fe and mg in 2014 in contrast cr and ni correlated significantly and positively with fine particles al and fe each year except cr vs al in 2016 copper had a weak correlation with fine particles loi ph and al each year and it correlated significantly with other major elements except fe in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 increasing anthropogenic dominance on trace metal contamination during dam operation dam construction can dramatically slow down flow velocity and increase water retention time causing the subsequent capture of sediments in reservoirs feng et al 2014 latrubesse et al 2017 tian et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 which may enrich trace metals in aquatic environment because of sediment adsorption effects as expected we observed an evident increase in the concentrations of trace metals in the sediments of the wlf zone after the full impoundment stage since 2012 when compared with the pre dam period before 2002 xu et al 1999 and the early stage of the post dam period 2003 2012 fig 2 meanwhile the concentrations of trace metals in the sediments after the full impoundment exceeded their local background of 10 fold for cd 3 to 4 fold for zn 2 to 3 fold for cu and pb and nearly twice for cr and ni from 2014 to 2020 and the values of each metal exceeded their individual threshold effect level for aquatic organisms macdonald et al 2000 as such the sediments were moderately to highly contaminated with the trace metals and featured a high potential risk table 2 however there was a marked difference in the contamination levels for specific trace metals in the sediments which was characteristic of relatively high contamination for cd followed by cu pb and zn and then cr and ni table 2 fig 4a this indicates that cd should be of great concern in the wlf zone of the tgr over the long term in terms of its high toxicity to aquatic organisms meanwhile trace metals in the sediments can likely be characterized by distinctly different anthropogenic versus natural sources the correlation analysis clearly identified three groups of trace metals in the sediments along with temporal variations from 2014 to 2020 fig 7 the first group including cd pb and zn showed a consistent positive correlation with each other in any year whereas they had a non significant and even negative correlation with fine particles al and fe in 2018 and 2020 relative to 2014 and 2016 which suggests an increasing anthropogenic contribution to these metals although the concentrations of pb in the sediments did not increase significantly during 2014 2020 which may be related to the large range of pb concentrations at such a large spatial scale that affects the statistical significance the marked increase in pb concentrations since the full operation of the tgr e g since 2014 supports the increased anthropogenic influence fig 2 moreover the pb isotopic ratios further confirmed the increasingly evident anthropogenic signal of pb in the sediments which exhibited an increase in the correlation coefficients from 2014 to 2020 and an overlap of the plots in the sediments with multiple anthropogenic endmembers in 2018 and 2020 fig 6b meanwhile increasing human activities in the catchment have also increased pollutant emissions under intensifying industrial production figure s5b c recent studies have reported that trace metals such as cd pb and zn in the sediments and or water of the tgr are related to anthropogenic emissions from the catchment including industrial emissions involved in coal utilization and ore smelting agricultural emissions such as chemical fertilizers and herbicides and shipping related emissions gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 although our pb isotopic ratios did not reveal the agricultural and vehicle shipping fuel oil sources of pb the ratios in the sediments overlapped with those in air dust or aerosols indicating the complicated and mixed anthropogenic sources of pb and metals that correlated significantly with pb the second group included cr and ni which were significantly and positively correlated with each other from 2014 to 2020 but not with cd pb and zn in 2018 or 2020 also had a significant correlation with the fine particles and mineral elements e g al fe ca and mg despite a small difference among the years this suggests that cr and ni have different sources of cd pb and zn and are mainly from natural origins copper as the third group generally had a close correlation with all other trace metals indicating a mixed source from both anthropogenic and natural origins in addition to the difference in the metal sources the significant correlation of fe mn ca and mg with specific trace metals also indicates that redox conditions and carbonates play an important role in the behavior of trace metals and affect their distribution in the sediments rinklebe et al 2019 shaheen et al 2016 spatial information on regional human activities indirectly reflects anthropogenic effects on trace metal contamination in sediments the higher concentrations and contamination levels of cd pb and zn in the sediments were mainly centralized in the upper section of the tgr from 2016 to 2020 fig 3 which corresponds to the main urban area of chongqing city relatively low ratios of 206pb 207pb which commonly represent anthropogenic signals in china were also observed in this area fig 6a chongqing city is one of the most developed cities and industrial centers where there are many medium sized enterprises involved in electroplating machinery manufacturing mineral mining smelting etc and coal is one of the main industrial fuel and energy sources in urban areas wang et al 2006 consequently the discharges of industrial and municipal sewage from the main urban area were markedly higher than those from other areas in the tgr region figure s5a which strongly supports the anthropogenic contribution of cd pb and zn in the sediments moreover we also sampled the sediments in the upper outside the tgr the background site at zhutuo from 2016 to 2020 and the results showed that the concentrations of all trace metals in the sediments were notably lower at the background site than in the wlf zone despite a small temporal difference table s3 this indicates that the distant inputs of trace metals from the upper yangtze river had a limited contribution to metal contamination in the sediments of the tgr relative to the main urban area in addition relatively high contamination levels of trace metals were observed in the middle section of the tgr during 2016 2020 and in areas near the dam in 2014 and 2020 fig 5 agricultural and animal husbandry industries may have caused trace metal accumulation in the sediments of the middle section which features a relatively flat and wide area via runoff and or seepage however the high values in the areas near the dam were possibly associated with the high geological background levels of the trace metals in the host rock limestone considering the fewer cities and less developed industries bao et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 4 2 regulation of sedimentary dynamics on the spatiotemporal distribution of trace metals in this study we observed that the concentrations and contamination of trace metals in the sediments increased markedly after the full impoundment stage of the tgr relative to the early stage especially for cd which reached its highest contamination in 2018 and then decreased in 2020 fig 2 table 2 as discussed above the sediments from the upper yangtze river commonly contain fewer trace metals and are regarded as a clean provenance in that they limit the contribution of trace metals to the wlf zone of the tgr therefore the decreased distant inputs of sediments and their bound trace metals from the upper yangtze river further enlarges the role of anthropogenic contribution in the urban area in metal accumulation in the sediments this was also supported by the negative or non significant correlation of anthropogenic metals e g cd pb and zn with al and fe in 2018 and 2020 fig 7 however sediment inputs from the upper yangtze river may have two contrasting effects on the accumulation of anthropogenic metals in the sediments as was observed for 2018 and 2020 according to the sediment discharge data from the monitoring stations there was a marked increase in the fluxes of sediment discharge in both 2018 and 2020 and the fluxes were much higher in 2020 than in 2018 figure s6 thus we infer that the increased sediment fluxes along with the finer grain size in 2018 accelerated the adsorption and deposition of anthropogenic metals in the wlf zone while the higher sediment inputs and a slightly coarser grain size in 2020 relative to those in 2018 diluted the concentrations of these metals this is also supported by the non significant difference in pb concentrations between 2018 and 2020 but the significantly lower 206pb 207pb ratios in 2020 relative to those in 2018 fig 2 table s2 spatially three distribution patterns of anthropogenic metals cd pb and zn were observed in the sediments of the wlf zone over the four years fig 3 although human activities in the urban area of the tgr have become the major driver of trace metal accumulation in the sediments the variations in the particle composition of sediments are considered to drive the trace metal distribution in the wlf zone this is because fine grained sediments have a relatively large specific surface area beckingham et al 2016 and they can adsorb and transport trace metals at further distances our previous study found that with a decrease in the grain sizes the fine particles in the sediments which consisted of scattered coatings in a squama shape with more ridges channels and pores tended to be more complex in terms of surface morphology and structure wang et al 2020 in the present study we also observed that the proportion of fine particles in sediments increased significantly with increasing impoundment time moreover the contents of fine particles al and fe relatively high element composition in mineral displayed a clear spatial variation with distance to the dam from 2014 to 2020 fig 1 namely their contents gradually increased from upstream to downstream of the tgr in 2014 while relatively higher contents appeared further from the dam after 2014 especially in 2018 when higher values were observed in the middle and upper sections considering that the sediments entering the tgr decreased sharply but the runoff did not vary significantly in 2014 figure s6 the sampled sediments in 2014 probably recorded the signal before 2014 with the higher contents of relatively coarse particles when compared with other years as a result the fine particles were transported long distances to the near dam areas resulting in the high deposition of bound trace metals with the continuous sediment interception by the cascade reservoirs and the water and soil conservation measures implemented in the upper yangtze river and the increasing fine particles under the decrease in flow velocity in the middle and upper sections the trace metals emitted by local human activities can be adsorbed by fine grained sediments and promptly deposited in the wlf zone overall anthropogenic emissions in the main urban area of the tgr have become a main driver of the spatial distribution of trace metals in the sediments of the wlf zone while sediment composition regulates the transportation and deposition of anthropogenic metals recently increasing research with model prediction has revealed a decreasing trend of sediment inputs into the tgr tian et al 2021 which may stress the human disturbance on trace metal accumulation in sediments however two issues must be noted when evaluating the sedimentary dynamics of trace metal distribution in the sediments of the wlf zone first fluvial sediments can store substantial trace metals which may introduce a lag period into the transport and deposition of trace metals thus legacy metal contamination in the sediments may have affected their spatial distribution it should be noted that we have considered this issue by collecting surface sediments every two years second extreme climate events and their induced flooding in the upper yangtze river have evidently increased in recent years li et al 2021 therefore also significantly affecting the runoff and sediment discharges in the tgr region for example relative to the periods before 2014 the annual precipitation in the tgr area generally increased according to the local weather stations figure s7 a and b more importantly extreme precipitation events increased markedly in the summer although the annual precipitation did not change significantly or even decreased figure s7 c and d in particular rainfall in 2020 caused five flooding events with discharges over 50 000 m3 s in the yangtze river basin xia and chen 2021 and the station of cuntan in the upper yangtze river recorded the second highest water level since 1892 bulletin of the sediments in the yangtze river http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb 2020 gb these extreme events have resulted in evident variations in runoff and sediment discharges in the tgr figure s6 which is a potential driver of the changes in the deposition and distribution of anthropogenic metals therefore in addition to long term monitoring of sediment inputs from the upper yangtze river the annual sediment dynamics regulated by extreme climate must be considered to prevent trace metal contamination in the aquatic environment 4 3 attenuation of trace metal contamination in water driven by sedimentary dynamics the tgr operation features an anti seasonal water level regulation with the lowest in the wet seasons and the highest in the dry seasons which may cause trace metals in the sediments to be released to the overlying water via diffusion dissolution and exchange especially at high water levels and relatively anaerobic conditions the positive relationship between anthropogenic metals in the water and their labile fractions in the sediments confirms the direct contribution of trace metal release from sediments to the overlying water figure s3 however according to the trace metal concentrations in the water water quality is generally at an acceptable level for aquatic organisms in the tgr table 1 when compared with other reports using the health risk index zhao et al 2017 2020 there was no potential health risk of the studied trace metals for the local population meanwhile we also observed a decreasing trend of the trace metal concentrations since dam construction and the decrease was much more significant after the full impoundment stage table 1 which indicates that dam construction may be unexpectedly conducive to improving the water quality away from trace metal contamination in contrast we found the opposite case of trace metal accumulation in the sediments after dam construction fig 2 this suggests that the decrease in trace metals in the water may be closely associated with the sedimentary dynamics under the current flow regulation of the tgr which has altered the hydrological conditions and sediment deposition deng et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 and the migration and accumulation of trace metals in the aquatic environment after the full impoundment operation of the tgr the flow velocity of the water decreased notably tang et al 2016 xiang et al 2021 which increased the retention time of the sediments in the water and the sediment sorting and deposition the recent study found that the suspended sediment concentration has declined by an order magnitude from 1 0 to 0 1 kg m3 in the heavily dammed changjiang fluvial system in recent three decades sun et al 2021 in this study the increased content of fine grained sediments from 2014 to 2020 also supports the increased deposition of fine particles in the tgr fig 1 considering the high adsorption capacity of fine particles for the elements the decreasing concentrations of trace metals in the water are mainly attributed to the elevated water retention time and sediment adsorption of the metals although the spatial distribution of trace metals was similar in the water and sediments the concentrations of individual metals were not significantly correlated between the water and the sediments especially for anthropogenic metals except zn on the one hand the higher concentrations of trace metals such as cd pb and zn in the water of the upper tgr further confirm the complex effects of anthropogenic emissions on their accumulation in the sediments on the other hand dynamic variations in the fluxes and particle composition of sediments may modulate the deposition of fine particle adsorbed metals specifically the content of fine grained sediments in the middle and upper sections of the tgr increased from 2014 to 2020 fig 1 the trace metals emitted by local human activities can be adsorbed in these fine grained sediments and dynamically deposited in the wlf zone especially in the high water level season with decreased flow velocity and subsequent backflow bao et al 2015 which is a probable reason for the non significant relationship of each metal between the water and the sediments therefore the sedimentary dynamics in the tgr have great potential for regulating trace metal contamination in water meanwhile our results indicate that under the effects of the cascade dams constructed in the upper yangtze river the decrease in the sediment fluxes mainly the decreased sediments with large grain sizes and the increase in the fine sediment content contributed to the good water quality in the tgr 5 conclusions in this study we found a significant decrease in trace metal concentrations in the water of the tgr mainstream especially since the dam operation whereas the concentrations and contamination of anthropogenic metals e g cd pb zn and cu in the sediments of the wlf zone increased notably as expected spatiotemporal variations in the contamination of these metals highlighted the importance of human activities in the urban area of the tgr moreover the dynamic variations in the fluxes and composition of sediments under periodic and anti seasonal flow regulation as well as extreme climate modulated the distribution patterns of trace metals in the sediments in contrast to our previously thought the higher anthropogenic contribution to trace metals relative to natural inputs did not negatively affect water quality which may be closely related to the fine sediment composition with increasing impoundment time our results suggest that large dam construction in riverine systems such as the tgr probably prevents trace metal contamination from the water environment by regulating the fluxes and composition of sediments however the adsorption and release capacity of sediments for the trace metals over the long term still needs to be considered under in situ periodic water level fluctuations in the future our results can serve as a foundation for future environmental impact assessments resulting from dam induced river

16030,dam construction has a far reaching impact on trace metal accumulation and the metal induced quality of the aquatic environment however the long term impacts of dam construction and impoundments on the spatial distribution of trace metals and water quality remain poorly understood here we found that the concentrations of trace metals in the mainstream water of the world s largest reservoir three gorges reservoir tgr decreased after impoundment while their concentrations and contamination in the sediments of the water level fluctuation zone increased significantly especially for anthropogenic sources of metals such as cadmium lead and zinc the spatial and temporal variations of anthropogenic metals in the sediments revealed increased anthropogenic dominance in their distribution under current hydrological management especially for the urban area of the upper tgr sediment fluxes particle composition and extreme climate modulated the distribution of trace metals in the sediments the results demonstrate that human activities have increasingly determined the distribution and contamination state of trace metals in the mainstream tgr however in contrast to our previously thought the anthropogenic discharge of trace metals did not adversely affect water quality our results indicate that dam construction in riverine systems attenuates trace metal contamination in water through sediment sorting and deposition graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words trace metal contamination spatiotemporal variation sedimentary dynamics surface water fluvial sediments large reservoir 1 introduction dam construction can evidently modulate the accumulation distribution and transportation of trace metals in riverine systems by altering factors such as the flow velocity sediment discharge deposition retention and sorting nilsson et al 2005 grill et al 2015 wang et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 this can potentially affect water quality and human health in the catchment yang et al 2012 huang et al 2021 according to the international commission on large dams icold more than 58 000 large dams had been built on the world s major rivers by 2020 and 40 6 of dams in china is large dam the yangtze river is one of asia s largest rivers a large number of dams have been built in the upper yangtze river in the last few decades and more dams are under construction or being planned yang et al 2011 xu et al 2013 tian et al 2021 the three gorges dam tgd in the upper yangtze river is the world s largest hydroelectric dam and the construction of the tgd has posed a profound impact on material transfer and the aquatic environment in the three gorges reservoir tgr as well as downstream in the yangtze river feng et al 2014 he et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 one of the main characteristics of the tgr is the anti seasonal water level operation which features the lowest water level 145 m in the summer and wet seasons and the highest 175 m in the winter and dry seasons this results in a marked difference in the discharge of water and sediment into the reservoir relative to other flow managed and free flowing rivers tang et al 2018a grill et al 2019 moreover the anti seasonal water level operation forms a unique geomorphological unit of the water level fluctuation wlf zone which is characterized by a vertical height of 30 m and a total area of 349 km2 and is one of the main zones for sediment accumulation in the tgr bao et al 2015 specifically the impoundment stage in the winter and dry seasons can facilitate clear dispersal and deposition of sediments in the wlf zone relative to the recession stage in the summer and wet seasons which features a relatively higher duration frequency and magnitude of flooding although water recession may scour the riverbed and carry away a certain amount of sediment that was originally deposited at the impoundment stage the wlf zone tends to maintain a stable and relatively high sediment trapping rate tang et al 2016 2018b in addition to the variable sediment loads the special flow regime under dam operation also affects sediment sorting and thus modulates sediment redistribution in the wlf zone for example the preferential settling of coaster particles has been observed in backwater sections that have a relatively low flow velocity bing et al 2019a tang et al 2018b sediments are the predominant sinks of trace metals in rivers and their dynamics and fluxes determine the biological availability distribution and environmental accessibility of trace metals in aquatic environment to a large extent du laing et al 2009 baborowski et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 under annual cyclic exposure and inundation the wlf zone in the tgr mainstream faces many strong anthropogenic and natural disturbances such as secondary geological disasters soil erosion and tillage bao et al 2015 xu et al 2013 which may cause the migration of accumulated sediments from the wlf zone and increase the release of trace metals to the overlying water moreover sediment fluxes in the wlf zone are appreciably influenced by sediment management strategies in the tgr such as the cascade reservoirs that were constructed in the upper yangtze river sediment regulation policies and soil and water conservation projects in the catchment yang et al 2018 ren et al 2020 ren 2021 relative to the pre dam period the sediment input into the tgr decreased sharply from 2003 to 2012 and decreased further to approximately zero from 2013 to 2017 yang et al 2011 2014 dai et al 2014 tian et al 2021 this potentially determines the distribution and ecological risk of trace metals in the sediments gao et al 2019 bing et al 2019a in addition the ecological environmental and geomorphological conditions in the wlf zone of the tgr mainstream over the post dam period are still highly dynamic under the special flow regime and increasing anthropogenic disturbance bao et al 2015 which directly affects sediment dynamics and the metals associated with them a recent modeling study predicted that it would take 320 560 years to reach the sedimentation balance in the tgr under current water sediment conditions chen et al 2021 therefore a long term and continuous focus on trace metal contamination in sediments is necessary to control the water quality in the tgr anthropogenic disturbances along rivers are distinctly position dependent yet current frameworks or models of environmental impact assessment generally render all river reaches equally important irrespective of habitat suitability or local human influence xenopoulos and lodge 2006 grill et al 2015 which may cause uncertainty in the prediction of dam induced environmental impacts spatiotemporal information on trace metal contamination in riverine systems provides a proxy for anthropogenic disturbance because of its non degradation and toxicity to aquatic organisms and human health the contamination of trace metals in the aquatic environment of the tgr has been a concern since the construction of the tgd yang et al 2012 many previous studies have found that after the full operation of the tgr trace metals such as cd cr cu pb and zn in the water did not exceed the quality standards of drinking water and or surface water in china whereas the contamination of some metals such as cd pb and zn in the sediments reached a moderate or even high level bing et al 2016 gao et al 2016 lin et al 2020 meanwhile the spatial distribution of trace metals in the sediments has changed markedly with periodic flow management moreover the changes in geomorphological characteristics local human activities and sediment fluxes in the wlf zone have been regarded as the main drivers of spatial variations in trace metal distribution bing et al 2019a gao et al 2019 lin et al 2020 however the majority of these studies mainly consider either a short time scale i e one or two impoundment periods or the relatively small spatial scale as the study unit thereby overlooking the long term and large scale spatial variations in the contamination of trace metals in the water and or sediments at all phases of the dam s life as such the direction and magnitude of trace metal contamination in space and time as well as the underlying drivers are still unclear and deserve to be comprehensively explored in addition extreme climate and flooding in the upper basin of the yangtze river have become increasingly anomalous and more frequent in recent years li et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 this is believed to not only affect the river runoff and sediment transfer but also regulate the distribution and contamination of trace metals in the wlf zone of the tgr overall in terms of the global surge in dam construction grill et al 2015 zarfl et al 2015 it is of paramount importance to consider the spatial and temporal variations of trace metal contamination in the water and sediments of dammed rivers over the long term in order to improve aquatic quality this would also provide insights into the dynamics of trace metals in the water sediment system under long term and periodic flow management as well as extreme climate change in combination with other short term or single monitoring of trace metals in the water and or sediments of the tgr mainstream this study explored the impact of long term hydrological management with tgd construction on the dynamics of trace metals in the sediments and overlying water to achieve this the wlf zone in the entire mainstream of the tgr was selected to measure six trace metals including cd cr cu ni pb and zn in the water and sediments during 2014 2020 the main objectives were to 1 plumb the spatial and temporal variations in the distribution and contamination of trace metals in the water and sediments 2 identify the anthropogenic effects on the accumulation of trace metals by the spatiotemporal distribution and pb isotopic ratios and 3 decipher the effects of sedimentary dynamics on the variations in trace metals and aquatic environment quality we expected that local anthropogenic sources of trace metals would become increasingly dominant in the aquatic environment because of decreasing sediment inputs from the upper yangtze river as a result the increased trace metals might negatively affect the quality of the overlying water however the particle composition could play a vital role in regulating the contamination of trace metals in the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the region of the tgr 28 28 31 44 n 105 49 110 12 e covers the upper yangtze river between chongqing and yichang with a total water surface area of 1080 km2 and a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 at a water level of 175 m fu et al 2010 the study area spanned the entire mainstream of the tgr with a length of more than 660 km figure s1 the climate in the tgr region is mainly controlled by a humid subtropical monsoon with the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation of 16 19 c and 1000 1200 mm respectively there were three major types of bedrock in the study area purple and red rocks 74 carbonate 19 and other rocks 7 bao et al 2015 tang et al

below 150 m were campaigned to collect surface sediments 0 20 cm a two year sampling interval allowed us to obtain the newly deposited sediments because of the high sedimentation rate and flow regulation in the tgr tang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 at each site at least three 10 5 m plots were randomly selected with the distance between each greater than 20 m and at each plot five samples were collected with a plastic shovel and mixed into one sample on site to remove the sediments below 20 cm we first collected sediment blocks with 10 5 20 cm and then excluded the sediments below 20 cm in total 312 sediment samples comprising 81 63 78 and 90 in 2014 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively were collected in the wlf zone in 2016 2018 and 2020 one background site zhutuo outside the tgr was selected to sample additional sediments n 3 per year according to the same method all samples were stored at 4 c in the field and after returning to the laboratory the samples were freeze dried and sieved to 2 mm to remove coarse particles and plant residues one portion of the sample was used to analyze the sediment properties and the other was pulverized using an agate mortar to pass through a 100 mesh nylon screen for the analysis of element concentrations and trace metal fractions surface water samples were collected in the tgr mainstream when collecting the sediment samples in 2016 n 18 and 2020 n 29 three repeated samples 0 50 cm were collected at each site using a depth keeping water sampler made of polymethyl methacrylate and then mixed into one sample on site the samples were acidified with hno3 solution volume ratio of water hno3 100 1 and stored in polyethylene bottles at 4 c according to the technical regulation of the preservation and handling of samples of china hj 493 2009 once in the laboratory the water samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter membrane for further analysis of the dissolved metal concentrations 2 3 chemical analysis sediment grain sizes clay 4 μm silt 4 64 μm sand 64 μm were measured using a mastersizer 2000 laser grain size meter after the removal of carbonates and organic matter using hcl and h2o2 respectively a grain size of less than 64 μm was defined as fine particles the ph was analyzed using a ph meter after mixing the sediments and deionized water at a ratio of 1 2 5 for 30 min the organic matter content was determined using the loss on ignition loi test a known amount of sample was burned at 550 c for 4 h in a muffle furnace and the percentage of weight loss was recorded the fractions of trace metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn in the sediments were analyzed following the european standard measurements and testing program formerly the community bureau of reference bcr method which includes acid soluble or exchangeable and carbonate bound fraction reducible oxidizable and residual fractions rauret et al 1999 the acid soluble fraction of trace metals defined as the labile fraction was analyzed in this study to reveal the metals mobility and ecological risk in sediments the sediment samples used for the analysis of total metal concentrations were digested with a mixture of concentrated acids comprising hf hno3

the basic properties of the sediments including grain size organic matter ph and major elements during 2014 2020 are presented in table s1 relative to other properties in the sediments we observed marked spatiotemporal variations in the contents of grain size al and fe specifically fine particles including clay and silt dominated the grain sizes of the sediments and their contents increased from 2014 to 2018 but then decreased in 2020 to the levels of 2014 and 2016 fig 1 a similarly the concentrations of al and fe in the sediments also increased evidently from 2014 to 2018 and then decreased in 2020 fig 1b c spatially the contents of fine particles al and fe showed an evident increase towards the dam and their contents increased markedly from 2014 to 2018 with increasing distance towards the dam although they decreased again in 2020 fig 1d e f 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of trace metals in the sediments and surface water compared with the early stage of the impoundment in 2010 the concentrations of trace metals especially cd pb and zn in the sediments increased markedly since the full operation of the tgr since 2012 although a slight fluctuation in the concentrations existed for specific metals fig 2 among the four years in this study significantly higher concentrations were observed for cd in 2018 cu in 2014 and ni in 2018 and 2020 while lower values were observed for cr in 2016 and zn in 2014 no significant changes in pb concentrations were observed over the four years in contrast there was marked spatial variation in the metal concentrations in the sediments during 2014 2020 fig 3 in 2014 the concentrations of all trace metals except cu showed an increasing trend towards the dam however although the concentrations of cr except in 2016 and ni continued to increase towards the dam following 2016 other trace metals changed their spatial distribution patterns in 2016 and 2020 the concentrations of cd cu pb and zn showed an increasing trend in the upper section of the tgr approximately 550 km away from the dam and then decreased appreciably despite a slight increase in the wlf zone near the dam in 2018 cu did not show a marked variation along the tgr while a significant decrease in the concentrations of cd pb and zn towards the dam was observed owing to the low mobility of cr and ni in the sediments the concentrations and percentages of labile cr 1 0 mg kg and 1 of total cr and ni 2 0 mg kg and 5 of total ni were very low according to the bcr method thus we only displayed the spatiotemporal variations in the concentrations and percentages of labile cd cu pb and zn the labile cd concentrations showed an increasing trend from 2014 to 2018 and then decreased in 2020 the percentage of labile cd to total cd exceeded 50 and was significantly higher in 2016 and 2018 followed by 2020 and then 2014 fig 4 a the labile cu concentrations decreased from 2014 to 2020 and the percentage showed a similar trend as its concentrations varying between 10 and 15 in 2014 and between 5 and 10 in other years the labile pb concentrations were significantly higher in 2014 and 2018 followed by 2016 and then 2020 and its percentage was higher in 2014 5 than in other years 5 the labile zn concentrations were significantly higher in 2016 2018 and 2020 than in 2014 while its percentage was higher in 2016 and 2018 15 20 than in 2014 and 2020 10 15 spatially the distribution of labile metals was similar to that of the total metals fig 4b except for cu pb and zn in 2014 which were relatively higher in the upper section of the tgr the concentrations of trace metals in the surface water were very low in 2016 and 2020 far below the standards of drinking water quality and surface water quality i type in china table 1 meanwhile the concentrations of trace metals decreased notably from 2008 to 2020 except for zn which exhibited marked annual fluctuations spatially the concentrations of trace metals in the water were generally consistent with their concentrations in the sediments figure s2 the concentrations of cd cu pb and zn were relatively higher in the upper section of the tgr except pb in 2020 while an increasing trend of cr and ni towards the dam was observed despite the marked decrease in their concentrations in 2020 similar spatial distribution patterns of trace metals existed in the water and sediments whereas a significant correlation of the concentrations between the water and the sediments was not observed except for zn adj r2 0 110 p 0 013 in contrast the concentrations of cd cu pb and zn in water were significantly correlated with their labile fractions in the sediments figure s3 3 3 contamination state of trace metals in the sediments according to the igeo cd contamination was significantly higher moderate to high level than other metals followed by zn moderate level and cr cu ni and pb with nil to moderate contamination table 2 compared with other years the contamination of trace metals was evidently higher for cd high level in 2018 cr and ni in 2018 and 2020 cu in 2014 and zn in 2016 2018 and 2020 while pb contamination did not show a temporal difference moreover the spatial distribution of igeo was generally similar to that of the metal concentrations figure s4 the pli results showed that the sediments were moderately to highly contaminated by all metals and the contamination in 2018 was relatively higher than that in 2016 and 2020 spatially the contamination increased significantly towards the dam in 2014 yet the opposite case was observed in 2018 in 2016 and 2020 the contamination increased towards the dam in the upper section of the tgr and then decreased markedly fig 5 the percentage of labile metal concentration to its total concentration known as the risk assessment code rac provides an index to assess the risk of trace metals in the sediments for aquatic organisms singh et al 2005 the rac classification was defined as 1 no risk 1 10 low risk 10 30 moderate risk 30 50 high risk 50 extremely high risk according to this classification the risk of cd in the sediments for aquatic organisms reached an extremely high level each year zn had a moderate risk cu except in 2014 moderate risk ni and pb had a low risk level and cr had no risk fig 4a 3 4 isotopic ratios of pb in the sediments although the concentrations of pb in the sediments did not show a significant difference during 2014 2020 its isotopic ratios were relatively low for 206pb 207pb in 2020 and 208pb 206pb in 2018 table s2 meanwhile there was a marked spatial variation in the pb isotopic ratios among the four years the ratio of 206pb 207pb did not change significantly along the mainstream in 2014 p 0 114 despite the relatively low values in the upper section while it showed significantly different distribution patterns in the other three years p 0 001 fig 6 a particularly the ratio of 206pb 207pb in 2016 evidently decreased from the upper section and then increased again in the area near the dam while the ratio in 2018 displayed a prominent increase towards the dam further the ratio in 2020 decreased largely in the upper section increased again in the middle section and then remained stable according to the diagram of 206pb 207pb versus 208pb 206pb in the sediments and potential source materials we observed three main characteristics fig 6b first there was a significant correlation between 206pb 207pb and 208pb 206pb over the four years and the significance increased markedly from 2014 to 2020 indicating a much clearer anthropogenic versus natural signal in the sediments second the absolute slopes of the fitting lines evidently increased from 2014 to 2020 and according to the pb isotopic ratios more plots with much lower 206pb 207pb and higher 208pb 206pb were close to anthropogenic endmembers in 2018 and 2020 than in the other years see the sub figure in fig 6b third the ratios in most of the plots overlapped with those in ores coal emissions and air dust or aerosols in southern china but not in natural endmembers e g background soils in southern china s mountains or vehicle emissions meanwhile the ratios of 206pb 207pb and 208pb 206pb in the sediments especially in 2018 and 2020 were close to those in the mosses from southern china s mountains where pb was identified from anthropogenic sources bing et al 2019b furthermore because the 206pb 207pb ratio has been widely used to identify pb sources in the environment chen et al 2005 cheng and hu 2010 we also compiled the ratios from various archives in southern and southwestern china the results further support that pb in the sediments was mainly from anthropogenic sources including ore mining and smelting fossil fuel combustion and atmospheric deposition table s2 3 5 relationship of trace metals with sediment variables there was a clear difference in the correlation of trace metals in the sediments between sampling years fig 7 although a significant correlation was observed between trace metals except cr and zn in 2014 in 2014 and 2016 the correlation coefficients between cd cu pb and zn increased significantly in 2016 in 2018 cd pb and zn were significantly and positively correlated with each other whereas they showed a negative or non significant correlation with cr and ni which correlated significantly with each other a positive correlation between cu and all other metals except cd was observed in 2018 in 2020 the correlations of cd pb and zn were still significant and a similar case was also observed for cr and ni however the correlations of cd pb and zn with cr and ni were not significant except for a weak correlation between cr and pb copper showed a significant positive correlation with all other metals in 2020 the correlation between trace metals and sediment properties was metal and year specific fig 7 except for cd and zn in 2014 which were positively correlated with fine particles cd pb and zn showed a non significant or negative correlation with fine particles and they did not positively correlate with loi and ph except pb in 2014 in any year moreover cd pb and zn had no or a negative correlation with other major elements except mn in the sediments sampled from 2016 to 2020 whereas they showed a significant and positive correlation with al fe and mg in 2014 in contrast cr and ni correlated significantly and positively with fine particles al and fe each year except cr vs al in 2016 copper had a weak correlation with fine particles loi ph and al each year and it correlated significantly with other major elements except fe in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 increasing anthropogenic dominance on trace metal contamination during dam operation dam construction can dramatically slow down flow velocity and increase water retention time causing the subsequent capture of sediments in reservoirs feng et al 2014 latrubesse et al 2017 tian et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 which may enrich trace metals in aquatic environment because of sediment adsorption effects as expected we observed an evident increase in the concentrations of trace metals in the sediments of the wlf zone after the full impoundment stage since 2012 when compared with the pre dam period before 2002 xu et al 1999 and the early stage of the post dam period 2003 2012 fig 2 meanwhile the concentrations of trace metals in the sediments after the full impoundment exceeded their local background of 10 fold for cd 3 to 4 fold for zn 2 to 3 fold for cu and pb and nearly twice for cr and ni from 2014 to 2020 and the values of each metal exceeded their individual threshold effect level for aquatic organisms macdonald et al 2000 as such the sediments were moderately to highly contaminated with the trace metals and featured a high potential risk table 2 however there was a marked difference in the contamination levels for specific trace metals in the sediments which was characteristic of relatively high contamination for cd followed by cu pb and zn and then cr and ni table 2 fig 4a this indicates that cd should be of great concern in the wlf zone of the tgr over the long term in terms of its high toxicity to aquatic organisms meanwhile trace metals in the sediments can likely be characterized by distinctly different anthropogenic versus natural sources the correlation analysis clearly identified three groups of trace metals in the sediments along with temporal variations from 2014 to 2020 fig 7 the first group including cd pb and zn showed a consistent positive correlation with each other in any year whereas they had a non significant and even negative correlation with fine particles al and fe in 2018 and 2020 relative to 2014 and 2016 which suggests an increasing anthropogenic contribution to these metals although the concentrations of pb in the sediments did not increase significantly during 2014 2020 which may be related to the large range of pb concentrations at such a large spatial scale that affects the statistical significance the marked increase in pb concentrations since the full operation of the tgr e g since 2014 supports the increased anthropogenic influence fig 2 moreover the pb isotopic ratios further confirmed the increasingly evident anthropogenic signal of pb in the sediments which exhibited an increase in the correlation coefficients from 2014 to 2020 and an overlap of the plots in the sediments with multiple anthropogenic endmembers in 2018 and 2020 fig 6b meanwhile increasing human activities in the catchment have also increased pollutant emissions under intensifying industrial production figure s5b c recent studies have reported that trace metals such as cd pb and zn in the sediments and or water of the tgr are related to anthropogenic emissions from the catchment including industrial emissions involved in coal utilization and ore smelting agricultural emissions such as chemical fertilizers and herbicides and shipping related emissions gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 although our pb isotopic ratios did not reveal the agricultural and vehicle shipping fuel oil sources of pb the ratios in the sediments overlapped with those in air dust or aerosols indicating the complicated and mixed anthropogenic sources of pb and metals that correlated significantly with pb the second group included cr and ni which were significantly and positively correlated with each other from 2014 to 2020 but not with cd pb and zn in 2018 or 2020 also had a significant correlation with the fine particles and mineral elements e g al fe ca and mg despite a small difference among the years this suggests that cr and ni have different sources of cd pb and zn and are mainly from natural origins copper as the third group generally had a close correlation with all other trace metals indicating a mixed source from both anthropogenic and natural origins in addition to the difference in the metal sources the significant correlation of fe mn ca and mg with specific trace metals also indicates that redox conditions and carbonates play an important role in the behavior of trace metals and affect their distribution in the sediments rinklebe et al 2019 shaheen et al 2016 spatial information on regional human activities indirectly reflects anthropogenic effects on trace metal contamination in sediments the higher concentrations and contamination levels of cd pb and zn in the sediments were mainly centralized in the upper section of the tgr from 2016 to 2020 fig 3 which corresponds to the main urban area of chongqing city relatively low ratios of 206pb 207pb which commonly represent anthropogenic signals in china were also observed in this area fig 6a chongqing city is one of the most developed cities and industrial centers where there are many medium sized enterprises involved in electroplating machinery manufacturing mineral mining smelting etc and coal is one of the main industrial fuel and energy sources in urban areas wang et al 2006 consequently the discharges of industrial and municipal sewage from the main urban area were markedly higher than those from other areas in the tgr region figure s5a which strongly supports the anthropogenic contribution of cd pb and zn in the sediments moreover we also sampled the sediments in the upper outside the tgr the background site at zhutuo from 2016 to 2020 and the results showed that the concentrations of all trace metals in the sediments were notably lower at the background site than in the wlf zone despite a small temporal difference table s3 this indicates that the distant inputs of trace metals from the upper yangtze river had a limited contribution to metal contamination in the sediments of the tgr relative to the main urban area in addition relatively high contamination levels of trace metals were observed in the middle section of the tgr during 2016 2020 and in areas near the dam in 2014 and 2020 fig 5 agricultural and animal husbandry industries may have caused trace metal accumulation in the sediments of the middle section which features a relatively flat and wide area via runoff and or seepage however the high values in the areas near the dam were possibly associated with the high geological background levels of the trace metals in the host rock limestone considering the fewer cities and less developed industries bao et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 4 2 regulation of sedimentary dynamics on the spatiotemporal distribution of trace metals in this study we observed that the concentrations and contamination of trace metals in the sediments increased markedly after the full impoundment stage of the tgr relative to the early stage especially for cd which reached its highest contamination in 2018 and then decreased in 2020 fig 2 table 2 as discussed above the sediments from the upper yangtze river commonly contain fewer trace metals and are regarded as a clean provenance in that they limit the contribution of trace metals to the wlf zone of the tgr therefore the decreased distant inputs of sediments and their bound trace metals from the upper yangtze river further enlarges the role of anthropogenic contribution in the urban area in metal accumulation in the sediments this was also supported by the negative or non significant correlation of anthropogenic metals e g cd pb and zn with al and fe in 2018 and 2020 fig 7 however sediment inputs from the upper yangtze river may have two contrasting effects on the accumulation of anthropogenic metals in the sediments as was observed for 2018 and 2020 according to the sediment discharge data from the monitoring stations there was a marked increase in the fluxes of sediment discharge in both 2018 and 2020 and the fluxes were much higher in 2020 than in 2018 figure s6 thus we infer that the increased sediment fluxes along with the finer grain size in 2018 accelerated the adsorption and deposition of anthropogenic metals in the wlf zone while the higher sediment inputs and a slightly coarser grain size in 2020 relative to those in 2018 diluted the concentrations of these metals this is also supported by the non significant difference in pb concentrations between 2018 and 2020 but the significantly lower 206pb 207pb ratios in 2020 relative to those in 2018 fig 2 table s2 spatially three distribution patterns of anthropogenic metals cd pb and zn were observed in the sediments of the wlf zone over the four years fig 3 although human activities in the urban area of the tgr have become the major driver of trace metal accumulation in the sediments the variations in the particle composition of sediments are considered to drive the trace metal distribution in the wlf zone this is because fine grained sediments have a relatively large specific surface area beckingham et al 2016 and they can adsorb and transport trace metals at further distances our previous study found that with a decrease in the grain sizes the fine particles in the sediments which consisted of scattered coatings in a squama shape with more ridges channels and pores tended to be more complex in terms of surface morphology and structure wang et al 2020 in the present study we also observed that the proportion of fine particles in sediments increased significantly with increasing impoundment time moreover the contents of fine particles al and fe relatively high element composition in mineral displayed a clear spatial variation with distance to the dam from 2014 to 2020 fig 1 namely their contents gradually increased from upstream to downstream of the tgr in 2014 while relatively higher contents appeared further from the dam after 2014 especially in 2018 when higher values were observed in the middle and upper sections considering that the sediments entering the tgr decreased sharply but the runoff did not vary significantly in 2014 figure s6 the sampled sediments in 2014 probably recorded the signal before 2014 with the higher contents of relatively coarse particles when compared with other years as a result the fine particles were transported long distances to the near dam areas resulting in the high deposition of bound trace metals with the continuous sediment interception by the cascade reservoirs and the water and soil conservation measures implemented in the upper yangtze river and the increasing fine particles under the decrease in flow velocity in the middle and upper sections the trace metals emitted by local human activities can be adsorbed by fine grained sediments and promptly deposited in the wlf zone overall anthropogenic emissions in the main urban area of the tgr have become a main driver of the spatial distribution of trace metals in the sediments of the wlf zone while sediment composition regulates the transportation and deposition of anthropogenic metals recently increasing research with model prediction has revealed a decreasing trend of sediment inputs into the tgr tian et al 2021 which may stress the human disturbance on trace metal accumulation in sediments however two issues must be noted when evaluating the sedimentary dynamics of trace metal distribution in the sediments of the wlf zone first fluvial sediments can store substantial trace metals which may introduce a lag period into the transport and deposition of trace metals thus legacy metal contamination in the sediments may have affected their spatial distribution it should be noted that we have considered this issue by collecting surface sediments every two years second extreme climate events and their induced flooding in the upper yangtze river have evidently increased in recent years li et al 2021 therefore also significantly affecting the runoff and sediment discharges in the tgr region for example relative to the periods before 2014 the annual precipitation in the tgr area generally increased according to the local weather stations figure s7 a and b more importantly extreme precipitation events increased markedly in the summer although the annual precipitation did not change significantly or even decreased figure s7 c and d in particular rainfall in 2020 caused five flooding events with discharges over 50 000 m3 s in the yangtze river basin xia and chen 2021 and the station of cuntan in the upper yangtze river recorded the second highest water level since 1892 bulletin of the sediments in the yangtze river http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb 2020 gb these extreme events have resulted in evident variations in runoff and sediment discharges in the tgr figure s6 which is a potential driver of the changes in the deposition and distribution of anthropogenic metals therefore in addition to long term monitoring of sediment inputs from the upper yangtze river the annual sediment dynamics regulated by extreme climate must be considered to prevent trace metal contamination in the aquatic environment 4 3 attenuation of trace metal contamination in water driven by sedimentary dynamics the tgr operation features an anti seasonal water level regulation with the lowest in the wet seasons and the highest in the dry seasons which may cause trace metals in the sediments to be released to the overlying water via diffusion dissolution and exchange especially at high water levels and relatively anaerobic conditions the positive relationship between anthropogenic metals in the water and their labile fractions in the sediments confirms the direct contribution of trace metal release from sediments to the overlying water figure s3 however according to the trace metal concentrations in the water water quality is generally at an acceptable level for aquatic organisms in the tgr table 1 when compared with other reports using the health risk index zhao et al 2017 2020 there was no potential health risk of the studied trace metals for the local population meanwhile we also observed a decreasing trend of the trace metal concentrations since dam construction and the decrease was much more significant after the full impoundment stage table 1 which indicates that dam construction may be unexpectedly conducive to improving the water quality away from trace metal contamination in contrast we found the opposite case of trace metal accumulation in the sediments after dam construction fig 2 this suggests that the decrease in trace metals in the water may be closely associated with the sedimentary dynamics under the current flow regulation of the tgr which has altered the hydrological conditions and sediment deposition deng et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 and the migration and accumulation of trace metals in the aquatic environment after the full impoundment operation of the tgr the flow velocity of the water decreased notably tang et al 2016 xiang et al 2021 which increased the retention time of the sediments in the water and the sediment sorting and deposition the recent study found that the suspended sediment concentration has declined by an order magnitude from 1 0 to 0 1 kg m3 in the heavily dammed changjiang fluvial system in recent three decades sun et al 2021 in this study the increased content of fine grained sediments from 2014 to 2020 also supports the increased deposition of fine particles in the tgr fig 1 considering the high adsorption capacity of fine particles for the elements the decreasing concentrations of trace metals in the water are mainly attributed to the elevated water retention time and sediment adsorption of the metals although the spatial distribution of trace metals was similar in the water and sediments the concentrations of individual metals were not significantly correlated between the water and the sediments especially for anthropogenic metals except zn on the one hand the higher concentrations of trace metals such as cd pb and zn in the water of the upper tgr further confirm the complex effects of anthropogenic emissions on their accumulation in the sediments on the other hand dynamic variations in the fluxes and particle composition of sediments may modulate the deposition of fine particle adsorbed metals specifically the content of fine grained sediments in the middle and upper sections of the tgr increased from 2014 to 2020 fig 1 the trace metals emitted by local human activities can be adsorbed in these fine grained sediments and dynamically deposited in the wlf zone especially in the high water level season with decreased flow velocity and subsequent backflow bao et al 2015 which is a probable reason for the non significant relationship of each metal between the water and the sediments therefore the sedimentary dynamics in the tgr have great potential for regulating trace metal contamination in water meanwhile our results indicate that under the effects of the cascade dams constructed in the upper yangtze river the decrease in the sediment fluxes mainly the decreased sediments with large grain sizes and the increase in the fine sediment content contributed to the good water quality in the tgr 5 conclusions in this study we found a significant decrease in trace metal concentrations in the water of the tgr mainstream especially since the dam operation whereas the concentrations and contamination of anthropogenic metals e g cd pb zn and cu in the sediments of the wlf zone increased notably as expected spatiotemporal variations in the contamination of these metals highlighted the importance of human activities in the urban area of the tgr moreover the dynamic variations in the fluxes and composition of sediments under periodic and anti seasonal flow regulation as well as extreme climate modulated the distribution patterns of trace metals in the sediments in contrast to our previously thought the higher anthropogenic contribution to trace metals relative to natural inputs did not negatively affect water quality which may be closely related to the fine sediment composition with increasing impoundment time our results suggest that large dam construction in riverine systems such as the tgr probably prevents trace metal contamination from the water environment by regulating the fluxes and composition of sediments however the adsorption and release capacity of sediments for the trace metals over the long term still needs to be considered under in situ periodic water level fluctuations in the future our results can serve as a foundation for future environmental impact assessments resulting from dam induced river

16031,as a reductive fe ii bearing mineral green rust gr is able to reduce halogenated compounds in anoxic subsurface environments the redox condition of subsurface environment often changes from anoxic to oxic due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances but the interaction of gr with halogenated compounds in oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions has not been studied this study reveals that gr can sequester tbp for a short time 4 to 10 h under anoxic conditions later gr undergoes structural transformation to ferrihydrite and magnetite with the desorption of tbp gr derived iron hydr oxides can generate 33 8 μm of oh upon 50 h exposure to dioxygen which leads to 67 of oxidative degradation of tbp the anoxic to oxic transition during the tbp adsorption process initiates the tbp desorption immediately and also results in the oxidative degradation of tbp via the production of oh the oxygenation of gr immediately forms magnetite which activate dioxygen to produce oh also the gr derived magnetite acts as a fe ii source and free fe ii in solution and fe ii adsorbed on magnetite surface both contribute to dioxygen activation this work provides vital evidence on the role of gr in the fate and transformation of tbp in redox alternating subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrous mineral tribromophenol adsorption desorption dioxygen activation anoxic to oxic transition 1 introduction green rust gr is a layered iron hydroxide consisting of positively charged layers of iron ii iron iii hydroxide and hydrated anion interlayers hansen et al 1996 refait et al 1998 due to its layered double hydroxide ldh structure gr has an excellent adsorption property for organic or inorganic pollutants gr adsorbs pollutants mainly through ligand exchange surface complexation or anion exchange gasser et al 2008 seida and nakano 2000 previous studies have shown that gr has an adsorption effect on arsenate arsenite jonsson and sherman 2008 wang et al 2010 silicate and phosphate fang et al 2021 yin et al 2018 in addition due to the presence of highly active structural fe ii in the iron ii iron iii hydroxide gr has a strong reducing activity o loughlin et al 2007 thus gr plays an important role in controlling the mobility and toxicity of various pollutants in the soil and groundwater environment under anoxic conditions these pollutants include inorganic and organic pollutants such as nitrate and nitrite anions hansen et al 1994 hansen et al 2001 chlorinated methane erbs et al 1999 chlorinated ethylene and chlorinated ethane lee and batchelor 2002 o loughlin and burris 2004 and various heavy metals including cr vi se vi u vi beck et al 2008 refait et al 2003 ruby et al 2010 at present most of the studies on gr are conducted in an oxygen free environment while there are very few studies on the oxidative transformation of pollutants induced by gr under oxidizing conditions fang et al 2021 when the environment changes from anoxic to oxic the highly redox sensitive gr will rapidly transform into other more stable iron hydro oxides refait et al 2003 ruby et al 2010 however most of the previous studies ignored the possible oxidative transformation of pollutants that gr may induce under oxidizing conditions our recent study has shown that gr oxygenation in the presence of phosphate can generate hydroxyl radicals oh fang et al 2021 resulting in the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants nevertheless all previous studies on gr are limited to a single environment either anoxic or oxic however the real subsurface environment is subject to natural or anthropogenic disturbances such as surface water groundwater interaction groundwater level fluctuations artificial groundwater recharge hydraulic engineering and artificially induced dry wet alternation beck et al 2008 hester and gooseff 2010 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 once these kinds of disturbance occur the subsurface environment may change from anoxic to oxic previous studies show the anoxic to oxic transition leads to oh production via oxygenation of various fe ii minerals such as fes siderite magnetite ligand complexed fe ii and pyrite cheng et al 2016 guo et al 2013 ona nguema et al 2010 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 specifically the oxygenation of fes can produce oh and lead to the formation of a gr like phase jeong et al 2010 however the contribution of gr to the production of oh has been ignored in jeong et al s work as a member of fe ii minerals gr may potentially activate molecular o2 to produce oh but this process has been scarcely studied consequently the oxidative transformation of pollutants resulted from oh produced from gr oxygenation has not been fully understood 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp as a flame retardant intermediate is often used in electronic products halden et al 2010 because of the widespread use of tbp it exists in numerous environmental substrates such as soil sediment and groundwater ronen et al 2005 sim et al 2009 relatively high concentrations of tbp have even been detected in human plasma and milk gao et al 2015 ho et al 2015 tbp can accumulate in organisms has high toxicity and strong carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects once tbp enters the environment it will pose a long term threat to humans and the ecological environment thus the detoxification of tbp has increasingly attracted global attention zou et al 2016 the stable c br bonds in tbp are the reason for its toxicity and persistence and debromination with the breakage of the c br bonds is essential to detoxify tbp various detoxification processes have been studied such as biological yamada et al 2008 electrochemical processes and photocatalytic degradation gao et al 2013 konstantinov et al 2008 however biodegradation requires a long time and relatively pure strains li et al 2015 electrochemical and photocatalytic processes are relatively complex and costly saeed et al 2016 the interaction between gr and tbp during anoxic oxic alternating conditions could exert a profound influence on the fate and transformation of tbp in the subsurface environment feder et al 2005 but this interaction has never been investigated in this work the interactions between gr and tbp under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions were studied the adsorption desorption redox reactions processes under these environmental relevant conditions were fully characterized and relevant mechanisms were revealed this study deepens our understanding of the impact of gr on the fate and transformation of tbp under redox alternating subsurface environment and also provides guidance for the gr mediated remediation of tbp contaminated groundwater and soil 2 materials and

ultrapure water electrical conductivity 18 25 mω cm were used througout the experiements 2 2 synthesis of gr the synthesis of gr was carried out via a previously reported coprecipitation method yin et al 2017a briefly 400 ml of water 2 1 g of glycine and 5 8 g of nacl were added into a glass bottle with a volume of 500 ml the solution mixture was n2 bubbled for 1 h the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 using 1 m naoh subsequently 25 ml of 0 5 m fecl2 solution and 20 ml of 0 1 m fecl3 add 5 ml each time were added the ph was maintained at 8 throughout the addition of naoh and n2 was continuously bubbled to avoid any possible oxidation during the synthesis the as synthesized gr suspensions were immediately transported into an anoxic glovebox mikrouna china filled with n2 99 999 and stirred at 200 rpm using a teflon coated magnetic bar for half an hour to remove any remaining o2 gr suspensions were washed with oxygen free water three times before use the added glycine was removed after washing treatment which was confirmed in our previous study yin et al 2017b the stability and purity of gr was checked by xrd analysis prior to the reaction experiments xrd results show the characteristic peaks of green rust are intact before and after one week storage fig s1 furthermore all the observed peaks are from gr without the formation of any other iron oxides confirming the high stability of the gr during preparation and storage the content of fe ii was 150 mm and the ratio of fe ii fe iii was 3 the dosage of gr suspensions was calculated according to the actual content of fe ii each time to ensure a dosage of 10 mm of fe ii gr 2 3 interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic conditions sample preparation was carried out in the anoxic glove box for experiments carried out under anoxic conditions reaction suspensions were prepared in a 100 ml reaction bottle with an effective volume of 50 ml and a headspace filled with n2 one mm of tbp stock solution was prepared at alkali conditions the detail for the preparation of tbp stock solution is given in text s1 deionized water was added into the reaction bottle followed by the addition of 0 5 ml of 1 mm tbp the solution ph was adjusted to 8 using 0 1 m hcl then gr suspension was added to obtain a fe ii gr concentration of 10 mm in a 50 ml reaction solution the solution ph was adjusted to 8 again and not controlled during the reaction the sealed reactor is wrapped with tin foil to avoid any potential photochemical side reactions the reaction bottles were put on a shaker at 150 rpm to initiate the reaction 2 4 interaction between gr and tbp under oxic conditions the preparation of the reaction suspensions is the same as that for anoxic conditions except for an air filled headspace the production of oh under oxic conditions was identified by radical quenching and capture experiments in which 100 mm ethanol and 10 mm benzoic acid ba was added respectively at predetermined time intervals 1 ml of the reaction suspensions were collected and immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe filter followed by the determination of p hydroxybenzoic acid and tbp the influence of the added cl during ph adjustment on oh production can be omitted fig s2 2 5 interactions between gr and tbp during anoxic to oxic transition the preparation of the reaction suspensions is the same as that for anoxic conditions after the anoxic treatment for 1 h 4 h 7 h and 6 d the headspace of reaction bottles was filled with air to trigger the anoxic to oxic transition the tbp concentration was determined at predetermined time intervals all experiments were carried out at least in duplicate 2 6 analytical methods the concentration of fe ii gr was determined photometrically using o

electrochemical cell consisted of 20 ml of 0 5 m na2so4 solution as a supporting electrolyte the electrochemical characterization of redox sensitive samples was done under anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte was removed by n2 bubbling for 30 min to obtain anoxic conditions the anoxic conditions during the electrochemical measurement were maintained by n2 flushing above the liquid surface in the electrochemical cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic conditions 3 1 1 adsorption desorption of tbp about 75 of tbp was removed by gr within 4 h under anoxic conditions and no br were detected in the whole process indicating that tbp was not degraded thus tbp was removed by gr via adsorption under anoxic conditions after 7 h of interaction the concentration of tbp in the solution increased slowly which may result from its desorption from the gr surface the concentration of the desorbed tbp reached 80 of the initial concentration after 24 h and remained at 86 after 6 d this adsorption desorption phenomenon further confirms that no redox reaction occurs during the interaction of gr with tbp under anoxic conditions fig 1 a the adsorption of tbp by gr could be attributed to the intrinsic properties of gr gr has a positively charged octahedral iron hydroxide layer in which some divalent iron ions are replaced by trivalent iron ions gr adsorbs pollutants mainly through ligand exchange surface complexation or anion exchange gasser et al 2008 seida and nakano 2000 liang reported that organic compounds containing phenolic functional groups can be adsorbed on the surface and interlayer space of gr liang and butler 2010 xrd data shows that gr was partially transformed to magnetite after interacting with tbp for 24 h under anoxic conditions fig 2 a leading to the collapse of the layered structure and a decrease in its adsorption capacity for tbp the charge variation of gr suspensions due to mineralogical variation was further revealed by zeta potential analysis fig 3 a the zeta potential decreased slowly in the first 10 h but decreased significantly at 24 h from 44 mv to 39 mv this variation of zeta potential was in line with the desorption of tbp and the mineralogical variation as shown by xrd fig 2a these results confirmed that the transformation of gr to stable iron hydr oxides may result in a less positively charged surface leading to a diminished electrostatic interaction between gr and tbp followed by the desorption of tbp from gr surface in addition to reflecting the surface charge of the suspension particles the absolute value of zeta potential also reflects the stability of the suspension system the decrease in the zeta potential of the reaction suspensions at 24 h also indicated that the suspension became less stable and easy to agglomerate leading to the increase of particle size which was confirmed by the particle size measurement fig 3d all the above changes i e less positively charged surface collapse of the layered structure agglomerate are not conducive to the adsorption of tbp furthermore mössbauer spectroscopic analysis confirms that gr was transformed to ferrihydrite after 24 h of interaction with tbp fig 4 a the determined mössbauer parameters are in line with that reported for ferrihydrite isomer shift 0 48 mm s 1 quadrupole split 0 04 mm s 1 and magnetic field 47 4 t schwertman et al 2004 ferrihydrite is a poorly crystallized iron hydroxide which can be identified by mössbauer spectroscopic analysis rather than xrd analysis previous studies show that the oxidation of gr by cr vi or dissolved oxygen leads to its transformation to ferrihydrite abdelmoula et al 1996 loyaux lawniczak et al 2000 refait et al 2003 in our work ferrihydrite could be formed via dissolution recrystallization pathway since large amounts of fe ii was dissolved during the gr tbp interaction under anoxic conditions fig 3b also the presence of structural fe ii 10 observed by mössbauer spectroscopic analysis is in line with the presence of gr residues which is also confirmed by xrd table1 fig 2a less amount of fe ii was observed in mössbauer measurement which is resulted from the discarded supernatant during sample preparation text s3 fig s3 part of the fe ii was dissolved into the aqueous solution during the transformation of gr fig 3b it was also found that more fe ii was dissolved than fe iii which could be precipitated as ferrihydrite as confirmed by mössbauer spectra fig 4a the xrd patterns of gr with and without tbp after aging for 10 h 24 h 30 h and 50 h were conducted fig 2a b the aging of gr without tbp lead to its partial transformation to magnetite after 24 hours and the color of the gr suspensions turned black gr can be transformed to magnetite under anoxic conditions through dissolution reprecipitation mechanism sumoondur et al 2008 however the characteristic peaks of gr are evident even after 50 h of aging suggesting a intact gr structure fig 2b for the aging of gr with tbp the transformation from gr to magnetite start after 10 h the characteristic peaks of gr became significantly weak after 30 h of interaction with tbp and disappeared after 50 h fig 2a only the characteristic peaks of magnetite were observed in the xrd patterns at 50 h and a large part of gr was transformed to poorly crystallized ferrihydrite as shown by mössbauer data table 1 the structural transformation of gr conforms with the desorption of tbp along the aging course the desorption of tbp begins at 10 h and 85 of desorption occurred after 50 h indicating that the unique gr structure is essential for tbp adsorption once the structure of gr collapses and transformed into other iron minerals tbp desorption occurs although gr can transform into more stable iron hydr oxides along aging time its interaction with tbp can accelerate this transformation process 3 1 2 effect of gr dosage on the adsorption desorption of tbp the lower the concentration of gr the faster the adsorption and the subsequent desorption of tbp also the color turns into black faster for low concentration gr compared to concentrated gr during the ageing interestingly the lower the concentration of fe ii gr the larger the maximum adsorption capacity of gr for tbp gr with a fe ii gr concentration of 2 mm adsorbed 85 tbp within 1 h while that of 40 mm adsorbed 20 tbp fig 3c this phenomenon may be related to the different particle sizes of gr with different concentrations the particle size of gr increases with increasing the fe ii gr concentration the particle size of gr increased from 978 nm to 3245 nm with the concentration of gr increasing from 2 mm to 40 mm fig 3d the smaller the particle size the higher the surface area and the faster the adsorption however the particle size increase is about 3 times while the concentration increase is 20 times in this regard the concentration increase could lead to more pronounced influence on the tbp adsorption than particle size increase on the other hand fig s4 shows that the characteristic peaks of gr with fe ii gr concentrations of 20 mm and 40 mm were still evident after aging with tbp for 24 h in contrast the characteristic peaks of gr with fe ii gr concentrations of 2 mm and 5 mm were significantly weakened after 10 h furthermore gr with fe ii gr concentration of 2 mm was completely transformed after 25 h as no characteristic peaks of gr were observed thus it was confirmed that the lower the concentration of gr the faster the transformation of gr which led to a faster desorption of tbp from gr surface also the particle size of gr increases significantly after 50 h of reaction with tbp fig 3d further indicating the transformation of gr to other iron hydr oxides 3 2 interaction between gr and tbp under oxic conditions 3 2 1 degradation of tbp by gr under oxic conditions gr continuously removed tbp in an oxic environment with a removal efficiency of 65 after 24 h fig 1b no desorption of tbp occurs during the long term interaction which is different from the phenomenon observed under anoxic conditions fig 1b thus tbp may be degraded rather than adsorbed by gr under oxic conditions which is confirmed by the br production along the tbp removal process after 50 h of reaction the concentration of released br gradually increased to 10 µm fig 5 a 3 2 2 oxidation products of gr xrd data shows that gr was immediately transformed to magnetite hematite and lepidocrocite after interacting with tbp under oxic conditions fig 2c gr was rapidly oxidized by dissolved oxygen to more stable iron hydr oxides which can degrade tbp under oxic conditions the characteristic peaks of gr were not observed in the xrd patterns of the final product produced under oxic conditions confirming the complete oxidation of gr with the collapse of the layer structure in order to further distinguish the structural difference of the final transformed products under anoxic and oxic environments mössbauer measurements were performed at 13 k and room temperature fig 4 and table 1 and the results show that the transformed products consist of maghemite and lepidocrocite since the néel temperature tn for lepidocrocite is relatively low 77 k lepidocrocite presents a paramagnetic doublet at room temperature and a magnetically ordered sextet at 13 k these mössbauer parameters are consistent with the data of maghemite and lepidocrocite reported by others cannas et al 2011 murad and schwertmann 1984 the results show that maghemite accounts for most of the products 70 ardo et al 2015 showed that nano sized magnetite could activate dioxygen to initiate heterogeneous fenton like reaction under oxic conditions for pollutant degradation and the magnetite was transformed to maghemite after reaction in our work gr was rapidly oxidized to magnetite upon exposure to air the in situ generated magnetite may activate dioxygen to produce reactive oxygen species for tbp degradation and the magnetite is eventually transformed to maghemite as verified by mössbauer analysis aged commercial magnetite and hematite have no reactivity for tbp degradation under the same conditions even though commercial magnetite shows the same xrd patterns as the gr transformed products under oxic conditions fig 1e it demonstrates that the in situ production of magnetite from gr is essential for dioxygen activation 3 2 3 effects of reaction parameters the initial ph has no obvious influence on the removal of tbp by gr under oxic conditions fig 5b once gr suspensions were exposed to air gr was rapidly oxidized to magnetite as a result the reaction suspensions undergo a quick ph drop to 4 and a color change to black therefore the initial ph has little influence on the later degradation process this is in consistent with the experimental results reported by ardo et al 2015 the authors observed that the ph value of nano magnetite suspensions decreases significantly from 6 5 7 0 to 4 0 under oxic conditions although the oxidation of magnetite to maghemite does not lead to a decrease of ph eq 1 the oxidation of fe2 and the precipitation of fe iii in aqueous solutions lead to the release of protons eq 2 1 f e 3 o 4 s 1 4 o 2 aq 3 2 γ f e 2 o 3 2 fe aq 2 1 4 o 2 h 2 o 1 2 γ f e 2 o 3 2 h the effect of fe ii gr concentration on the degradation of tbp was also investigated under oxic environments the degradation efficiency of tbp is almost the same for the fe ii gr dosages of 5 mm and 10 mm 67 after 50 h of reaction when the fe ii gr dosage increased to 20 mm and 40 mm the removal efficiency of tbp increased to 75 and 80 respectively fig 5c in addition the br concentration in the final reaction solutions increased with the increase of gr dosage fig 5d demonstrating the increased oxidation power with increasing gr dosage under oxic conditions thus more active magnetite can be produced with the increase of gr dosage higher amount of structural fe ii in magnetite could lead to the production of higher amount of oh which is in line with our previous studies fang et al 2021 3 2 4 identification of oh in order to verify the production of oh under oxic conditions the hydroxylation of benzoic acid ba to p hydroxybenzoic acid p 4hba was used to quantify the cumulative concentration of oh the cumulative oh concentration gradually increased to 33 8 μm along the 50 h of reaction however this concentration decreased 81 2 to a value of 6 4 μm when 1 m ethanol an effective oh scavenger was added into the reaction suspensions fig 6 a these results confirm the generation of oh during the oxygenation of gr note that the oh increased continuously during the 50 h of oxygenation but xrd data shows that gr is immediately transformed to magnetite after exposure to air and the formed magnetite is stable under oxic conditions fig 2c thus it is concluded that the gr transformed magnetite is responsible for the production of hydroxyl radicals via dioxygen activation the production of oh is consistent with the production of br along the oxygenation process which demonstrates that oh is responsible for the oxidative breakage of c br bonds in tbp subsequently 1 m ethanol was added into the reaction suspensions to further verify the role of oh in tbp degradation in the presence of the oh scavenger the degradation of tbp is significantly inhibited fig 6b 20 of tbp was removed in the presence of 1 m ethanol which could be attributed to the incomplete quenching of oh by 1m ethanol fig 6a the oh capture and quenching experiment both confirmed that the produced oh is responsible for the degradation of tbp during gr oxygenation the production of oh during gr oxygenation was compared with nano scale zero valent iron nzvi and other common fe ii bearing minerals fig 6c results show that the amount of oh produced per mm fe ii from gr oxygenation is 0 685 μm after 4 h of reaction and this efficiency of oh production is higher than fes2 pyrite and nzvi but lower than feco3 siderite and fes mackinawite cheng et al 2016 keenan and sedlak 2008 tong et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the relatively low efficiency of oh production for fes2 and nzvi is likely attributed to the surface passivation which is caused by the precipitation of elemental sulfur or the formation of passive oxide layers pham et al 2008 sun et al 2016 the oxidation rate of feco3 and fes is relatively fast and fe ii is almost completely oxidized within 4 h of oxygenation after 4 h of oxygenation feco3 and fes are fully oxidized and cannot further produce oh in comparison gr was rapidly oxidized into more stable magnetite under oxic conditions which continuously activated dioxygen to generate oh during the studied oxygenation period of 6 d 3 2 5 mechanisms of oh production in order to verify the active sites of the gr o2 system for oh production the oh production by oxygenation of fe2 magnetite and their mixture was studied the removal efficiency of tbp was 30 by fe2 oxygenation 40 by the oxygenation of fe2 magnetite mixture and 70 by gr oxygenation fig 7 a these results are in line with previous reports that the oxygenation of fe2 can produce h2o2 and eventually leads to the formation of oh via fenton reaction keenan and sedlak 2008 the ex situ synthesized magnetite alone cannot activate dioxygen but the presence of ex situ synthesized magnetite enhanced the tbp degradation during fe2 oxygenation fig 7a which may be due to the adsorption of fe2 on the surface of magnetite the existence of surfaces could accelerate the reaction between fe2 and o2 which favor the production of oh keenan and sedlak 2008 note that the oxidative degradation of tbp induced by the oxygenation of added fe2 or fe2 magnetite mixture was ceased within 1 h but tbp was continuously degraded by gr oxygenation during the studied time period 50 h free fe ii could be in situ released during the interaction between gr magnetite and tbp fig 3b and the slow released fe2 and their adsorption on the surface of magnetite may play an important role in dioxygen activation previous studies have reported that oh can be produced by both dissolved and mineral adsorbed fe ii keenan and sedlak 2008 also ardo et al reported that dioxygen can be activated by aqueous fe2 ions released from magnetite and fe2 adsorbed on magnetite surface ardo et al 2015 similarly the gr derived magnetite could act as a fe ii source and free fe ii in solution and fe ii adsorbed on magnetite surface may both contribute to dioxygen activation since the fe ii adsorbed on magnetite surface can exchange with the structural fe ii on magnetite surface gorski and scherer 2009 williams and scherer 2004 the difference between their contribution to dioxygen activation can be hardly distinguishable our results also suggest that the structural fe ii on magnetite surface is responsible for dioxygen activation mössbauer spectroscopic analysis show that the oxidation products of gr derived magnetite consist of maghemite and lepidocrocite table 1 therefore the oxygenation of magnetite could produce maghemite with the formation of oh as reported by ardo et al 2015 the reduction of o2 on gr derived products was characterized by linear scanning voltammetry under oxic conditions fig 7b fig s5 the reduction of o2 on commercial magnetite is negligible as shown by the tiny peak at 0 2v in contrast a prominent cathodic peak at 0 2v resulted from o2 reduction was observed for gr derived magnetite 1 h and 10 h oxidation sample this cathodic peak was not observed under anoxic conditions fig s5 a similar reduction peak was observed for the reduction of o2 to h2o2 on the surface of pyrite zhang et al 2016 indicating the reduction of o2 by gr derived magnetite may also undergo a two electron transfer process the o2 reduction peak was not observed for the 50 h oxidized gr sample demonstrating its diminished activity for o2 activation 3 2 6 debromination pathway of tbp hplc ms was used to determine the degradation intermediates of tbp under oxic conditions the molecule with an m z of 328 8 was correspond to tbp two main intermediate products at m z 266 8 and m z 187 were detected which corresponded to 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and 2 bromo 1 4 benzoquinone respectively fig s6 these results revealed that tbp degradation occurred via the c br cleavage and hydroxyl substitution process the oxidative degradation pathway of tbp by gr under oxic conditions was proposed fig s7 gao et al 2013 3 3 interactions between gr and tbp during anoxic to oxic transition 3 3 1 anoxic to oxic transition during the tbp adsorption process the anoxic subsurface environment may change to oxic after disturbance by surface water groundwater interaction fluctuation of groundwater level and human activities therefore the impact of anoxic to oxic transition on the gr tbp interaction was investigated the gr tbp mixture was kept under anoxic conditions for 1 h 4 h and 7 h before applying oxic conditions fig 1c interestingly the tbp concentration in the solution increase immediately once the environment changes from anoxic to oxic fig 1c at the same time it is observed that gr was rapidly transformed with a color change to black the sudden increase in the concentration of tbp can be explained by the desorption of tbp resulting from the transformation of gr to other iron hydr oxides fig 2c this phenomenon is similar to the adsorption desorption process observed during the gr tbp interaction under anoxic conditions the difference is that the whole adsorption desorption process lasts for 6 d under anoxic conditions whereas the change to oxic conditions initiates the desorption immediately by transforming gr to more stable iron hydr oxides subsequently the desorbed tbp was degraded under oxic conditions and the degradation efficiency is 85 after 6 d regardless of the duration of the initial anoxic exposure these results demonstrate the possible interaction between gr and tbp during dioxygen intrusion in subsurface environment under anoxic environment gr can adsorb tbp for a short term 4 to 10 h once dioxygen is introduced tbp was desorbed from the gr surface immediately and released back into the environment however this increase of tbp concentration is short lived because the introduced dioxygen is activated by the transformed gr to produce oh leading to the oxidative degradation of tbp fig 8 3 3 2 anoxic to oxic transition after the desorption of tbp gr can sequester tbp for a short time 4 to 10 h before the desorption of tbp under anoxic conditions after the desorption equilibrium was established the final concentration of tbp is 86 of the initial tbp concentration these results show that gr cannot sequester tbp for a long time under anoxic conditions however the introduction of dioxygen into the system after the tbp desorption equilibrium led to the removal of tbp fig 1d the removal efficiency reached 75 after 70 h of reaction and no rebound of the tbp concentration was observed indicating the desorbed tbp underwent an oxidative degradation fig 1d the mössbauer and xrd data show that parts of gr were transformed to iron hydroxides including ferrihydrite magnetite after the gr tbp interaction under anoxic conditions for a long time fig 2a fig 4 upon the introduction of dioxygen the magnetite phase can active dioxygen to produce oh for oxidative degradation of tbp thus although the long time interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic conditions leads to the desorption of tbp and structural transformation of gr tbp could undergo an oxidative degradation once dioxygen is introduced into the gr tbp interaction system fig 8 4 conclusion gr can sequester tbp for a short time under anoxic conditions the followed desorption of tbp was resulted from the structural transformation of gr to more stable iron hydr oxides with aging the lower the concentration of gr the faster the adsorption and the subsequent desorption of tbp although gr can transform into more stable iron hydr oxides along aging time its interaction with tbp can accelerate this transformation process the oxygenation of gr suspensions leads to the oxidative degradation of tbp and the initial ph has no obvious influence on this degradation process the anoxic to oxic transition leads to the immediate structural transformation of gr to more stable iron hydr oxides resulting in the desorption of tbp and the activation of dioxygen with the generation of oh the reduction of o2 by gr derived magnetite undergo a two electron transfer process to produce oh whose presence is confirmed by both the radical capture and quenching experiment the generated oh is responsible for the oxidative degradation of tbp under oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions the anoxic to oxic transition after the full desorption of tbp can also result in the oxidative degradation of tbp this work provides key

16031,as a reductive fe ii bearing mineral green rust gr is able to reduce halogenated compounds in anoxic subsurface environments the redox condition of subsurface environment often changes from anoxic to oxic due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances but the interaction of gr with halogenated compounds in oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions has not been studied this study reveals that gr can sequester tbp for a short time 4 to 10 h under anoxic conditions later gr undergoes structural transformation to ferrihydrite and magnetite with the desorption of tbp gr derived iron hydr oxides can generate 33 8 μm of oh upon 50 h exposure to dioxygen which leads to 67 of oxidative degradation of tbp the anoxic to oxic transition during the tbp adsorption process initiates the tbp desorption immediately and also results in the oxidative degradation of tbp via the production of oh the oxygenation of gr immediately forms magnetite which activate dioxygen to produce oh also the gr derived magnetite acts as a fe ii source and free fe ii in solution and fe ii adsorbed on magnetite surface both contribute to dioxygen activation this work provides vital evidence on the role of gr in the fate and transformation of tbp in redox alternating subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrous mineral tribromophenol adsorption desorption dioxygen activation anoxic to oxic transition 1 introduction green rust gr is a layered iron hydroxide consisting of positively charged layers of iron ii iron iii hydroxide and hydrated anion interlayers hansen et al 1996 refait et al 1998 due to its layered double hydroxide ldh structure gr has an excellent adsorption property for organic or inorganic pollutants gr adsorbs pollutants mainly through ligand exchange surface complexation or anion exchange gasser et al 2008 seida and nakano 2000 previous studies have shown that gr has an adsorption effect on arsenate arsenite jonsson and sherman 2008 wang et al 2010 silicate and phosphate fang et al 2021 yin et al 2018 in addition due to the presence of highly active structural fe ii in the iron ii iron iii hydroxide gr has a strong reducing activity o loughlin et al 2007 thus gr plays an important role in controlling the mobility and toxicity of various pollutants in the soil and groundwater environment under anoxic conditions these pollutants include inorganic and organic pollutants such as nitrate and nitrite anions hansen et al 1994 hansen et al 2001 chlorinated methane erbs et al 1999 chlorinated ethylene and chlorinated ethane lee and batchelor 2002 o loughlin and burris 2004 and various heavy metals including cr vi se vi u vi beck et al 2008 refait et al 2003 ruby et al 2010 at present most of the studies on gr are conducted in an oxygen free environment while there are very few studies on the oxidative transformation of pollutants induced by gr under oxidizing conditions fang et al 2021 when the environment changes from anoxic to oxic the highly redox sensitive gr will rapidly transform into other more stable iron hydro oxides refait et al 2003 ruby et al 2010 however most of the previous studies ignored the possible oxidative transformation of pollutants that gr may induce under oxidizing conditions our recent study has shown that gr oxygenation in the presence of phosphate can generate hydroxyl radicals oh fang et al 2021 resulting in the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants nevertheless all previous studies on gr are limited to a single environment either anoxic or oxic however the real subsurface environment is subject to natural or anthropogenic disturbances such as surface water groundwater interaction groundwater level fluctuations artificial groundwater recharge hydraulic engineering and artificially induced dry wet alternation beck et al 2008 hester and gooseff 2010 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 once these kinds of disturbance occur the subsurface environment may change from anoxic to oxic previous studies show the anoxic to oxic transition leads to oh production via oxygenation of various fe ii minerals such as fes siderite magnetite ligand complexed fe ii and pyrite cheng et al 2016 guo et al 2013 ona nguema et al 2010 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 specifically the oxygenation of fes can produce oh and lead to the formation of a gr like phase jeong et al 2010 however the contribution of gr to the production of oh has been ignored in jeong et al s work as a member of fe ii minerals gr may potentially activate molecular o2 to produce oh but this process has been scarcely studied consequently the oxidative transformation of pollutants resulted from oh produced from gr oxygenation has not been fully understood 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp as a flame retardant intermediate is often used in electronic products halden et al 2010 because of the widespread use of tbp it exists in numerous environmental substrates such as soil sediment and groundwater ronen et al 2005 sim et al 2009 relatively high concentrations of tbp have even been detected in human plasma and milk gao et al 2015 ho et al 2015 tbp can accumulate in organisms has high toxicity and strong carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects once tbp enters the environment it will pose a long term threat to humans and the ecological environment thus the detoxification of tbp has increasingly attracted global attention zou et al 2016 the stable c br bonds in tbp are the reason for its toxicity and persistence and debromination with the breakage of the c br bonds is essential to detoxify tbp various detoxification processes have been studied such as biological yamada et al 2008 electrochemical processes and photocatalytic degradation gao et al 2013 konstantinov et al 2008 however biodegradation requires a long time and relatively pure strains li et al 2015 electrochemical and photocatalytic processes are relatively complex and costly saeed et al 2016 the interaction between gr and tbp during anoxic oxic alternating conditions could exert a profound influence on the fate and transformation of tbp in the subsurface environment feder et al 2005 but this interaction has never been investigated in this work the interactions between gr and tbp under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions were studied the adsorption desorption redox reactions processes under these environmental relevant conditions were fully characterized and relevant mechanisms were revealed this study deepens our understanding of the impact of gr on the fate and transformation of tbp under redox alternating subsurface environment and also provides guidance for the gr mediated remediation of tbp contaminated groundwater and soil 2 materials and

ultrapure water electrical conductivity 18 25 mω cm were used througout the experiements 2 2 synthesis of gr the synthesis of gr was carried out via a previously reported coprecipitation method yin et al 2017a briefly 400 ml of water 2 1 g of glycine and 5 8 g of nacl were added into a glass bottle with a volume of 500 ml the solution mixture was n2 bubbled for 1 h the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 using 1 m naoh subsequently 25 ml of 0 5 m fecl2 solution and 20 ml of 0 1 m fecl3 add 5 ml each time were added the ph was maintained at 8 throughout the addition of naoh and n2 was continuously bubbled to avoid any possible oxidation during the synthesis the as synthesized gr suspensions were immediately transported into an anoxic glovebox mikrouna china filled with n2 99 999 and stirred at 200 rpm using a teflon coated magnetic bar for half an hour to remove any remaining o2 gr suspensions were washed with oxygen free water three times before use the added glycine was removed after washing treatment which was confirmed in our previous study yin et al 2017b the stability and purity of gr was checked by xrd analysis prior to the reaction experiments xrd results show the characteristic peaks of green rust are intact before and after one week storage fig s1 furthermore all the observed peaks are from gr without the formation of any other iron oxides confirming the high stability of the gr during preparation and storage the content of fe ii was 150 mm and the ratio of fe ii fe iii was 3 the dosage of gr suspensions was calculated according to the actual content of fe ii each time to ensure a dosage of 10 mm of fe ii gr 2 3 interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic conditions sample preparation was carried out in the anoxic glove box for experiments carried out under anoxic conditions reaction suspensions were prepared in a 100 ml reaction bottle with an effective volume of 50 ml and a headspace filled with n2 one mm of tbp stock solution was prepared at alkali conditions the detail for the preparation of tbp stock solution is given in text s1 deionized water was added into the reaction bottle followed by the addition of 0 5 ml of 1 mm tbp the solution ph was adjusted to 8 using 0 1 m hcl then gr suspension was added to obtain a fe ii gr concentration of 10 mm in a 50 ml reaction solution the solution ph was adjusted to 8 again and not controlled during the reaction the sealed reactor is wrapped with tin foil to avoid any potential photochemical side reactions the reaction bottles were put on a shaker at 150 rpm to initiate the reaction 2 4 interaction between gr and tbp under oxic conditions the preparation of the reaction suspensions is the same as that for anoxic conditions except for an air filled headspace the production of oh under oxic conditions was identified by radical quenching and capture experiments in which 100 mm ethanol and 10 mm benzoic acid ba was added respectively at predetermined time intervals 1 ml of the reaction suspensions were collected and immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe filter followed by the determination of p hydroxybenzoic acid and tbp the influence of the added cl during ph adjustment on oh production can be omitted fig s2 2 5 interactions between gr and tbp during anoxic to oxic transition the preparation of the reaction suspensions is the same as that for anoxic conditions after the anoxic treatment for 1 h 4 h 7 h and 6 d the headspace of reaction bottles was filled with air to trigger the anoxic to oxic transition the tbp concentration was determined at predetermined time intervals all experiments were carried out at least in duplicate 2 6 analytical methods the concentration of fe ii gr was determined photometrically using o

malvern x ray diffractometer xpert pro in the range of 5 70 the mössbauer measurements were performed at room temperature and 13 k using a conventional spectrometer germany wissel ms 500 and the obtained spectra were fitted by the software recoil using voigt based fitting vbf analysis rancourt and ping 1991 the sample under anoxic conditions was put into a vacuum bag and sealed by the vacuum sealing machine in the glove box to avoid oxidation before xrd and mössbauer analysis the reduction of o2 on the gr surface was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry cv the oxidation products of gr or commercial magnetite were deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode and used as the working electrode the counter and reference electrodes were pt plate and ag agcl electrode respectively the electrochemical cell consisted of 20 ml of 0 5 m na2so4 solution as a supporting electrolyte the electrochemical characterization of redox sensitive samples was done under anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte was removed by n2 bubbling for 30 min to obtain anoxic conditions the anoxic conditions during the electrochemical measurement were maintained by n2 flushing above the liquid surface in the electrochemical cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic conditions 3 1 1 adsorption desorption of tbp about 75 of tbp was removed by gr within 4 h under anoxic conditions and no br were detected in the whole process indicating that tbp was not degraded thus tbp was removed by gr via adsorption under anoxic conditions after 7 h of interaction the concentration of tbp in the solution increased slowly which may result from its desorption from the gr surface the concentration of the desorbed tbp reached 80 of the initial concentration after 24 h and remained at 86 after 6 d this adsorption desorption phenomenon further confirms that no redox reaction occurs during the interaction of gr with tbp under anoxic conditions fig 1 a the adsorption of tbp by gr could be attributed to the intrinsic properties of gr gr has a positively charged octahedral iron hydroxide layer in which some divalent iron ions are replaced by trivalent iron ions gr adsorbs pollutants mainly through ligand exchange surface complexation or anion exchange gasser et al 2008 seida and nakano 2000 liang reported that organic compounds containing phenolic functional groups can be adsorbed on the surface and interlayer space of gr liang and butler 2010 xrd data shows that gr was partially transformed to magnetite after interacting with tbp for 24 h under anoxic conditions fig 2 a leading to the collapse of the layered structure and a decrease in its adsorption capacity for tbp the charge variation of gr suspensions due to mineralogical variation was further revealed by zeta potential analysis fig 3 a the zeta potential decreased slowly in the first 10 h but decreased significantly at 24 h from 44 mv to 39 mv this variation of zeta potential was in line with the desorption of tbp and the mineralogical variation as shown by xrd fig 2a these results confirmed that the transformation of gr to stable iron hydr oxides may result in a less positively charged surface leading to a diminished electrostatic interaction between gr and tbp followed by the desorption of tbp from gr surface in addition to reflecting the surface charge of the suspension particles the absolute value of zeta potential also reflects the stability of the suspension system the decrease in the zeta potential of the reaction suspensions at 24 h also indicated that the suspension became less stable and easy to agglomerate leading to the increase of particle size which was confirmed by the particle size measurement fig 3d all the above changes i e less positively charged surface collapse of the layered structure agglomerate are not conducive to the adsorption of tbp furthermore mössbauer spectroscopic analysis confirms that gr was transformed to ferrihydrite after 24 h of interaction with tbp fig 4 a the determined mössbauer parameters are in line with that reported for ferrihydrite isomer shift 0 48 mm s 1 quadrupole split 0 04 mm s 1 and magnetic field 47 4 t schwertman et al 2004 ferrihydrite is a poorly crystallized iron hydroxide which can be identified by mössbauer spectroscopic analysis rather than xrd analysis previous studies show that the oxidation of gr by cr vi or dissolved oxygen leads to its transformation to ferrihydrite abdelmoula et al 1996 loyaux lawniczak et al 2000 refait et al 2003 in our work ferrihydrite could be formed via dissolution recrystallization pathway since large amounts of fe ii was dissolved during the gr tbp interaction under anoxic conditions fig 3b also the presence of structural fe ii 10 observed by mössbauer spectroscopic analysis is in line with the presence of gr residues which is also confirmed by xrd table1 fig 2a less amount of fe ii was observed in mössbauer measurement which is resulted from the discarded supernatant during sample preparation text s3 fig s3 part of the fe ii was dissolved into the aqueous solution during the transformation of gr fig 3b it was also found that more fe ii was dissolved than fe iii which could be precipitated as ferrihydrite as confirmed by mössbauer spectra fig 4a the xrd patterns of gr with and without tbp after aging for 10 h 24 h 30 h and 50 h were conducted fig 2a b the aging of gr without tbp lead to its partial transformation to magnetite after 24 hours and the color of the gr suspensions turned black gr can be transformed to magnetite under anoxic conditions through dissolution reprecipitation mechanism sumoondur et al 2008 however the characteristic peaks of gr are evident even after 50 h of aging suggesting a intact gr structure fig 2b for the aging of gr with tbp the transformation from gr to magnetite start after 10 h the characteristic peaks of gr became significantly weak after 30 h of interaction with tbp and disappeared after 50 h fig 2a only the characteristic peaks of magnetite were observed in the xrd patterns at 50 h and a large part of gr was transformed to poorly crystallized ferrihydrite as shown by mössbauer data table 1 the structural transformation of gr conforms with the desorption of tbp along the aging course the desorption of tbp begins at 10 h and 85 of desorption occurred after 50 h indicating that the unique gr structure is essential for tbp adsorption once the structure of gr collapses and transformed into other iron minerals tbp desorption occurs although gr can transform into more stable iron hydr oxides along aging time its interaction with tbp can accelerate this transformation process 3 1 2 effect of gr dosage on the adsorption desorption of tbp the lower the concentration of gr the faster the adsorption and the subsequent desorption of tbp also the color turns into black faster for low concentration gr compared to concentrated gr during the ageing interestingly the lower the concentration of fe ii gr the larger the maximum adsorption capacity of gr for tbp gr with a fe ii gr concentration of 2 mm adsorbed 85 tbp within 1 h while that of 40 mm adsorbed 20 tbp fig 3c this phenomenon may be related to the different particle sizes of gr with different concentrations the particle size of gr increases with increasing the fe ii gr concentration the particle size of gr increased from 978 nm to 3245 nm with the concentration of gr increasing from 2 mm to 40 mm fig 3d the smaller the particle size the higher the surface area and the faster the adsorption however the particle size increase is about 3 times while the concentration increase is 20 times in this regard the concentration increase could lead to more pronounced influence on the tbp adsorption than particle size increase on the other hand fig s4 shows that the characteristic peaks of gr with fe ii gr concentrations of 20 mm and 40 mm were still evident after aging with tbp for 24 h in contrast the characteristic peaks of gr with fe ii gr concentrations of 2 mm and 5 mm were significantly weakened after 10 h furthermore gr with fe ii gr concentration of 2 mm was completely transformed after 25 h as no characteristic peaks of gr were observed thus it was confirmed that the lower the concentration of gr the faster the transformation of gr which led to a faster desorption of tbp from gr surface also the particle size of gr increases significantly after 50 h of reaction with tbp fig 3d further indicating the transformation of gr to other iron hydr oxides 3 2 interaction between gr and tbp under oxic conditions 3 2 1 degradation of tbp by gr under oxic conditions gr continuously removed tbp in an oxic environment with a removal efficiency of 65 after 24 h fig 1b no desorption of tbp occurs during the long term interaction which is different from the phenomenon observed under anoxic conditions fig 1b thus tbp may be degraded rather than adsorbed by gr under oxic conditions which is confirmed by the br production along the tbp removal process after 50 h of reaction the concentration of released br gradually increased to 10 µm fig 5 a 3 2 2 oxidation products of gr xrd data shows that gr was immediately transformed to magnetite hematite and lepidocrocite after interacting with tbp under oxic conditions fig 2c gr was rapidly oxidized by dissolved oxygen to more stable iron hydr oxides which can degrade tbp under oxic conditions the characteristic peaks of gr were not observed in the xrd patterns of the final product produced under oxic conditions confirming the complete oxidation of gr with the collapse of the layer structure in order to further distinguish the structural difference of the final transformed products under anoxic and oxic environments mössbauer measurements were performed at 13 k and room temperature fig 4 and table 1 and the results show that the transformed products consist of maghemite and lepidocrocite since the néel temperature tn for lepidocrocite is relatively low 77 k lepidocrocite presents a paramagnetic doublet at room temperature and a magnetically ordered sextet at 13 k these mössbauer parameters are consistent with the data of maghemite and lepidocrocite reported by others cannas et al 2011 murad and schwertmann 1984 the results show that maghemite accounts for most of the products 70 ardo et al 2015 showed that nano sized magnetite could activate dioxygen to initiate heterogeneous fenton like reaction under oxic conditions for pollutant degradation and the magnetite was transformed to maghemite after reaction in our work gr was rapidly oxidized to magnetite upon exposure to air the in situ generated magnetite may activate dioxygen to produce reactive oxygen species for tbp degradation and the magnetite is eventually transformed to maghemite as verified by mössbauer analysis aged commercial magnetite and hematite have no reactivity for tbp degradation under the same conditions even though commercial magnetite shows the same xrd patterns as the gr transformed products under oxic conditions fig 1e it demonstrates that the in situ production of magnetite from gr is essential for dioxygen activation 3 2 3 effects of reaction parameters the initial ph has no obvious influence on the removal of tbp by gr under oxic conditions fig 5b once gr suspensions were exposed to air gr was rapidly oxidized to magnetite as a result the reaction suspensions undergo a quick ph drop to 4 and a color change to black therefore the initial ph has little influence on the later degradation process this is in consistent with the experimental results reported by ardo et al 2015 the authors observed that the ph value of nano magnetite suspensions decreases significantly from 6 5 7 0 to 4 0 under oxic conditions although the oxidation of magnetite to maghemite does not lead to a decrease of ph eq 1 the oxidation of fe2 and the precipitation of fe iii in aqueous solutions lead to the release of protons eq 2 1 f e 3 o 4 s 1 4 o 2 aq 3 2 γ f e 2 o 3 2 fe aq 2 1 4 o 2 h 2 o 1 2 γ f e 2 o 3 2 h the effect of fe ii gr concentration on the degradation of tbp was also investigated under oxic environments the degradation efficiency of tbp is almost the same for the fe ii gr dosages of 5 mm and 10 mm 67 after 50 h of reaction when the fe ii gr dosage increased to 20 mm and 40 mm the removal efficiency of tbp increased to 75 and 80 respectively fig 5c in addition the br concentration in the final reaction solutions increased with the increase of gr dosage fig 5d demonstrating the increased oxidation power with increasing gr dosage under oxic conditions thus more active magnetite can be produced with the increase of gr dosage higher amount of structural fe ii in magnetite could lead to the production of higher amount of oh which is in line with our previous studies fang et al 2021 3 2 4 identification of oh in order to verify the production of oh under oxic conditions the hydroxylation of benzoic acid ba to p hydroxybenzoic acid p 4hba was used to quantify the cumulative concentration of oh the cumulative oh concentration gradually increased to 33 8 μm along the 50 h of reaction however this concentration decreased 81 2 to a value of 6 4 μm when 1 m ethanol an effective oh scavenger was added into the reaction suspensions fig 6 a these results confirm the generation of oh during the oxygenation of gr note that the oh increased continuously during the 50 h of oxygenation but xrd data shows that gr is immediately transformed to magnetite after exposure to air and the formed magnetite is stable under oxic conditions fig 2c thus it is concluded that the gr transformed magnetite is responsible for the production of hydroxyl radicals via dioxygen activation the production of oh is consistent with the production of br along the oxygenation process which demonstrates that oh is responsible for the oxidative breakage of c br bonds in tbp subsequently 1 m ethanol was added into the reaction suspensions to further verify the role of oh in tbp degradation in the presence of the oh scavenger the degradation of tbp is significantly inhibited fig 6b 20 of tbp was removed in the presence of 1 m ethanol which could be attributed to the incomplete quenching of oh by 1m ethanol fig 6a the oh capture and quenching experiment both confirmed that the produced oh is responsible for the degradation of tbp during gr oxygenation the production of oh during gr oxygenation was compared with nano scale zero valent iron nzvi and other common fe ii bearing minerals fig 6c results show that the amount of oh produced per mm fe ii from gr oxygenation is 0 685 μm after 4 h of reaction and this efficiency of oh production is higher than fes2 pyrite and nzvi but lower than feco3 siderite and fes mackinawite cheng et al 2016 keenan and sedlak 2008 tong et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the relatively low efficiency of oh production for fes2 and nzvi is likely attributed to the surface passivation which is caused by the precipitation of elemental sulfur or the formation of passive oxide layers pham et al 2008 sun et al 2016 the oxidation rate of feco3 and fes is relatively fast and fe ii is almost completely oxidized within 4 h of oxygenation after 4 h of oxygenation feco3 and fes are fully oxidized and cannot further produce oh in comparison gr was rapidly oxidized into more stable magnetite under oxic conditions which continuously activated dioxygen to generate oh during the studied oxygenation period of 6 d 3 2 5 mechanisms of oh production in order to verify the active sites of the gr o2 system for oh production the oh production by oxygenation of fe2 magnetite and their mixture was studied the removal efficiency of tbp was 30 by fe2 oxygenation 40 by the oxygenation of fe2 magnetite mixture and 70 by gr oxygenation fig 7 a these results are in line with previous reports that the oxygenation of fe2 can produce h2o2 and eventually leads to the formation of oh via fenton reaction keenan and sedlak 2008 the ex situ synthesized magnetite alone cannot activate dioxygen but the presence of ex situ synthesized magnetite enhanced the tbp degradation during fe2 oxygenation fig 7a which may be due to the adsorption of fe2 on the surface of magnetite the existence of surfaces could accelerate the reaction between fe2 and o2 which favor the production of oh keenan and sedlak 2008 note that the oxidative degradation of tbp induced by the oxygenation of added fe2 or fe2 magnetite mixture was ceased within 1 h but tbp was continuously degraded by gr oxygenation during the studied time period 50 h free fe ii could be in situ released during the interaction between gr magnetite and tbp fig 3b and the slow released fe2 and their adsorption on the surface of magnetite may play an important role in dioxygen activation previous studies have reported that oh can be produced by both dissolved and mineral adsorbed fe ii keenan and sedlak 2008 also ardo et al reported that dioxygen can be activated by aqueous fe2 ions released from magnetite and fe2 adsorbed on magnetite surface ardo et al 2015 similarly the gr derived magnetite could act as a fe ii source and free fe ii in solution and fe ii adsorbed on magnetite surface may both contribute to dioxygen activation since the fe ii adsorbed on magnetite surface can exchange with the structural fe ii on magnetite surface gorski and scherer 2009 williams and scherer 2004 the difference between their contribution to dioxygen activation can be hardly distinguishable our results also suggest that the structural fe ii on magnetite surface is responsible for dioxygen activation mössbauer spectroscopic analysis show that the oxidation products of gr derived magnetite consist of maghemite and lepidocrocite table 1 therefore the oxygenation of magnetite could produce maghemite with the formation of oh as reported by ardo et al 2015 the reduction of o2 on gr derived products was characterized by linear scanning voltammetry under oxic conditions fig 7b fig s5 the reduction of o2 on commercial magnetite is negligible as shown by the tiny peak at 0 2v in contrast a prominent cathodic peak at 0 2v resulted from o2 reduction was observed for gr derived magnetite 1 h and 10 h oxidation sample this cathodic peak was not observed under anoxic conditions fig s5 a similar reduction peak was observed for the reduction of o2 to h2o2 on the surface of pyrite zhang et al 2016 indicating the reduction of o2 by gr derived magnetite may also undergo a two electron transfer process the o2 reduction peak was not observed for the 50 h oxidized gr sample demonstrating its diminished activity for o2 activation 3 2 6 debromination pathway of tbp hplc ms was used to determine the degradation intermediates of tbp under oxic conditions the molecule with an m z of 328 8 was correspond to tbp two main intermediate products at m z 266 8 and m z 187 were detected which corresponded to 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and 2 bromo 1 4 benzoquinone respectively fig s6 these results revealed that tbp degradation occurred via the c br cleavage and hydroxyl substitution process the oxidative degradation pathway of tbp by gr under oxic conditions was proposed fig s7 gao et al 2013 3 3 interactions between gr and tbp during anoxic to oxic transition 3 3 1 anoxic to oxic transition during the tbp adsorption process the anoxic subsurface environment may change to oxic after disturbance by surface water groundwater interaction fluctuation of groundwater level and human activities therefore the impact of anoxic to oxic transition on the gr tbp interaction was investigated the gr tbp mixture was kept under anoxic conditions for 1 h 4 h and 7 h before applying oxic conditions fig 1c interestingly the tbp concentration in the solution increase immediately once the environment changes from anoxic to oxic fig 1c at the same time it is observed that gr was rapidly transformed with a color change to black the sudden increase in the concentration of tbp can be explained by the desorption of tbp resulting from the transformation of gr to other iron hydr oxides fig 2c this phenomenon is similar to the adsorption desorption process observed during the gr tbp interaction under anoxic conditions the difference is that the whole adsorption desorption process lasts for 6 d under anoxic conditions whereas the change to oxic conditions initiates the desorption immediately by transforming gr to more stable iron hydr oxides subsequently the desorbed tbp was degraded under oxic conditions and the degradation efficiency is 85 after 6 d regardless of the duration of the initial anoxic exposure these results demonstrate the possible interaction between gr and tbp during dioxygen intrusion in subsurface environment under anoxic environment gr can adsorb tbp for a short term 4 to 10 h once dioxygen is introduced tbp was desorbed from the gr surface immediately and released back into the environment however this increase of tbp concentration is short lived because the introduced dioxygen is activated by the transformed gr to produce oh leading to the oxidative degradation of tbp fig 8 3 3 2 anoxic to oxic transition after the desorption of tbp gr can sequester tbp for a short time 4 to 10 h before the desorption of tbp under anoxic conditions after the desorption equilibrium was established the final concentration of tbp is 86 of the initial tbp concentration these results show that gr cannot sequester tbp for a long time under anoxic conditions however the introduction of dioxygen into the system after the tbp desorption equilibrium led to the removal of tbp fig 1d the removal efficiency reached 75 after 70 h of reaction and no rebound of the tbp concentration was observed indicating the desorbed tbp underwent an oxidative degradation fig 1d the mössbauer and xrd data show that parts of gr were transformed to iron hydroxides including ferrihydrite magnetite after the gr tbp interaction under anoxic conditions for a long time fig 2a fig 4 upon the introduction of dioxygen the magnetite phase can active dioxygen to produce oh for oxidative degradation of tbp thus although the long time interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic conditions leads to the desorption of tbp and structural transformation of gr tbp could undergo an oxidative degradation once dioxygen is introduced into the gr tbp interaction system fig 8 4 conclusion gr can sequester tbp for a short time under anoxic conditions the followed desorption of tbp was resulted from the structural transformation of gr to more stable iron hydr oxides with aging the lower the concentration of gr the faster the adsorption and the subsequent desorption of tbp although gr can transform into more stable iron hydr oxides along aging time its interaction with tbp can accelerate this transformation process the oxygenation of gr suspensions leads to the oxidative degradation of tbp and the initial ph has no obvious influence on this degradation process the anoxic to oxic transition leads to the immediate structural transformation of gr to more stable iron hydr oxides resulting in the desorption of tbp and the activation of dioxygen with the generation of oh the reduction of o2 by gr derived magnetite undergo a two electron transfer process to produce oh whose presence is confirmed by both the radical capture and quenching experiment the generated oh is responsible for the oxidative degradation of tbp under oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions the anoxic to oxic transition after the full desorption of tbp can also result in the oxidative degradation of tbp this work provides key

the most abundant pfas identified in the biosolids the total oxidizable precursor assay on biosolids extracts generally failed to quantify the amount of precursors present in large part due to the fact that dipaps were not fully transformed during the top assay outdoor biosolids column leaching experiments intended to simulate biosolids land application showed sustained pfas leaching over the 6 month study duration perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa concentrations in leachate when detected typically ranged in the 10 s to 100 s of ng l no dipaps were detected in the leachate the pfaa leaching from the biosolids exceeded the pfaa mass initially present in the biosolids typically by greater than an order of magnitude but the cumulative pfaa mass leached did not exceed the molar equivalents that could be explained by transformation of quantified precursors these results highlight the importance of pfaa precursors initially present in biosolids and their contribution to long term leaching of pfaas

use of pfas in consumer products ranging from non stick surfaces to water and grease repelling textiles to aqueous film forming foams afffs for firefighting have resulted in pfas detections in the influent and effluent of many water resource recovery facilities wrrfs rahman et al 2014 hu et al 2016 ahrens et al 2009 along with detections in sludge and biosolids ebrahimi et al 2021 sepulvado et al 2011 a united states national survey of 13 short and long chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in biosolids from 94 wrrfs in 2001 showed that pfos was the most abundant pfaa detected in biosolids at a

highly urban us wrrf that were collected quarterly from 2005 to 2013 showed that pfna pfoa and pfos had the highest average concentrations 25 1 µg kg 23 5 µg kg and 22 5 µg kg respectively the remaining analytes were less than 8 µg kg armstrong et al 2016 an australian study examining biosolids collected from 19 wrrfs in 2018 showed based on a pfas analyte list consisting of 44 compounds a

long term 12 years sustained leaching of pfas primarily pfos following the land application of biosolids has been observed in a field site with land applied industrially impacted compost röhler et al 2021 ebrahimi et al 2021 found that the relative release of pfas from biosolids was impacted by protein content organic carbon content and lipid fraction while both pfas composition and leaching from finished biosolids have been examined quantifying directly the role of potential pfaa precursors on leaching from biosolids is lacking the objective of this study was to determine the extent to which quantifiable polyfluorinated precursors present in finished biosolids contribute to overall pfas leaching precursor composition and subsequent leaching among various biosolids with differing characteristics and solids processing are compared in a long term outdoor leaching study 2 experimental 2 1 collection of finished biosolids from wrrfs seven wrrfs at five public utilities across the united states participated in this study current average daily flows at these wrrfs ranged from less than 7 to 630 million gallons per day mgd the seven wrrfs were representative of various treatment processes ranging from primary and secondary treatment to tertiary and advanced treatment the facilities were from highly urbanized metropolitan areas which included both domestic and industrial dischargers to the wrrfs tertiary wastewater treatment included nutrient removal of either phosphate or nitrogen and phosphate advanced wastewater treatment included granular media filtration membrane

collected in high density polyethylene hdpe sample jars on a single day after the final step in processing including any drying via time weighted composite grab samples over a six hour period collected samples were shipped on ice overnight to the laboratory where they were subsequently homogenized lyophilized and subsampled for baseline characterization and pfas analyses lyophilization was performed by initially freezing samples at 20 c for at least three hours before placing in a labconco lyophilizer at approximately 50 c with an operational vacuum of 0 1 to 0 01 millibar the duration of freeze drying varied depending on the sample moisture content baseline biosolids characteristics determined on lyophilized samples are summarized in table s2 2 2 column mesocosm leaching experiments outdoor column leaching experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of weathering and aging over a six month period april 2020 october 2020 with respect to pfas leaching from the collected biosolids thereby serving as a screening level means to assess pfas leaching from land applied biosolids columns were constructed using 1 l amber hdpe nalgene bottles with a 4 inch inner diameter all bottles were rinsed with methanol and ultrapure water prior to use the bottle bottoms were removed perforations were added into bottle cap a stainless steel mesh was affixed to the cap interior and all cut edges were smoothed out by sanding the bottom less bottles were inverted and used as a collection vessel for leachate during the experiment the experimental system is shown in fig

drainage and removal of excess organic carbon roots leaves debris after sieving the sand ph was 7 7 su 1 1 sand in deionized water the total organic carbon of the rinsed and sieved sand was 0 1 pfas analysis of the sand showed that all analytes were below the limit of quantification approximately 500 g of sand were added into the inverted capped bottle on top of this sand layer a mixed sand biosolids layer was added consisting of 245 g sand and 5 g lyophilized biosolids 2 biosolids by mass in this simulated till layer equating to 4 4 u s dry tons per acre this biosolids addition is comparable to a typical biosolids addition rate for small grains agricultural land 2 5 dry tons per acre usepa 2020 the total depth of the porous media bed was 4 inches including the 1 3 inch till layer all leaching columns were prepared in triplicate for each of the biosolids resulting in 21 biosolids amended columns in addition three controls comprised of only sand i e no biosolids were constructed using the same procedure but contained 750 g of sand without a till layer these controls were intended to account for potential pfas leaching from the sand leaching from any components of the experimental apparatus and any pfas collected from the natural rainwater the columns were transported to a community garden in seattle wa for deployment on april 1 2020 and secured in a locked enclosure the columns were placed within a four inch hdpe pipe supported by a cinder block frame an ecowitt wh5360b digital rain gauge was erected in the center of the column plot to collect precipitation data fig 1b a total of five precipitation events over the course of the six month column leaching experiment april 1 2020 october 17 2020 yielded sufficient leachate collection figure s1 for pfas and total organic carbon toc analysis outdoor temperatures ranged from 2 to 36 c during the duration of the study after each rain event the total rainfall was recorded from the digital rain gauge and total leachate volume was measured for each of the 5 leachate sampling events all cumulative leachate was removed from the collection vessel subsamples of this collected leachate from each of the collection events were transferred into 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and stored at 4 c prior to analysis thereby allowing for determination of the total quantity of pfas that eluted from the columns after collecting the final leachate samples the biosolids layer for each column was removed homogenized and sub sampled for pfas analysis 2 3 analytical methods analyses for biosolids

with individual pfas concentrations provided in table s5 overall 95 confidence intervals are relatively low typically less than 5 of the average indicating a high level of repeatability among the triplicate analyses total pfas concentrations ranged from 323 14 1 to 1100 43 8 µg kg dry weight basis which is comparable to the range of 4 2 to 910 µg kg reported for australian biosolids by moodie et al 2021 who monitored a similar suite of pfas also the range in total pfaas is similar to those reported for 2014 commercial biosolids of 9 0 to 199 µg kg lazcano et al 2020 the relatively narrow range i e within the same order of magnitude among the facilities shown in table 2 suggests that municipal wastewaters that are not highly impacted by industry likely carry a fairly consistent typical pfas load this narrow range also suggests that the differences in the various wastewater and solids treatment processes table 1 among the facilities examined do not have substantial impacts on pfas concentrations in finished biosolids pfas in each of the biosolids on a fluorine molar basis notably shows that potential pfaa precursor compounds account for 77 to 97 of the total molar fluorine present fig 2 quantified precursor compounds were consistently dominated by the 5 3 and 7 3 fluorotelomer acids ftas and the di substituted polyfluorinated phosphate esters e g 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap fluorotelomer acids may be intermediates from transformation of other pfas dinglasan et al 2004 dipaps are commonly used as coating agents in food contact materials and found to migrate into foods begley et al 2008 surface treatment and protectant applications buck et al 2011 and personal care products and pharmaceuticals lee and mabury 2011 thus their appearance in biosolids may stem from their widespread use and consumption moodie et al 2021 also noted that dipaps were the predominant pfas detected in biosolids interestingly the long chained sulfonates were prevalent over the short chained sulfonates 91 long chain and 9 short chain for the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas on average where long chain is defined as greater than 6 carbons and short chain is 6 or less carbons this may be due to the increased hydrophobicity of long chain pfas relative to short chain however for the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas both long and short chain were equally represented average of 55 and 45 respectively the pfas analyses performed on the biosolids interrogated a wide range of pfas however it is recognized that many pfas in the biosolids likely went undetected because they were either not extracted e g side chain polymers require stronger organic solvents to extract letcher et al 2020 ms detector parameters were not optimized for untargeted pfas or standards were not available therefore the quantity of pfaa precursors present is likely underestimated the top assay conducted to further characterize potential pfaa formation from extractable precursors yielded higher total pfcas on a fluorine molar basis than observed in the biosolids with increases ranging from 20 for a2 to a nearly 14 fold increase for a1 fig 3 when the top assay results based on pfca generation were compared to the fluorine contained in known and measured precursors tables 2 and s5 the top assay typically accounted for less than 25 of the fluorine in known precursors that were quantified directly thus the top assay did not adequately account for the total known precursors quantified based on fluorine with the exception of a1 for a1 the top assay predicted a similar amount of fluorine as found in the quantified precursors in the initial biosolids sample one possible reason why the top assay failed to capture the majority of known precursors is that many of the identified precursors e g dipaps may not have been fully transformed to pfcas during the top assay due to the chemical nature of these compounds and or matrix issues associated with the biosolids extracts to explore this possibility the persistence of precursors following application of the top assay was determined results confirmed that substantial precursor mass persisted fig 3 and that the top assay failed to convert all known precursors to pfcas the predominant precursors that persisted accounting for 95 of the fluorine mass associated with these precursors were 6 2 dpap 8 2 dipap and 5 3 fluorotelomer acid in particular the dipaps showed minimal 25 transformation during the top assay as shown in fig 3 the persistence of these precursors in addition to pfca generation following the top assay accounted for 48 to 80 of the known fluorine mass initially present in the biosolids the exception to these observations on precursor persistence following the top assay was again a1 where the fluorine balance following the top assay with inclusion of precursors exceeded that of the initial known fluorine mass in the biosolids this exceedance could be the result of pfca generation from precursors that were not identified in the biosolids prior to the top assay even with accounting for the persistence of precursors following the top assay precursor fluorine levels are significantly underpredicted in several of the biosolids one possible explanation for this underprediction is based on a recent study that showed that the top assay resulted in formation of several ultra short chained pfcas e g trifluoroacetic acid c2 and perfluoropropanoic acid c3 that escape detection janda et al 2019 pfcas with chain lengths less than four are difficult to measure analytically due to significant matrix effects from salts generated during the top assay potassium or sodium and sulfate from the oxidation of persulfate the generation of ultrashort chained pfcas is especially important when the top assay is applied to samples with short chain pfas for example pfas with c6 to c4 moieties such as 4 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate may degrade to c2 and c3 products that are not typically analyzed in the current study approximately half of the pfcas and pfsas detected in the biosolids were short chain in any case results shown herein suggest caution should be used when basing potential pfaa formation in biosolids solely on the top assay 3 2 leaching from biosolids toc concentrations measured in the leachate collected in the rainfall events from april until october 2020 decreased over time in all the biosolids columns from an average of 63 35 mg l for the first sampling event to 9 8 2 4 mg l for the last sampling event figure s2 the toc in the effluent of the sand control column was relatively consistent at 7 5 2 9 mg toc l the total toc released during the column experiment represented between only 1 3 to 2 9 of the total carbon mass initially present toc was not measured in the leachate from the first rainfall event because of limited leachate volume only 1 pore volume of leachate was collected after the first rainfall event as shown in figure s1 measurable pfas release from the sand controls was observed during the 6 month study figure s3 pfas concentrations in the sand control leachate figure s3 were typically less than 40 ng l for individual pfas with the exception of pfhxa for which release concentrations were approximately 100 ng l through the first four pore volumes pfas were not detected in laboratory blank samples nor within the sand prior to the column experiments the source of the pfhxa has not been determined however pfas concentrations on the order of tens of ng l have been observed in urban rainwater pike et al 2021 pfas concentrations in rainwater were not measured during the leaching study however given the urban environment of this study pfhxa may have been present in the rainwater the results for the biosolids amended columns presented below were corrected for pfas concentrations measured in the sand controls i e pfas concentrations in the controls were subtracted from the pfas concentrations measured in the biosolid amended columns pfas concentrations observed in the leachate of the biosolids amended columns include the pfaas and four precursors figures s4 through s6 for pfcas pfsas and precursors respectively individual pfcas and pfsas detected in the leachate generally ranged in the 10 s to 100 s of ng l with pfca concentrations being approximately double the pfsa concentrations precursor concentrations generally ranged between 10 and 100 ng l pfca and pfsa releases from the columns were sustained for the duration of the six month leaching study overall no significant trends were apparent in either increasing or decreasing total pfas leachate concentrations within the 6 month study table s6 this is consistent with observations from field applied biosolids documented by others röhler et al 2021 where sustained leaching occurred for up to several years 3 3 pfas and fluorine balances individual cumulative pfcas and pfsas leached from the columns relative to the pfas initially present in the biosolids are shown in figures s7 and s8 respectively values greater than one on the y axis indicate that greater than 100 of the initial pfaa mass detected in the biosolids was observed in the leachate as most notably seen for the pfcas thus the total mass of pfcas desorbed into leachate far exceeded the initial pfcas present in the biosolids the presence of pfaa precursors and their subsequent transformation during the 6 month leaching experiment provides a plausible explanation for these results similar results where increases in some pfcas were observed over time have been observed by others in biosolids field leaching studies venkatesan and halden 2014 the total mass of pfsas leached from the columns relative to the initial mass in the emplaced biosolids also exceeded values of 1 but to a substantially lower extent than that of the pfcas such behavior is consistent with previous observations that pfaa precursors are primarily biotransformed to pfcas as end products lee et al 2014 harding marjanovic et al 2015 d agostino and mabury 2017 total fluorine nmoles initially quantified in the biosolids measured in leachate and remaining in the aged mesocosm biosolids sand mix post leaching are summarized in fig 4 along with the fluorine recovered right axis relative to the initial fluorine quantified in the biosolids emplaced in the mesocosms a discussion of these calculations are provided in the supplementary materials fluorine molar balances show that the total fluorine eluted from the columns did not exceed the total fluorine initially present in the biosolids despite the fact that the mass of individual pfcas and pfsas leached far exceeded what was initially present in the biosolids figures s7 and s8 these results indicate that the sustained leaching of pfaas from the columns is in large part due to biotransformation of the precursors initially present in the biosolids it is also noted that the absence of any precursors in the mesocosm control sand at the end of the 6 month experiment as well as the absence of any precursors detected in the control effluents with the exception of trace levels of 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate as shown in figure s3 strongly suggests that the source of the precursors that were transformed were not from any precursors present in the rainwater but rather from the biosolids for a1 and a2 the fluorine leached from the columns was nearly equal to the pfas initially present in the biosolids however analysis of the biosolids post leaching showed that some pfas associated fluorine was still present in the biosolids one potential explanation for this discrepancy is that fluorine associated with unidentified pfaa precursors e g low levels of cationic or zwitterionic pfas not picked up in the esi positive mode suspect screening also may have been initially present in the biosolids and contributed to the formation of pfaas thus the fluorine initially present in the columns fig 4 may be greater than what was quantified dipaps were the primary source of fluorine identified in the biosolids prior to leaching fig 2 and the dipaps decreased in the biosolids following the 6 month leaching study differences between the black and red bars in fig 4 largely reflect the depletion of dipaps in the biosolids the dipaps were also the only remaining pfas identified in the biosolid sand mix post leaching table s7 but were not observed in any of the leachate samples thus it is likely that the biotransformation of dipaps to primarily pfcas controlled the overall fluorine leaching previous studies have shown that dipaps in biosolids can biotransform to pfcas where the initial transformation step is hydrolysis of the phosphate ester bond lee et al 2014 the overall percent fluorine recoveries fig 4 considering the relatively large error associated with the post leaching biosolids sampling were reasonably close to 100 the exception was e2 where the fluorine mass recovered in the leachate and post leaching biosolids was only 32 of the fluorine initially present in the biosolids this may be due to some pfas transforming to unquantified intermediates overall the reasonable closure of these mass balances provide another line of evidence that the generated pfaas were derived from precursors present in the biosolids and not potentially unidentified precursors present in the rainwater the ratio of the fluorine mass leached from the columns relative to the fluorine initially present in the biosolids was not associated with a specific sludge process or type of biosolid produced however when comparing the overall fraction of fluorine released during the leaching study among the different biosolids the fraction of fluorine released was linearly correlated to the organic carbon content of the biosolids fig 5 where fractional removal of fluorine increased or fluorine desorbed increased with decreasing organic carbon content interestingly the one outlying datapoint in fig 5 was for a1 while it is unclear why a1 was an outlier it is noted that the biosolids for a1 had the lowest ph 5 8 which may have had an impact on the sorption and or transformation of pfas 5 conclusions for the finished biosolids examined in this study based on the 54 pfas quantified precursors primarily dipaps accounted for the majority of the organic fluorine present the outdoor mesocosm study showed that the pfas and fluorine mass leached from the columns over a 6 month period could only be accounted for by considering precursor transformation both the standard analyte list i e those for which analytical standards are available and the top assay underestimated the pfas mass in biosolids while the results presented herein provide a strong line of evidence for the role of precursors in determining the sustained pfas leaching from biosolids additional studies are needed to assess the environmental impacts of such

the most abundant pfas identified in the biosolids the total oxidizable precursor assay on biosolids extracts generally failed to quantify the amount of precursors present in large part due to the fact that dipaps were not fully transformed during the top assay outdoor biosolids column leaching experiments intended to simulate biosolids land application showed sustained pfas leaching over the 6 month study duration perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa concentrations in leachate when detected typically ranged in the 10 s to 100 s of ng l no dipaps were detected in the leachate the pfaa leaching from the biosolids exceeded the pfaa mass initially present in the biosolids typically by greater than an order of magnitude but the cumulative pfaa mass leached did not exceed the molar equivalents that could

long term 12 years sustained leaching of pfas primarily pfos following the land application of biosolids has been observed in a field site with land applied industrially impacted compost röhler et al 2021 ebrahimi et al 2021 found that the relative release of pfas from biosolids was impacted by protein content organic carbon content and lipid fraction while both pfas composition and leaching from finished biosolids have been examined quantifying directly the role of potential pfaa precursors on leaching from biosolids is lacking the objective of this study was to determine the extent to which quantifiable polyfluorinated precursors present in finished biosolids contribute to overall pfas leaching precursor composition and subsequent leaching among various biosolids with differing characteristics and solids processing are compared in a long term outdoor leaching study 2 experimental 2 1 collection of finished biosolids from wrrfs seven wrrfs at five public utilities across the united states participated in this study current average daily flows at these wrrfs ranged from less than 7 to 630 million gallons per day mgd the seven wrrfs were representative of various treatment processes ranging from primary and secondary treatment to tertiary and advanced treatment the facilities were from highly urbanized metropolitan areas which included both domestic and industrial dischargers to the wrrfs tertiary wastewater treatment included nutrient removal of either phosphate or nitrogen and phosphate advanced wastewater treatment included granular media filtration membrane filtration pre ozonation and biological activated carbon bac disinfection included chlorine ozone or ultraviolet uv irradiation the solids processing trains involved thickening digestion dewatering and or drying for the seven biosolids in this study which were identified with the same ids as the facilities from which they were obtained ids a1 a2 b1 c1 d1 e1 and e2 solids and liquid processing details are summarized in table 1 and table s1 respectively sampling devices used for collection of biosolids that came in direct contact with the samples were triple rinsed with 99 american chemical society acs grade methanol integra and then triple rinsed with american society for testing and materials astm type i ultrapure water prior to sampling finished biosolids from each facility were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe sample jars on a single day after the final step in processing including any drying via time weighted composite grab samples over a six hour period collected samples were shipped on ice overnight to the laboratory where they were subsequently homogenized lyophilized and subsampled for baseline characterization and pfas analyses lyophilization was performed by initially freezing samples at 20 c for at least three hours before placing in a labconco lyophilizer at approximately 50 c with an operational vacuum of 0 1 to 0 01 millibar the duration of freeze drying varied depending on the sample moisture content baseline biosolids characteristics determined on lyophilized samples are summarized in table s2 2 2 column mesocosm leaching experiments outdoor column leaching experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of weathering and aging over a six month period april 2020 october 2020 with respect to pfas leaching from the collected biosolids thereby serving as a screening level means to assess pfas leaching from land applied biosolids columns were constructed using 1 l amber hdpe nalgene bottles with a 4 inch inner diameter all bottles were rinsed with methanol and ultrapure water prior to use the bottle bottoms were removed perforations were added into bottle cap a stainless steel mesh was affixed to the cap interior and all cut edges were smoothed out by sanding the bottom less bottles were inverted and used as a collection vessel for leachate during the experiment the experimental system is shown in fig 1 a sand used in the column experiments was obtained from washington rock quarries orting wa before use the sand was rinsed with tap water and sieved using a 60 sieve 250 µm to facilitate adequate drainage and removal of excess organic carbon roots leaves debris after sieving the sand ph was 7 7 su 1 1 sand in deionized water the total organic carbon of the rinsed and sieved sand was 0 1 pfas analysis of the sand showed that all analytes were below the limit of quantification approximately 500 g of sand were added into the inverted capped bottle on top of this sand layer a mixed sand biosolids layer was added consisting of 245 g sand and 5 g lyophilized biosolids 2 biosolids by mass in this simulated till layer equating to 4 4 u s dry tons per acre this biosolids addition is comparable to a typical biosolids addition rate for small grains agricultural land 2 5 dry tons per acre usepa 2020 the total depth of the porous media bed was 4 inches including the 1 3 inch till layer all leaching columns were prepared in triplicate for each of the biosolids resulting in 21 biosolids amended columns in addition three controls comprised of only sand i e no biosolids were constructed using the same procedure but contained 750 g of sand without a till layer these controls were intended to account for potential pfas leaching from the sand leaching from any components of the experimental apparatus and any pfas collected from the natural rainwater the columns were transported to a community garden in seattle wa for deployment on april 1 2020 and secured in a locked enclosure the columns were placed within a four inch hdpe pipe supported by a cinder block frame an ecowitt wh5360b digital rain gauge was erected in the center of the column plot to collect precipitation data fig 1b a total of five precipitation events over the course of the six month column leaching experiment april 1 2020 october 17 2020 yielded sufficient leachate collection figure s1 for pfas and total organic carbon toc analysis outdoor temperatures ranged from 2 to 36 c during the duration of the study after each rain event the total rainfall was recorded from the digital rain gauge and total leachate volume was measured for each of the 5 leachate sampling events all cumulative leachate was removed from the collection vessel subsamples of this collected leachate from each of the collection events were transferred into 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and stored at 4 c prior to analysis thereby allowing for determination of the total quantity of pfas that eluted from the columns after collecting the final leachate samples the biosolids layer for each column was removed homogenized and sub sampled for pfas analysis 2 3 analytical methods analyses for biosolids

products that are not typically analyzed in the current study approximately half of the pfcas and pfsas detected in the biosolids were short chain in any case results shown herein suggest caution should be used when basing potential pfaa formation in biosolids solely on the top assay 3 2 leaching from biosolids toc concentrations measured in the leachate collected in the rainfall events from april until october 2020 decreased over time in all the biosolids columns from an average of 63 35 mg l for the first sampling event to 9 8 2 4 mg l for the last sampling event figure s2 the toc in the effluent of the sand control column was relatively consistent at 7 5 2 9 mg toc l the total toc released during the column experiment represented between only 1 3 to 2 9 of the total carbon mass initially present toc was not measured in the leachate from the first rainfall event because of limited leachate volume only 1 pore volume of leachate was collected after the first rainfall event as shown in figure s1 measurable pfas release from the sand controls was observed during the 6 month study figure s3 pfas concentrations in the sand control leachate figure s3 were typically less than 40 ng l for individual pfas with the exception of pfhxa for which release concentrations were approximately 100 ng l through the first four pore volumes pfas were not detected in laboratory blank samples nor within the sand prior to the column experiments the source of the pfhxa has not been determined however pfas concentrations on the order of tens of ng l have been observed in urban rainwater pike et al 2021 pfas concentrations in rainwater were not measured during the leaching study however given the urban environment of this study pfhxa may have been present in the rainwater the results for the biosolids amended columns presented below were corrected for pfas concentrations measured in the sand controls i e pfas concentrations in the controls were subtracted from the pfas concentrations measured in the biosolid amended columns pfas concentrations observed in the leachate of the biosolids amended columns include the pfaas and four precursors figures s4 through s6 for pfcas pfsas and precursors respectively individual pfcas and pfsas detected in the leachate generally ranged in the 10 s to 100 s of ng l with pfca concentrations being approximately double the pfsa concentrations precursor concentrations generally ranged between 10 and 100 ng l pfca and pfsa releases from the columns were sustained for the duration of the six month leaching study overall no significant trends were apparent in either increasing or decreasing total pfas leachate concentrations within the 6 month study table s6 this is consistent with observations from field applied biosolids documented by others röhler et al 2021 where sustained leaching occurred for up to several years 3 3 pfas and fluorine balances individual cumulative pfcas and pfsas leached from the columns relative to the pfas initially present in the biosolids are shown in figures s7 and s8 respectively values greater than one on the y axis indicate that greater than 100 of the initial pfaa mass detected in the biosolids was observed in the leachate as most notably seen for the pfcas thus the total mass of pfcas desorbed into leachate far exceeded the initial pfcas present in the biosolids the presence of pfaa precursors and their subsequent transformation during the 6 month leaching experiment provides a plausible explanation for these results similar results where increases in some pfcas were observed over time have been observed by others in biosolids field leaching studies venkatesan and halden 2014 the total mass of pfsas leached from the columns relative to the initial mass in the emplaced biosolids also exceeded values of 1 but to a substantially lower extent than that of the pfcas such behavior is consistent with previous observations that pfaa precursors are primarily biotransformed to pfcas as end products lee et al 2014 harding marjanovic et al 2015 d agostino and mabury 2017 total fluorine nmoles initially quantified in the biosolids measured in leachate and remaining in the aged mesocosm biosolids sand mix post leaching are summarized in fig 4 along with the fluorine recovered right axis relative to the initial fluorine quantified in the biosolids emplaced in the mesocosms a discussion of these calculations are provided in the supplementary materials fluorine molar balances show that the total fluorine eluted from the columns did not exceed the total fluorine initially present in the biosolids despite the fact that the mass of individual pfcas and pfsas leached far exceeded what was initially present in the biosolids figures s7 and s8 these results indicate that the sustained leaching of pfaas from the columns is in large part due to biotransformation of the precursors initially present in the biosolids it is also noted that the absence of any precursors in the mesocosm control sand at the end of the 6 month experiment as well as the absence of any precursors detected in the control effluents with the exception of trace levels of 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate as shown in figure s3 strongly suggests that the source of the precursors that were transformed were not from any precursors present in the rainwater but rather from the biosolids for a1 and a2 the fluorine leached from the columns was nearly equal to the pfas initially present in the biosolids however analysis of the biosolids post leaching showed that some pfas associated fluorine was still present in the biosolids one potential explanation for this discrepancy is that fluorine associated with unidentified pfaa precursors e g low levels of cationic or zwitterionic pfas not picked up in the esi positive mode suspect screening also may have been initially present in the biosolids and contributed to the formation of pfaas thus the fluorine initially present in the columns fig 4 may be greater than what was quantified dipaps were the primary source of fluorine identified in the biosolids prior to leaching fig 2 and the dipaps decreased in the biosolids following the 6 month leaching study differences between the black and red bars in fig 4 largely reflect the depletion of dipaps in the biosolids the dipaps were also the only remaining pfas identified in the biosolid sand mix post leaching table s7 but were not observed in any of the leachate samples thus it is likely that the biotransformation of dipaps to primarily pfcas controlled the overall fluorine leaching previous studies have shown that dipaps in biosolids can biotransform to pfcas where the initial transformation step is hydrolysis of the phosphate ester bond lee et al 2014 the overall percent fluorine recoveries fig 4 considering the relatively large error associated with the post leaching biosolids sampling were reasonably close to 100 the exception was e2 where the fluorine mass recovered in the leachate and post leaching biosolids was only 32 of the fluorine initially present in the biosolids this may be due to some pfas transforming to unquantified intermediates overall the reasonable closure of these mass balances provide another line of evidence that the generated pfaas were derived from precursors present in the biosolids and not potentially unidentified precursors present in the rainwater the ratio of the fluorine mass leached from the columns relative to the fluorine initially present in the biosolids was not associated with a specific sludge process or type of biosolid produced however when comparing the overall fraction of fluorine released during the leaching study among the different biosolids the fraction of fluorine released was linearly correlated to the organic carbon content of the biosolids fig 5 where fractional removal of fluorine increased or fluorine desorbed increased with decreasing organic carbon content interestingly the one outlying datapoint in fig 5 was for a1 while it is unclear why a1 was an outlier it is noted that the biosolids for a1 had the lowest ph 5 8 which may have had an impact on the sorption and or transformation of pfas 5 conclusions for the finished biosolids examined in this study based on the 54 pfas quantified precursors primarily dipaps accounted for the majority of the organic fluorine present the outdoor mesocosm study showed that the pfas and fluorine mass leached from the columns over a 6 month period could only be accounted for by considering precursor transformation both the standard analyte list i e those for which analytical standards are available and the top assay underestimated the pfas mass in biosolids while the results presented herein provide a strong line of evidence for the role of precursors in determining the sustained pfas leaching from biosolids additional studies are needed to assess the environmental impacts of such leaching following the land application of biosolids the mesocosm experiment described herein does not address the fate of leachate in the soil including further sorption vadose zone migration

16033,in intermittent rivers which represent a prominent part of worldwide rivers aquatic organisms are exposed to sequential disturbances including flow cessation potentially associated with water warming desiccation process and flow resumption at flow resumption pollutants stored in soil and washed by rainfalls can reach fresh waters the interaction between contamination and river intermittency is poorly understood in this study we aimed at understanding in what extent the intensity of dry period combined or not to water warming drives the sensitivity of aquatic communities to a complex agricultural run off aro during rewetting phototrophic biofilms at the basis of freshwater food webs were chosen as a model of community biofilms grown in laboratory were first exposed to a disturbance crossing two temperature conditions not warmed 22 c or warmed 32 c and three dry periods no drying short 3 days or long 3 months then they were exposed to a chemical mix of nitrates copper and 3 pesticides at 6 gradual concentrations various descriptors associated with biofilm structure and function were assessed one week after aro addition when undisturbed biofilms were exposed to aro they shifted toward a more heterotrophic state as they lost algal richness and diversity and gross primary production tended to decrease warming alone only slightly modified the sensitivity of biofilms to aro with lower effects on algal richness and a trend to increase the effect on gross primary production in contrast the association of warming and a dry period strongly modified the sensitivity to aro certainly due to the selection of generalist species and or physiological acclimation inducted by the first disturbance this study emphasizes the importance of considering water intermittency in the management of the ecological risk of chemicals in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords global change desiccation process agricultural runoff sequential disturbance phototrophic biofilms 1 introduction intermittent rivers represent more than 50 of rivers worldwide datry et al 2014 they can be found on every continent within every climate messager et al 2021 a river is considered intermittent or nonperennial if its flow ceases and the riverbed dries out a part of the year datry et al 2017a even if this phenomenon is frequent and naturally occurs in arid and semiarid regions because of low precipitation events and strong direct evaporation it is exacerbated by climate change and human uses and is expected to increase both in space and duration sabater et al 2016 the prevalence of intermittency requires to adjust the classical model of river for a more accurate understanding and prediction of river functioning biodiversity and vulnerability intermittency is a complex phenomenon which covers contrasted situations during the desiccation process the water flow first decreases and the system undergoes a slow transition from a lotic toward a lentic system datry et al 2017b the decrease of water level induces modifications of water quality depending notably on the hydrological drivers and mass balance in the system mosley 2015 for instance temperature increase has been observed in many studies during drought up to 7 degrees in a regulated river ha et al 1999 after this first step the riverbed completely dries out and there is a shift toward terrestrial habitat for some days to several months before rewetting occurs sabater et al 2016 depending on land use practices agricultural contaminants stored in soils during drought can be leached by the precipitation events and reach fresh waters through runoff exposing aquatic communities to a cocktail of pollutants during flow resumption a post drought increase in nitrate concentration was thus observed in several studies see mosley 2015 in this context flow intermittency can be considered as a sequence of different disturbances occurring before during and after the dry period that can affect all the river biocenosis benthic microbial communities which cannot circumvent such disturbances are particularly exposed to the consequences of river intermittency phototrophic biofilms are benthic microbial communities made up of both phototrophic and heterotrophic cells embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix these communities are of major importance in ecosystem functioning as they are key primary producers in many rivers and are involved in organic matter and nutrient cycling battin et al 2016 their short generation time makes them early warning systems to many stressors sabater et al 2007 especially to chemical stressors from agriculture practices like fertilizers trace metals such as copper widely used for vineyard culture but also organic pesticides herbicides insecticides fungicides biofilm structural and functional responses to independent chemical stressors have been well studied for instance nutrients enhance biofilm growth rate and functioning but can also induce significant changes in community structure by favouring filamentous green algae dalton et al 2015 compared to planktonic algae biofilms exhibit an important tolerance to copper contamination with usually few effects on functioning even at high concentration 2 mg l 1 zhong zhao and song 2020 in contrast they tend to be negatively impacted by organic herbicides although the effect of combinations of pesticides are more difficult to predict halstead et al 2014 more generally the chemical complexity of agricultural run off makes difficult to predict its effects on biofilm as the interactions of stressors do not result in a simple addition of stressor effects pesce et al 2011 warming and desiccation are the main effects of river flow drying up with global change intensity i e duration of dry periods is expected to increase and increasing temperatures intensify the severity of drought chiang et al 2021 when temperature increases metabolic activities are enhanced for instance under warming biofilms use more carbon substrates ylla et al 2014 and basal fluorescence and enzymatic activity are enhanced romero et al 2018 conversely desiccation appears to have negative impacts on biofilm structure and functioning during desiccation photosynthetic processes weaken regardless of the disturbance duration while heterotrophic activities and community respiration could persist longer depending on the humidity degree remaining in biofilm acuña et al 2015 besides those functional responses it has been shown that desiccation tends to induce changes in both algal and bacterial communities mckew et al 2011 sabater et al 2016 some studies have investigated the response of microbial communities to a stressor after a prior exposure to another disturbance but with contrasted results in some cases the community was then more affected e g tobor kapłon et al 2006 while in others the exposure to a first disturbance decreased the effects of the second one the microbial community showing antagonistic responses to the successive disturbances e g sjöstedt et al 2018 antagonistic responses can be explained by different mechanisms first some species in the community can exhibit co tolerance to both disturbances vinebrooke et al 2004 with the selection of generalist species that are usually less sensitive to environmental changes chen et al 2021 acquired stress resistance can also be implied after a first disturbance communities have been prepared to resist a second one rillig et al 2015 on the opposite additive or synergic effects can be observed when there is a negative correlation between species tolerance to each disturbance vinebrooke et al 2004 therefore the outcome of the disturbance sequence for a microbial community strongly depends on the order of disturbances this was experimentally demonstrated in soil microbial communities by manipulating the sequence of three different disturbances heat freeze thaw and anoxia calderón et al 2018 in intermittent rivers rewetting appears to be a hot biogeochemical moment mcclain et al 2003 i e shortly after the water returns biogeochemical processes are reactivated and all biological activities are exacerbated including primary production and respiration timoner et al 2012 it appears important to understand in which extent phototrophic biofilms that are critical for the whole river functioning could be sensitive to contaminants leached by precipitations during rewetting some studies may provide a partial response proia et al 2013 have shown that flow reduction and interruption amplified the effects of one contaminant the triclosan on river biofilms corcoll et al 2015 highlighted the cumulative effects of the exposure to a mixture of pharmaceuticals followed by a dry period however these previous studies do not allow to predict the sensitivity to a complex agricultural run off aro of biofilms that have experienced a complete drying such a complex aro whose components nutrients herbicide insecticide fungicide heavy metal may have antagonistic effects has been already shown to induce either positive or neutral effects on biofilm biomass allen et al 2021 this study aims at quantifying how the sensitivity of phototrophic biofilms to a complex agricultural runoff is modulated by river intermittency history we conducted a microcosm experiment where we first manipulated both water warming and the duration of the dry period and then we exposed produced biofilms to a gradient of aro concentrations during rewetting the objective was to understand in what extent the first disturbance dry period and or warming drives the structural and functional biofilm response to the exposure to contaminant our hypothesis was that the first disturbance will decrease biofilm sensitivity to contamination through the selection of co tolerant species 2 material and methods complex phototrophic biofilms were grown in the laboratory they were next exposed to a typical dryness sequence that consisted in a period of no flow nf followed by a short dry period s or a long dry period l combined or not with warming nw or w fig 1 next biofilms were exposed to aro enriched water at gradual concentrations to mimic rewetting with gradually contaminated water 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 biofilm growth

to mimic the first step of dryness process colonised ceramic coupons were thus dispatched in 36 crystallizers 15 coupons per crystalliser filled with 600 ml of volvic water in 2 distinct thermostatic chambers ventilation 100 in the same lighting conditions than during growth after this first week produced biofilms were exposed to contrasted hydric stress at both temperatures one third of coupons were dried up for a short period 3 days one third were dried up for a long 84 days period before contamination and the remaining third was not dried up and directly exposed to contamination dry period durations applied are in the range of dry durations extending from 1 to 150 days observed in mediterranean streams colls et al 2019 and within the range of what can be observed in french intermittent rivers snelder et al 2013 2 1 3 second disturbance the contaminant cocktail used was the same as in allen et al 2021 it consisted in a mix of nitrates kno3 copper cuso4 that is a metallic trace

fluorescence measurement phytopam measurements phytoplankton analyzer heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany have been carried out on 1 10 diluted 200 µl biofilm suspensions the maximal quantum yield of photosystem ii psii or φpsii was used to assess algal physiological state this metric depends on the algal species present in the biofilm but also on the physiological state of cells as it decreases when algae are stressed or damaged roháček and barták 1999 measurements of φpsii were done under dark adapted state baker 2008 φpsii 0 φpsii 1 corresponds to the ratio fv fm where fv fm f0 with fm the maximal fluorescence and f0 the minimal fluorescence of psii roháček and barták 1999 2 3 data analysis all analyses were performed using r software version 3 6 1 r development core team for all response variables normality was tested and log transformed if necessary a pca was performed in order to visualize the effects of the first disturbance and contamination on biofilm global structure and functioning fig 2 effects of dry period duration d and warming w were tested with permanovas the two first component pc1 and pc2 of the pca were extracted and coordinates were used as summary variables to describe the response of biofilms two ways anovas d x w and tukey post hoc tests were performed on each variable as well as on pc1 and pc2 in a second time we assessed biofilm sensitivity to aro by comparing the slopes of biofilm response to contaminant concentrations depending on the first disturbance biofilms were exposed to therefore linear regressions were conducted on every variable as a function of contaminant concentrations variables were standardised using z score to enable comparison between effects a significant regression t test indicates a significant effect of the increasing contaminant concentration on the variable regression slopes as well as standard deviations were extracted for each first disturbance treatment and plotted together to compare the effects 3 results 3 1 biofilm response to dry period and warming permanova analysis demonstrated a significant effect of dry period duration p 0 001 on the global biofilm response such an effect was clearly described by the first pca component fig 2 the longer the dry period was the more biofilm shifted toward heterotrophy fig 3 table si2 these results were consistent with those observed on

pesticides an herbicide a fungicide and an insecticide the response of the different descriptors to contamination was assessed by analysing the estimated regression slopes between each variable and the contaminant concentrations when the regression was significant table si3 fig si1 aro contamination induced a significant increase in pc1 value in the treatments nw fn w nf and w l fig 4 which indicates an increase in biofilm heterotrophy fig 2 contamination had no impact on pc1 values of the other treatments the effect of contaminant on pc2 was significant for biofilms that were previously

previously disturbed biofilms biofilms previously subjected to a long dry period with warming exhibited a shift from green algae to cyanobacteria fig 4 this response to aro contamination was confirmed on the second pca axis fig 2 low aro contaminated 0 1x 10x samples dominated by green algae are clearly distinct from high aro contaminated 50x 100x 250x samples dominated by cyanobacteria when biofilms were previously exposed to warming the total carbon content decreased with contamination fig 4 t 2 771 p 0 05 but this sensitivity to contamination diminished with increasing dry period

was significant only for the w nf treatment t 3 582 p 0 023 4 discussion the prevalence of intermittency in world rivers messager et al 2021 makes necessary to take into account their specificities in the assessment of aquatic ecosystem vulnerability to anthropogenic stressors the aim of this study was to assess if intermittency would alter the sensitivity of a river microbial community to a complex contamination in addition to dryness we considered the effect of water warming associated to water flow cessation though the response of biofilm to a synthetic agricultural run off aro was moderate our results show that it is strongly driven by biofilm history of disturbance response to aro in previously undisturbed biofilms the biofilms produced for the experiment were mainly dominated by cyanobacteria and in a lesser extent by diatoms and were characterized by a positive net primary production when exposed to increasing aro contamination such phototrophic communities lost algal richness and diversity and gpp tended to decrease while heterotrophy was enhanced fig 4 pc1 loss in pigment richness and diversity was likely linked to the removal of species sensitive to aro notably to copper and herbicide that were expected to negatively affect microalgae sousa et al 2019 despite this effect previously undisturbed biofilms globally exhibited rather low sensitivity to aro given the very high concentrations applied with values reaching 750 mg l 1 of n no3 3 5 mg l 1 of cu and 250 µg l 1 of terbuthylazine different reasons such as aro complexity biofilm abilities to resist and experimental timing may explain such rather weak effects first the pesticides toxic effects could be counterbalanced by positive effects of n inputs at lowest aro concentrations as shown by aristi et al 2016 and therefore could mitigate pesticides impact additionally n inputs may have increased heterotrophy by providing an alternative electron acceptor that may promote heterotrophic activities denitrification in the anoxic deeper layers of biofilms such a compensation between negative and positive effects of aro components depending on aro concentration is also consistent with the negative impact we observed on gpp at the highest aro concentrations resistance to organic pesticides and heavy metals is notably linked to the eps matrix which adsorbs those pollutants flemming et al 2016 and to biofilm thickness that limits contact between microbial cells and pesticides for the deeper layers davies 2003 the biofilm biomasses reached in this study correspond to those of mature natural biofilms boulêtreau et al 2006 and eps production is similar to the one of classic biofilms kroll et al 2014 so that such resistance mechanisms may occur finally biofilms were likely to exhibit a partial recovery since they were sampled one week after aro addition and algae can recover very fast from herbicide exposure as already shown for atrazine a photosynthesis inhibitor like terbuthylazine laviale et al 2011 response to aro in biofilms pre exposed to warming water temperature can dramatically increase over flow cessation desiccation and fragmentation into isolated pools gómez et al 2017 in accordance with field personal observations we experimented how a 10 c heatwave could modulate aro sensitivity despite the high intensity of the heatwave biofilm response to aro contamination was not strongly impacted by warming the response of warmed but undried biofilms to aro was globally similar to the one of previously undisturbed biofilms however pigments richness decrease was weaker respiration tended to be enhanced and gpp was inhibited by aro in biofilms pre exposed to warming this indicates that a warming event before contamination would tend to mitigate algal simplification but would amplify biofilm functioning shift toward heterotrophy switches to heterotrophy due to warming have been observed in natural biofilms in intermittent rivers acuña et al 2015 this is partly explained by the higher metabolic response of respiration than photosynthesis to temperature boulêtreau et al 2012 weak effects of warming observed on biofilm pigment composition do not rule out possible replacements of algal or bacterial species according to their thermal preferences since the taxonomic composition of the communities was not assessed here many studies have considered the effect of contaminants depending on temperature but in most cases the stressors were applied simultaneously rather than sequentially nutrient supply combined with warming induced changes in structure with enhanced bacterial growth degerman et al 2013 in this study authors have shown that increasing nutrient concentration enhanced growth with a stronger positive effect when the temperature exposure was higher 4 c increasing temperature 3 6 and 10 c also reduced the negative effects of toxic organic pollutants larras et al 2013 when applied before contamination warming could select species that are tolerant to heavy metal exposure and reduce the effects of the latter pesce et al 2018 on the opposite lambert et al 2017 noticed that the sensitivity of phototrophic biofilms to copper increased after warming these contradictory observations all fit with the theory of co tolerance developed by vinebrooke et al 2004 when two disturbances are applied successively the first disturbance can either increase the tolerance to the second disturbance through antagonist effects rillig et al 2015 li et al 2014 or increase the sensitivity through synergic effects the lower decrease in pigment richness compared to undisturbed biofilms and the weak global warming effect we observed on contaminated biofilms pre exposed to warming could be explained by a positive correlation between warming and contamination effects on species tolerance species more tolerant to aro could have been already selected by warming pre exposure all these experimental results suggest that the outcome of successive disturbances is far from easy to predict depending on the initial community composition species properties and the nature and chronology of the disturbances response to aro in previously dried biofilms non perennial rivers and streams cover a wide spectrum of flow conditions from rarely intermittent rivers periodically experiencing flow cessation during a few days to ephemeral streams that only temporally flow after intense rainfall consistently we exposed biofilms to two contrasted durations a short dry period of 3 days and a long dry period of 3 months dry period is a very strong disturbance for the aquatic organisms forming phototrophic biofilms inducing a high mortality rate in algae barthès et al 2015a souffreau et al 2010 however even after quite long dry periods biofilms are able to quickly recover and resume their functioning e g timoner et al 2012 fast recovery is partly due to the ability of some species to form resting spores to resist dry period hargraves and french 1983 and to become active again within hours and days of flow resumption robson et al 2008 high functional resilience is often coupled with a low structural resilience with marked modification of the composition of both algal and bacterial components barthès et al 2015b gottlieb richards and gaiser 2005 in our experiment biofilms exposed to a dry period showed deep modifications of their composition well visible on the pca first component with less chlorophyll a biomass less eps lower pigment diversity and more bacteria dry period also resulted in changes in biofilm productivity with a consistent decrease in gpp this trend toward heterotrophy is likely also promoted by the release of nutrients by dead algal cells in previously dried biofilms there was almost no effect of aro contamination visible on the pca first component the contamination tended to mitigate the effect of the first disturbance on eps production eps were reduced by half with dryness whatever its duration but slightly increased with aro contamination this makes sense since eps are known to play a role in algal protection against heavy metals flemming et al 2016 dryness also led to lower aro sensitivity of pigment richness and diversity similarly to what was observed for biofilms pre exposed to warming this can be explained by the selection of co tolerant species as hypothesized for warming it may also be linked to the fact that dry period had already a very strong effect on pigment diversity the maximum quantum yield of psii fv fm was negatively impacted by aro in dried biofilms in contrast with undisturbed or biofilms pre exposed to warming fv fm value can reflect the nature of the main algal groups present in biofilm but aro did not induce clear changes in green algae cyanobacteria and diatom proportions therefore the observed decrease in fv fm suggests dry period would amplify the deterioration of the physiological state of algae laviale 2008 probably due to pesticide exposition tiam et al 2015 in terms of functioning previously dried biofilms exhibited a global lower sensitivity to contaminant than undisturbed biofilms with notably npp and gpp less affected by aro this apparent reduced sensitivity is consistent with some previous studies for instance calapez et al 2020 found that after a combined exposure to no flow and to sewage contamination both the negative effect of contaminant on algae and the positive effect on bacteria were less pronounced than after contaminant exposure alone similarly it has been shown that after intermittency biofilms were able to maintain biodegradation of a certain pharmaceutical when exposed to emerging contaminants while biofilms exposed to permanent flow were not rožman et al 2018 it should be noted that in these two studies biofilms were exposed to complex contaminants on the contrary proia et al 2013 observed that flow intermittency increased biofilm sensitivity to triclosan suggesting that the toxicity of pollutants may be exacerbated following a drought in the present study the regressions point out that the physical disturbance induced by the dry period had the highest impact on biofilms and that the chemical stressor did not significantly intensify drought induced changes a similar observation emerged from the meta analysis performed by arenas sánchez et al 2016 on studies focusing on the co occurring effects of water scarcity and chemical pollution on micro and macro organisms in aquatic ecosystems this highlights the necessity to prioritize at least minimal water support in river management response to aro in biofilms previously exposed to both disturbances as seen on the pca the combination of warming and dry period induced a strong modification of biofilm algal composition green algae replaced cyanobacteria and diatoms which dominated undisturbed biofilm this modification of algal composition may explain why those biofilms exhibited highest fv fm than undisturbed biofilms since green algae have highest fv fm than cyanobacteria suggett et al 2009 when these previously disturbed biofilms were exposed to aro the proportion of green algae and fv fm significantly decreased and cyanobacteria proportion increased this stronger response to aro quite visible on the pca plot may be explained by a higher sensitivity of green algae to aro ma 2005 5 conclusion as a whole these results show very clearly that previous warming and or dryness modulate biofilm response to a complex contaminant added during rewetting we hypothesized that the first disturbance would decrease biofilm sensitivity to contamination this was only partially observed since warming decreased the aro effects on biofilm composition but amplified them on biofilm functioning dry periods significantly reduced the contaminant effects our findings show that the first disturbance was the one impacting the most biofilms the low sensitivity of dried biofilm to aro is certainly due to the selection of generalist species or the induction of physiological responses by the first disturbance that allow biofilm to resist contamination during rewetting our study

16033,in intermittent rivers which represent a prominent part of worldwide rivers aquatic organisms are exposed to sequential disturbances including flow cessation potentially associated with water warming desiccation process and flow resumption at flow resumption pollutants stored in soil and washed by rainfalls can reach fresh waters the interaction between contamination and river intermittency is poorly understood in this study we aimed at understanding in what extent the intensity of dry period combined or not to water warming drives the sensitivity of aquatic communities to a complex agricultural run off aro during rewetting phototrophic biofilms at the basis of freshwater food webs were chosen as a model of community biofilms grown in laboratory were first exposed to a disturbance crossing two temperature conditions not warmed 22 c or warmed 32 c and three dry periods no drying short 3 days or long 3 months then they were exposed to a chemical mix of nitrates copper and 3 pesticides at 6 gradual concentrations various descriptors associated with biofilm structure and function were assessed one week after aro addition when undisturbed biofilms were exposed to aro they shifted toward a more heterotrophic state as they lost algal richness and diversity and gross primary production tended to decrease warming alone only slightly modified the sensitivity of biofilms to aro with lower effects on algal richness and a trend to increase the effect on gross primary production in contrast the association of warming and a dry period strongly modified the sensitivity to aro certainly due to the selection of generalist species and or physiological acclimation inducted by the first disturbance this study emphasizes the importance of considering water intermittency in the management of the ecological risk of chemicals in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords global change desiccation process agricultural runoff sequential disturbance phototrophic biofilms 1 introduction intermittent rivers represent more than 50 of rivers worldwide datry et al 2014 they can be found on every continent within every climate messager et al 2021 a river is considered intermittent or nonperennial if its flow ceases and the riverbed dries out a part of the year datry et al 2017a even if this phenomenon is frequent and naturally occurs in arid and semiarid regions because of low precipitation events and strong direct evaporation it is exacerbated by climate change and human uses and is expected to increase both in space and duration sabater et al 2016 the prevalence of intermittency requires to adjust the classical model of river for a more accurate understanding and prediction of river functioning biodiversity and vulnerability intermittency is a complex phenomenon which covers contrasted situations during the desiccation process the water flow first decreases and the system undergoes a slow transition from a lotic toward a lentic system datry et al 2017b the decrease of water level induces modifications of water quality depending notably on the hydrological drivers and mass balance in the system mosley 2015 for instance temperature increase has been observed in many studies during drought up to 7 degrees in a regulated river ha et al 1999 after this first step the riverbed completely dries out and there is a shift toward terrestrial habitat for some days to several months before rewetting occurs sabater et al 2016 depending on land use practices agricultural contaminants stored in soils during drought can be leached by the precipitation events and reach fresh waters through runoff exposing aquatic communities to a cocktail of pollutants during flow resumption a post drought increase in nitrate concentration was thus observed in several studies see mosley 2015 in this context flow intermittency can be considered as a sequence of different disturbances occurring before during and after the dry period that can affect all the river biocenosis benthic microbial communities which cannot circumvent such disturbances are particularly exposed to the consequences of river intermittency phototrophic biofilms are benthic microbial communities made up of both phototrophic and heterotrophic cells embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix these communities are of major importance in ecosystem functioning as they are key primary producers in many rivers and are involved in organic matter and nutrient cycling battin et al 2016 their short generation time makes them early warning systems to many stressors sabater et al 2007 especially to chemical stressors from agriculture practices like fertilizers trace metals such as copper widely used for vineyard culture but also organic pesticides herbicides insecticides fungicides biofilm structural and functional responses to independent chemical stressors have been well studied for instance nutrients enhance biofilm growth rate and functioning but can also induce significant changes in community structure by favouring filamentous green algae dalton et al 2015 compared to planktonic algae biofilms exhibit an important tolerance to copper contamination with usually few effects on functioning even at high concentration 2 mg l 1 zhong zhao and song 2020 in contrast they tend to be negatively impacted by organic herbicides although the effect of combinations of pesticides are more difficult to predict halstead et al 2014 more generally the chemical complexity of agricultural run off makes difficult to predict its effects on biofilm as the interactions of stressors do not result in a simple addition of stressor effects pesce et al 2011 warming and desiccation are the main effects of river flow drying up with global change intensity i e duration of dry periods is expected to increase and increasing temperatures intensify the severity of drought chiang et al 2021 when temperature increases metabolic activities are enhanced for instance under warming biofilms use more carbon substrates ylla et al 2014 and basal fluorescence and enzymatic activity are enhanced romero et al 2018 conversely desiccation appears to have negative impacts on biofilm structure and functioning during desiccation photosynthetic processes weaken regardless of the disturbance duration while heterotrophic activities and community respiration could persist longer depending on the humidity degree remaining in biofilm acuña et al 2015 besides those functional responses it has been shown that desiccation tends to induce changes in both algal and bacterial communities mckew et al 2011 sabater et al 2016 some studies have investigated the response of microbial communities to a stressor after a prior exposure to another disturbance but with contrasted results in some cases the community was then more affected e g tobor kapłon et al 2006 while in others the exposure to a first disturbance decreased the effects of the second one the microbial community showing antagonistic responses to the successive disturbances e g sjöstedt et al 2018 antagonistic responses can be explained by different mechanisms first some species in the community can exhibit co tolerance to both disturbances vinebrooke et al 2004 with the selection of generalist species that are usually less sensitive to environmental changes chen et al 2021 acquired stress resistance can also be implied after a first disturbance communities have been prepared to resist a second one rillig et al 2015 on the opposite additive or synergic effects can be observed when there is a negative correlation between species tolerance to each disturbance vinebrooke et al 2004 therefore the outcome of the disturbance sequence for a microbial community strongly depends on the order of disturbances this was experimentally demonstrated in soil microbial communities by manipulating the sequence of three different disturbances heat freeze thaw and anoxia calderón et al 2018 in intermittent rivers rewetting appears to be a hot biogeochemical moment mcclain et al 2003 i e shortly after the water returns biogeochemical processes are reactivated and all biological activities are exacerbated including primary production and respiration timoner et al 2012 it appears important to understand in which extent phototrophic biofilms that are critical for the whole river functioning could be sensitive to contaminants leached by precipitations during rewetting some studies may provide a partial response proia et al 2013 have shown that flow reduction and interruption amplified the effects of one contaminant the triclosan on river biofilms corcoll et al 2015 highlighted the cumulative effects of the exposure to a mixture of pharmaceuticals followed by a dry period however these previous studies do not allow to predict the sensitivity to a complex agricultural run off aro of biofilms that have experienced a complete drying such a complex aro whose components nutrients herbicide insecticide fungicide heavy metal may have antagonistic effects has been already shown to induce either positive or neutral effects on biofilm biomass allen et al 2021 this study aims at quantifying how the sensitivity of phototrophic biofilms to a complex agricultural runoff is modulated by river intermittency history we conducted a microcosm experiment where we first manipulated both water warming and the duration of the dry period and then we exposed produced biofilms to a gradient of aro concentrations during rewetting the objective was to understand in what extent the first disturbance dry period and or warming drives the structural and functional biofilm response to the exposure to contaminant our hypothesis was that the first disturbance will decrease biofilm sensitivity to contamination through the selection of co tolerant species 2 material and methods complex phototrophic biofilms were grown in the laboratory they were next exposed to a typical dryness sequence that consisted in a period of no flow nf followed by a short dry period s or a long dry period l combined or not with warming nw or w fig 1 next biofilms were exposed to aro enriched water at gradual concentrations to mimic rewetting with gradually contaminated water 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 biofilm growth natural biofilms were sampled in february 2020 in the river garonne 43 396635 1 300394 south west france biofilms were scrapped with a toothbrush on field and were stored in river water at 4 c back to

to mimic the first step of dryness process colonised ceramic coupons were thus dispatched in 36 crystallizers 15 coupons per crystalliser filled with 600 ml of volvic water in 2 distinct thermostatic chambers ventilation 100 in the same lighting conditions than during growth after this first week produced biofilms were exposed to contrasted hydric stress at both temperatures one third of coupons were dried up for a short period 3 days one third were dried up for a long 84 days period before contamination and the remaining third was not dried up and directly exposed to contamination dry period durations applied are in the range of dry durations extending from 1 to 150 days observed in mediterranean streams colls et al 2019 and within the range of what can be observed in french intermittent rivers snelder et al 2013 2 1 3 second disturbance the contaminant cocktail used was the same as in allen et al 2021 it consisted in a mix of nitrates kno3 copper cuso4 that is a metallic trace

tubes were stored at 20 c before quantification the piercetm bca protein assay kit n 23223 sigma aldrich was used to quantify proteins content in eps smith et al 1985 bovine serum albumin bsa was used

fluorescence measurement phytopam measurements phytoplankton analyzer heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany have been carried out on 1 10 diluted 200 µl biofilm suspensions the maximal quantum yield of photosystem ii psii or φpsii was used to assess algal physiological state this metric depends on the algal species present in the biofilm but also on the physiological state of cells as it decreases when algae are stressed or damaged roháček and barták 1999 measurements of φpsii were done under dark adapted state baker 2008 φpsii 0 φpsii 1 corresponds to the ratio fv fm where fv fm f0 with fm the maximal fluorescence and f0 the minimal fluorescence of psii roháček and barták 1999 2 3 data analysis all analyses were performed using r software version 3 6 1 r development core team for all response variables normality was tested and log transformed if necessary a pca was performed in order to visualize the effects of the first disturbance and contamination on biofilm global structure and functioning fig 2 effects of dry period duration d and warming w were tested with permanovas the two first component pc1 and pc2 of the pca were extracted and coordinates were used as summary variables to describe the response of biofilms two ways anovas d x w and tukey post hoc tests were performed on each variable as well as on pc1 and pc2 in a second time we assessed biofilm sensitivity to aro by comparing the slopes of biofilm response to contaminant concentrations depending on the first disturbance biofilms were exposed to therefore linear regressions were conducted on every variable as a function of contaminant concentrations variables were standardised using z score to enable comparison between effects a significant regression t test indicates a significant effect of the increasing contaminant concentration on the variable regression slopes as well as standard deviations were extracted for each first disturbance treatment and plotted together to compare the effects 3 results 3 1 biofilm response to dry period and warming permanova analysis demonstrated a significant effect of dry period duration p 0 001 on the global biofilm response such an effect was clearly described by the first pca component fig 2 the longer the dry period was the more biofilm shifted toward heterotrophy fig 3 table si2 these results were consistent with those observed on

a negative response to warming with significantly less diatom specific pigments after exposure to warming fig 3 p 0 001 table si2 a negative effect of warming was observed on bacterial density after the longest dry period fig 3 p 0 001 table si2 3 2 biofilm sensitivity to aro contamination the contaminant used to mimic aro consisted in a mix of nitrates kno3 copper cuso4 and three organic pesticides an herbicide a fungicide and an insecticide the response of the different descriptors to contamination was assessed by analysing the estimated regression slopes between each variable and the contaminant concentrations when the regression was significant table si3 fig si1 aro contamination induced a significant increase in pc1 value in the treatments nw fn w nf and w l fig 4 which indicates an increase in biofilm heterotrophy fig 2 contamination had no impact on pc1 values of the other treatments the effect of contaminant on pc2 was significant for biofilms that were previously dried for a short time and those subjected to warming alone nf nw p 0 05 similar slope values were observed for all the other treatments except for w l contamination had no impact on the algal

previously disturbed biofilms biofilms previously subjected to a long dry period with warming exhibited a shift from green algae to cyanobacteria fig 4 this response to aro contamination was confirmed on the second pca axis fig 2 low aro contaminated 0 1x 10x samples dominated by green algae are clearly distinct from high aro contaminated 50x 100x 250x samples dominated by cyanobacteria when biofilms were previously exposed to warming the total carbon content decreased with contamination fig 4 t 2 771 p 0 05 but this sensitivity to contamination diminished with increasing dry period

dried fig 4 t 2 734 0 05 on the contrary gross primary production fig 4 and net primary production fig 4 tended to decrease with contamination only when biofilms were not previously dried though it was significant only for the w nf treatment t 3 582 p 0 023 4 discussion the prevalence of intermittency in world rivers messager et al 2021 makes necessary to take into account their specificities in the assessment of aquatic ecosystem vulnerability to anthropogenic stressors the aim of this study was to assess if intermittency would alter the sensitivity of a river microbial community to a complex contamination in addition to dryness we considered the effect of water warming associated to water flow cessation though the response of biofilm to a synthetic agricultural run off aro was moderate our results show that it is strongly driven by biofilm history of disturbance response to aro in previously undisturbed biofilms the biofilms produced for the experiment were mainly dominated by cyanobacteria and in a lesser extent by diatoms and were characterized by a positive net primary production when exposed to increasing aro contamination such phototrophic communities lost algal richness and diversity and gpp tended to decrease while heterotrophy was enhanced fig 4 pc1 loss in pigment richness and diversity was likely linked to the removal of species sensitive to aro notably to copper and herbicide that were expected to negatively affect microalgae sousa et al 2019 despite this effect previously undisturbed biofilms globally exhibited rather low sensitivity to aro given the very high concentrations applied with values reaching 750 mg l 1 of n no3 3 5 mg l 1 of cu and 250 µg l 1 of terbuthylazine different reasons such as aro complexity biofilm abilities to resist and experimental timing may explain such rather weak effects first the pesticides toxic effects could be counterbalanced by positive effects of n inputs at lowest aro concentrations as shown by aristi et al 2016 and therefore could mitigate pesticides impact additionally n inputs may have increased heterotrophy by providing an alternative electron acceptor that may promote heterotrophic activities denitrification in the anoxic deeper layers of biofilms such a compensation between negative and positive effects of aro components depending on aro concentration is also consistent with the negative impact we observed on gpp at the highest aro concentrations resistance to organic pesticides and heavy metals is notably linked to the eps matrix which adsorbs those pollutants flemming et al 2016 and to biofilm thickness that limits contact between microbial cells and pesticides for the deeper layers davies 2003 the biofilm biomasses reached in this study correspond to those of mature natural biofilms boulêtreau et al 2006 and eps production is similar to the one of classic biofilms kroll et al 2014 so that such resistance mechanisms may occur finally biofilms were likely to exhibit a partial recovery since they were sampled one week after aro addition and algae can recover very fast from herbicide exposure as already shown for atrazine a photosynthesis inhibitor like terbuthylazine laviale et al 2011 response to aro in biofilms pre exposed to warming water temperature can dramatically increase over flow cessation desiccation and fragmentation into isolated pools gómez et al 2017 in accordance with field personal observations we experimented how a 10 c heatwave could modulate aro sensitivity despite the high intensity of the heatwave biofilm response to aro contamination was not strongly impacted by warming the response of warmed but undried biofilms to aro was globally similar to the one of previously undisturbed biofilms however pigments richness decrease was weaker respiration tended to be enhanced and gpp was inhibited by aro in biofilms pre exposed to warming this indicates that a warming event before contamination would tend to mitigate algal simplification but would amplify biofilm functioning shift toward heterotrophy switches to heterotrophy due to warming have been observed in natural biofilms in intermittent rivers acuña et al 2015 this is partly explained by the higher metabolic response of respiration than photosynthesis to temperature boulêtreau et al 2012 weak effects of warming observed on biofilm pigment composition do not rule out possible replacements of algal or bacterial species according to their thermal preferences since the taxonomic composition of the communities was not assessed here many studies have considered the effect of contaminants depending on temperature but in most cases the stressors were applied simultaneously rather than sequentially nutrient supply combined with warming induced changes in structure with enhanced bacterial growth degerman et al 2013 in this study authors have shown that increasing nutrient concentration enhanced growth with a stronger positive effect when the temperature exposure was higher 4 c increasing temperature 3 6 and 10 c also reduced the negative effects of toxic organic pollutants larras et al 2013 when applied before contamination warming could select species that are tolerant to heavy metal exposure and reduce the effects of the latter pesce et al 2018 on the opposite lambert et al 2017 noticed that the sensitivity of phototrophic biofilms to copper increased after warming these contradictory observations all fit with the theory of co tolerance developed by vinebrooke et al 2004 when two disturbances are applied successively the first disturbance can either increase the tolerance to the second disturbance through antagonist effects rillig et al 2015 li et al 2014 or increase the sensitivity through synergic effects the lower decrease in pigment richness compared to undisturbed biofilms and the weak global warming effect we observed on contaminated biofilms pre exposed to warming could be explained by a positive correlation between warming and contamination effects on species tolerance species more tolerant to aro could have been already selected by warming pre exposure all these experimental results suggest that the outcome of successive disturbances is far from easy to predict depending on the initial community composition species properties and the nature and chronology of the disturbances response to aro in previously dried biofilms non perennial rivers and streams cover a wide spectrum of flow conditions from rarely intermittent rivers periodically experiencing flow cessation during a few days to ephemeral streams that only temporally flow after intense rainfall consistently we exposed biofilms to two contrasted durations a short dry period of 3 days and a long dry period of 3 months dry period is a very strong disturbance for the aquatic organisms forming phototrophic biofilms inducing a high mortality rate in algae barthès et al 2015a souffreau et al 2010 however even after quite long dry periods biofilms are able to quickly recover and resume their functioning e g timoner et al 2012 fast recovery is partly due to the ability of some species to form resting spores to resist dry period hargraves and french 1983 and to become active again within hours and days of flow resumption robson et al 2008 high functional resilience is often coupled with a low structural resilience with marked modification of the composition of both algal and bacterial components barthès et al 2015b gottlieb richards and gaiser 2005 in our experiment biofilms exposed to a dry period showed deep modifications of their composition well visible on the pca first component with less chlorophyll a biomass less eps lower pigment diversity and more bacteria dry period also resulted in changes in biofilm productivity with a consistent decrease in gpp this trend toward heterotrophy is likely also promoted by the release of nutrients by dead algal cells in previously dried biofilms there was almost no effect of aro contamination visible on the pca first component the contamination tended to mitigate the effect of the first disturbance on eps production eps were reduced by half with dryness whatever its duration but slightly increased with aro contamination this makes sense since eps are known to play a role in algal protection against heavy metals flemming et al 2016 dryness also led to lower aro sensitivity of pigment richness and diversity similarly to what was observed for biofilms pre exposed to warming this can be explained by the selection of co tolerant species as hypothesized for warming it may also be linked to the fact that dry period had already a very strong effect on pigment diversity the maximum quantum yield of psii fv fm was negatively impacted by aro in dried biofilms in contrast with undisturbed or biofilms pre exposed to warming fv fm value can reflect the nature of the main algal groups present in biofilm but aro did not induce clear changes in green algae cyanobacteria and diatom proportions therefore the observed decrease in fv fm suggests dry period would amplify the deterioration of the physiological state of algae laviale 2008 probably due to pesticide exposition tiam et al 2015 in terms of functioning previously dried biofilms exhibited a global lower sensitivity to contaminant than undisturbed biofilms with notably npp and gpp less affected by aro this apparent reduced sensitivity is consistent with some previous studies for instance calapez et al 2020 found that after a combined exposure to no flow and to sewage contamination both the negative effect of contaminant on algae and the positive effect on bacteria were less pronounced than after contaminant exposure alone similarly it has been shown that after intermittency biofilms were able to maintain biodegradation of a certain pharmaceutical when exposed to emerging contaminants while biofilms exposed to permanent flow were not rožman et al 2018 it should be noted that in these two studies biofilms were exposed to complex contaminants on the contrary proia et al 2013 observed that flow intermittency increased biofilm sensitivity to triclosan suggesting that the toxicity of pollutants may be exacerbated following a drought in the present study the regressions point out that the physical disturbance induced by the dry period had the highest impact on biofilms and that the chemical stressor did not significantly intensify drought induced changes a similar observation emerged from the meta analysis performed by arenas sánchez et al 2016 on studies focusing on the co occurring effects of water scarcity and chemical pollution on micro and macro organisms in aquatic ecosystems this highlights the necessity to prioritize at least minimal water support in river management response to aro in biofilms previously exposed to both disturbances as seen on the pca the combination of warming and dry period induced a strong modification of biofilm algal composition green algae replaced cyanobacteria and diatoms which dominated undisturbed biofilm this modification of algal composition may explain why those biofilms exhibited highest fv fm than undisturbed biofilms since green algae have highest fv fm than cyanobacteria suggett et al 2009 when these previously disturbed biofilms were exposed to aro the proportion of green algae and fv fm significantly decreased and cyanobacteria proportion increased this stronger response to aro quite visible on the pca plot may be explained by a higher sensitivity of green algae to aro ma 2005 5 conclusion as a whole these results show very clearly that previous warming and or dryness modulate biofilm response to a complex contaminant added during rewetting we hypothesized that the first disturbance would decrease biofilm sensitivity to contamination this was only partially observed since warming decreased the aro effects on biofilm composition but amplified them on biofilm functioning dry periods significantly reduced the contaminant effects our findings show that the first disturbance was the one impacting the most biofilms the low sensitivity of dried biofilm to aro is certainly due to the selection of generalist species or the induction of physiological responses by the first disturbance that allow biofilm to resist contamination during rewetting our study emphasizes the importance of considering the hydrological history of a microbial community when assessing its sensitivity to a contaminant and more generally the requirement to consider water scarcity

16034,a pilot scale chlorine contact tank cct with flexible baffling was installed at an operational water treatment plant wtp taking a direct feed from the outlet of the rapid gravity filters rgf for the first time disinfection efficacy was established by direct microbial monitoring in a continuous reactor using flow cytometry fcm disinfection variables of dose time and hydraulic efficiency short circuiting and dispersion were explored following characterisation of the reactor s residence time distributions rtd by tracer testing fcm enabled distinction to be made between changes in disinfection reactor design where standard culture based methods could not the product of chlorine concentration c and residence time t correlated well with inactivation of microbes organisms with the highest cell reductions n n0 reaching 0 025 at ct x of 20 mg min l and above the influence of reactor geometry on disinfection was best shown from the ct10 this identified that the initial level of microbial inactivation was higher in unbaffled reactors for low ct10 values although the highest levels of inactivation of 0 015 could only be achieved in the baffled reactors because these conditions enabled the highest ct10 values to be achieved increased levels of disinfection were closely associated with increased formation of the trihalomethane disinfection by products the results highlight the importance of well designed and operated cct the improved resolution afforded by fcm provides a tool that can dynamically quantify disinfection processes enabling options for much better process control keywords disinfection microorganisms chlorine drinking water flow cytometry 1 introduction disinfection by chlorine remains the final barrier in most drinking water treatment systems before water enters distribution the efficacy of disinfection is typically designed using the product of the chlorine concentration c and the disinfection contact time t known as the ct the desired flow conditions in chlorine contact tanks cct used for disinfection should be as close to plug flow as possible to ensure the full contact time is experienced by all portions of the water being treated true plug flow is seldom achieved due to incompatible geometries the ideal is a narrow channel with a length to width l w ratio greater than 40 or increased dispersion due to turbulence caused by friction effects with the walls and baffles rauen et al 2012 non ideal flow conditions are detrimental to the performance of ccts leading to short circuiting and unwanted recirculation within the reactor short circuiting occurs when a proportion of the fluid by passes much of the available reactor volume and exits the reactor sooner than the theoretical hydraulic retention time hrt in turn this can lead to insufficient inactivation of microorganisms as that portion of the flow would not receive the desired ct recirculation leads to excessive contact time in dead zones and promotes short circuiting due the reduction in the effective operating proportion of the tank the importance of having as close to ideal flow conditions in ccts has been demonstrated previously using both empirical and theoretical testing angeloudis et al 2014a teixeira et al 2008 rauen et al 2008 the effectiveness of a cct can be described with hydraulic efficiency indicators heis that are derived from residence time distributions teixeira et al 2008 heis can also be derived via computational fluid dynamics cfd a simulation approach that does not require physical experimental testing and avoids potential scaling issues rauen et al 2012 angeloudis et al 2014a b 2016 goodarzi et al 2020 however calibration of cfd models is required and it is preferential to carry out physical testing to best calibrate the simulations falconer 1986 estimates of disinfection efficacy in ccts have been made using established disinfection inactivation kinetic calculations chick watson law and disinfection by product dbp formation kinetics brown et al 2011 angeloudis et al 2014a however these experiments did not record real microbial inactivation rates this is an important consideration given that organisms of different characteristics have a unique residence time distribution in tanks in addition to having different inactivation kinetics asraf snir and gitis 2011 as a result research is ongoing as to which model best describes the transport of particles in this case bacteria through the reactor and the most appropriate disinfection kinetic model that should be used in cfd approaches angeloudis 2014 to date no papers have reported the use of direct microbial monitoring of environmental microbes to assess disinfection variables in ccts the traditional approach of monitoring microbial inactivation during disinfection is by using indicator organisms this becomes challenging at the low bacterial concentrations presented at disinfection stages resulting in limited detection and a high error on measurements cheswick et al 2019 in addition pathogen surrogates coliforms escherichia coli or enterococci are not suitable performance indicators due to the rare occurrence of these organisms before and after disinfection as well as their high sensitivity to chlorine an alternative is to monitor heterotrophic bacteria using heterotrophic plate counting hpc these bacteria are typically abundant in drinking water and may have higher recovery rates following disinfection making them a more suitable process indicator hijnen 2008 however chlorination can lead to the loss of bacterial culturability without destroying the cell which can lead to skewed representations of inactivation berney et al 2006 in addition it has been concluded that hpc measurements do not provide any information on the hygienic quality of the water van nevel et al 2017 an alternative approach is the use of flow cytometry fcm for quantifying the autochthonous bacterial population in drinking water there have been many demonstrations of the benefits of this technique over traditional culture based methods hoefel et al 2005 berney et al 2007 ho et al 2012 van nevel et al 2017 cheswick et al 2019 successful application has been shown in laboratory studies investigating various oxidant kinetics ramseier et al 2010 ding et al 2019 cheswick et al 2020 and real time monitoring of biocide kinetics heat and ciprofloxacin exposure arnoldini et al 2013 this methodology has also gained significant attention as a tool for assessing operational water treatment plants wtps helmi et al 2014 cheswick et al 2019 distribution systems gillespie et al 2014 nescerecka et al 2018 and in water reuse safford and bischel 2018 whitton et al 2018 however there is a knowledge gap in the ability of fcm to be used for optimisation and design of disinfection processes the aim of this work was to determine the role that fcm can play in developing our understanding of disinfection in continuous flow chlorine contact tanks and establish relationships between hydraulic efficiency indicators and inactivation this was achieved by comparing traditional microbial monitoring parameters hpc and indicator organisms with that of total and intact cells measured by fcm in a pilot scale cct reactor with various baffling arrangements and flow rates treating real water the inactivation achieved was compared to other disinfection parameters including formation of disinfection by products dbps in chlorinated water the novelty of the present work was to therefore use fcm to directly determine disinfection efficacy establishing the role that advanced microbial monitoring can play in future development and monitoring of chlorine disinfection 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions a pilot scale cct was located at an operational wtp in scotland uk the wtp was a conventional surface water treatment plant fig 1 a the pilot plant was supplied with water from the wtp following filtration and was representative of real water presented to disinfection the reactor mimicked a typical longitudinal serpentine baffled cct with the option of removing baffles to change the hydraulic conditions fig 1b the cct was 1 8 m long 1 2 m wide with a water of depth 0 42 m the minimal channel width was 0 23 m when fully baffled and 1 3 m when unbaffled flow rates were varied using a pump supply from the filtered water channel and monitored using a flowmeter siemens sitrans f m mag nordborg denmark sodium hypochlorite was dosed via a dosing pump grundfus digital dosing control ddc grundfos pumps ltd bedfordshire uk prior to an inline static mixer downstream of this mixer was a turbidity metre ami turbiwell swan analytical usa inc illinois usa and a free chlorine monitor hach cl17 manchester uk at the outlet of the tank was a rhodamine sensor with internal data logger cyclops 7 turner designs california usa for tracer testing and a second free chlorine monitor a programmable logic controller plc allowed for outlet chlorine concentrations to be controlled tests were carried out over a range of flow rates to provide theoretical hrt t of between 10 and 40 min two chlorine doses were applied 0 5 and 1 mg l cl2 and three baffling conditions incorporating an un ub partially 2b and fully baffled fb reactor geometry with 0 2 and 4 baffles respectively conditions were selected to cover a range of operational chlorine concentrations and residence times as well as considering best to worst baffling arrangements table 1 sampling took place once a period of three theoretical hrt had expired and the outlet chlorine concentration was stabilised to allow complete turnover of the water and an equilibrium to be reached for each condition tested 500 ml samples were taken from a sample tap in the outlet pipework immediately at the exit of the tank the diameter of this outlet pipe was 10 cm and hence the sample taken was assumed to be representative of the bulk flow chlorine was quenched from the sample using sodium thiosulphate with a subsample taken for analysis on the day of collection for each condition three replicate samples were taken with data reported as the arithmetic mean of the samples 2 2 tracer experiments tracer experiments were carried out using the pulse trace methodology with rhodamine wt acros organics geel belgium a submersible fluorometer at a maximum resolution of t 3 s was used for the detection of the rhodamine trace each tracer experiment lasted for a minimum of three theoretical retention times and subsequent tests were only carried out after a fourth retention time had passed to allow complete turnover of the water within the reactor the tracer was added to the inlet of the reactor via a manual syringe injection of rhodamine wt solution 20 ml at 35 mg l mass of rhodamine added 7000 µg this injection time was within that recommended by marske and boyle 1973 and was no more than 1 50th of the reactor retention time to effectively describe the residence time distribution rtd the results were normalised using the e curve method levenspeil 2012 the mean residence time t x was calculated from the area under the concentration c time t curve equation 1 t x 0 t c δ t 0 c δ t this curve was transformed into the e curve such that the area under the curve was unity using the tracer mass m and reactor flow rate q equation 2 e c q m the e curve was then translated into an e θ curve from equation 3 e θ x e finally the normalised time θ was calculated from the measured time t and the theoretical retention time t equation 4 θ t t the rtd variance σ 2 was calculated from equation 5 σ 2 t 2 c δ t c δ t θ 2 the variance and the mean residence time was then used to calculate the dispersion index of the rtd curve σ t 2 equation 6 σ t 2 σ 2 x 2 this normalisation allows for interpretation of the hydraulic performance across variable flow rates time specific tracer parameters were recorded and heis table 2 were calculated using the rtd results and were classified from poor to excellent based on criteria from awwa 2006 and angeloudis et al 2014a si table s1 2 3 water quality measurements hpcs were determined by mixing 1 ml of sample into 18 ml of molten yeast extract agar yea oxoid thermofisher scientific uk these plates were duplicated with one incubated at 37 c for 48 h hpc 37 c and the second at 22 c for 72 h hpc 22 c in accordance with standard methods the determination of coliforms and e coli was carried out by membrane filtration 100 ml of sample was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter plates were incubated at 30 c for 4 h and then 37 c for 14 h fcm analysis for determination of intact icc and total cell counts tcc was carried out using an adapted method as described previously gillespie et al 2014 with the amendment of a 25 μl undiluted sample volume in accordance with the rapid method described by van nevel et al 2013 for measurement of tcc sybr green i 10 000 x stock cat

following the addition of the dyes the samples were incubated in a plate incubator for 30 min at 30 c in the dark following incubation 25 μl samples were analysed using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm solid state laser becton dickinson uk ltd oxford uk in accordance with the rapid method described by van nevel et al 2013 the fcm was calibrated with spherotech validation beads becton dickinson uk ltd oxford uk to ensure that the instrument was operating within acceptable limits as stated by the manufacturer green fluorescence was collected in the fl1 channel at 533 nm fl1 and red fluorescence in the fl3 channel at 670 nm fl3 with the trigger set on the green fluorescence no compensation was used tcc and icc were quantified using a fixed gate as used previously for detection of bacteria present in natural water sources gatza et al 2013 cheswick et al 2020 all data were reported back above the reported limit of quantification of 1 102 cells and well below the upper limit of quantification 1 107 cells the frequency of microorganisms contained in this gate after staining with sybr green i or sybr green i pi formed the basis for calculations of tcc or icc per ml data was processed using the accuri c6 software trihalomethane thm concentrations were measured in samples exiting the cct following chlorination following methods reported elsewhere golea et al 2019 chlorine was quenched with excess sodium thiosulphate following sampling the total thm concentration tthm was measured using gas chromatography spectrometry with headspace injection using the standard usepa 551 method usepa 1998 a minimum of 7 injections were undertaken for each measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality the water quality entering the pilot remained stable throughout the trial with respect to ph ph 6 4 0 1 temperature 12 7 0 5 c and doc 2 7 0 3 mg l such that a consistent chlorine demand of 0 18 0 05 mg l was presented si table s2 the consistency of the water quality enabled the inactivation data to be directly related to the two components of chlorine dose and hydraulic conditions white 2010 haas and engelbrecht 1980 the culture based bacterial counts in the inlet had significant variation for example the hpc 22 c had an average of 40 cfu ml with a minimum of non detectable and a maximum of 300 cfu ml the hpc 37 c had even lower counts with most samples returning non detect samples and a maximum of 4 cfu ml in contrast the fcm icc remained relatively consistent throughout the trial 5 20 105 3 36 104 cells ml with cell concentration values that were between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude higher than seen for the culture based method only three hpc positive detections were observed after chlorine addition from the samples taken at the reactor outlet maximum cfu ml 3 all other samples n 53 were reported as non detectable these results highlight the poor resolution afforded by traditional culture based methods for assessment of log reductions across water treatment processes this impact is particularly seen for disinfection due to the low number of cells going into and out of the process fcm on the other hand was able to detect significant cell concentrations in both the inlet and outlet see inactivation section allowing much better assessment of the true efficacy of disinfection 3 2 hydraulic performance the hydraulic performance of the pilot cct was improved as baffling increased approaching idealised plug flow pf conditions this highlights the importance of considering the hydraulic efficiency in ct calculations the unbaffled condition ub showed a large spike of tracer leaving the reactor shortly after injection due to streaming across the tank this was followed by a long tail of the trace caused by the large recirculation zone in the centre of the tank example for hrt of 20 min shown in fig 2 this profile was typical of an unbaffled reactor and similar to that of a continuously stirred reactor cstr rather than the desired pf conditions levenspiel 2012 summary rtd values show how the baffles improve hydraulic efficiency for each of the flow rates si figure s1 and table s3 to demonstrate analysis of the rtd for the ub reactor at a theoretical hrt 20 mins gave a t10 t of 0 09 showing in this case that 10 of the tracer had exited the reactor within 1 8 min of the injection approaches to quantify mixing in the tank using the dispersion index σt 2 0 735 and the morril index mo 15 45 resulted in values classified as poor by the hei descriptors with the introduction of two baffles in the tank the rtd profile improved the tracer front was held back from short circuiting the reactor rapidly and the tail of the rtd was shortened the introduction of these channels reduced the dispersion and improved the value of the dispersion index to a level associated with an hei descriptor of acceptable σt 2 0 188 similarly the morril index improved from an hei descriptor of compromising to one classified as acceptable mo 2 15 table s3 short circuiting was reduced t10 t 0 47 but was still evident as a result of 50 of the tank volume remaining un baffled which allowed for streaming in the final compartment it was evident from visual observation of the tracer that recirculation was occurring in this final section of the tank fig 3 when fully baffled the rtd resembled a normally distributed curve centred around the theoretical residence time θ 1 short circuiting was significantly reduced to a value associated with an hei descriptor of excellent for serpentine cct reactors t10 t 0 79 and dispersion was brought down to a level commensurate with the descriptor excellent σt 2 0 034 this was visually confirmed by a compact tracer block moving through the tank fig 3 and video files available here doi org 10 17862 cranfield rd 16773220 comparison of the hydraulic efficiency of the different baffle arrangements was assessed at three hrts and compared in relation to t10 t σt 2 and mo si figure s1 and table s3 the normalised heis indicated only small variation as a function of hrt as illustrated through the t10 t ranges which were 0 09 0 13 0 46 0 49 and 0 79 0 89 for the unbaffled two baffles and fully baffled tanks respectively importantly only the fully baffled arrangement delivered acceptable hydraulic conditions for all flow rates investigated whilst partial baffling improved the hydraulic performance relative to the unbaffled reactor appropriate conditions were only seen for specific flow rates revealing a loss of resilience in the system this distinction between baffling arrangements was also seen for the two mixing indices σt 2 and mo although the separation was less clearly defined between the two baffle reactor and the fully baffled system for the mo the t90 t increased substantially from 1 1 to 1 7 for the unbaffled reactor as the residence time decreased evidence of the long tail of tracer as the flow rate through the reactor reduced si figure s2 less distinction was seen for t90 t in the baffled systems overall baffling had a larger impact on hei s than the flow rate a finding supported by zhang et al 2014 who also saw that the t10 t and morril index were unaffected by changing flow rates for the fully baffled contactor no dead zones were evident although tx was t indicating that there was some recirculation of the tracer at the outlet of the tank an effect that was exaggerated at the longer hrt of 40 mins for the two baffle contact tank the dead volume remained similar at the different hrt between 19 2 and 24 2 for unbaffled reactors the volume of the dead zone in the reactor increased from 32 0 38 3 and 71 3 with theoretical hrt of 10 20 and 40 respectively the comparison of the heis indicate that the different tank arrangements were best distinguished by the t10 t the two mixing heis should not be considered in isolation as an acceptable σt 2 and excellent mo could be classified as compromising with regards to the short circuiting index t10 t a situation seen for the two baffle chlorination reactor when considering mixing the σt 2 has been reported to be the most suitable mixing index for assessment of ccts as it considers the whole rtd function teixeira et al 2008 this was consistent with the observations seen here where better distinction was seen between the mixing in the two baffled system compared to the fully baffled reactor 3 3 inactivation efficiency in order to assess the efficacy of disinfection samples were taken from the inlet and outlet of the cct for each experimental assessment of baffling and hrt condition fig 4 a at the inlet to the cct there was a median hpc count of 26cfu ml with the minimum reported value as non detectable and a maximum reported as 300 cfu ml as noted nearly all samples from the outlet were reported as non detectable thus preventing assessment of removal efficacy across the cct using culture based methods this variation is typical of that seen when using total viable count methods and is routinely seen in operational practice where more than 92 of samples in chlorinated water are typically returned as non detects cheswick et al 2019 irrespective of the disinfection conditions only a single coliform colony was detected by standard microbiological analysis table s2 no e coli were detected throughout the entirety of the study these findings reinforce the challenge of microbial monitoring of disinfection processes when using traditional methods in contrast the results from fcm analysis carried out on the same sample offered more insights into process performance providing data that has not been previously available at the inlet to the cct there was a median tcc observed of 613 440 cells ml reaching a maximum of 867 200 cells ml and a minimum of 510 160 cells ml the median icc at the inlet was 86 of the tcc median at 527 960 cells ml showing that a proportion of cells had compromised membrane integrity prior to disinfection at the outlet of the reactor there was a much wider variation in the tcc than those observed at the inlet the median tcc was 5 lower in the outlet than the tcc at the inlet 579 600 cells ml whilst the range of tcc went from 23 600 to 835 200 cells ml as cells were oxidised by chlorine in the cct many cellular structures will be sufficiently damaged such that they will no longer interact with the fluorescing dyes as a result this will reduce the total number of cells counted particularly in systems where microbes had been exposed to longer cts represented by the long bottom whisker in fig 4b the median icc was much lower than for the inlet at 25 280 cells ml range 7080 to 39 920 cells ml importantly this enabled the importance of baffling and the connection between inactivation and hydraulic indicators to be re examined through a more detailed lens the results also show the suitability of using icc to determine the efficacy of chlorine based disinfection chlorine is a non selective oxidant that damages cellular components notably the cell membrane damage to cell membranes is strongly associated with reduced viability of both pure cultured and environmental bacteria nocker et al 2017 no relationships were found between the concentrations of hpc and fcm cell counts for either icc or tcc this is a result consistent with previous studies highlighting the differences in microbial populations that are quantified by these different methods van nevel et al 2017 cheswick et al 2019 to elucidate the impacts of flow on the efficacy of disinfection the cell inactivation was correlated to the various hei adjusted ct values using the mean residence time t x the 10th t10 and 90th t90 percentile residence time fig 5 cell inactivation was considered by determining the cell survival ratio defined as the proportion of icc in samples taken from the outlet of the contact tank relative to those seen in the inlet the survival ratio was therefore the inverse of cell inactivation during these tests the range of survival ratios were between 0 08 and 0 015 for the highest survival ratio of 0 08 this represented cell inactivation of 92 while the lowest survival ratio of 0 015 was equivalent to inactivation of 98 5 higher levels of cell inactivation was seen with increasing ctx fig 5a the steepest drop in cell survival was seen at low ctx values up until 10 mg min l with around 4 of the cells measured as intact at higher ct the increase in cell inactivation slowed reaching between 1 5 and 2 cell survival at ct 20 mg min l the surviving cells represent the bacteria that were more resistant to chlorine disinfection attributable to heterogenous bacterial populations present in any system which have varying tolerance to oxidation cerf 1977 those bacteria surviving chlorine disinfection have been identified previously as spore forming species acid fast partially acid fast and gram positive bacteria linked to their thicker cell walls norton and lechavallier 2000 who 2022 while the baffling arrangements clearly led to differences in the heis there was little to distinguish between the cell survival ratios for the different baffling arrangements when the ctx was considered fig 5a instead the inactivation was more linked to the ability of the reactor to be able to deliver longer residence times these conditions were predominately observed when the highest degree of baffling was applied and dead zones in the reactor were minimised however best practice for disinfection considers the more conservative ct10 which considers the first 10 of the residence time distribution leaving the cct angeloudis et al 2014a the highest bacterial inactivation could only be achieved for the highest ct10 values and these could only be achieved when baffling was in place summarised for ct10 in table 3 the maximum ct10 achievable for the different baffling arrangements was 3 3 mg min l for the ub reactor and 31 9 mg min l for the fb reactor fig 6 b the lowest cell survival ratios of 0 015 were only seen when the ct10 was 15 mg min l conditions that could only be achieved with baffling for the ub conditions there was an initially steep drop in the survival ratio from 0 075 to 0 035 as the ct10 increased from 0 3 to 3 6 mg min l the maximum value achievable in comparison the 2b and fb reactors followed a more shallow inactivation profile to illustrate inactivation only declined from 0 075 to 0 060 as the ct10 increased from 0 3 to 3 6 mg min l as noted however these baffled reactors were able to achieve the highest residence times which was when the highest inactivation was seen when the ct90 was considered there was a bigger difference in the inactivation between reactor geometries as the ct90 went beyond 20 mg min l fig 5c for example at a ct90 of 42 7 mg min l for the ub reactor the inactivation was 0 041 while at a similar ct90 of 46 mg min l for the fb reactor the inactivation was only 0 018 as similar picture was observed when thm formation in the reactors were considered with values ranging from 6 to 16 μg l while the dbp concentrations were low relative to the drinking water quality standards of europe and north america evlampidou et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the highest thm concentrations were associated with the longest residence times fig 6a c as seen for microbial inactivation most discrimination between reactor layout was seen when the ct10 was considered showing a more rapid increase in formation with residence time for the ub reactor fig 6b slower rates of increase were seen for the fb followed by the 2b reactors although the highest thm concentration values were seen for these systems due to their ability to be able to deliver longer contact times the ctx and ct90 did not provide a clear distinction between baffling arrangements with respect to dbp formation figs 6a and c these results support the use of the ct10 as an hei that can provide the most appropriate discrimination between reactor types providing insight into how short circuiting impacts on disinfection efficacy and disinfection by product formation the results presented here are interesting because they demonstrate a higher initial level of inactivation and dbp formation for unbaffled reactors in comparison to fully and partially baffled systems at low ct10 values 5 mg min l it is posited that this reflects the change in the flow pattern when operating the cct without baffles where the rtd profile deviates significantly away from plug flow as a result a significant proportion of the water exiting the tank has had an extended period of contact time in the reactor for both inactivation and chemical reactions to take place this was a view supported by the significantly higher dead volumes and recirculation zones present in ub reactors these dead zones have previously been modelled to be hotspots for increased dbp formation angeloudis et al 2014a angeloudis et al 2016 and presumably this would also be the case for high levels of disinfection assuming that residual chlorine is still present however the fact that a larger proportion of the flow has had a relatively short contact time as a result of short circuiting when compared to the baffled reactors means that the highest inactivation values could not be achieved this is particularly relevant when considering the range of microbes present in environmental systems that will have different tolerances to chlorine and hence will require longer contact for inactivation ridgway and olson 1982 similarly under conditions of significant short circuiting there will be large volume of water in the cct with an extended residence time providing opportunities for increased formation of disinfection by products with regards to the dispersion index an excellent hei value σt 2 0 1 did not guarantee consistently similar levels of disinfection with survival ratios between 0 018 0 057 showing the dominance of the ct on microbial inactivation in the present case the partially baffled reactor produced a similar level of performance to that seen for the fb this was posited to be due to the high susceptibility to chlorine of the organisms present it would be expected that the fb reactor with the best hydraulic indicators would handle microbes with increased chlorine tolerance much better the log inactivation rates observed here did not achieve the 2 log 99 reduction fig 6e that is typically considered for effective disinfection who 2017 in the present study a maximum log reduction of 1 79 was observed for ct 19 mg min l from an initial cell concentration of 6 38 105 tcc ml in comparison laboratory assessment of chlorine disinfection using fcm to assess bacterial inactivation saw up to 1 log inactivation at a ct of 20 mg min l at an initial bacterial concentration of 14 107 tcc ml ramseier et al 2010 in this case the authors showed that fcm which measures membrane integrity had lower inactivation than culture based methods that have been used to traditionally define inactivation rates regardless of the oxidant used and were not able to achieve 2 log reduction the present results extend this understanding further confirming similar observations for continuous systems more akin to real disinfection practice the implication of these results being that fcm provides a more conservative measure of disinfection efficacy such that adjustment of target log reductions may be required if it is to be used as a validation indicator the difference relates to the fact that fcm measures membrane integrity whereas traditional methods reflect culturability for example e coli cells have been reported to lose culturability well before the loss of membrane integrity lisle et al 1999 ramseier et al 2010 nocker et al 2017 this observed loss of culturability supports the concept of chlorination inducing a viable but not culturable vbnc state for the bacterial cells wang et al 2010 and explains why all but three hpc samples returned a non detectable results in the current study while significant numbers of intact cells were still measured by fcm 4 future perspectives of fcm as monitoring technique for disinfection efficacy methods such as fcm for total bacterial counts should not be considered an alternative for measurement of indicator organisms as part of compliance monitoring as no clear correlation exists between the two cheswick et al 2020 fcm should be viewed as a complimentary tool enabling the efficacy of cct to be viewed through a different more sensitive lens that enables closer to real time measurement and avoids the more limited insights that results from the predominately non detectable results obtained from culture based approaches it should also be acknowledged that while used for regulatory monitoring the bacteria that are cultured during hpc tests are largely non pathogenic and hence there is no clear cut public health risk particularly for healthy individuals who 2003 indicator organisms that are indicative of faecal contamination of drinking water have a strong rationale for inclusion but are fortunately rarely found in properly treated water the application of fcm provided new insights in relation to differences in inactivation rates for increasing contact time that were dependent on reactor configuration with more rapid initial reduction in cell survival seen in unbaffled reactors for equivalent low values of ct10 to the authors knowledge this is an observation that has not been previously reported the practical consequence of this is not to advocate the use of unbaffled reactors because the highest inactivation could only be observed at the longer cts when baffling was added instead it shows the importance of considering the whole bacterial population when considering disinfection in reactors with significant short circuiting bacteria which have low chlorine tolerance can still be easily killed but those which have a higher tolerance may pass straight through the reactor this became clearer when equivalent ct90 values were considered where the highest inactivation was only seen in baffled systems further the results showed the merits of even partial baffling where significant inactivation was still possible the implication of this relates to existing cct where a significant number in operation around the world have little to no baffling adaptation of these existing tanks to incorporate some degree of baffling will have a significant impact on inactivation and offer the possibility of low cost upgrading of existing ccts this can be achieved relatively simply and effectively using retrofitted baffle plates and curtains nasyrlayev et al 2020 the fcm approach quantifies a fuller representation of the native microbial community importantly including the non culturable organisms this provides measurable numbers with sufficient resolution to enable effective exploration of design and operating impacts in addition the method was able to reveal hitherto unexplored impacts related to the breadth of chlorine tolerances within environmental populations allowing for greater understanding of variation both within the same water supply and between different water sources importantly it enables us to move beyond the use of surrogate organisms such as e coli total coliforms and enterococci which are known to exhibit a particularly high susceptibility to chlorine at ct levels of between 0 01 1 mg min l stanfield 2005 moreover fcm is a fast practical technique that can be used as a routine measurement in practice cheswick et al 2020 to compliment more advanced techniques around species and strain identification direct microbial monitoring could be used more effectively alongside modelling approaches to demonstrate the efficacy of new innovations to cct design and operation that have been developed by cfd angeloudis et al 2016 bruno et al 2021 numerical modelling of disinfection and by product formation remains a challenge due to the dependency on kinetic models that are not equipped to deal with the complexities of real systems hence the methods described in this work have the potential to significantly help in the development of more accurate and functional numerical based modelling of disinfection processes fcm has the potential to offer significant value with regards to optimisation process investigations and route cause analysis with the development of online fcm and the increasing uptake in the application of this approach for monitoring treatment process dynamics besmer et al 2016 favere et al 2020 it is likely that fcm could be applied in near real time for active disinfection monitoring 5 conclusions the work aimed to explore the use of flow cytometry to understand if it could provide fresh insights into the design or operation of chlorine contact tanks the results provided novelty in presenting the first set of experimental data to explore the use of fcm for cct alongside comparative data based on traditional microbial monitoring and hydraulic efficiency parameters importantly fcm provides positive data throughout negating the problems associated with large datasets of non detectable results that occur when using culture based approaches this empowers fresh consideration into the performance of cct both in terms of design and performance monitoring this is most apparent in the comparison between the impact of baffling on hydraulic efficiency indicators and inactivation clear distinction was observed with the former but was not always seen in the case of the latter and thus suggests the need to re evaluate the role of baffling on organism inactivation interestingly the unbaffled systems initially provided more rapid decrease in cells at low ct values compared to the baffled system this was attributed to the higher proportion of dead zones and recirculation that prevailed in the unbaffled system ultimately however the highest inactivation rates were connected with the ability of the reactor to be able to deliver the longest ct10 this was delivered most consistently with the fully baffled system however partial baffling also had the ability to deliver similar inactivation levels the importance of this relates to the potential for enhancement of existing systems with achievable modifications such as insertion of curtains to provide some degree of baffling these new insights offered here show the importance of monitoring the whole native population in practice regular monitoring of inactivation is required to ensure that the diversity of organisms present is captured and to ensure that the ct can be tailored to the specific requirements the measurement of the survival of intact cells enabled accurate derivation of inactivation from a real water source containing only environmentally relevant bacteria declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

16034,a pilot scale chlorine contact tank cct with flexible baffling was installed at an operational water treatment plant wtp taking a direct feed from the outlet of the rapid gravity filters rgf for the first time disinfection efficacy was established by direct microbial monitoring in a continuous reactor using flow cytometry fcm disinfection variables of dose time and hydraulic efficiency short circuiting and dispersion were explored following characterisation of the reactor s residence time distributions rtd by tracer testing fcm enabled distinction to be made between changes in disinfection reactor design where standard culture based methods could not the product of chlorine concentration c and residence time t correlated well with inactivation of microbes organisms with the highest cell reductions n n0 reaching 0 025 at ct x of 20 mg min l and above the influence of reactor geometry on disinfection was best shown from the ct10 this identified that the initial level of microbial inactivation was higher in unbaffled reactors for low ct10 values although the highest levels of inactivation of 0 015 could only be achieved in the baffled reactors because these conditions enabled the highest ct10 values to be achieved increased levels of disinfection were closely associated with increased formation of the trihalomethane disinfection by products the results highlight the importance of well designed and operated cct the improved resolution afforded by fcm provides a tool that can dynamically quantify disinfection processes enabling options for much better process control keywords disinfection microorganisms chlorine drinking water flow cytometry 1 introduction disinfection by chlorine remains the final barrier in most drinking water treatment systems before water enters distribution the efficacy of disinfection is typically designed using the product of the chlorine concentration c and the disinfection contact time t known as the ct the desired flow conditions in chlorine contact tanks cct used for disinfection should be as close to plug flow as possible to ensure the full contact time is experienced by all portions of the water being treated true plug flow is seldom achieved due to incompatible geometries the ideal is a narrow channel with a length to width l w ratio greater than 40 or increased dispersion due to turbulence caused by friction effects with the walls and baffles rauen et al 2012 non ideal flow conditions are detrimental to the performance of ccts leading to short circuiting and unwanted recirculation within the reactor short circuiting occurs when a proportion of the fluid by passes much of the available reactor volume and exits the reactor sooner than the theoretical hydraulic retention time hrt in turn this can lead to insufficient inactivation of microorganisms as that portion of the flow would not receive the desired ct recirculation leads to excessive contact time in dead zones and promotes short circuiting due the reduction in the effective operating proportion of the tank the importance of having as close to ideal flow conditions in ccts has been demonstrated previously using both empirical and theoretical testing angeloudis et al 2014a teixeira et al 2008 rauen et al 2008 the effectiveness of a cct can be described with hydraulic efficiency indicators heis that are derived from residence time distributions teixeira et al 2008 heis can also be derived via computational fluid dynamics cfd a simulation approach that does not require physical experimental testing and avoids potential scaling issues rauen et al 2012 angeloudis et al 2014a b 2016 goodarzi et al 2020 however calibration of cfd models is required and it is preferential to carry out physical testing to best calibrate the simulations falconer 1986 estimates of disinfection efficacy in ccts have been made using established disinfection inactivation kinetic calculations chick watson law and disinfection by product dbp formation kinetics brown et al 2011 angeloudis et al 2014a however these experiments did not record real microbial inactivation rates this is an important consideration given that organisms of different characteristics have a unique residence time distribution in tanks in addition to having different inactivation kinetics asraf snir and gitis 2011 as a result research is ongoing as to which model best describes the transport of particles in this case bacteria through the reactor and the most appropriate disinfection kinetic model that should be used in cfd approaches angeloudis 2014 to date no papers have reported the use of direct microbial monitoring of environmental microbes to assess disinfection variables in ccts the traditional approach of monitoring microbial inactivation during disinfection is by using indicator organisms this becomes challenging at the low bacterial concentrations presented at disinfection stages resulting in limited detection and a high error on measurements cheswick et al 2019 in addition pathogen surrogates coliforms escherichia coli or enterococci are not suitable performance indicators due to the rare occurrence of these organisms before and after disinfection as well as their high sensitivity to chlorine an alternative is to monitor heterotrophic bacteria using heterotrophic plate counting hpc these bacteria are typically abundant in drinking water and may have higher recovery rates following disinfection making them a more suitable process indicator hijnen 2008 however chlorination can lead to the loss of bacterial culturability without destroying the cell which can lead to skewed representations of inactivation berney et al 2006 in addition it has been concluded that hpc measurements do not provide any information on the hygienic quality of the water van nevel et al 2017 an alternative approach is the use of flow cytometry fcm for quantifying the autochthonous bacterial population in drinking water there have been many demonstrations of the benefits of this technique over traditional culture based methods hoefel et al 2005 berney et al 2007 ho et al 2012 van nevel et al 2017 cheswick et al 2019 successful application has been shown in laboratory studies investigating various oxidant kinetics ramseier et al 2010 ding et al 2019 cheswick et al 2020 and real time monitoring of biocide kinetics heat and ciprofloxacin exposure arnoldini et al 2013 this methodology has also gained significant attention as a tool for assessing operational water treatment plants wtps helmi et al 2014 cheswick et al 2019 distribution systems gillespie et al 2014 nescerecka et al 2018 and in water reuse safford and bischel 2018 whitton et al 2018 however there is a knowledge gap in the ability of fcm to be used for optimisation and design of disinfection processes the aim of this work was to determine the role that fcm can play in developing our understanding of disinfection in continuous flow chlorine contact tanks and establish relationships between hydraulic efficiency indicators and inactivation this was achieved by comparing traditional microbial monitoring parameters hpc and indicator organisms with that of total and intact cells measured by fcm in a pilot scale cct reactor with various baffling arrangements and flow rates treating real water the inactivation achieved was compared to other disinfection parameters including formation of disinfection by products dbps in chlorinated water the novelty of the present work was to therefore use fcm to directly determine disinfection efficacy establishing the role that advanced microbial monitoring can play in future development and monitoring of chlorine disinfection 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions a pilot scale cct was located at an operational wtp in scotland uk the wtp was a conventional surface water treatment plant fig 1 a the pilot plant was supplied with water from the wtp following filtration and was representative of real water presented to disinfection the reactor mimicked a typical longitudinal serpentine baffled cct with the option of removing baffles to change the hydraulic conditions fig 1b the cct was 1 8 m long 1 2 m wide with a water of depth 0 42 m the minimal channel width was 0 23 m when fully baffled and 1 3 m when unbaffled flow rates were varied using a pump supply from the filtered water channel and monitored using a flowmeter siemens sitrans f m mag nordborg denmark sodium hypochlorite was dosed via a dosing pump grundfus digital dosing control ddc grundfos pumps ltd bedfordshire uk prior to an inline static mixer downstream of this mixer was a turbidity metre ami turbiwell swan analytical usa inc illinois usa and a free chlorine monitor hach cl17 manchester uk at the outlet of the tank was a rhodamine sensor with internal data logger cyclops 7 turner designs california usa for tracer testing and a second free chlorine monitor a programmable logic controller plc allowed for outlet chlorine concentrations to be controlled tests were carried out over a range of flow rates to provide theoretical hrt t of between 10 and 40 min two chlorine doses were applied 0 5 and 1 mg l cl2 and three baffling conditions incorporating an un ub partially 2b and fully baffled fb reactor geometry with 0 2 and 4 baffles respectively conditions were selected to cover a range of operational chlorine concentrations and residence times as well as considering best to worst baffling arrangements table 1 sampling took place once a period of three theoretical hrt had expired and the outlet chlorine concentration was stabilised to allow complete turnover of the water and an equilibrium to be reached for each condition tested 500 ml samples were taken from a sample tap in the outlet pipework immediately at the exit of the tank the diameter of this outlet pipe was 10 cm and hence the sample taken was assumed to be representative of the bulk flow chlorine was quenched from the sample using sodium thiosulphate with a subsample taken for analysis on the day of collection for each condition three replicate samples were taken with data reported as the arithmetic mean of the samples 2 2 tracer experiments tracer experiments were carried out using the pulse trace methodology with rhodamine wt acros organics geel belgium a submersible fluorometer at a maximum resolution of t 3 s was used for the detection of the rhodamine trace each tracer experiment lasted for a minimum of three theoretical retention times and subsequent tests were only carried out after a fourth retention time had passed to allow complete turnover of the water within the reactor the tracer was added to the inlet of the reactor via a manual syringe injection of rhodamine wt solution 20 ml at 35 mg l mass of rhodamine added 7000 µg this injection time was within that recommended by marske and boyle 1973 and was no more than 1 50th of the reactor retention time to effectively describe the residence time distribution rtd the results were normalised using the e curve method levenspeil 2012 the mean residence time t x was calculated from the area under the concentration c time t curve equation 1 t x 0 t c δ t 0 c δ t this curve was transformed into the e curve such that the area under the curve was unity using the tracer mass m and reactor flow rate q equation 2 e c q m the e curve was then translated into an e θ curve from equation 3 e θ x e finally the normalised time θ was calculated from the measured time t and the theoretical retention time t equation 4 θ t t the rtd variance σ 2 was calculated from equation 5 σ 2 t 2 c δ t c δ t θ 2 the variance and the mean residence time was then used to calculate the dispersion index of the rtd curve σ t 2 equation 6 σ t 2 σ 2 x 2 this normalisation allows for interpretation of the hydraulic performance across variable flow rates time specific tracer parameters were recorded and heis table 2 were calculated using the rtd results and were classified from poor to excellent based on criteria from awwa 2006 and angeloudis et al 2014a si table s1 2 3 water quality measurements hpcs were determined by mixing 1 ml of sample into 18 ml of molten yeast extract agar yea oxoid thermofisher scientific uk these plates were duplicated with one incubated at 37 c for 48 h hpc 37 c and the second at 22 c for 72 h hpc 22 c in accordance with standard methods the determination of coliforms and e coli was carried out by membrane filtration 100 ml of sample was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter plates were incubated at 30 c for 4 h and then 37 c for 14 h fcm analysis for determination of intact icc and total cell counts tcc was carried out using an adapted method as described previously

following the addition of the dyes the samples were incubated in a plate incubator for 30 min at 30 c in the dark following incubation 25 μl samples were analysed using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm solid state laser becton dickinson uk ltd oxford uk in accordance with the rapid method described by van nevel et al 2013 the fcm was calibrated with spherotech validation beads becton dickinson uk ltd oxford uk to ensure that the instrument was operating within acceptable limits as stated by the manufacturer green fluorescence was collected in the fl1 channel at 533 nm fl1 and red fluorescence in the fl3 channel at 670 nm fl3 with the trigger set on the green fluorescence no compensation was used tcc and icc were quantified using a fixed gate as used previously for detection of bacteria present in natural water sources gatza et al 2013 cheswick et al 2020 all data were reported back above the reported limit of quantification of 1 102 cells and well below the upper limit of quantification 1 107 cells the frequency of microorganisms contained in this gate after staining with sybr green i or sybr green i pi formed the basis for calculations of tcc or icc per ml data was processed using the accuri c6 software trihalomethane thm concentrations were measured in samples exiting the cct following chlorination following methods reported elsewhere golea et al 2019 chlorine was quenched with excess sodium thiosulphate following sampling the total thm concentration tthm was measured using gas chromatography spectrometry with headspace injection using the standard usepa 551 method usepa 1998 a minimum of 7 injections were undertaken for each measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality the water quality entering the pilot remained stable throughout the trial with respect to ph ph 6 4 0 1 temperature 12 7 0 5 c and doc 2 7 0 3 mg l such that a consistent chlorine demand of 0 18 0 05 mg l was presented si table s2 the consistency of the water quality enabled the inactivation data to be directly related to the two components of chlorine dose and hydraulic conditions white 2010 haas and engelbrecht 1980 the culture based bacterial counts in the inlet had significant variation for example the hpc 22 c had an average of 40 cfu ml with a minimum of non detectable and a maximum of 300 cfu ml the hpc 37 c had even lower counts with most samples returning non detect samples and a maximum of 4 cfu ml in contrast the fcm icc remained relatively consistent throughout the trial 5 20 105 3 36 104 cells ml with cell concentration values that were between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude higher than seen for the culture based method only three hpc positive detections were observed after chlorine addition from the samples taken at the reactor outlet maximum cfu ml 3 all other samples n 53 were reported as non detectable these results highlight the poor resolution afforded by traditional culture based methods for assessment of log reductions across water treatment processes this impact is particularly seen for disinfection due to the low number of cells going into and out of the process fcm on the other hand was able to detect significant cell concentrations in both the inlet and outlet see inactivation section allowing much better assessment of the true efficacy of disinfection 3 2 hydraulic performance the hydraulic performance of the pilot cct was improved as baffling increased approaching idealised plug flow pf conditions this highlights the importance of considering the hydraulic efficiency in ct calculations the unbaffled condition ub showed a large spike of tracer leaving the reactor shortly after injection due to streaming across the tank this was followed by a long tail of the trace caused by the large recirculation zone in the centre of the tank example for hrt of 20 min shown in fig 2 this profile was typical of an unbaffled reactor and similar to that of a continuously stirred reactor cstr rather than the desired pf conditions levenspiel 2012 summary rtd values show how the baffles improve hydraulic efficiency for each of the flow rates si figure s1 and table s3 to demonstrate analysis of the rtd for the ub reactor at a theoretical hrt 20 mins gave a t10 t of 0 09 showing in this case that 10 of the tracer had exited the reactor within 1 8 min of the injection approaches to quantify mixing in the tank using the dispersion index σt 2 0 735 and the morril index mo 15 45 resulted in values classified as poor by the hei descriptors with the introduction of two baffles in the tank the rtd profile improved the tracer front was held back from short circuiting the reactor rapidly and the tail of the rtd was shortened the introduction of these channels reduced the dispersion and improved the value of the dispersion index to a level associated with an hei descriptor of acceptable σt 2 0 188 similarly the morril index improved from an hei descriptor of compromising to one classified as acceptable mo 2 15 table s3 short circuiting was reduced t10 t 0 47 but was still evident as a result of 50 of the tank volume remaining un baffled which allowed for streaming in the final compartment it was evident from visual observation of the tracer that recirculation was occurring in this final section of the tank fig 3 when fully baffled the rtd resembled a normally distributed curve centred around the theoretical residence time θ 1 short circuiting was significantly reduced to a value associated with an hei descriptor of excellent for serpentine cct reactors t10 t 0 79 and dispersion was brought down to a level commensurate with the descriptor excellent σt 2 0 034 this was visually confirmed by a compact tracer block moving through the tank fig 3 and video files available here doi org 10 17862 cranfield rd 16773220 comparison of the hydraulic efficiency of the different baffle arrangements was assessed at three hrts and compared in relation to t10 t σt 2 and mo si figure s1 and table s3 the normalised heis indicated only small variation as a function of hrt as illustrated through the t10 t ranges which were 0 09 0 13 0 46 0 49 and 0 79 0 89 for the unbaffled two baffles and fully baffled tanks respectively importantly only the fully baffled arrangement delivered acceptable hydraulic conditions for all flow rates investigated whilst partial baffling improved the hydraulic performance relative to the unbaffled reactor appropriate conditions were only seen for specific flow rates revealing a loss of resilience in the system this distinction between baffling arrangements was also seen for the two mixing indices σt 2 and mo although the separation was less clearly defined between the two baffle reactor and the fully baffled system for the mo the t90 t increased substantially from 1 1 to 1 7 for the unbaffled reactor as the residence time decreased evidence of the long tail of tracer as the flow rate through the reactor reduced si figure s2 less distinction was seen for t90 t in the baffled systems overall baffling had a larger impact on hei s than the flow rate a finding supported by zhang et al 2014 who also saw that the t10 t and morril index were unaffected by changing flow rates for the fully baffled contactor no dead zones were evident although tx was t indicating that there was some recirculation of the tracer at the outlet of the tank an effect that was exaggerated at the longer hrt of 40 mins for the two baffle contact tank the dead volume remained similar at the different hrt between 19 2 and 24 2 for unbaffled reactors the volume of the dead zone in the reactor increased from 32 0 38 3 and 71 3 with theoretical hrt of 10 20 and 40 respectively the comparison of the heis indicate that the different tank arrangements were best distinguished by the t10 t the two mixing heis should not be considered in isolation as an acceptable σt 2 and excellent mo could be classified as compromising with regards to the short circuiting index t10 t a situation seen for the two baffle chlorination reactor when considering mixing the σt 2 has been reported to be the most suitable mixing index for assessment of ccts as it considers the whole rtd function teixeira et al 2008 this was consistent with the observations seen here where better distinction was seen between the mixing in the two baffled system compared to the fully baffled reactor 3 3 inactivation efficiency in order to assess the efficacy of disinfection samples were taken from the inlet and outlet of the cct for each experimental assessment of baffling and hrt condition fig 4 a at the inlet to the cct there was a median hpc count of 26cfu ml with the minimum reported value as non detectable and a maximum reported as 300 cfu ml as noted nearly all samples from the outlet were reported as non detectable thus preventing assessment of removal efficacy across the cct using culture based methods this variation is typical of that seen when using total viable count methods and is routinely seen in operational practice where more than 92 of samples in chlorinated water are typically returned as non detects cheswick et al 2019 irrespective of the disinfection conditions only a single coliform colony was detected by standard microbiological analysis table s2 no e coli were detected throughout the entirety of the study these findings reinforce the challenge of microbial monitoring of disinfection processes when using traditional methods in contrast the results from fcm analysis carried out on the same sample offered more insights into process performance providing data that has not been previously available at the inlet to the cct there was a median tcc observed of 613 440 cells ml reaching a maximum of 867 200 cells ml and a minimum of 510 160 cells ml the median icc at the inlet was 86 of the tcc median at 527 960 cells ml showing that a proportion of cells had compromised membrane integrity prior to disinfection at the outlet of the reactor there was a much wider variation in the tcc than those observed at the inlet the median tcc was 5 lower in the outlet than the tcc at the inlet 579 600 cells ml whilst the range of tcc went from 23 600 to 835 200 cells ml as cells were oxidised by chlorine in the cct many cellular structures will be sufficiently damaged such that they will no longer interact with the fluorescing dyes as a result this will reduce the total number of cells counted particularly in systems where microbes had been exposed to longer cts represented by the long bottom whisker in fig 4b the median icc was much lower than for the inlet at 25 280 cells ml range 7080 to 39 920 cells ml importantly this enabled the importance of baffling and the connection between inactivation and hydraulic indicators to be re examined through a more detailed lens the results also show the suitability of using icc to determine the efficacy of chlorine based disinfection chlorine is a non selective oxidant that damages cellular components notably the cell membrane damage to cell membranes is strongly associated with reduced viability of both pure cultured and environmental bacteria nocker et al 2017 no relationships were found between the concentrations of hpc and fcm cell counts for either icc or tcc this is a result consistent with previous studies highlighting the differences in microbial populations that are quantified by these different methods van nevel et al 2017 cheswick et al 2019 to elucidate the impacts of flow on the efficacy of disinfection the cell inactivation was correlated to the various hei adjusted ct values using the mean residence time t x the 10th t10 and 90th t90 percentile residence time fig 5 cell inactivation was considered by determining the cell survival ratio defined as the proportion of icc in samples taken from the outlet of the contact tank relative to those seen in the inlet the survival ratio was therefore the inverse of cell inactivation during these tests the range of survival ratios were between 0 08 and 0 015 for the highest survival ratio of 0 08 this represented cell inactivation of 92 while the lowest survival ratio of 0 015 was equivalent to inactivation of 98 5 higher levels of cell inactivation was seen with increasing ctx fig 5a the steepest drop in cell survival was seen at low ctx values up until 10 mg min l with around 4 of the cells measured as intact at higher ct the increase in cell inactivation slowed reaching between 1 5 and 2 cell survival at ct 20 mg min l the surviving cells represent the bacteria that were more resistant to chlorine disinfection attributable to heterogenous bacterial populations present in any system which have varying tolerance to oxidation cerf 1977 those bacteria surviving chlorine disinfection have been identified previously as spore forming species acid fast partially acid fast and gram positive bacteria linked to their thicker cell walls norton and lechavallier 2000 who 2022 while the baffling arrangements clearly led to differences in the heis there was little to distinguish between the cell survival ratios for the different baffling arrangements when the ctx was considered fig 5a instead the inactivation was more linked to the ability of the reactor to be able to deliver longer residence times these conditions were predominately observed when the highest degree of baffling was applied and dead zones in the reactor were minimised however best practice for disinfection considers the more conservative ct10 which considers the first 10 of the residence time distribution leaving the cct angeloudis et al 2014a the highest bacterial inactivation could only be achieved for the highest ct10 values and these could only be achieved when baffling was in place summarised for ct10 in table 3 the maximum ct10 achievable for the different baffling arrangements was 3 3 mg min l for the ub reactor and 31 9 mg min l for the fb reactor fig 6 b the lowest cell survival ratios of 0 015 were only seen when the ct10 was 15 mg min l conditions that could only be achieved with baffling for the ub conditions there was an initially steep drop in the survival ratio from 0 075 to 0 035 as the ct10 increased from 0 3 to 3 6 mg min l the maximum value achievable in comparison the 2b and fb reactors followed a more shallow inactivation profile to illustrate inactivation only declined from 0 075 to 0 060 as the ct10 increased from 0 3 to 3 6 mg min l as noted however these baffled reactors were able to achieve the highest residence times which was when the highest inactivation was seen when the ct90 was considered there was a bigger difference in the inactivation between reactor geometries as the ct90 went beyond 20 mg min l fig 5c for example at a ct90 of 42 7 mg min l for the ub reactor the inactivation was 0 041 while at a similar ct90 of 46 mg min l for the fb reactor the inactivation was only 0 018 as similar picture was observed when thm formation in the reactors were considered with values ranging from 6 to 16 μg l while the dbp concentrations were low relative to the drinking water quality standards of europe and north america evlampidou et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the highest thm concentrations were associated with the longest residence times fig 6a c as seen for microbial inactivation most discrimination between reactor layout was seen when the ct10 was considered showing a more rapid increase in formation with residence time for the ub reactor fig 6b slower rates of increase were seen for the fb followed by the 2b reactors although the highest thm concentration values were seen for these systems due to their ability to be able to deliver longer contact times the ctx and ct90 did not provide a clear distinction between baffling arrangements with respect to dbp formation figs 6a and c these results support the use of the ct10 as an hei that can provide the most appropriate discrimination between reactor types providing insight into how short circuiting impacts on disinfection efficacy and disinfection by product formation the results presented here are interesting because they demonstrate a higher initial level of inactivation and dbp formation for unbaffled reactors in comparison to fully and partially baffled systems at low ct10 values 5 mg min l it is posited that this reflects the change in the flow pattern when operating the cct without baffles where the rtd profile deviates significantly away from plug flow as a result a significant proportion of the water exiting the tank has had an extended period of contact time in the reactor for both inactivation and chemical reactions to take place this was a view supported by the significantly higher dead volumes and recirculation zones present in ub reactors these dead zones have previously been modelled to be hotspots for increased dbp formation angeloudis et al 2014a angeloudis et al 2016 and presumably this would also be the case for high levels of disinfection assuming that residual chlorine is still present however the fact that a larger proportion of the flow has had a relatively short contact time as a result of short circuiting when compared to the baffled reactors means that the highest inactivation values could not be achieved this is particularly relevant when considering the range of microbes present in environmental systems that will have different tolerances to chlorine and hence will require longer contact for inactivation ridgway and olson 1982 similarly under conditions of significant short circuiting there will be large volume of water in the cct with an extended residence time providing opportunities for increased formation of disinfection by products with regards to the dispersion index an excellent hei value σt 2 0 1 did not guarantee consistently similar levels of disinfection with survival ratios between 0 018 0 057 showing the dominance of the ct on microbial inactivation in the present case the partially baffled reactor produced a similar level of performance to that seen for the fb this was posited to be due to the high susceptibility to chlorine of the organisms present it would be expected that the fb reactor with the best hydraulic indicators would handle microbes with increased chlorine tolerance much better the log inactivation rates observed here did not achieve the 2 log 99 reduction fig 6e that is typically considered for effective disinfection who 2017 in the present study a maximum log reduction of 1 79 was observed for ct 19 mg min l from an initial cell concentration of 6 38 105 tcc ml in comparison laboratory assessment of chlorine disinfection using fcm to assess bacterial inactivation saw up to 1 log inactivation at a ct of 20 mg min l at an initial bacterial concentration of 14 107 tcc ml ramseier et al 2010 in this case the authors showed that fcm which measures membrane integrity had lower inactivation than culture based methods that have been used to traditionally define inactivation rates regardless of the oxidant used and were not able to achieve 2 log reduction the present results extend this understanding further confirming similar observations for continuous systems more akin to real disinfection practice the implication of these results being that fcm provides a more conservative measure of disinfection efficacy such that adjustment of target log reductions may be required if it is to be used as a validation indicator the difference relates to the fact that fcm measures membrane integrity whereas traditional methods reflect culturability for example e coli cells have been reported to lose culturability well before the loss of membrane integrity lisle et al 1999 ramseier et al 2010 nocker et al 2017 this observed loss of culturability supports the concept of chlorination inducing a viable but not culturable vbnc state for the bacterial cells wang et al 2010 and explains why all but three hpc samples returned a non detectable results in the current study while significant numbers of intact cells were still measured by fcm 4 future perspectives of fcm as monitoring technique for disinfection efficacy methods such as fcm for total bacterial counts should not be considered an alternative for measurement of indicator organisms as part of compliance monitoring as no clear correlation exists between the two cheswick et al 2020 fcm should be viewed as a complimentary tool enabling the efficacy of cct to be viewed through a different more sensitive lens that enables closer to real time measurement and avoids the more limited insights that results from the predominately non detectable results obtained from culture based approaches it should also be acknowledged that while used for regulatory monitoring the bacteria that are cultured during hpc tests are largely non pathogenic and hence there is no clear cut public health risk particularly for healthy individuals who 2003 indicator organisms that are indicative of faecal contamination of drinking water have a strong rationale for inclusion but are fortunately rarely found in properly treated water the application of fcm provided new insights in relation to differences in inactivation rates for increasing contact time that were dependent on reactor configuration with more rapid initial reduction in cell survival seen in unbaffled reactors for equivalent low values of ct10 to the authors knowledge this is an observation that has not been previously reported the practical consequence of this is not to advocate the use of unbaffled reactors because the highest inactivation could only be observed at the longer cts when baffling was added instead it shows the importance of considering the whole bacterial population when considering disinfection in reactors with significant short circuiting bacteria which have low chlorine tolerance can still be easily killed but those which have a higher tolerance may pass straight through the reactor this became clearer when equivalent ct90 values were considered where the highest inactivation was only seen in baffled systems further the results showed the merits of even partial baffling where significant inactivation was still possible the implication of this relates to existing cct where a significant number in operation around the world have little to no baffling adaptation of these existing tanks to incorporate some degree of baffling will have a significant impact on inactivation and offer the possibility of low cost upgrading of existing ccts this can be achieved relatively simply and effectively using retrofitted baffle plates and curtains nasyrlayev et al 2020 the fcm approach quantifies a fuller representation of the native microbial community importantly including the non culturable organisms this provides measurable numbers with sufficient resolution to enable effective exploration of design and operating impacts in addition the method was able to reveal hitherto unexplored impacts related to the breadth of chlorine tolerances within environmental populations allowing for greater understanding of variation both within the same water supply and between different water sources importantly it enables us to move beyond the use of surrogate organisms such as e coli total coliforms and enterococci which are known to exhibit a particularly high susceptibility to chlorine at ct levels of between 0 01 1 mg min l stanfield 2005 moreover fcm is a fast practical technique that can be used as a routine measurement in practice cheswick et al 2020 to compliment more advanced techniques around species and strain identification direct microbial monitoring could be used more effectively alongside modelling approaches to demonstrate the efficacy of new innovations to cct design and operation that have been developed by cfd angeloudis et al 2016 bruno et al 2021 numerical modelling of disinfection and by product formation remains a challenge due to the dependency on kinetic models that are not equipped to deal with the complexities of real systems hence the methods described in this work have the potential to significantly help in the development of more accurate and functional numerical based modelling of disinfection processes fcm has the potential to offer significant value with regards to optimisation process investigations and route cause analysis with the development of online fcm and the increasing uptake in the application of this approach for monitoring treatment process dynamics besmer et al 2016 favere et al 2020 it is likely that fcm could be applied in near real time for active disinfection monitoring 5 conclusions the work aimed to explore the use of flow cytometry to understand if it could provide fresh insights into the design or operation of chlorine contact tanks the results provided novelty in presenting the first set of experimental data to explore the use of fcm for cct alongside comparative data based on traditional microbial monitoring and hydraulic efficiency parameters importantly fcm provides positive data throughout negating the problems associated with large datasets of non detectable results that occur when using culture based approaches this empowers fresh consideration into the performance of cct both in terms of design and performance monitoring this is most apparent in the comparison between the impact of baffling on hydraulic efficiency indicators and inactivation clear distinction was observed with the former but was not always seen in the case of the latter and thus suggests the need to re evaluate the role of baffling on organism inactivation interestingly the unbaffled systems initially provided more rapid decrease in cells at low ct values compared to the baffled system this was attributed to the higher proportion of dead zones and recirculation that prevailed in the unbaffled system ultimately however the highest inactivation rates were connected with the ability of the reactor to be able to deliver the longest ct10 this was delivered most consistently with the fully baffled system however partial baffling also had the ability to deliver similar inactivation levels the importance of this relates to the potential for enhancement of existing systems with achievable modifications such as insertion of curtains to provide some degree of baffling these new insights offered here show the importance of monitoring the whole native population in practice regular monitoring of inactivation is required to ensure that the diversity of organisms present is captured and to ensure that the ct can be tailored to the specific requirements the measurement of the survival of intact cells enabled accurate derivation of inactivation from a real water source containing only environmentally relevant bacteria declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements
