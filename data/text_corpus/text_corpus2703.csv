13515,this study characterized the sequencing batch membrane bioreactors sb mbr system containing nanoclay in the treatment of acid red 18 ar 18 azo dye in two steps the first step compared sb mbrs operations containing six different concentrations of cloisite 20a as nanoclay a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h was considered to remove a high initial concentration of 500 mg l of dye at a sludge retention time of 45 d in the first step the transmembrane pressure tmp changes was reduced 74 by 10 g l cumulative nanoclay cloisite 20a concentration 0 22 g l d but no improvement in dye removal was observed the tmp rate reduction was due to extracellular polymeric substances eps decreasing from 370 mg l to 330 mg l for sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 change in the morphology via reduced particle sizes and floc stability was another main factor of fouling alleviation following the addition of nanoclay floc stability reduction can also be confirmed by changing tightly bound eps tb eps 330 160 mg l to loosely bound eps lb eps 40 170 mg l in sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 respectively in the second step some parameters were changed to obtain the optimum values and improve obtained 30 dye removal efficiency in the first step for all the reactors the hrt and fresh daily nanoclay were increased to 48 h and 1 5 4 g l d respectively consequently dye removal improved to about 80 keywords acid red 18 adsorbent dye removal nanoclay concentration sequencing batch membrane bioreactor sb mbr 1 introduction the textile industry contributes to more than half 54 of the dye effluents released in the environment 1 azo dyes with 65 70 of produced dyes are the most commonly used type in the textile industry 1 in addition to being toxic azo dyes and their intermediate compounds are carcinogenic and mutagenic 1 on the other hand treated wastewater is a reliable water resource for farming and agriculture especially in arid and semiarid areas 2 there have been numerous studies on the treatment of single and combined dye containing wastewater including adsorption 3 coagulation 4 electrocoagulation 5 and also other methods such as membrane bioreactor mbr as a popular biological method which has attracted enormous attention 6 7 utilizing membranes is an environmentally friendly and cost effective approach and makes the mbr treatment process reliable and efficient 6 8 membranes prevent non flocculating and dispersed microorganisms and most insoluble additives to leave the reactor 9 azo dye elimination requires sequencing anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions 6 thus sequencing batch mbr sb mbr is a more promising approach than sequencing two mbr systems therefore sb mbr has received significant attention in recent years in azo dye removal studies 1 10 11 membrane fouling as a major drawback of membrane biological systems can be reduced by applying enhanced processes such as the use of adsorbents 8 furthermore adding adsorbents can improve both the removal efficiency and system performance 3 nano technology can minimize the cost accelerate the process and improve industrial wastewater treatment efficiency 12 nanoparticles nps and nanomaterials are efficient in cleaning wastewater and being one of the best solutions for industrial wastewater treatment 2 12 the nanomaterials characteristics including quantum confinement effects surface charge density high surface area reactivity and nanophase stability are the reasons for their application 2 nano adsorbents can enter the mbr 13 18 or sb mbr 19 wastewater treatment processes as an additive 13 18 19 to reduce fouling and increase efficiency zeolite 13 and aluminum nitride 18 nanoparticles were added to petrochemical wastewater and synthetic wastewater respectively which led to a more than 65 reduction in transmembrane pressure tmp tmp reduction was due to increasing particle size distribution psd by having high crystallinity results to larger pores 13 decreasing soluble microbial products smp 13 18 decreasing extracellular polymeric substances eps 13 18 decreasing psd results to hindering the combination of sludge flocs and inhibiting the accumulation of framework components sio2 on cake layer 18 on the other hand adding silica nanoparticles to synthetic wastewater doubled tmp because small sio2 nps results in pore plugging and accumulation of the particle on the membrane surface 19 alternatively natural nanomaterials such as nanoclay represent an inexpensive and environmentally friendly substance for wastewater remediation between other nanomaterials previous research 20 has shown that nanoclay is an effective adsorbent in dye removal however to the best of our knowledge it has never been applied in biological systems using membrane provides the advantage of preventing nanoclay unlike other nano adsorbents from leaving the system through the treated solution s discharge therefore sludge and nanoclay remain in contact and the retention time of both is increased removal of high concentrations of dye employing sb mbr microfiltration 11 and elimination of low concentrations using nanofiltration 21 were reported earlier another unique advantage of nanoclay is its fast adsorption rate 22 24 considering eps and smp reduction as critical factors in fouling alleviation 11 13 investigation of these components is essential according to previous studies 25 humic is considered a predominant organic foulant in biological treatments other researchers 26 have also expressed that humic can generally pass through the membrane but protein causes a high adhesion propensity for the membrane so examining humic can help in investigating fouling furthermore no research was available that evaluated the protein humic and carbohydrate contents of smp loosely and tightly bound eps lb eps and tb eps in membrane bioreactor systems using comparable methods which are evaluated in the current paper in addition only one research on activated sludge is available 27 there is no research on adding nanoclay to biological systems to the best of our knowledge and only one research was found on adsorption of ar 18 by nanoclay 24 therefore the present comparative study aimed to assess nanoclay sludge ratios on sb mbrs operation system in treating acid red 18 ar 18 as a conventional acid azo dye the optimum operation condition was then evaluated by changing daily nanoclay concentration and hydraulic retention time hrt 2 materials and methods 2 1 dye and selection of nanoclay ar 18 as an azo dye with negative charges was purchased from the alvan sabet company asc of iran the main characteristics and chemical structure of the commercial grade ar 18 with high purity of 98 are summarized and depicted in table 1 and fig 1 respectively cloisite 20a was purchased as nanoclay from byk additives instruments table 1 illustrates the properties of cloisite 20a with a positive charge fig 1 also shows the structures of natural montmorillonite and the cloisite 20a organic modifier also two types of clays and iranian nanoclay were compared to cloisite 20a concerning ar 18 adsorption psd by malvern mastersizer 2000 uk x ray fluorescence xrf by philips x unique ii pw 1510 netherland and x ray diffraction xrd by panalytical x pert pro mpd netherlands was accomplished 2 2 experimental setup and operating conditions the key parameters of the sb mbrs system are listed in table 2 for the first and the second steps the order in which operations are performed is filling anaerobic aerobic suction and idle six flat sheet shanghai sinap membranes named sinap10 with maximum suitable pressure of 100 200 mbar were purchased from china the nanoclay values of table 2 in the first step were evaluated as the proposed lowest values as effective anti fouling material in the second step nanoclay was added after seven days while sludge discharge was carried out daily also hrt separately changed to 48 h the activated sludge was taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in tehran iran after seeding the sludge was fed gradually into two barrels and transferred to the reactors the sb mbrs system was inoculated with sludge and was used for approximately one month to carry out the test without nanoclay addition the stability of tss and vss were examined to check the steady state condition in each step the sb mbr system as an example with just one reactor instead of six is shown in fig 2 besides a real photo of the sb mbr system used in this study is depicted in fig a 1 as supplementary data the total and effective volumes of the reactors are 19 20 l and 14 l respectively as shown in fig 2 two stirrers and two air diffusers were employed for each reactor at 75 rpm and 5 5 l min respectively the plexiglas reactors of the sb mbr system were named sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 r1 r6 illustrated samples of sb mbrs and the membranes or sludge on them were denoted as m1 to m6 a peristaltic pump etatron bv 30 1 italy was used to fill the tanks and feed the reactors a peristaltic pump longer bt100 2 j china was also used to withdraw permeate from the membranes according to the schedule one membrane every two hours a calibrated pressure gauge sensys pfah 001bcme korea reported 4 20 ma using 1 to 0 bar to human machine interface hmi the cycles operation in six sb mbrs were controlled and pressure data were recorded by a control system and hmi which were linked between the given program and the setup elements including pressure gauge peristaltic pumps and solenoid valves 2 3 analytical methods the absorption values were measured using two spectrophotometers hach dr4000 and dr2800 usa standard methods 29 were applied for cod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and sludge volume index svi oxygen consumption rate or oxygen uptake rate our a thermogravimetric analyzer shimadzu tga 50 japan was used for mass loss of cloisite 20a in parallel with the tss and vss results lb eps tb eps extracted using the heating method 30 and smp were filtered by a 0 45 Î¼m syringe filter biofil 30 mm mixed cellulose ester after centrifuging hettich eba 21 germany the sample test was repeated three times the protein and humic contents were analyzed according to the methods described by lowry et al 31 and frÃ¸lund et al 32 carbohydrate content was analyzed according to dubois et al 33 carbohydrate and humic contents show interference with industrial ar 18 dye that subtracted from obtained values though other researchers did not address the finding for the preparation of the humic acid ha standard technical grade salt alfa 41748 with 50 60 purity was purified according to 34 35 and supplementary data the rheological measurements brookfield dv ii pro usa can be accomplished with the assumption of herschel bulkley 11 or power law models the resistances were calculated using the tmp values 36 chemical cleaning of the membranes was performed using sodium hypochlorite 5000 mg l and oxalic acid 1000 mg l for three and two hours respectively after physical cleaning experiments related to scanning electron microscopy sem were accomplished using thermo scientific fei esem quanta 200 usa and seron technology ais2100 korea devices energy dispersive analysis x ray edax was also done by thermo scientific fei eds silicon drift 2017 usa sem images of ais2100 seron technology were taken without preparation for cloisite 20a and r1 r6 samples sample preparation for the fei esem quanta 200 device was accomplished according to 37 and supplementary data all 13 samples were gold coated by coxem korea before imaging to reduce sample charging gold coating was also accomplished for the seron technology samples quorum technologies emitech sc7620 uk turbidity hach 2100 n usa versus clay concentration was considered for determining clay nonclay concentration an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes device varian 730 es usa was also used to detect the values of nanoclay in the supernatant membrane extraction and test the samples according to the two elements of al aluminum and si silicon using the xrf report do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp values were monitored regularly using wtw oxical sl oxi 340i germany wtw sentix41 ph 340i germany and wtw sentix ph 340i germany devices respectively the obtained data were investigated using analysis of variance anova in minitab software to assess the responses via mean and standard deviation as required 3 results and discussion the nanoclay selection details are mentioned in the supplementary data table a 1 and fig a 2 and psd for cloisite 20a is reported in table 3 also the respiration inhibition test for ar 18 is demonstrated in fig a 3 of the supplementary data the respiration inhibition test showed no difference with and without cloisite 20a 3 1 treatment performance and key parameters 3 1 1 solution treatment and biomass assessment the sb mbr system s overall performance from the first day of adding nanoclay is reported in table 4 under stable conditions the tss values increased during 20 days of operations for all the reactors according to the p and mean values in table 4 vss dye and cod removal have no significant difference despite changes in other parameters tss increased from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 relative to nanoclay concentration thermal analysis data is not given showed no significant mass changes for cloisite 20a at 104 c and 550 c which is also in agreement with tss data the vss tss average value in sb mbr1 was near the results reported by other researchers 38 and decreased from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 therefore our data is acceptable and the vss tss ratio shows the accumulation of inorganic elements in sb mbrs the average f m ratio mg cod mg vss decreased from 0 2 to 0 05 during one cycle for sb mbr1 which shows that the range is acceptable and enough food was provided at the beginning of the experiments according to the five sludge settleability groups 11 the svi values are in the ranges of 50 100 and therefore good settleability is reported for all the reactors in addition sedimentation volumes versus time during the 20 47 days showed no significant difference between the reactors the graph is not given it means that the membrane can be eliminated from the system because most of the nanoclay will be attached to the sludge due to good settleability the decolorization efficiency was almost 30 for all the reactors the primary mechanism of ar 18 removal was because of the biological process in both steps biological azo dye elimination occurs by breaking the azo n n bond via a reduction process and then oxidation of the intermediate compounds the mechanism of azo dye degradation is demonstrated 39 40 discussed 40 and optimized 41 in the literature also a part of the selected dye can be adsorbed by cloisite 20a however the amount of adsorption depends on the concentration of the pollutant concentration of the adsorbent and adsorption capacity for r6 by adding nanoclay on the first day the dye was eliminated however after several days no difference was observed between the reactors and no significant change in removal efficiencies was reported in related literature 13 19 which is in agreement with our results therefore more nanoclay and nanoparticles should be added to act as adsorbents in mixture appropriately kinetics was approximately the same for all the reactors the remaining ar 18 dye and linear kinetic model are shown in fig 3 for sb mbr2 the linear kinetic model was selected as the simplest acceptable model which indicates the slow rate of removal the changes in nanoclay were assessed in the mixed liquor considering the mechanism of fouling and confirmation of the system s stability after adding nanoclay sampling was carried out from the supernatant and permeate of sb mbr6 to find the nanoclay concentration sb mbr6 was selected as a reactor with the highest concentration of nanoclay compared to the others the assessment results of cloisite 20a using icp oes and turbidity are given in table a 2 as supplementary data and a summary is provided in table 5 after sedimentation time cloisite 20a attached to the flocs and microorganisms and was not observed in the supernatant less than 2 cloisite 20a was found although it adsorbs ar 18 soluble dye after several days it decreased from approximately 2 to less than 0 5 in the supernatant which showed that cloisite 20a was completely attached to the flocs and microorganisms the parameters were subsequently modified as the second step to guess or obtain the optimum scenario near the current operating condition at first glance it seemed that a longer hrt is the best solution so hrt was doubled to 48 h the effect of rising hrt to 48 h in comparison with 24 h was markedly effective on ar 18 removal hrt changes approximately 0 150 mg l of ar 18 remained from the initial 500 mg l according to the operating conditions such as temperature to achieve the best performance increasing daily nanoclay concentration in the operation condition of table 2 was also examined 1 5 g l d of fresh cloisite 20a removed approximately 40 mg l ar 18 in sb mbr6 in the second step the remaining dye adsorption mechanism was based on the positive charge of cloisite 20a and negative charges of ar 18 therefore at least a cumulative concentration of about 70 g l 1 5 g l d rather than 10 g l 0 22 g l d cloisite 20a was needed for better ar 18 removal efficiencies summarizing this section s results cumulative values between 70 180 g l cloisite 20a equivalent to 1 5 4 g l d cloisite 20a with an hrt of 48 h ensure the high quality of permeate like other investigations future studies can examine the recovery applicability of nanoclay 24 do and orp were approximately 5 3 mg l to 0 mg l and 105 mv to 259 mv for aerobic and anaerobic anoxic conditions respectively as reported previously for orp 42 also ph was 6 5 8 3 2 fouling parameters 3 2 1 tmp and filtration resistances table 4 and fig 4 a show tmp and corresponding anova results from the beginning to the end of all the experiments p value of 0 00 0 05 indicated that tmp changes is meaningful according to table 4 in the present research tmp decreased by increasing cumulative nanoclay concentration from 0 to 10 g l according to fig 4a tmp changes decreased by 74 from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 initial final tmp values were reported differently in other studies ranging from 10 40 k pa with sb mbrs system similar to our research system and kubota flat sheet membrane 11 to 1 25 kpa with mbrs system and sinap flat sheet membrane 13 in the present work as shown in fig 4a in the first step the final tmp was 5 9 and 10 2 k pa for 10 g l cumulative nanoclay concentration and without nanoclay respectively according to the literature a 16 k pa and 40 k pa reduction in tmp were also reported by hazrati et al 13 and zhou et al 18 respectively using zeolite and aluminum nitride nanoparticles which is also in agreement with the current research hazrati et al 13 indicated that nano adsorbents improve sludge and cake layer characterizations and they can adsorb microbial products so the tmps of the reactors with nano zeolite were less than the control reactor zhou et al 18 reported that membrane fouling was mainly mitigated due to the inhibition of cake layer formation by adding aluminum nitride nanoparticles however as a non dominant theory these nanoparticles could aggravate pore blocking although 15 k pa increase in tmp due to pore blocking using nano silicon dioxide was also reported by larracas sibag et al 19 according to the current study in the second step the effect of cloisite 20a on decreasing tmp is positive and compared to other works 43 46 a high concentration of adsorbent 0 160 g l even the adsorbent that increases fouling 44 45 is applicable also high tss research with low tmp is reported 47 according to the literature 75 160 g l powdered activated carbon pac added to the mbr with the known negative impact on tmp reduced flux up to 35 compared to 5 10 g l pac according to the literature 11 the power law model was selected the rheology formulas Ï 139 04 Î³0 2777 for sb mbr6 and Ï 249 29 Î³0 1157 for sb mbr1 to sb mbr5 as the relation between Î³ as the shear rate s 1 and Ï as shear stress mpa were estimated at the constant shear rate of 100 s 1 the apparent viscosities are 3 3 3 6 and 3 94 mn s m2 for sb mbr1 to sb mbr4 sb mbr5 and sb mbr6 which are used in calculating filtration resistances according to chang and kim 36 total rtotal membrane rm cake rc and irreversible rf resistances which rf is fouling as irreversible deposition resistance were calculated fig 4b shows total membrane cake irreversible resistances and their percentages from rtotal for the reactors from adding the nanoclay until completion of all the experiments rtotal and rc decreased from r1 to r6 but rf was too low for all reactors and rm had no significant changes according to this section s comparable quantitative results more viscose samples caused less tmp therefore higher viscosities caused by more particles nanoclay in the mbr system do not necessarily lead to higher tmps 3 2 2 smp and eps protein humic and carbohydrate concentrations were measured in smp lb eps and tb eps withdrawn samples from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 smphumic 66 mg l was the main constituent of the smp content during all the tests other parts of smp and the protein were almost zero besides no particular trend was observed for smp and protein between sb mbrs average concentrations of lb epshumic lb epscarbohydrate lb eps tb epshumic tb epscarbohydrate tb eps epshumic epscarbohydrate and eps samples for level i before adding nanoclay ii after adding nanoclay iii during experiments with the stable conditions and iv adding nanoclay maximum 1 5 g l d in sb mbr6 of several days in one day second step is depicted in fig 5 fig 5 shows that during the experiments at level iii all the depicted contents had significant trends under stable conditions lb eps increased and tb eps and eps decreased from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 eps reduction had no impact on sedimentation volumes 48 but it reduced tmp 11 13 as a crucial parameter in this research eps tb eps could gather cells by decreasing the negative charges of cell surfaces 49 vice versa lb eps has a negative effect on bio flocculation 50 therefore nanoclay acted as an anti fouling adsorbent by attaching to eps thus reducing floc stability by changing tb eps to lb eps humic content has not been investigated in related literature on nano adsorbents in the activated sludge and mbr studies by yin et al 27 and han et al 51 humic were not considered as the major component in smp lb eps and tb eps samples while in the present study humic is the principal constituent lb eps to tb eps ratios were between 0 2 higher values were associated with sb mbr6 with lower values of tmp the ratio of lb eps to tb eps in the reports by yin et al 27 and han et al 51 are close to the current study results regarding sb mbr1 and sb mbr6 respectively hazrati et al 13 reported a decrease in both smp and eps by adding 0 014 g l d nano zeolite according to the literature reduction in smp and eps has been reported by other studies on nano adsorbents 17 18 and other adsorbents such as zeolite 8 which is in agreement with current research data for level iv of the tests as a part of the second step sludge discharge was performed daily however cloisite 20a was added after approximately seven days unlike the previously reported values according to fig 5 iv lb eps decreased in the reactors with higher concentrations of fresh cloisite 20a compared to level iii 1 5 g l of fresh cloisite 20a can also adsorb approximately 20 50 mg l smp therefore it could remove smp and the remaining pollutant it is noteworthy that smp is the fragment of biological treatment and cannot be completely eliminated by changing hrt and srt but nanoclay can solve this problem in the reactor with no need for additional filtration leading to high quality permeate water the remaining pollutant from biological treatment can be eliminated by adding nanoclay before extraction from the membranes according to the nanoclay exfoliation time to reach iranian standard 52 which dictates that cod should be under 100 200 mg l reduction in tmp by decreasing eps or specific eps and smp is reported 11 13 a critical parameter in this research 3 2 3 morphology and edax assessment the morphologies of mixed liquor and attached layer to the membranes are depicted in sem images fig 6 edax is also reported in fig a 5 as supplementary material according to the weighted percent for r1 r6 m1 m6 and cloisite 20a samples according to fig a 5 nanoclay did not change the culture of the sludge according to fig 6d and h cloisite 20a can attach to the yeast eps or be placed near microorganisms respectively the main reason for fouling alleviation is the change in morphology thus as demonstrated in the sem images nanoclay with a positive charge fig 1 as an adsorbent can adsorb sludge with a negative charge 53 and also eps and smp therefore sludge particles cannot join each other which leads to sludge size reduction and lower sludge adhesion strength 17 the attachment of nanoclay to eps or smp was confirmed previously by related tests fig 6 shows the r6 sample in the presence of nanoclay which is more compact than r1 in agreement with viscosity results though it has less tmp fig 6 also indicates that sludge on the membranes have rougher surfaces and are more compact than withdrawn reactor sludge samples also edax and sem showed nanoclay attachment tendency to the microorganisms of the cake layer is more than the mixed liquor s microorganisms therefore the nanoclay impact on the cake layers morphology is more transparent than the mixed liquors because of more compact sludge and higher amounts of nanoclay on the membrane edax also shows differences between the nanoclay free r1 and m1 samples carbon nitrogen and oxygen weighted percent in m1 were lower than in r1 vice versa phosphorus and sulfur weighted percent were higher in m1 changes in other elements including aluminum silicon and potassium were negligible increasing calcium and decreasing carbon from mixed liquor to cake layer by gao et al 54 and increasing both silver and phosphorus from mixed liquor to cake layer by yuan et al 14 also reported the same results which are in agreement with the present study the results confirm that carbon decreased as the primary nutrient for the growth of microorganisms and phosphorus increased as an element for establishing cell surfaces properties 55 therefore the difference between r1 and m1 is the sample density and the elements or in other words in the cell and physicochemical properties 3 2 4 psd the psd tests for sludge of the reactors r1 r6 and sludge on the membranes m1 m6 are shown in fig 7 and table 3 also the psd of mixed liquor before adding nanoclay is shown in fig a 6 as demonstrated in fig 7a two peaks appeared by increasing nanoclay concentration instead of one from r1 to r6 in addition surface weighted mean volume weighted mean d 0 1 d 0 5 and d 0 9 decreased table 3 reveals that d 0 5 decreased about 10 Î¼m this trend was also observed for m1 and m5 as observed in fig 7b and table 3 though m6 did not pursue the mentioned trend by adding aluminum nitride nanoparticles 18 with dimensions of 10 100 nm nano zeolite with crystal sizes of 150 1500 nm 13 and nano titanium dioxide 17 with dimensions of 150 300 nm the average particle size decreased 42 Î¼m and d 0 5 increased and decreased about 29 1 Î¼m and 5 4 Î¼m respectively a decreasing flocculation capacity 17 and changing psd pattern by silica nanoparticles with 28 nm 19 are also reported also a decrease in psd caused a decrease 13 18 and an increase 19 in tmp psd in fig 7 and the specific surface area and uniformity coefficient parameters in table 3 indicated greater more compact and more non uniform particles on the membranes m1 m6 respectively despite the particles in the reactors r1 r6 which are in agreement with the sem results according to table 3 figs 7 and a 5 the psd range for particles on the membranes and mixed liquor in the reactors is in agreement with the wang et al 56 and hasani zonoozi et al 11 respectively the psd and the sem observation of cake and floc explained tmp reduction after adding the nanoclay 4 conclusions the first step was carried out to reduce fouling using low daily nanoclay concentrations 0 0 22 g l d in the second step high concentrations of fresh daily nanoclay 0 1 5 g l d were used to remove the remaining pollutant and find the optimum point after setting hrt the following results were obtained tmp changes decreased 74 by improving nanoclay concentration in the first step eps decreased as an essential factor in membrane fouling so that tb eps changed to lb eps from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 in the first step humic was the major part in both of smp and eps samples sem and psd showed the theory behind the reduction of tmp by the changes in particle morphology stability and size via nano eps and nano sludge attachments from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 the optimum operating conditions were srt of 45 d hrt of 48 h and 1 5 g l d cloisite 20a to obtain 80 ar 18 from the second step in the second step by adding higher daily amounts of nanoclay both smp and eps decreased with no need for additional filtration in the separation process funding sources the authors acknowledge the qom province water and wastewater company the iran biotechnology

13515,this study characterized the sequencing batch membrane bioreactors sb mbr system containing nanoclay in the treatment of acid red 18 ar 18 azo dye in two steps the first step compared sb mbrs operations containing six different concentrations of cloisite 20a as nanoclay a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h was considered to remove a high initial concentration of 500 mg l of dye at a sludge retention time of 45 d in the first step the transmembrane pressure tmp changes was reduced 74 by 10 g l cumulative nanoclay cloisite 20a concentration 0 22 g l d but no improvement in dye removal was observed the tmp rate reduction was due to extracellular polymeric substances eps decreasing from 370 mg l to 330 mg l for sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 change in the morphology via reduced particle sizes and floc stability was another main factor of fouling alleviation following the addition of nanoclay floc stability reduction can also be confirmed by changing tightly bound eps tb eps 330 160 mg l to loosely bound eps lb eps 40 170 mg l in sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 respectively in the second step some parameters were changed to obtain the optimum values and improve obtained 30 dye removal efficiency in the first step for all the reactors the hrt and fresh daily nanoclay were increased to 48 h and 1 5 4 g l d respectively consequently dye removal improved to about 80 keywords acid red 18 adsorbent dye removal nanoclay concentration sequencing batch membrane bioreactor sb mbr 1 introduction the textile industry contributes to more than half 54 of the dye effluents released in the environment 1 azo dyes with 65 70 of produced dyes are the most commonly used type in the textile industry 1 in addition to being toxic azo dyes and their intermediate compounds are carcinogenic and mutagenic 1 on the other hand treated wastewater is a reliable water resource for farming and agriculture especially in arid and semiarid areas 2 there have been numerous studies on the treatment of single and combined dye containing wastewater including adsorption 3 coagulation 4 electrocoagulation 5 and also other methods such as membrane bioreactor mbr as a popular biological method which has attracted enormous attention 6 7 utilizing membranes is an environmentally friendly and cost effective approach and makes the mbr treatment process reliable and efficient 6 8 membranes prevent non flocculating and dispersed microorganisms and most insoluble additives to leave the reactor 9 azo dye elimination requires sequencing anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions 6 thus sequencing batch mbr sb mbr is a more promising approach than sequencing two mbr systems therefore sb mbr has received significant attention in recent years in azo dye removal studies 1 10 11 membrane fouling as a major drawback of membrane biological systems can be reduced by applying enhanced processes such as the use of adsorbents 8 furthermore adding adsorbents can improve both the removal efficiency and system performance 3 nano technology can minimize the cost accelerate the process and improve industrial wastewater treatment efficiency 12 nanoparticles nps and nanomaterials are efficient in cleaning wastewater and being one of the best solutions for industrial wastewater treatment 2 12 the nanomaterials characteristics including quantum confinement effects surface charge density high surface area reactivity and nanophase stability are the reasons for their application 2 nano adsorbents can enter the mbr 13 18 or sb mbr 19 wastewater treatment processes as an additive 13 18 19 to reduce fouling and increase efficiency zeolite 13 and aluminum nitride 18 nanoparticles were added to petrochemical wastewater and synthetic wastewater respectively which led to a more than 65 reduction in transmembrane pressure tmp tmp reduction was due to increasing particle size distribution psd by having high crystallinity results to larger pores 13 decreasing soluble microbial products smp 13 18 decreasing extracellular polymeric substances eps 13 18 decreasing psd results to hindering the combination of sludge flocs and inhibiting the accumulation of framework components sio2 on cake layer 18 on the other hand adding silica nanoparticles to synthetic wastewater doubled tmp because small sio2 nps results in pore plugging and accumulation of the particle on the membrane surface 19 alternatively natural nanomaterials such as nanoclay represent an inexpensive and environmentally friendly substance for wastewater remediation between other nanomaterials previous research 20 has shown that nanoclay is an effective adsorbent in dye removal however to the best of our knowledge it has never been applied in biological systems using membrane provides the advantage of preventing nanoclay unlike other nano adsorbents from leaving the system through the treated solution s discharge therefore sludge and nanoclay remain in contact and the retention time of both is increased removal of high concentrations of dye employing sb mbr microfiltration 11 and elimination of low concentrations using nanofiltration 21 were reported earlier another unique advantage of nanoclay is its fast adsorption rate 22 24 considering eps and smp reduction as critical factors in fouling alleviation 11 13 investigation of these components is essential according to previous studies 25 humic is considered a predominant organic foulant in biological treatments other researchers 26 have also expressed that humic can generally pass through the membrane but protein causes a high adhesion propensity for the membrane so examining humic can help in investigating fouling furthermore no research was available that evaluated the protein humic and carbohydrate contents of smp loosely and tightly bound eps lb eps and tb eps in membrane bioreactor systems using comparable methods which are evaluated in the current paper in addition only one research on activated sludge is available 27 there is no research on adding nanoclay to biological systems to the best of our knowledge and only one research was found on adsorption of ar 18 by nanoclay 24 therefore the present comparative study aimed to assess nanoclay sludge ratios on sb mbrs operation system in treating acid red 18 ar 18 as a conventional acid azo dye the optimum operation condition was then evaluated by changing daily nanoclay concentration and hydraulic retention time hrt 2 materials and methods 2 1 dye and selection of nanoclay ar 18 as an azo dye with negative charges was purchased from the alvan sabet company

fouling material in the second step nanoclay was added after seven days while sludge discharge was carried out daily also hrt separately changed to 48 h the activated sludge was taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in tehran iran after seeding the sludge was fed gradually into two barrels and transferred to the reactors the sb mbrs system was inoculated with sludge and was used for approximately one month to carry out the test without nanoclay addition the stability of tss and vss were examined to check the steady state condition in each step the sb mbr system as an example with just one reactor instead of six is shown in fig 2 besides a real photo of the sb mbr system used in this study is depicted in fig a 1 as supplementary data the total and effective volumes of the reactors are 19 20 l and 14 l respectively as shown in fig 2 two stirrers and two air diffusers were employed for each reactor at 75 rpm and 5 5 l min respectively the plexiglas reactors of the sb mbr system were named sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 r1 r6 illustrated samples of sb mbrs and the membranes or sludge on them were denoted as m1 to m6 a peristaltic pump etatron bv 30 1 italy was used to fill the tanks and feed the reactors a peristaltic pump longer bt100 2 j china was also used to withdraw permeate from the membranes according to the schedule one membrane every two hours a calibrated pressure

and humic contents were analyzed according to the methods described by lowry et al 31 and frÃ¸lund et al 32 carbohydrate content was analyzed according to dubois et al 33 carbohydrate and humic contents show interference with industrial ar 18 dye that subtracted from obtained values though other researchers did not address the finding for the preparation of the humic acid ha standard technical grade salt alfa 41748 with 50 60 purity was purified according to 34 35 and supplementary data the rheological measurements brookfield dv ii pro usa can be accomplished with the assumption of herschel bulkley 11 or power law models the resistances were calculated using the tmp values 36 chemical cleaning of the membranes was performed using sodium hypochlorite 5000 mg l and oxalic acid 1000 mg l for three and two hours respectively after physical cleaning experiments related to scanning electron microscopy sem were accomplished using thermo scientific fei esem quanta 200 usa and seron technology ais2100 korea devices energy dispersive analysis x ray edax was also done by thermo scientific fei eds silicon drift 2017 usa sem images of ais2100 seron technology were taken without preparation for cloisite 20a and r1 r6 samples sample preparation for the fei esem quanta 200 device was accomplished according to 37 and supplementary data all 13 samples were gold coated by coxem korea before imaging to reduce sample charging gold coating was also accomplished for the seron technology samples quorum technologies emitech sc7620 uk turbidity hach 2100 n usa versus clay concentration was considered for determining clay nonclay concentration an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes device varian 730 es usa was also used to detect the values of nanoclay in the supernatant membrane extraction and test the samples according to the two elements of al aluminum and si silicon using the xrf report do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp values were monitored regularly using wtw oxical sl oxi 340i germany wtw sentix41 ph 340i germany and wtw sentix ph 340i germany devices respectively the obtained data were investigated using analysis of variance anova in minitab software to assess the responses via mean and standard deviation as required 3 results and discussion the nanoclay selection details are mentioned in the supplementary data table a 1 and fig a 2 and psd for cloisite 20a is reported in table 3 also the respiration inhibition test for ar 18 is demonstrated in fig a 3 of the supplementary data the respiration inhibition test showed no difference with and without cloisite 20a 3 1 treatment performance and key parameters 3 1 1 solution treatment and biomass assessment the sb mbr system s overall performance from the first day of adding nanoclay is reported in table 4 under stable conditions the tss values increased during 20 days of operations for all the reactors according to the p and mean values in table 4 vss dye and cod removal have no significant difference despite changes in other parameters tss increased from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 relative to nanoclay concentration thermal analysis data is not given showed no significant mass changes for cloisite 20a at 104 c and 550 c which is also in agreement with tss data the vss tss average value in sb mbr1 was near the results reported by other researchers 38 and decreased from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 therefore our data is acceptable and the vss tss ratio shows the accumulation of inorganic elements in sb mbrs the average f m ratio mg cod mg vss decreased from 0 2 to 0 05 during one cycle for sb mbr1 which shows that the range is acceptable and enough food was provided at the beginning of the experiments according to the five sludge settleability groups 11 the svi values are in the ranges of 50 100 and therefore good settleability is reported for all the reactors in addition sedimentation volumes versus time during the 20 47 days showed no significant difference between the reactors the graph is not given it means that the membrane can be eliminated from the system because most of the nanoclay will be attached to the sludge due to good settleability the decolorization efficiency was almost 30 for all the reactors the primary mechanism of ar 18 removal was because of the biological process in both steps biological azo dye elimination occurs by breaking the azo n n bond via a reduction process and then oxidation of the intermediate compounds the mechanism of azo dye degradation is demonstrated 39 40 discussed 40 and optimized 41 in the literature also a part of the selected dye can be adsorbed by cloisite 20a however the amount of adsorption depends on the concentration of the pollutant concentration of the adsorbent and adsorption capacity for r6 by adding nanoclay on the first day the dye was eliminated however after several days no difference was observed between the reactors and no significant change in removal efficiencies was reported in related literature 13 19 which is in agreement with our results therefore more nanoclay and nanoparticles should be added to act as adsorbents in mixture appropriately kinetics was approximately the same for all the reactors the remaining ar 18 dye and linear kinetic model are shown in fig 3 for sb mbr2 the linear kinetic model was selected as the simplest acceptable model which indicates the slow rate of removal the changes in nanoclay were assessed in the mixed liquor considering the mechanism of fouling and confirmation of the system s stability after adding nanoclay sampling was carried out from the supernatant and permeate of sb mbr6 to find the nanoclay concentration sb mbr6 was selected as a reactor with the highest concentration of nanoclay compared to the others the assessment results of cloisite 20a using icp oes and turbidity are given in table a 2 as supplementary data and a summary is provided in table 5 after sedimentation time cloisite 20a attached to the flocs and microorganisms and was not observed in the supernatant less than 2 cloisite 20a was found although it adsorbs ar 18 soluble dye after several days it decreased from approximately 2 to less than 0 5 in the supernatant which showed that cloisite 20a was completely attached to the flocs and microorganisms the parameters were subsequently modified as the second step to guess or obtain the optimum scenario near the current operating condition at first glance it seemed that a longer hrt is the best solution so hrt was doubled to 48 h the effect of rising hrt to 48 h in comparison with 24 h was markedly effective on ar 18 removal hrt changes approximately 0 150 mg l of ar 18 remained from the initial 500 mg l according to the operating conditions such as temperature to achieve the best performance increasing daily nanoclay concentration in the operation condition of table 2 was also examined 1 5 g l d of fresh cloisite 20a removed approximately 40 mg l ar 18 in sb mbr6 in the second step the remaining dye adsorption mechanism was based on the positive charge of cloisite 20a and negative charges of ar 18 therefore at least a cumulative concentration of about 70 g l 1 5 g l d rather than 10 g l 0 22 g l d cloisite 20a was needed for better ar 18 removal efficiencies summarizing this section s results cumulative values between 70 180 g l cloisite 20a equivalent to 1 5 4 g l d cloisite 20a with an hrt of 48 h ensure the high quality of permeate like other investigations future studies can examine the recovery applicability of nanoclay 24 do and orp were approximately 5 3 mg l to 0 mg l and 105 mv to 259 mv for aerobic and anaerobic anoxic conditions respectively as reported previously for orp 42 also ph was 6 5 8 3 2 fouling parameters 3 2 1 tmp and filtration resistances table 4 and fig 4 a show tmp and corresponding anova results from the beginning to the end of all the experiments p value of 0 00 0 05 indicated that tmp changes is meaningful according to table 4 in the present research tmp decreased by increasing cumulative nanoclay concentration from 0 to 10 g l according to fig 4a tmp changes decreased by 74 from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 initial final tmp values were reported differently in other studies ranging from 10 40 k pa with sb mbrs system similar to our research system and kubota flat sheet membrane 11 to 1 25 kpa with mbrs system and sinap flat sheet membrane 13 in the present work as shown in fig 4a in the first step the final tmp was 5 9 and 10 2 k pa for 10 g l cumulative nanoclay concentration and without nanoclay respectively according to the literature a 16 k pa and 40 k pa reduction in tmp were also reported by hazrati et al 13 and zhou et al 18 respectively using zeolite and aluminum nitride nanoparticles which is also in agreement with the current research hazrati et al 13 indicated that nano adsorbents improve sludge and cake layer characterizations and they can adsorb microbial products so the tmps of the reactors with nano zeolite were less than the control reactor zhou et al 18 reported that membrane fouling was mainly mitigated due to the inhibition of cake layer formation by adding aluminum nitride nanoparticles however as a non dominant theory these nanoparticles could aggravate pore blocking although 15 k pa increase in tmp due to pore blocking using nano silicon dioxide was also reported by larracas sibag et al 19 according to the current study in the second step the effect of cloisite 20a on decreasing tmp is positive and compared to other works 43 46 a high concentration of adsorbent 0 160 g l even the adsorbent that increases fouling 44 45 is applicable also high tss research with low tmp is reported 47 according to the literature 75 160 g l powdered activated carbon pac added to the mbr with the known negative impact on tmp reduced flux up to 35 compared to 5 10 g l pac according to the literature 11 the power law model was selected the rheology formulas Ï 139 04 Î³0 2777 for sb mbr6 and Ï 249 29 Î³0 1157 for sb mbr1 to sb mbr5 as the relation between Î³ as the shear rate s 1 and Ï as shear stress mpa were estimated at the constant shear rate of 100 s 1 the apparent viscosities are 3 3 3 6 and 3 94 mn s m2 for sb mbr1 to sb mbr4 sb mbr5 and sb mbr6 which are used in calculating filtration resistances according to chang and kim 36 total rtotal membrane rm cake rc and irreversible rf resistances which rf is fouling as irreversible deposition resistance were calculated fig 4b shows total membrane cake irreversible resistances and their percentages from rtotal for the reactors from adding the nanoclay until completion of all the experiments rtotal and rc decreased from r1 to r6 but rf was too low for all reactors and rm had no significant changes according to this section s comparable quantitative results more viscose samples caused less tmp therefore higher viscosities caused by more particles nanoclay in the mbr system do not necessarily lead to higher tmps 3 2 2 smp and eps protein humic and carbohydrate concentrations were measured in smp lb eps and tb eps withdrawn samples from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 smphumic 66 mg l was the main constituent of the smp content during all the tests other parts of smp and the protein were almost zero besides no particular trend was observed for smp and protein between sb mbrs average concentrations of lb epshumic lb epscarbohydrate lb eps tb epshumic tb epscarbohydrate tb eps epshumic epscarbohydrate and eps samples for level i before adding nanoclay ii after adding nanoclay iii during experiments with the stable conditions and iv adding nanoclay maximum 1 5 g l d in sb mbr6 of several days in one day second step is depicted in fig 5 fig 5 shows that during the experiments at level iii all the depicted contents had significant trends under stable conditions lb eps increased and tb eps and eps decreased from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 eps reduction had no impact on sedimentation volumes 48 but it reduced tmp 11 13 as a crucial parameter in this research eps tb eps could gather cells by decreasing the negative charges of cell surfaces 49 vice versa lb eps has a negative effect on bio flocculation 50 therefore nanoclay acted as an anti fouling adsorbent by attaching to eps thus reducing floc stability by changing tb eps to lb eps humic content has not been investigated in related literature on nano adsorbents in the activated sludge and mbr studies by yin et al 27 and han et al 51 humic were not considered as the major component in smp lb eps and tb eps samples while in the present study humic is the principal constituent lb eps to tb eps ratios were between 0 2 higher values were associated with sb mbr6 with lower values of tmp the ratio of lb eps to tb eps in the reports by yin et al 27 and han et al 51 are close to the current study results regarding sb mbr1 and sb mbr6 respectively hazrati et al 13 reported a decrease in both smp and eps by adding 0 014 g l d nano zeolite according to the literature reduction in smp and eps has been reported by other studies on nano adsorbents 17 18 and other adsorbents such as zeolite 8 which is in agreement with current research data for level iv of the tests as a part of the second step sludge discharge was performed daily however cloisite 20a was added after approximately seven days unlike the previously reported values according to fig 5 iv lb eps decreased in the reactors with higher concentrations of fresh cloisite 20a compared to level iii 1 5 g l of fresh cloisite 20a can also adsorb approximately 20 50 mg l smp therefore it could remove smp and the remaining pollutant it is noteworthy that smp is the fragment of biological treatment and cannot be completely eliminated by changing hrt and srt but nanoclay can solve this problem in the reactor with no need for additional filtration leading to high quality permeate water the remaining pollutant from biological treatment can be eliminated by adding nanoclay before extraction from the membranes according to the nanoclay exfoliation time to reach iranian standard 52 which dictates that cod should be under 100 200 mg l reduction in tmp by decreasing eps or specific eps and smp is reported 11 13 a critical parameter in this research 3 2 3 morphology and edax assessment the morphologies of mixed liquor and attached layer to the membranes are depicted in sem images fig 6 edax is also reported in fig a 5 as supplementary material according to the weighted percent for r1 r6 m1 m6 and cloisite 20a samples according to fig a 5 nanoclay did not change the culture of the sludge according to fig 6d and h cloisite 20a can attach to the yeast eps or be placed near microorganisms respectively the main reason for fouling alleviation is the change in morphology thus as demonstrated in the sem images nanoclay with a positive charge fig 1 as an adsorbent can adsorb sludge with a negative charge 53 and also eps and smp therefore sludge particles cannot join each other which leads to sludge size reduction and lower sludge adhesion strength 17 the attachment of nanoclay to eps or smp was confirmed previously by related tests fig 6 shows the r6 sample in the presence of nanoclay which is more compact than r1 in agreement with viscosity results though it has less tmp fig 6 also indicates that sludge on the membranes have rougher surfaces and are more compact than withdrawn reactor sludge samples also edax and sem showed nanoclay attachment tendency to the microorganisms of the cake layer is more than the mixed liquor s microorganisms therefore the nanoclay impact on the cake layers morphology is more transparent than the mixed liquors because of more compact sludge and higher amounts of nanoclay on the membrane edax also shows differences between the nanoclay free r1 and m1 samples carbon nitrogen and oxygen weighted percent in m1 were lower than in r1 vice versa phosphorus and sulfur weighted percent were higher in m1 changes in other elements including aluminum silicon and potassium were negligible increasing calcium and decreasing carbon from mixed liquor to cake layer by gao et al 54 and increasing both silver and phosphorus from mixed liquor to cake layer by yuan et al 14 also reported the same results which are in agreement with the present study the results confirm that carbon decreased as the primary nutrient for the growth of microorganisms and phosphorus increased as an element for establishing cell surfaces properties 55 therefore the difference between r1 and m1 is the sample density and the elements or in other words in the cell and physicochemical properties 3 2 4 psd the psd tests for sludge of the reactors r1 r6 and sludge on the membranes m1 m6 are shown in fig 7 and table 3 also the psd of mixed liquor before adding nanoclay is shown in fig a 6 as demonstrated in fig 7a two peaks appeared by increasing nanoclay concentration instead of one from r1 to r6 in addition surface weighted mean volume weighted mean d 0 1 d 0 5 and d 0 9 decreased table 3 reveals that d 0 5 decreased about 10 Î¼m this trend was also observed for m1 and m5 as observed in fig 7b and table 3 though m6 did not pursue the mentioned trend by adding aluminum nitride nanoparticles 18 with dimensions of 10 100 nm nano zeolite with crystal sizes of 150 1500 nm 13 and nano titanium dioxide 17 with dimensions of 150 300 nm the average particle size decreased 42 Î¼m and d 0 5 increased and decreased about 29 1 Î¼m and 5 4 Î¼m respectively a decreasing flocculation capacity 17 and changing psd pattern by silica nanoparticles with 28 nm 19 are also reported also a decrease in psd caused a decrease 13 18 and an increase 19 in tmp psd in fig 7 and the specific surface area and uniformity coefficient parameters in table 3 indicated greater more compact and more non uniform particles on the membranes m1 m6 respectively despite the particles in the reactors r1 r6 which are in agreement with the sem results according to table 3 figs 7 and a 5 the psd range for particles on the membranes and mixed liquor in the reactors is in agreement with the wang et al 56 and hasani zonoozi et al 11 respectively the psd and the sem observation of cake and floc explained tmp reduction after adding the nanoclay 4 conclusions the first step was carried out to reduce fouling using low daily nanoclay concentrations 0 0 22 g l d in the second step high concentrations of fresh daily nanoclay 0 1 5 g l d were used to remove the remaining pollutant and find the optimum point after setting hrt the following results were obtained tmp changes decreased 74 by improving nanoclay concentration in the first step eps decreased as an essential factor in membrane fouling so that tb eps changed to lb eps from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 in the first step humic was the major part in both of smp and eps samples sem and psd showed the theory behind the reduction of tmp by the changes in particle morphology stability and size via nano eps and nano sludge attachments from sb mbr1 to sb mbr6 the optimum operating conditions were srt of 45 d hrt of 48 h and 1 5 g l d cloisite 20a to obtain 80 ar 18 from the second step in the second step by adding higher daily amounts of nanoclay both smp and eps decreased with no need for additional filtration in the separation process funding sources the authors acknowledge the qom province water and wastewater company the iran biotechnology

chitosan nanoparticles citric acid beta cyclodextrin tripolyphosphate removal cobalt ions wastewater 1 introduction heavy metals contamination is tremendously detrimental to both public health and aquatic life because of their infamous influence on biological systems therefore selective separation of metal ions from aqueous solution especially wastewater has drawn more and more attention in recent years 1 cobalt is one of the most generally utilized heavy metals and its removal from aqueous solution is very crucial to minimize its harmful effects it is non biodegradable and is mainly employed in different industries in a larger amount which is tremendously toxic to living organisms the acceptable furthest range of cobalt in livestock water is 1 0 mg l 1 while 0 05 mg l 1 is acceptable for irrigation water 2 likewise its concentration in the waste effluents must not exceed 1 mg l 1 3 the presence of cobalt ions above permissible level causes neurological disorders nerve damage memory loss pernicious anemia weight loss headache asthma heart damage heart failure thyroid and liver damage 4 5 consequently it is very important to manage their concentration in wastewater before their discharge into the aquatic systems to minimize their adverse effects 6 7 numerous procedures have been studied to remove cobalt ions from wastewater such as precipitation coagulation ion exchange electrodialysis membrane separation biological and adsorption 8 10 recently adsorption with low priced non conventional adsorbents has been employed for pollutants elimination from wastewater adsorption is generally applied to get rid of co ii ions from aqueous solutions 11 12 with incredible biocompatibility no noxiousness and availability plenitude natural biopolymers have been gotten expanding consideration recently 13 15 chitosan a type of biopolymer is an impressive sorbent material for the elimination of hazardous heavy metals because it has exceptional features for instance biodegradability effectiveness and non harmfulness 16 it is known that the nh2 and oh groups in its structure are mainly responsible for its properties and unlimited potential applications 17 18 heavy metals adsorption properties of chitosan can be increased by its modification either physically via preparation in nanosized or chemically with crosslinking or grafting 19 22 chemical modification of chitosan contributed to achieving better adsorption capacity and gain excellent characteristics such as stability in various environments reduction of solubility in acidic medium increase in flexibility and targeting specific pollutants 23 26 in this work the modification of raw chitosan raw cs with citric acid cit and beta cyclodextrin beta cd was carried out to improve its capacity selectivity chemical stability and lower its responsiveness in acidic environment to evaluate the efficiency of raw chitosan and modified chitosan adsorbents co ii was selected as a model target pollutant in aqueous solutions to date there are no reports for cobalt removal from aqueous solutions using chitosan nanoparticles prepared using citric acid as a crosslinking agent and chitosan nanocomposite grafting with beta cyclodextrin as well the effects of analytical parameters including ph time amount of adsorbent and preliminary concentration of co ii ions on adsorption

different concentrations of co ii ions 10 400 mg l 1 at the optimum ph was shaken with 0 05 g of adsorbent material for 2 h at room temperature for kinetics studies 25 ml of the co ii solution 50 mg l 1 was shaken with 0 05 g sorbent at altered time intervals 5 180 min to scrutinize the temperature impact on co ii ions sorption on different adsorbent materials experimentations were conducted at four different temperatures 20 30 40 and 50 c all samples in this work were tested in duplicate and the analysis tests were reproduced two times for each sample so that the relative errors could be minimized as possible the removal percentage removal and uptake capacity of the materials at equilibrium and at time t were calculated using eq s 1 and 2 correspondingly 1 r e m o v a l c i c e c i

10 ml of desorption solutions 0 01 0 001 mol l 1 hcl 0 01 mol l 1 hno3 1 mol l 1 nacl and 0 01 mol l 1 etda for 2 h at normal temperature solutions were finally separated from the solids by centrifugation followed by ï¬ltration the co ii ions concentration was measured prior to and next to desorption experimentations by aas desorption effectiveness was computed from eq 3 3 r d e s d d e s a a d s x 100 where aads and d des are the amounts of adsorbed and desorbed metal ions respectively as for reusability the regenerated adsorbent was used in the successive adsorption experimentations and the adsorption desorption procedure was repeated using the same adsorbent sample finally the analytical applicability of the prepared adsorbents to remove co ii ions from different types of real water samples was investigated different types of water samples were used such as tap water nile water and industrial water wasted from electroplating process 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd in our study cs cit was fabricated via crosslinking of raw chitosan raw cs using citric acid then the prepared cs cit ratio 1 3 was modified by grafting with beta cd to prepare cs cit beta cd the ftir spectra of raw cs and cs cit were displayed in fig 1 the distinguishing peaks of raw cs centered at 3437 2880 and 1425 cm 1 were allocated to oh and nh stretching vibration c h stretching vibration and ch bending vibration correspondingly 28 30 furthermore other characteristic absorption peaks of raw cs assigned at 1645 cm 1 correlated with vibrations of co stretching 1599 cm 1 correlated to cn stretching and nh bending vibration 1382 cm 1 consistent with nh bending and cn stretching and 1083 cm 1 vibration of co stretching 31 33 in contrast the ftir spectra of cs cit exhibited oh stretching vibration peaks around 3431 3434 cm 1 which became less broad and was shifted to low wavenumbers due to chelation as a consequence of the crosslinking interactions 34 furthermore the ch stretching vibration at around 2922 2927 cm 1 became less intense and was shifted to high wavenumbers and this may be due to crosslinking interactions comparing the data of ftir spectra of raw cs with cs cit the carboxyl group coo peaks at around 1715 1719 cm 1 the amide i peak at about 1625 1629 cm 1 and the peaks of co at around 1078 1094 cm 1 in spectra of cs cit samples assured the successful crosslinking of cs with citric acid via ester and amides linkages 34 36 besides the new manifested peaks at 2372 2375 2374 and 2364 cm 1 in spectra of cs cit with the mass ratios of 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 respectively suggesting the formation nco bond in the crosslinking process 37 39 fig 2 shows ftir bands of cs cit and cs cit beta cd adsorbents the figure shows broad peaks at around 3432 to 3431 cm 1 that correlated to oh and nh stretching vibration of hydroxyl and amino groups correspondingly we can notice that the large number of hydroxyl groups present from beta cd led to broadening the peak at 3432 cm 1 40 the co carbonyl peak at 1715 cm 1 disappeared in the fiir spectra for cs cit beta cd the amide single peak at 1629 cm 1 for cs cit ester duplicated to peaks at 1630 and 1548 cm 1 for cs cit beta cd characterizing amide i and amide ii vibrations 41 also at 1316 cm 1a peak represented the co stretching of the primary alcoholic group ch2oh that was also moved from 1397 cm 1 42 however the co stretching vibration of cs cit was noticed at 1094 cm 1 the broad peak at 1085 cm 1 was accredited to po3 group vibration 43 moreover at 889 cm 1 peaks are ascribed to the antisymmetric bending of the pop of tpp 44 the existence of all these characteristic peaks demonstrated that beta cd had been successfully grafted onto the cs cit chains xrd investigations of raw cs and cs cit with different ratios are revealed in fig 3 a two main peaks of raw cs were detected at 2Éµ 11 79 and 19 73 which are characteristic patterns of a low degree of crystallinity of raw cs 45 the partial crystalline nature of chitosan is principally determined by intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding formed by the nh2 group at c 2 position and oh at the c 3 position 46 upon modification of raw cs with citric acid the main peak of raw cs at 19 73 became less intense and shifted towards lower diffraction angles demonstrating that the crystallinity was decreased significantly 46 the decrease in the crystallinity of cs cit may be accredited to the hydrogen bonds distortion that exists in the chitosan molecules and may also be credited to its crosslinking with citric acid 34 47 the xrd patterns revealed also new broad peaks that appeared in the range of 2Î¸ 23 45 24 28 for the cs cit samples with the different ratios in fig 3 b xrd analysis of cs cit ratio 1 3 and cs cit modified with beta cd cs cit beta cd is shown it can be seen that cs cit exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks at 2Î¸ 11 73 18 45 and 23 45 the two peaks at 11 73 and 18 45 disappeared in the xrd pattern of cs cit beta cd owing to the crystalloid change after grafting of beta cd onto cs cit it could be also detected that the distinguishing peak of cs cit at 23 45 decreased in its intensity and broadened noticeably in the xrd pattern of cs cit beta cd reported that the decrease in the crystallinity of cs cit beta cd may be due to the deformation of the hydrogen bonds between cs cit backbone and beta cd furthermore the low crystallinity of cs cit beta cd in comparison with that of cs cit may be as a result of the introducing bulky molecules of beta cd onto cs cit skeletal frame led to less regularity of the polymeric chains consequently decreased cs cit beta cd crystallinity 40 48 sem image in fig s3 a in the supplemental file shows that the raw cs matrix had a rather smooth and heterogeneous surface the edx elemental analysis in fig s3 b displays the presence of o c and n which are present in the raw cs structure 49 fig s3 c d shows the tem image of cs that revealed a compact structure with diffused molecular chains 50 it is seen that the raw chitosan particles were characterized by aggregations that were distributed in several classes of particles 51 fig 4 a c e and g displays the sem images for cs cit prepared using different ratios of cs citric acid as shown in the figure cs cit had a rough and irregular surface which is common for such hybrid materials in the case of ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 as the citric acid ratio increased the size and surface roughness of the prepared cs cit nanoparticles were changed and became less agglomerated on the contrary for the ratio 3 1 the cs cit nanoparticles were more aggregated and had a sheet like surface this can be accredited to the existence of a higher ratio of chitosan it is noted from the edx results fig 4 b d f and h that nitrogen oxygen and carbon were the principal elements in the nanoparticles and their ratios changed according to the citric acid ratios in cs cit indicating the crosslinking of the chitosan matrix tem images displayed in fig 5 a b for 1 3 cs cit nanoparticles proposed that the crosslinking reaction between citric acid and chitosan led to an increasingly higher content of stacked spherical like nanoparticles that distributed in the same shapes and forms in the case of the mass ratio of 1 5 fig 5 c d the particles were aggregated with irregular shape compared to the ratio of 1 3 sem images of cs cit beta cd are exposed in fig 6 a b as noticed the surface of the cs cit beta cd sample was rough and had excellent dispersibility tem investigation was practiced to describe the dimensions and morphology of the cs cit beta cd typical tem images of cs cit beta cd are shown in fig 6 c d no significant layer can be detected by virtue of beta cd grafting on the cs cit surface the images also indicated that cs cit nanoparticles bound to beta cd had well spherical nano sized particles moreover the particles looked like a long chain of interacting particles which were composed of small nanoparticles the diameter range of cs cit beta cd nanocomposite was 20 80 nm this signifies that the crosslinking and grafting action did not bring about an agglomeration 52 edx analysis fig 6 e shows the main elements presented in the nanocomposite and they were carbon nitrogen oxygen and phosphorus indicating a good crosslinking of beta cd with cs cit using tripolyphosphate as a crosslinker 3 2 adsorption investigations 3 2 1 impact of cs cit ratio cs cit nanoparticles were prepared via crosslinking of raw chitosan using different mass ratios of chitosan citric acid 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 w w the impact of the mass ratio was examined to elect the superlative candidate from the as prepared nanoparticles on the basis of maximum co ii ions removal efficiency the results in fig s4 demonstrated that the removal percentages of co ii were 52 63 8 57 2 and 45 for the mass ratios of 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 respectively while the removal efficiency of raw cs at the same conditions was 12 13 it can be concluded that the best cs cit ratio was 1 3 which achieved maximum co ii adsorption and this may be due to it had less agglomerated surface and particle size compared to the other ratios as shown in fig 4 and 5 consequently cs cit nanoparticles prepared in a ratio of 1 3 were used in the subsequent work 3 2 2 initial ph impact the initial ph of the solution is a principal variable in the adsorption course as it influences the uptake efficacy to scrutinize the impact of ph on co ii ions removal ph was varied from 2 to 7 and to avoid co ii precipitation the adsorption experiments were not conducted at alkaline ph values ph 7 the outcomes shown in fig 7 a revealed the upsurge in the elimination efficacy with ph and the best removal efficacy for both cs cit and cs cit beta cd was achieved at ph 7 co ii ions are presented as divalent cations co ii within a board ph range 2 7 5 and as cooh between ph 3 2 12 while they start to precipitate as co oh 2 at ph 7 8 53 as detected from the figure the removal efficiency of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd increased by 13 65 35 71 and 62 correspondingly when the original ph was varied from 2 to 7 thus co ii ions sorption on the prepared adsorbents was highly ph dependent at acidic ph carboxyl and amino groups on cs cit and cs cit beta cd could be protonated eqs 4 5 and thereby induced electrostatic repulsion with co ii ions furthermore the rivalry between h and co ions over the energetic sites also induced low adsorption efficiency because the chelate forming and adsorption of co ii ions were restricted 54 as ph increased the amino groups were gradually de protonated donating accordingly lone pair of electrons to co ii ions thus forming complexes on the adsorbents surface eq 4 and thus showed the highest adsorption capacity 55 in like manner the equilibrium of eq 5 was right shifted where the carboxylate groups became more prominent and the attraction between carboxylate groups and positive co ii ions eq 7 became tougher with the upsurge in the amount of coo 55 4 r nh2 s h aq rnh3 s 5 r cooh s h aq r coo s 6 nr nh2 s co2 aq co r nh2 n 2 s 7 2r coo s co2 aq co r coo 2 s 3 2 3 sorbent dosage impact the sorbent amount is a significant variable strongly impacting the removal efficiency fig 7 b reveals the impact of co ii ions sorption onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd performed using various doses of adsorbents 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g while keeping other variables constant results exposed that the upsurge in the adsorbent amount from 0 02 to 0 4 g increased the co ii elimination from 9 20 71 98 for raw cs from 27 38 82 04 for cs cit and from 46 86 99 42 for cs cit beta cd the increase of removal efficiencies was due to the growth of the surface area and the number of active sorption sites on the adsorbent s surfaces which were fully populated by a vast number of co ii ions in the aqueous solution these results demonstrated that the modification of raw cs with citric acid and then with beta cyclodextrin caused increased efficacy of co ii ions removal raw cs cs cit cs cit beta cd 3 2 4 time impact the time impact was investigated at different periods of 10 15 30 45 60 120 and 180 min to find the optimized time for highest efficiency for co ii removal fig 7 c the rate of removal was really quick in the first 20 min since a plethora of active sites on the adsorbents surface is available but with more contacting time the removal efficacy of co ii ions increased leisurely and eventually reached steadiness within approximately 60 min for all adsorbents also it was noticed that co ii ions removal using cs cit beta cd 83 34 was higher than that of raw cs 16 30 and cs cit 53 62 3 2 5 temperature impact results of the temperature impact on the sorption of co ii on raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd are shown in fig 7 d which specified that the efficacy of co ii ions removal using raw cs slightly increased from 14 68 to 18 78 with the increase of temperature this might be interrelated to the new active sites generated on the adsorbent s surface the increasing rate of co ii ions diffusion which led to increased adsorption 56 nevertheless the removal proficiency of cs cit and cs cit beta cd decreased with temperature from 49 69 to 43 13 and 80 85 to 65 46 respectively 3 2 6 impact of preliminary cobalt concentration effect of preliminary co ii ions concentration was explored at neutral ph 7 120 min and adsorbent dosage of 0 05 g using different concentrations of co ii 10 25 50 100 200 and 400 mg l 1 results in fig 8 revealed that when the starting amount of co ii ions 10 mg l 1 was augmented up to 400 mg l 1 uptake capacities of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd were enhanced from 1 38 to 6 90 mg g 1 3 60 18 50 mg g 1 and 4 29 to 43 96 mg g 1 correspondingly until equilibrium reached these results can be explained as follows at the same sorbent amount more co2 promoted occupying further sites on the adsorbents surface in comparison with lower initial concentrations similarly increased concentration augmented the driving force to conquer the transfer conflict of co2 amid the fluid and sorbent furthermore the increase in uptake capacity with initial co2 concentration might be a result of an additional strong interaction between the adsorbent s surface and co ii ions 57 the results have also shown that on changing the preliminary concentration of co from 10 to 400 mg l the efficacy of the removal reduced from 30 30 to 3 41 for raw cs 74 41 to 9 59 for cs cit and 90 79 to 21 98 for cs cit beta cd respectively when the concentration of co ii was low the initial moles ratio of co ii ions on the accessible surface area became less too and sorption got autonomous on preliminary concentration in any case at larger co ii concentrations the available sites for adsorption became less amount in contrast to the co ii moles where the active sites had been dwelled by co ii and thereby a decrease in the removal efficiency occurred 58 therefore the removal percentage of metal would be reliant on the preliminary metal ion concentration 7 3 3 sorption mechanism in this work cs cit nanoparticles were prepared via the chemical modification of raw chitosan with carboxyl functional groups through the crosslinking with citric acid the schematic illustration of the probable sorption mechanism of co2 by cs cit nanoparticles is presented in scheme 1 it might be decided that the energetic sites for co ii sorption may be the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the amino and hydroxyl groups in the chitosan backbone in addition to the oxygens of the linked carboxylic groups of citric acid 3 59 the cs cit beta cd was fabricated by esteriï¬cation reaction with tpp acting as a bridging link amongst cs cit and beta cd and this may have occurred via two possible suggested routes as demonstrated in scheme 2 in the first proposed route the tpp reacted with beta cd and the oh at the c of the 6 position from glucopyranose units in cs cit structure via esteriï¬cation to crosslink beta cd with cs cit 35 the second proposed route suggests that the tpp reacted with beta cd and the oh of crosslinked citric acid at the amide functional groups of the chitosan structure 41 60 the excellent sorption performance of cs cit beta cd nanocomposite is mainly accredited to the richness in functional groups as proposed in the mechanism displayed in scheme 2 the adsorption mechanism could be mainly dependent on the electrostatic attraction between co ii and various functional groups especially oh and nh2 groups of the adsorbent 3 4 sorption isotherms sorption is usually portrayed via isotherms indicating how much ions are adsorbed by the sorbent at a specified temperature in our investigation the equilibrium sorption data of co ii ions by raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd were investigated and analyzed in conformity with the linear form of the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models 3 4 1 langmuir isotherm this model adopts monolayer sorption on the surface with a certain sum of undistinguishable sites 61 when a site is packed further sorption cannot happen at that site and different destinations are alike until the surface reaches a saturation point this model is expressed by eq 8 8 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max where q max is the maximum sorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 q e is the uptake extent per gram of sorbent at equilibrium concentration mg g 1 and k l is a constant correlated to the binding sites affinity l mg 1 the plots of ce qe versus ce eq 8 for co ii ions adsorption using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd with a slope of 1 qmax and intercept of 1 klqmax are exposed in fig 9 a slopes and intercepts values are tabled in table s1 in the supplemental file outcomes revealed that the data for co ii adsorption onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd fitted better with the langmuir model r2 0 99 the uppermost sorption capacity qmax of co ii ions using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd were 7 48 19 09 and 38 26 mg g 1 respectively these results confirmed the very high capacity of cs cit beta cd in comparison with raw cs and cs cit the suitability of the langmuir model showed that the sorption mechanism was monolayered 3 4 2 freundlich isotherm this one adopts sorption on heterogeneous surfaces with the interaction between sorbent molecules involving multilayer formation it also proposes that adsorption energy is non uniformly distributed over the adsorbent surface 56 freundlich model is set by relation 9 9 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e k f and n are constants signifying the uptake capacity mg g 1 and intensity unitless respectively these constant values are calculated from the intercept and slope of ln q e vs ln c e plot fig 9 b the values of kf and 1 n for co ii ions sorption using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd are given in table s1 in the supplemental file the higher value of k f in the case of co ii ions sorption onto cs cit beta cd than that of those onto both raw cs and cs cit indicated the higher capacity of cs cit beta cd the value of the parameter 1 n calculated from the freundlich plot is a measure of surface heterogeneousness 62 as noticed from the table 1 n values were between 0 1 signifying the surface heterogeneity of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd 3 4 3 temkin isotherm here the sorption of ions on a heterogeneous surface is manifested by the uniform distribution of binding energies up to a maximum 63 the temkin isotherm is expressed by eq 10 10 q e r t b t l n k t r t b t l n c e where kt is a constant l g 1 correlating to the maximum binding energy bt is related to the sorption heat j mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature k the q e versus ln c e plots for co ii ions sorption using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd with a straight line of slope rt bt and intercept rt ln kt bt are shown in fig 9 c as well values of bt listed in table s1 were in the range of 0 409 1 835 kj mol 1 mohammadnezhad and coworkers conveyed that bt standards less than 20 kj mol 1 is a distinguishing of weak electrostatic interactions hence sorption of co ii ions onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd exhibited good compatibility with physisorption process 63 relating r 2 values of the three models for co ii sorption by raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd it can be seen that the order is langmuir temkin freundlich 3 5 adsorption kinetics to study the adsorption kinetics a separate set of adsorption experimentations was conducted to follow up the adsorption change with various contact times the sorption rate was elucidated and tested using kinetic different models lagergren pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models 64 3 5 1 lagergren pseudo first order model lagergren s first order model was calculated through equation 11 65 11 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t qt and qe are the amount of co ii ions sorbed per gram sorbent mg g 1 at time t and equilibrium correspondingly k 1 is the lagergren pseudo first order rate constant min 1 t is the time of shaking min fig 9 d illustrates the relation between log q e q t and time for the elimination of co ii ions using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd it is clear that the relationship is represented by a straight line its slope is the rate constant s value of lagergren pseudo first order k 1 and the values are displayed in table s2 in the supplemental file the low values of r 2 smaller than 0 99 indicated the inapplicability of this model for the interpretation of the obtained data 3 5 2 pseudo second order model pseudo second order model was calculated using eq 12 12 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e k 2 is pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 the relations between t q t and time for the elimination of co ii using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd are shown in fig 9 e we can see that the relationship is portrayed by a straight line constant k 2 values can be computed from the intercepts and slopes of the lines see the values in table s2 in the supplemental file as indicated from the table the values of correlation coefficients of pseudo second order are nearer to 1 it can be noticed that the computed q e values were really tight to the investigational q e values thus the sorption of co ii ions by raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd can be considered following pseudo second order kinetics 3 5 3 intra particle diffusion model weber and morris model this model 66 was calculated using eq 13 13 q t k 3 t 0 5 c where k 3 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min1 2 and c is the width of the limit layer fig 9 f shows the relation between q t and t 0 5 for the removal of co ii using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd the calculated values of k 3 and c from the intercepts and slopes of the lines are given in table s2 in the supplemental file it can be noticed from the figure the involvement of two stages occurred during the co ii ions sorption onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd the first one represented sorption of the co ii ions on the adsorbents surface and second one described diffusion of the co ii ions to the adsorption sites in the second one the intra particle diffusion process became sluggish owing to a minor concentration of co ii left in the solution 67 additionally since straight lines did not intersect the origin point the intra particle diffusion was not the rate controlling step and sorption took place via a complex mechanism 68 the intercept positive value is revealing some extent of boundary layer control 3 6 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic parameters 69 suchlike the gibbs free energy change Î´g kj mol 1 the enthalpy change Î´h kj mol 1 and the entropy change Î´s j mol 1 were estimated from eq 14 van t hoff equation 14 ln k d Î´ s o r Î´ h o r t 15 k d q e c e where kd is the distribution coefficient q e is the concentration of co ii ions on adsorbent mg g 1 while c e mg l 1 is its concentration in solution at equilibrium and t is the temperature k values of Î´h and Î´s were computed through slopes and intercepts of the plots between ln kd versus 1 t where gibb s free energy change Î´g kj mol 1 was calculated via eq 16 16 Î´g Î´h tÎ´s by graphing ln k d versus 1 t Î´h and Î´s changes could be established through the slopes and the intercepts respectively the thermodynamic variables Î´h Î´s and Î´g determined in this work were summarized in table s3 in the supplemental file 3 7 desorption and reusability studies desorption implementation is a vital indicator for adsorbent because it affects its sorption efficacy capacity and development expenses when applied for wastewater treatment to determine the regeneration possibility of cs cit and cs cit beta cd the desorption process was considered by blending co loaded adsorbent with 10 ml of different desorption solutions 0 01 0 001 m hcl 0 01 m hno3 1 m nacl and 0 01 m etda at the first adsorption process 0 1 g of cs cit or cs cit beta cd was shaken with 25 ml co ii solution 10 mg l 1 at ph 7 for 2 h then the desorption of co ii ions from co loaded cs cit or co loaded cs cit beta cd was carried out for 2 h the desorbed co was determined and the desorption efficiencies from co loaded adsorbents were calculated using eq 3 the desorption efficiencies from co loaded cs cit were 29 05 15 92 24 63 36 96 and 95 75 respectively the adsorption desorption experiments were carried out successfully up to six and ten cycles see fig s5 in the supplemental file for cs cit and cs cit beta cd respectively 3 8 adsorption evaluation in real water samples to appraise the analytical applicability of the prepared adsorbent materials cs cit and cs cit beta cd were employed for co ii ions removal from different sorts of water samples such as tap water nile water and industrial water wasted from electroplating process the elimination of co ii ions from water samples was scrutinized where 25 ml aliquot containing an adsorbent dosage of 0 05 g was adjusted to the optimum ph in the case of tap water and nile water the samples were spiked by standard addition of 10 mg l 1 of co ii results demonstrated the feasibility of cs cit and cs cit beta cd as efficient adsorbents for eliminating co ii ions from real water samples the removal percentages of co ii ions from tap nile and industrial water samples are presented in fig s6 and table s4 in the supplemental file the obtained results indicated the excellent capability of cs cit and cs cit beta cd for the co ii ions removal from real water samples it is worth noting that many laws in egypt control wastewater reuse such as egypt decrees no 92 2013 and no 208 2018 for protection of nile river and its waterways from pollution coming from industrial activities 70 71 characteristics of the treated effluent in our study were complying with the permissible egyptian limits for co ii 0 5 mg l for reclaimed water reuse standard according to these decrees 3 9 comparison of performance characteristics with other adsorbents a comparative evaluation between adsorption capacities and working conditions of some recently published works 2010 2019 for co ii ions removal from aqueous solutions using modified chitosan adsorbents is presented in table 1 to date there are no reports for cobalt removal from solutions using chitosan nanoparticles fabricated via citric acid as a crosslinker and chitosan nanocomposite prepared using beta cyclodextrin as well the adsorption capacities of the prepared adsorbents in this work are comparable with other adsorbents described in other scientific papers most studies were performed at acidic and near acidic ph ranged from 2 1 6 0 but in the present work the co ii removal was carried out in neutral media on the contrary negm and his coworkers removed co ii ions by chitosan chloroacetic acid composite at alkaline media ph 9 in less than two hours however the adsorbent dose was high 0 5 g 72 as seen in the table the process of co ii removal in the present study was fast in comparison to many reported studies also despite the higher adsorption capacity of chitosan composites prepared by repo and hirtcu teams the process of preparation was time consuming whereas hritcu team applied a higher dose of the prepared adsorbent for a long time of adsorption process as well 62 73 in the present work the crosslinking agent and grafting materials used for the adsorbents preparation were eco friendly materials on the contrary prepared a magnetic chitosan composite using a grafting process with xanthate which has a significant impact on the environment and human health 59 moreover the preparation method of cs cit beta cd was a more simple one than those prepared by other researchers 35 41 74 additionally the prepared adsorbents in the current work can be used effectively for many cycles more than those adsorbents in others work 62 75 76 it is worth mentioning that cs cit and cs cit beta cd had removed successfully w iv ions 40 mg l 1 that have already existed in the industrial electroplating wastewater with removal efficiencies higher than 96 and 98 respectively 4 conclusions in our study chitosan was modified to accomplish better removal efficiency of heavy metals to enhance its chemical stability and lower its susceptibility in acidic media firstly cs cit nanoparticles were prepared using citric acid as a crosslinker with different ratios of chitosan and citric acid 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 the experimental results revealed that the optimum ratio was 1 3 that could achieve maximum removal efficiency of co ii ions secondly a new nanocomposite cs cit beta cd was prepared via the grafting of beta cd onto the prepared cs cit nanoparticles data obtained using xrd edx and ftir for cs cit and cs cit beta cd showed characteristic peaks that confirmed the crosslinking action and grafting of beta cd as well sem and tem images revealed that the particle size of cs cit beta cd nanocomposite was in the range of 20 80 nm which was smaller than that of cs cit nanoparticles 30 100 nm the maximum co ii adsorption capacities of raw cs cs cit nanoparticles and cs cit beta cd nanocomposite were found to be 6 90 18 50 and 43 95 respectively at ph 7 a dose of adsorbent 0 05 g 25 ml of cobalt solution 400 mg l 1 for a contact time of 2 h adsorption isotherms of co ii ions on cs cit and cs cit beta cd fitted the langmuir model and kinetics of the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order model thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that cobalt ions adsorption onto raw cs and cs cit was not spontaneous over the studied range of temperatures 20 50 c but for cs cit beta cd it was spontaneous at the range of temperatures 20 40 c then it became nonspontaneous the negative values of Î´h for all modified adsorbents reflected that the nature of the adsorption process was exothermic compared to the endothermic nature of the raw cs adsorption the cs cit and cs cit beta cd adsorbents were regenerated using 0 01 m edta for six and ten successive adsorption desorption cycles respectively the removal efficiencies of co ii ions in the last cycle were 72 51 and 80 93 respectively reflecting the good regeneration capacity for all prepared adsorbents the results of this work also indicated that cs cit and cs cit beta cd could be used as effective ecofriendly adsorbents for the elimination of co ii present in aqueous solution and real water samples such as tap nile and industrial water samples declaration of competing interest no competing financial interests to declare acknowledgment

chitosan nanoparticles citric acid beta cyclodextrin tripolyphosphate removal cobalt ions wastewater 1 introduction heavy metals contamination is tremendously detrimental to both public health and aquatic life because of their infamous influence on biological systems therefore selective separation of metal ions from aqueous solution especially wastewater has drawn more and more attention in recent years 1 cobalt is one of the most generally utilized heavy metals and its removal from aqueous solution is very crucial to minimize its harmful effects it is non biodegradable and is mainly employed in different industries in a larger amount which is tremendously toxic to living organisms the acceptable furthest range of cobalt in livestock water is 1 0 mg l 1 while 0 05 mg l 1 is acceptable for irrigation water 2 likewise its concentration in the waste effluents must not exceed 1 mg l 1 3 the presence of cobalt ions above permissible level causes neurological disorders nerve damage memory loss pernicious anemia weight loss headache asthma heart damage heart failure thyroid and liver damage 4 5 consequently it is very important to manage their concentration in wastewater before their discharge into the aquatic systems to minimize their adverse effects 6 7 numerous procedures have been studied to remove cobalt ions from wastewater such as precipitation coagulation ion exchange electrodialysis membrane separation biological and adsorption 8 10 recently adsorption with low priced non conventional adsorbents has been employed for pollutants elimination from wastewater

expanding consideration recently 13 15 chitosan a type of biopolymer is an impressive sorbent material for the elimination of hazardous heavy metals because it has exceptional features for instance biodegradability effectiveness and non harmfulness 16 it is known that the nh2 and oh groups in its structure are mainly responsible for its properties and unlimited potential applications 17 18 heavy metals adsorption properties of chitosan can be increased by its modification either physically via preparation in nanosized or chemically with crosslinking or grafting 19 22 chemical modification of chitosan contributed to achieving better adsorption capacity and gain excellent characteristics such as stability in various environments reduction of solubility in acidic medium increase in flexibility and targeting specific pollutants 23 26 in this work the modification of raw chitosan raw cs with citric acid cit and beta cyclodextrin beta cd was carried out to improve its capacity selectivity chemical stability and lower its responsiveness in acidic environment to evaluate the efficiency of raw chitosan and modified chitosan adsorbents co ii was selected as a model target

solution 50 mg l 1 with 0 05 g of adsorbent and the solutions were constantly shaken at 250 rpm following the adsorption procedure the adsorbents were separated using a centrifuge where all sample solutions were centrifuged to achieve complete separation the residual concentration of the co ii ions was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy gbc 908 aa australia to adjust the optimum mass ratio of chitosan citric acid used in cs cit nanoparticles preparation that could achieve maximum removal of co ii ions 0 05 g of adsorbent material with the different prepared ratios 1 1 1 3 1 5 and

different types of real water samples was investigated different types of water samples were used such as tap water nile water and industrial water wasted from electroplating process 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd in our study cs cit was fabricated via crosslinking of raw chitosan raw cs using citric acid then the prepared cs cit ratio 1 3 was modified by grafting with beta cd to prepare cs cit beta cd the ftir spectra of raw cs and cs cit were displayed in fig 1 the distinguishing peaks of raw cs centered at 3437 2880 and 1425 cm 1 were allocated to oh and nh stretching vibration c h stretching vibration and ch bending vibration correspondingly 28 30 furthermore other characteristic absorption peaks of raw cs assigned at 1645 cm 1 correlated with vibrations of co stretching 1599 cm 1 correlated to cn stretching and nh bending vibration 1382 cm 1 consistent with nh bending and cn stretching and 1083 cm 1 vibration of co stretching 31 33 in contrast the ftir spectra of cs cit exhibited oh stretching vibration peaks around 3431 3434 cm 1 which became less broad and was shifted to low wavenumbers due to chelation as a consequence of the crosslinking interactions 34 furthermore the ch stretching vibration at around 2922 2927 cm 1 became less intense and was shifted to high wavenumbers and this may be due to crosslinking interactions comparing the data of ftir spectra of raw cs with cs cit the carboxyl group coo peaks at around 1715 1719 cm 1 the amide i peak at about 1625 1629 cm 1 and the peaks of co at around 1078 1094 cm 1 in spectra of cs cit samples assured the successful crosslinking of cs with citric acid via ester and amides linkages 34 36 besides the new manifested peaks at 2372 2375 2374 and 2364 cm 1 in spectra of cs cit with the mass ratios of 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 respectively suggesting the formation nco bond in the crosslinking process 37 39 fig 2 shows ftir bands of cs cit and cs cit beta cd adsorbents the figure shows broad peaks at around 3432 to 3431 cm 1 that correlated to oh and nh stretching vibration of hydroxyl and amino groups correspondingly we can notice that the large number of hydroxyl groups present from beta cd led to broadening the peak at 3432 cm 1 40 the co carbonyl peak at 1715 cm 1 disappeared in the fiir spectra for cs cit beta cd the amide single peak at 1629 cm 1 for cs cit ester duplicated to peaks at 1630 and 1548 cm 1 for cs cit beta cd characterizing amide i and amide ii vibrations 41 also at 1316 cm 1a peak represented the co stretching of the primary alcoholic group ch2oh that was also moved from 1397 cm 1 42 however the co stretching vibration of cs cit was noticed at 1094 cm 1 the broad peak at 1085 cm 1 was accredited to po3 group vibration 43 moreover at 889 cm 1 peaks are ascribed to the antisymmetric bending of the pop of tpp 44 the existence of all these characteristic peaks demonstrated that beta cd had been successfully grafted onto the cs cit chains xrd investigations of raw cs and cs cit with different ratios are revealed in fig 3 a two main peaks of raw cs were detected at 2Éµ 11 79 and 19 73 which are characteristic patterns of a low degree of crystallinity of raw cs 45 the partial crystalline nature of chitosan is principally determined by intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding formed by the nh2 group at c 2 position and oh at the c 3 position 46 upon modification of raw cs with citric acid the main peak of raw cs at 19 73 became less intense and shifted towards lower diffraction angles demonstrating that the crystallinity was decreased significantly 46 the decrease in the crystallinity of cs cit may be accredited to the hydrogen bonds distortion that exists in the chitosan molecules and may also be credited to its crosslinking with citric acid 34 47 the xrd patterns revealed also new broad peaks that appeared in the range of 2Î¸ 23 45 24 28 for the cs cit samples with the different ratios in fig 3 b xrd analysis of cs cit ratio 1 3 and cs cit modified with beta cd cs cit beta cd is shown it can be seen that cs cit exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks at 2Î¸ 11 73 18 45 and 23 45 the two peaks at 11 73 and 18 45 disappeared in the xrd pattern of cs cit beta cd owing to the crystalloid change after grafting of beta cd onto cs cit it could be also detected that the distinguishing peak of cs cit at 23 45 decreased in its intensity and broadened noticeably in the xrd pattern of cs cit beta cd reported that the decrease in the crystallinity of cs cit beta cd may be due to the deformation of the hydrogen bonds between cs cit backbone and beta cd furthermore the low crystallinity of cs cit beta cd in comparison with that of cs cit may be as a result of the introducing bulky molecules of beta cd onto cs cit skeletal frame led to less regularity of the polymeric chains consequently decreased cs cit beta cd crystallinity 40 48 sem image in fig s3 a in the supplemental file shows that the raw cs matrix had a rather smooth and heterogeneous surface the edx elemental analysis in fig s3 b displays the presence of o c and n which are present in the raw cs structure 49 fig s3 c d shows the tem image of cs that revealed a compact structure with diffused molecular chains 50 it is seen that the raw chitosan particles were characterized by aggregations that were distributed in several classes of particles 51 fig 4 a c e and g displays the sem images for cs cit prepared using different ratios of cs citric acid as shown in the figure cs cit had a rough and irregular surface which is common for such hybrid materials in the case of ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 as the citric acid ratio increased the size and surface roughness of the prepared cs cit nanoparticles were changed and became less agglomerated on the contrary for the ratio 3 1 the cs cit nanoparticles were more aggregated and had a sheet like surface this can be accredited to the existence of a higher ratio of chitosan it is noted from the edx results fig 4 b d f and h that nitrogen oxygen and carbon were the principal elements in the nanoparticles and their ratios changed according to the citric acid ratios in cs cit indicating the crosslinking of the chitosan matrix tem images displayed in fig 5 a b for 1 3 cs cit nanoparticles proposed that the crosslinking reaction between citric acid and chitosan led to an increasingly higher content of stacked spherical like nanoparticles that distributed in the same shapes and forms in the case of the mass ratio of 1 5 fig 5 c d the particles were aggregated with irregular shape compared to the ratio of 1 3 sem images of cs cit beta cd are exposed in fig 6 a b as noticed the surface of the cs cit beta cd sample was rough and had excellent dispersibility tem investigation was practiced to describe the dimensions and morphology of the cs cit beta cd typical tem images of cs cit beta cd are shown in fig 6 c d no significant layer can be detected by virtue of beta cd grafting on the cs cit surface the images also indicated that cs cit nanoparticles bound to beta cd had well spherical nano sized particles moreover the particles looked like a long chain of interacting particles which were composed of small nanoparticles the diameter range of cs cit beta cd nanocomposite was 20 80 nm this signifies that the crosslinking and grafting action did not bring about an agglomeration 52 edx analysis fig 6 e shows the main elements presented in the nanocomposite and they were carbon nitrogen oxygen and phosphorus indicating a good crosslinking of beta cd with cs cit using tripolyphosphate as a crosslinker 3 2 adsorption investigations 3 2 1 impact of cs cit ratio cs cit nanoparticles were prepared via crosslinking of raw chitosan using different mass ratios of chitosan citric acid 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 w w the impact of the mass ratio was examined to elect the superlative candidate from the as prepared nanoparticles on the basis of maximum co ii ions removal efficiency the results in fig s4 demonstrated that the removal percentages of co ii were 52 63 8 57 2 and 45 for the mass ratios of 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 respectively while the removal efficiency of raw cs at the same conditions was 12 13 it can be concluded that the best cs cit ratio was 1 3 which achieved maximum co ii adsorption and this may be due to it had less agglomerated surface and particle size compared to the other ratios as shown in fig 4 and 5 consequently cs cit nanoparticles prepared in a ratio of 1 3 were used in the subsequent work 3 2 2 initial ph impact the initial ph of the solution is a principal variable in the adsorption course as it influences the uptake efficacy to scrutinize the impact of ph on co ii ions removal ph was varied from 2 to 7 and to avoid co ii precipitation the adsorption experiments were not conducted at alkaline ph values ph 7 the outcomes shown in fig 7 a revealed the upsurge in the elimination efficacy with ph and the best removal efficacy for both cs cit and cs cit beta cd was achieved at ph 7 co ii ions are presented as divalent cations co ii within a board ph range 2 7 5 and as cooh between ph 3 2 12 while they start to precipitate as co oh 2 at ph 7 8 53 as detected from the figure the removal efficiency of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd increased by 13 65 35 71 and 62 correspondingly when the original ph was varied from 2 to 7 thus co ii ions sorption on the prepared adsorbents was highly ph dependent at acidic ph carboxyl and amino groups on cs cit and cs cit beta cd could be protonated eqs 4 5 and thereby induced electrostatic repulsion with co ii ions furthermore the rivalry between h and co ions over the energetic sites also induced low adsorption efficiency because the chelate forming and adsorption of co ii ions were restricted 54 as ph increased the amino groups were gradually de protonated donating accordingly lone pair of electrons to co ii ions thus forming complexes on the adsorbents surface eq 4 and thus showed the highest adsorption capacity 55 in like manner the equilibrium of eq 5 was right shifted where the carboxylate groups became more prominent and the attraction between carboxylate groups and positive co ii ions eq 7 became tougher with the upsurge in the amount of coo 55 4 r nh2 s h aq rnh3 s 5 r cooh s h aq r coo s 6 nr nh2 s co2 aq co r nh2 n 2 s 7 2r coo s co2 aq co r coo 2 s 3 2 3 sorbent dosage impact the sorbent amount is a significant variable strongly impacting the removal efficiency fig 7 b reveals the impact of co ii ions sorption onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd performed using various doses of adsorbents 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g while keeping other variables constant results exposed that the upsurge in the adsorbent amount from 0 02 to 0 4 g increased the co ii elimination from 9 20 71 98 for raw cs from 27 38 82 04 for cs cit and from 46 86 99 42 for cs cit beta cd the increase of removal efficiencies was due to the growth of the surface area and the number of active sorption sites on the adsorbent s surfaces which were fully populated by a vast number of co ii ions in the aqueous solution these results demonstrated that the modification of raw cs with citric acid and then with beta cyclodextrin caused increased efficacy of co ii ions removal raw cs cs cit cs cit beta cd 3 2 4 time impact the time impact was investigated at different periods of 10 15 30 45 60 120 and 180 min to find the optimized time for highest efficiency for co ii removal fig 7 c the rate of removal was really quick in the first 20 min since a plethora of active sites on the adsorbents surface is available but with more contacting time the removal efficacy of co ii ions increased leisurely and eventually reached steadiness within approximately 60 min for all adsorbents also it was noticed that co ii ions removal using cs cit beta cd 83 34 was higher than that of raw cs 16 30 and cs cit 53 62 3 2 5 temperature impact results of the temperature impact on the sorption of co ii on raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd are shown in fig 7 d which specified that the efficacy of co ii ions removal using raw cs slightly increased from 14 68 to 18 78 with the increase of temperature this might be interrelated to the new active sites generated on the adsorbent s surface the increasing rate of co ii ions diffusion which led to increased adsorption 56 nevertheless the removal proficiency of cs cit and cs cit beta cd decreased with temperature from 49 69 to 43 13 and 80 85 to 65 46 respectively 3 2 6 impact of preliminary cobalt concentration effect of preliminary co ii ions concentration was explored at neutral ph 7 120 min and adsorbent dosage of 0 05 g using different concentrations of co ii 10 25 50 100 200 and 400 mg l 1 results in fig 8 revealed that when the starting amount of co ii ions 10 mg l 1 was augmented up to 400 mg l 1 uptake capacities of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd were enhanced from 1 38 to 6 90 mg g 1 3 60 18 50 mg g 1 and 4 29 to 43 96 mg g 1 correspondingly until equilibrium reached these results can be explained as follows at the same sorbent amount more co2 promoted occupying further sites on the adsorbents surface in comparison with lower initial concentrations similarly increased concentration augmented the driving force to conquer the transfer conflict of co2 amid the fluid and sorbent furthermore the increase in uptake capacity with initial co2 concentration might be a result of an additional strong interaction between the adsorbent s surface and co ii ions 57 the results have also shown that on changing the preliminary concentration of co from 10 to 400 mg l the efficacy of the removal reduced from 30 30 to 3 41 for raw cs 74 41 to 9 59 for cs cit and 90 79 to 21 98 for cs cit beta cd respectively when the concentration of co ii was low the initial moles ratio of co ii ions on the accessible surface area became less too and sorption got autonomous on preliminary concentration in any case at larger co ii concentrations the available sites for adsorption became less amount in contrast to the co ii moles where the active sites had been dwelled by co ii and thereby a decrease in the removal efficiency occurred 58 therefore the removal percentage of metal would be reliant on the preliminary metal ion concentration 7 3 3 sorption mechanism in this work cs cit nanoparticles were prepared via the chemical modification of raw chitosan with carboxyl functional groups through the crosslinking with citric acid the schematic illustration of the probable sorption mechanism of co2 by cs cit nanoparticles is presented in scheme 1 it might be decided that the energetic sites for co ii sorption may be the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the amino and hydroxyl groups in the chitosan backbone in addition to the oxygens of the linked carboxylic groups of citric acid 3 59 the cs cit beta cd was fabricated by esteriï¬cation reaction with tpp acting as a bridging link amongst cs cit and beta cd and this may have occurred via two possible suggested routes as demonstrated in scheme 2 in the first proposed route the tpp reacted with beta cd and the oh at the c of the 6 position from glucopyranose units in cs cit structure via esteriï¬cation to crosslink beta cd with cs cit 35 the second proposed route suggests that the tpp reacted with beta cd and the oh of crosslinked citric acid at the amide functional groups of the chitosan structure 41 60 the excellent sorption performance of cs cit beta cd nanocomposite is mainly accredited to the richness in functional groups as proposed in the mechanism displayed in scheme 2 the adsorption mechanism could be mainly dependent on the electrostatic attraction between co ii and various functional groups especially oh and nh2 groups of the adsorbent 3 4 sorption isotherms sorption is usually portrayed via isotherms indicating how much ions are adsorbed by the sorbent at a specified temperature in our investigation the equilibrium sorption data of co ii ions by raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd were investigated and analyzed in conformity with the linear form of the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models 3 4 1 langmuir isotherm this model adopts monolayer sorption on the surface with a certain sum of undistinguishable sites 61 when a site is packed further sorption cannot happen at that site and different destinations are alike until the surface reaches a saturation point this model is expressed by eq 8 8 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max where q max is the maximum sorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 q e is the uptake extent per gram of sorbent at equilibrium concentration mg g 1 and k l is a constant correlated to the binding sites affinity l mg 1 the plots of ce qe versus ce eq 8 for co ii ions adsorption using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd with a slope of 1 qmax and intercept of 1 klqmax are exposed in fig 9 a slopes and intercepts values are tabled in table s1 in the supplemental file outcomes revealed that the data for co ii adsorption onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd fitted better with the langmuir model r2 0 99 the uppermost sorption capacity qmax of co ii ions using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd were 7 48 19 09 and 38 26 mg g 1 respectively these results confirmed the very high capacity of cs cit beta cd in comparison with raw cs and cs cit the suitability of the langmuir model showed that the sorption mechanism was monolayered 3 4 2 freundlich isotherm this one adopts sorption on heterogeneous surfaces with the interaction between sorbent molecules involving multilayer formation it also proposes that adsorption energy is non uniformly distributed over the adsorbent surface 56 freundlich model is set by relation 9 9 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e k f and n are constants signifying the uptake capacity mg g 1 and intensity unitless respectively these constant values are calculated from the intercept and slope of ln q e vs ln c e plot fig 9 b the values of kf and 1 n for co ii ions sorption using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd are given in table s1 in the supplemental file the higher value of k f in the case of co ii ions sorption onto cs cit beta cd than that of those onto both raw cs and cs cit indicated the higher capacity of cs cit beta cd the value of the parameter 1 n calculated from the freundlich plot is a measure of surface heterogeneousness 62 as noticed from the table 1 n values were between 0 1 signifying the surface heterogeneity of raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd 3 4 3 temkin isotherm here the sorption of ions on a heterogeneous surface is manifested by the uniform distribution of binding energies up to a maximum 63 the temkin isotherm is expressed by eq 10 10 q e r t b t l n k t r t b t l n c e where kt is a constant l g 1 correlating to the maximum binding energy bt is related to the sorption heat j mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature k the q e versus ln c e plots for co ii ions sorption using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd with a straight line of slope rt bt and intercept rt ln kt bt are shown in fig 9 c as well values of bt listed in table s1 were in the range of 0 409 1 835 kj mol 1 mohammadnezhad and coworkers conveyed that bt standards less than 20 kj mol 1 is a distinguishing of weak electrostatic interactions hence sorption of co ii ions onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd exhibited good compatibility with physisorption process 63 relating r 2 values of the three models for co ii sorption by raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd it can be seen that the order is langmuir temkin freundlich 3 5 adsorption kinetics to study the adsorption kinetics a separate set of adsorption experimentations was conducted to follow up the adsorption change with various contact times the sorption rate was elucidated and tested using kinetic different models lagergren pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models 64 3 5 1 lagergren pseudo first order model lagergren s first order model was calculated through equation 11 65 11 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t qt and qe are the amount of co ii ions sorbed per gram sorbent mg g 1 at time t and equilibrium correspondingly k 1 is the lagergren pseudo first order rate constant min 1 t is the time of shaking min fig 9 d illustrates the relation between log q e q t and time for the elimination of co ii ions using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd it is clear that the relationship is represented by a straight line its slope is the rate constant s value of lagergren pseudo first order k 1 and the values are displayed in table s2 in the supplemental file the low values of r 2 smaller than 0 99 indicated the inapplicability of this model for the interpretation of the obtained data 3 5 2 pseudo second order model pseudo second

cs cit and cs cit beta cd are shown in fig 9 e we can see that the relationship is portrayed by a straight line constant k 2 values can be computed from the intercepts and slopes of the lines see the values in table s2 in the supplemental file as indicated from the table the values of correlation coefficients of pseudo second order are nearer to 1 it can be noticed that the computed q e values were really tight to the investigational q e values thus the sorption of co ii ions by raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd can be considered following pseudo second order kinetics 3 5 3 intra particle diffusion model weber and morris model this model 66 was calculated using eq 13 13 q t k 3 t 0 5 c where k 3 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min1 2 and c is the width of the limit layer fig 9 f shows the relation between q t and t 0 5 for the removal of co ii using raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd the calculated values of k 3 and c from the intercepts and slopes of the lines are given in table s2 in the supplemental file it can be noticed from the figure the involvement of two stages occurred during the co ii ions sorption onto raw cs cs cit and cs cit beta cd the first one represented sorption of the co ii ions on the adsorbents surface and second one described diffusion of the co ii ions to the adsorption sites in the second one the intra particle diffusion process became sluggish owing to a minor concentration of co ii left in the solution 67 additionally since straight lines did not intersect the origin point the intra particle diffusion was not the rate controlling step and sorption took place via a complex mechanism 68 the intercept positive value is revealing some extent of boundary layer control 3 6 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic parameters 69 suchlike the gibbs free energy change Î´g kj mol 1 the enthalpy change Î´h kj mol 1 and the entropy change Î´s j mol 1 were estimated from eq 14 van t hoff equation 14 ln k d Î´ s o r Î´ h o r t 15 k d q e c e where kd is the distribution coefficient q e is the concentration of co ii ions on adsorbent mg g 1 while c e mg l 1 is its concentration in solution at equilibrium and t is the temperature k values of Î´h and Î´s were computed through slopes and intercepts of the plots between ln kd versus 1 t where gibb s free energy change Î´g kj mol 1 was calculated via eq 16 16 Î´g Î´h tÎ´s by graphing ln k d versus 1 t Î´h and Î´s changes could be established through the slopes and the intercepts respectively the thermodynamic variables Î´h Î´s and Î´g determined in this work were summarized in table s3 in the supplemental file 3 7 desorption and reusability studies desorption implementation is a vital indicator for adsorbent because it affects its sorption efficacy capacity and development expenses when applied for wastewater treatment to determine the regeneration possibility of cs cit and cs cit beta cd the desorption process was considered by blending co loaded adsorbent with 10 ml of different desorption solutions 0 01 0 001 m hcl 0 01 m hno3 1 m nacl and 0 01 m etda at the first adsorption process 0 1 g of cs cit or cs cit beta cd was shaken with 25 ml co ii solution 10 mg l 1 at ph 7 for 2 h then the desorption of co ii ions from co loaded cs cit or co loaded cs cit beta cd was carried out for 2 h the desorbed co was determined and the desorption efficiencies from co loaded adsorbents were calculated using eq 3 the desorption efficiencies from co loaded cs cit were 29 05 15 92 24 63 36 96 and 95 75 respectively the adsorption desorption experiments were carried out successfully up to six and ten cycles see fig s5 in the supplemental file for cs cit and cs cit beta cd respectively 3 8 adsorption evaluation in real water samples to appraise the analytical applicability of the prepared adsorbent materials cs cit and cs cit beta cd were employed for co ii ions removal from different sorts of water samples such as tap water nile water and industrial water wasted from electroplating process the elimination of co ii ions from water samples was scrutinized where 25 ml aliquot containing an adsorbent dosage of 0 05 g was adjusted to the optimum ph in the case of tap water and nile water the samples were spiked by standard addition of 10 mg l 1 of co ii results demonstrated the feasibility of cs cit and cs cit beta cd as efficient adsorbents for eliminating co ii ions from real water samples the removal percentages of co ii ions from tap nile and industrial water samples are presented in fig s6 and table s4 in the supplemental file the obtained results indicated the excellent capability of cs cit and cs cit beta cd for the co ii ions removal from real water samples it is worth noting that many laws in egypt control wastewater reuse such as egypt decrees no 92 2013 and no 208 2018 for protection of nile river and its waterways from pollution coming from industrial activities 70 71 characteristics of the treated effluent in our study were complying with the permissible egyptian limits for co ii 0 5 mg l for reclaimed water reuse standard according to these decrees 3 9 comparison of performance characteristics with other adsorbents a comparative evaluation between adsorption capacities and working conditions of some recently published works 2010 2019 for co ii ions removal from aqueous solutions using modified chitosan adsorbents is presented in table 1 to date there are no reports for cobalt removal from solutions using chitosan nanoparticles fabricated via citric acid as a crosslinker and chitosan nanocomposite prepared using beta cyclodextrin as well the adsorption capacities of the prepared adsorbents in this work are comparable with other adsorbents described in other scientific papers most studies were performed at acidic and near acidic ph ranged from 2 1 6 0 but in the present work the co ii removal was carried out in neutral media on the contrary negm and his coworkers removed co ii ions by chitosan chloroacetic acid composite at alkaline media ph 9 in less than two hours however the adsorbent dose was high 0 5 g 72 as seen in the table the process of co ii removal in the present study was fast in comparison to many reported studies also despite the higher adsorption capacity of chitosan composites prepared by repo and hirtcu teams the process of preparation was time consuming whereas hritcu team applied a higher dose of the prepared adsorbent for a long time of adsorption process as well 62 73 in the present work the crosslinking agent and grafting materials used for the adsorbents preparation were eco friendly materials on the contrary prepared a magnetic chitosan composite using a grafting process with xanthate which has a significant impact on the environment and human health 59 moreover the preparation method of cs cit beta cd was a more simple one than those prepared by other researchers 35 41 74 additionally the prepared adsorbents in the current work can be used effectively for many cycles more than those adsorbents in others work 62 75 76 it is worth mentioning that cs cit and cs cit beta cd had removed successfully w iv ions 40 mg l 1 that have already existed in the industrial electroplating wastewater with removal efficiencies higher than 96 and 98 respectively 4 conclusions in our study chitosan was modified to accomplish better removal efficiency of heavy metals to enhance its chemical stability and lower its susceptibility in acidic media firstly cs cit nanoparticles were prepared using citric acid as a crosslinker with different ratios of chitosan and citric acid 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 3 1 the experimental results revealed that the optimum ratio was 1 3 that could achieve maximum removal efficiency of co ii ions secondly a new nanocomposite cs cit beta cd was prepared via the grafting of beta cd onto the prepared cs cit nanoparticles data obtained using xrd edx and ftir for cs cit and cs cit beta cd showed characteristic peaks that confirmed the crosslinking action and grafting of beta cd as well sem and tem images revealed that the particle size of cs cit beta cd nanocomposite was in the range of 20 80 nm which was smaller than that of cs cit nanoparticles 30 100 nm the maximum co ii adsorption capacities of raw cs cs cit nanoparticles and cs cit beta cd nanocomposite were found to be 6 90 18 50 and 43 95 respectively at ph 7 a dose of adsorbent 0 05 g 25 ml of cobalt solution 400 mg l 1 for a contact time of 2 h adsorption isotherms of co ii ions on cs cit and cs cit beta cd fitted the langmuir model and kinetics of the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order model thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that cobalt ions adsorption onto raw cs and cs cit was not spontaneous over the studied range of temperatures 20 50 c but for cs cit beta cd it was spontaneous at the range of temperatures 20 40 c then it became nonspontaneous the negative values of Î´h for all modified adsorbents reflected that the nature of the adsorption process was exothermic compared to the endothermic nature of the raw cs adsorption the cs cit and cs cit beta cd adsorbents were regenerated using 0 01 m edta for six and ten successive adsorption desorption cycles respectively the removal efficiencies of co ii ions in the last cycle were 72 51 and 80 93 respectively reflecting the good regeneration capacity for all prepared adsorbents the results of this work also indicated that cs cit and cs cit beta cd could be used as effective ecofriendly adsorbents for the elimination

13517,sour water are process streams with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide h2s and ammonia nh3 absorbed during the crude oil refining process in order to comply with environmental legislation and reducing costs it is treated to remove contaminants usually in separation columns despite stripping be widely found in industrial plants including refineries few studies have approached process optimal configurations to application in different scenarios of sour water stripping therefore this work aimed to verify the process configurations influence in non phenolic sour water treatment of two typical compositions and to improve the efficiency assisted by a virtual plant in aspen plus software radfrac module was adopted to simulate the stripping column with elecnrtl thermodynamic model the influence of operation conditions as boilup ratio br reflux ratio rr number of stages ns sour water input position si sour water temperature st and pressure p the composition itself and use of steam or thermal load were studied results showed that regardless of the use of steam or thermal load for bottom stripped water the increase in br ns and st promoted a decrease in nh3 and h2s recovery while the decrease in rr si and p reduced them use of steam performed less recovery values than thermal load process efficiency not changed significantly with composition study findings show the optimized configurations in order to obtain a better efficiency process for a one column system generating water with low h2s and nh3 concentrations which allow water reuse or disposal in accordance with brazilian legislation keywords aspen plus software elecnrtl thermodynamic model radfrac module simulation sour water stripping column 1 introduction water is an essential element for chemical petrochemical and related industries being used in the processes of steam distillation liquid liquid extraction washing operations among others in the oil sector it is estimated that for each barrel of crude oil about 65 90 barrels of water are used in the refinement processes 1 considering only the oil drilling process the ratio for oil and water is about 1 3 2 in refining process there is a produced effluent named sour water due to high levels of hydrogen sulfide h2s which together with ammonia nh3 have a solubility in water almost unlimited 3 4 which the total of h2s and nh3 depends directly on the nature of the oil sweet or sour 5 these streams are generated in the oil processing units through the contact of water or steam with hydrocarbons containing h2s and with nh3 generated in the crude oil fractionation circuit for each barrel of crude oil processed a barrel of sour water is generated 6 in general they are commonly classified as non phenolic and phenolic 4 non phenolic sour water have a composition given only by h2s nh3 and co2 if present at trace level phenolic sour water that in addition to the presence of h2s nh3 and co2 can also contain other compounds such as mercaptans phenols hydrocarbons and suspended solids 7 after the refining stage the produced sour water is sent to the sour water treatment unit swtu with the aim of reducing the contaminants content the removal is usually done in water stripping process as integral part of any refinery 8 9 and consists of submitting the sour water load to a heating and rectification system with steam flow or thermal load where it provides the heat necessary for the separation of contaminants and for reduction in gases partial pressures 10 11 this process is usually carried out with one or two columns 3 9 12 13 using one column h2s and nh3 are stripped and sent to the sulfur recovery unit sru adopting two columns h2s is recovered on top gas at first column because h2s is less soluble in water than nh3 and then nh3 is removed on top of second column and the stripped water reused considering the efficiency in ammonia removing and the economy the single column process is more widely used 13 these process streams are worrisome due to their composition since the increase in the concentration of nh3 and h2s are related to corrosion risk in pipes during oil processing which demands effluent treatment for reuse release into the environment or subsequent treatment 11 13 15 in addition in sour water stripping excessive accumulation of these compounds can increase the nh4hs concentration potential which also leads to severe corrosion in the condensing reflux system 15 once the rigor of environmental legislation has increased and become more restrictive a challenge has been created for those responsible to propose more sustainable as well as economic standards that allow the segregation of contaminants 1 16 nowadays in order to improve the wastewater treatment recent methods have been studied as the fenton and fenton like as examples to catalysis which allow to degrade different molecules pollutants 17 an another is the photocatalysis that is assisted by solar energy to energy conversion and pollutants degradation 18 thus the treatment of sour water in refineries has gained more emphasis so that the dynamics of the process with non linear characteristics has been more recently investigated to verify the optimal operating conditions and the most effective theoretical models comparing the modeled with the real data and improving the treatment 19 to study these processes in a more economical and safe way software for process simulations are adopted which allow different phenomena to be modeled with different parameter assumptions based on the theory in database without however having to carry out experimental tests on the plant as the aspen plus 20 although previous works have been using the software to simulate sour water streams and its treatment in systems of one or two stripping columns 10 19 21 22 there is a scarcity of studies focused on evaluating set of parameters and different sour water compositions brazilian oil for example compared to those commonly found in other countries has an n content higher than the world average modifying the sour water composition 12 21 moreover the s recovery and reduce costs have been the main focus of other papers that used the software and the sour water processes 5 6 8 9 11 13 23 26 when the operational process configurations are modified they can shift the chemical equilibria and to favor or not a separation of compounds in a stripping column in a real plant to perform these changes to a study generally is not suitable as the results can be not predicted therefore to do it in a virtual plant is preferable to vary theses parameters in an interval common to a real system allow to understand how to modify them to improve the efficiency and then to apply in a real one this study has as main purpose to show how some parameters influence the recovery of nh3 and h2s at the bottom of a stripping column from two non phenolic acid water compositions from a south korean industry and a brazilian study considering the gap on literature approaching this set and even though these systems have been installed and operated for decades efforts are still needed to optimize the process aiming to comply the increasingly in environmental laws requirements achieve greater energy efficiency and lower costs 9 the findings stand out showing optimized parameters obtained in a software assisted by appropriate thermodynamical model which could be applied in a real plant and produce stripped water with lower levels of nh3 and h2s furthermore it was noted if variation in sour water composition or adoption of steam or thermal load to rectification induces significative influence on recovery and if the treated water could be discarded according brazilian environmental legislation to the best of our knowledge there are no similar studies published yet which approached all these parameters composition and vapor adoption 2 methodology the simulation of sour water treatment was carried out using the aspen plus software the radfrac module was used in aspen plus to simulate the stripper 13 27 the selected thermodynamic model was appropriate for non ideal solutions with electrolytes in the wastewater as nh3 h2s and co2 which are partially dissociated into ions 13 for the thermodynamic model it was decided to use the elecnrtl because it is suitable for mixing solvents in any concentrations and it uses the redlich kwong equation of state for all vapor phase properties 13 28 29 the chemical equilibria of the electrolytes eqs 1 4 were added in the software 21 28 1 2 h 2 o h 3 o o h 2 n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h 3 h 2 s h 2 o h 3 o h s 4 h s h 2 o h 3 o s 2 two configurations of sour water treatment process were proposed using a stripping column system fig 1 1 feeding by two streams one with sour water h2o h2s and nh3 and another with steam flow 2 feeding only with sour water h2o h2s and nh3 however with a higher temperature thermal load heated input in both configurations acidic gas and the stripped water were removed from distillate stream on the top and at the bottom respectively in addition it is possible to use a heat exchanger to reuse energy from another system stream and also pumps to pressurize the input streams the recovery percentages of nh3 and h2s in the stripped water were evaluated in all studied process configurations initially all simulation parameters were fixed as shown in table 1 based on literature 19 21 22 then the parameters such as boilup ratio br reflux ratio rr number of stages ns sour water input position si sour water temperature st and pressure p were individually varied around these values to investigate the impact on the process performance two sour water with different compositions table 2 were used to evaluate the purification process case study i was a sour water from south korea corporation 19 and case study ii was a sour water from a brazilian work 21 fig 2 summarizes the methodology for evaluating the process parameters showing the different compositions of sour water and the use of steam or thermal load as input and the different column configurations to analyze what process configurations were most suitable the stripped water quality was evaluated in terms of recovery of the compounds therefore lower values of recovery of nh3 and h2s in stripped water represented a better treatment configuration the percentage of recovery presented in the following topics was calculated according to eq 5 5 c o m p o u n d r e c o v e r y c f c i x 100 where ci was the initial concentration of the compound in mg l and cf the final concentration of the compound in mg l the compound could be nh3 or h2s 3 results and discussion the process analysis was conducted in stripped water because there is interest in its reuse or treatment for correct disposal according to the local environmental legislation in addition to the composition and the operational parameters the temperature of the top gas was another important factor evaluated in the range of each configuration temperatures lower than 82 c can cause the precipitation of ammonium salts with the formation of cold spots which can generate pressure loss and corrosive processes 21 3 1 boilup ratio br boilup ratio br was varied from 5 10 5 to 3 0 results obtained showed that regardless of the choice of use of steam or thermal load when lower br values were applied there was a greater remove of nh3 and h2s in stripped water more recovery on the other hand increasing in br values promoted a cleaner stripped water i e with lower recovery values 1 for a br 0 2 for both compounds fig 3 in case study i fig 3a nh3 recovery percentage was higher than h2s for a br up to 0 1 either for the use of steam or thermal load for higher values than br 0 5 both percentages were kept close to zero using a vapor stream configuration the difference between nh3 and h2s recoveries gets much higher of about 28 while for thermal load it decreases for 7 when a br 0 0005 it is observed because nh3 have more affinity with water 21 therefore with vapor stream is more easily removed on the bottom for case study ii fig 3b a similar behavior was observed as in case study i thus the difference in composition did not significantly affect the recovery for values of br 0 5 almost all recovery percentage were slightly lower than these ones from case i nh3 recovery was considerably higher than h2s for same br its difference is also more evident when using steam for br 0 01 the percentage difference between nh3 and h2s recoveries was approximately 20 in the steam use and 8 for thermal load it was observed that a higher br promoted better removal of contaminants on distillate stream the mechanism which supports this behavior is the energy role energy provides the heat used to separate nh3 and h2s and to reduce gases partial pressures 10 11 higher br values meaning that more stream is heated and send to the column hence more energy is added and the vaporization is increased which tends to shift the chemical equilibriums towards the formation of nh3 and h2s vapor phases and favoring their removal on top it is known that there is no risk of nh3 degradation when high temperatures are reached in the boilup different from amines in the regeneration process 21 despite br to be an important parameter in column separation processes few studies have approached this influence on sour water stripping silva et al 22 for example showed that increasing reflux boilup ratio promoted less recovery of nh3 and h2s on bottom and the efficiency was similar when ratio was higher than 0 4 results found out here corroborated these one the temperature of the top gas is an important factor to be considered as it influences the possible precipitation of ammonium salts 21 with values of br 0 1 either with steam or thermal load a top gas with a temperature above 82 c is generated in the application of steam attention should be given when br 0 05 is used as in this case the lower limit is reached 3 2 reflux ratio rr the reflux ratio rr was varied from 1 to 6 results of its influence showed that higher values imply in higher removal of both compounds with a significant increase in the nh3 concentration in sour water fig 4 the use of thermal load also favored nh3 removal compared to steam for the study case i fig 4a in the entire analyzed range there was recovery of less than 1 of each compound when steam was used and less than 10 for thermal load however it is observed that nh3 recovery rate due to rr in the use of thermal load is slightly higher considering the study case ii a very similar behavior was verified fig 4b it can be noted that there was a significant growth in removal compounds in the stripped water with the increasing of rr it means that rr is an important parameter when the column purpose is to separate nh3 from h2s in different streams a model commonly adopted for two or more columns however the aim of the stripping column in this work was to separate both nh3 and h2s in the acid gas stream which will be treated later it occurs because increasing rr implies in a decreasing in rate of the column s distilled flow input flow maintained promoting better separation of volatile compounds 30 as was observed above in addition it was observed that the top gas temperature decreases exponentially as a function of rr values of rr 3 can promote a temperature lower than 82 c higher rr values represent a flow fraction increasing that returns to column causing energy loss lee et al 2004 29 have evaluated some configurations in an industrial scale simulation in stripping sour water even though to a two columns system noted that rr increasing was responsible to less mass fraction on top gas in the first column in this work using only a single column the behavior was the same which reinforce that to raise rr do not improve the efficiency moreover it is related to cost increasing 3 3 number of stages ns number of stages ns was varied from 10 to 30 the feed positions were fixed sour water at ns 2 steam at ns 9 if applicable top gas at ns 1 and the stripped water removed in last stage ns increasing promoted a better separation of the recovered compounds at the top of the column and lower percentages of both compounds at the bottom fig 5 in both cases it is noted that nh3 was recovered in higher percentages and it showed a significant decreasing in its recovery with ns growth the use of thermal load favored the removal of nh3 at the bottom when compared to the use of steam the different composition feed also did not interfere strongly in the process efficiency adopting ns 10 about 4 4 and 1 5 of nh3 and h2s respectively were recovered using thermal load in case i while in case study ii the values were of 4 3 and 1 3 for same conditions that is a small variation in recovery percentage a column with a greater number of stages favors the separation of nh3 and h2s reducing the recoveries at the bottom once a bigger contact area is supplied in addition as zahid 9 also showed that to remove nh3 is more difficult than to remove h2s therefore it is necessary more trays to achieve a similar recovery for both the top gas temperature changed slightly in both case studies for the use of thermal load or steam varying less than 2 c and remained higher than 90 c the use of thermal load induced a temperature of approximately 3 c higher than steam because the sour water already enters on column with a higher temperature this result presented that feed composition did not interfere substantially in the top gas temperature differently from lee et al work 29 which showed that nh3 feed content is the major cause of column temperature changes in addition column configuration was different and feed composition also had co2 and hcn contributions 3 4 stage of input si after analyzing the ns influence it was also necessary to understand how the position of the sour water input interferes in the separation in the chemical balances and more directly in the composition of the stripped water and the top gas temperature for this study ns 10 was fixed and the input was evaluated from the top si 2 to the bottom si 9 as a result when sour water was added near the top lower concentrations of contaminants were found in the stripped water using either steam or thermal load fig 6 in case study i fig 6a for si 3 with steam were found a recovery of about 0 23 and 0 08 for nh3 and h2s respectively and values of 4 71 and 1 90 when thermal load was adopted in case study ii fig 6b for the same si 3 the recovery difference was less than 1 compared to case i showing that the change in composition once more did not induce important differences in recovery efficiency however it is interesting to observe that for si 8 and 9 the concentration levels using steam exceeded that of thermal load a hypothesis for this inversion is that the sour water input together with the steam caused a better dilution and moving in chemical balances favoring the removal at the bottom these results evidenced that for a single column process aiming at obtaining a cleaner stripped water by using an input with lower si 5 better efficiencies are reached this configuration allows the water go through a longer way until it generates stripped water in contact with more superficial area favoring the contaminants vaporization in literature studies which have analyzed this parameter to a single column are scarce lee et al 2004 work 29 observed that nh3 fraction on top column increased with the injected feed stage whilst our findings indicated higher recoveries of nh3 and h2s at the bottom stripped water a hypothesis for this variation is the aim of each work column lee et al used a system of two columns where in the first one nh3 should be removed on top therefore an input near the bottom allows a more rectification section up to the top while here input near the top produce a similar behavior in addition other operational configurations were different top gas temperature raised with the increase of si in both studies for si 1 the temperature was already higher than 90 c not causing possible salt precipitations between the use of steam and thermal load it was observed that the increase in temperature versus si is greater in the use of steam 3 5 sour water temperature st for thermal load analysis the sour water temperature range varied from 100 c to 200 c keeping the other parameters fixed in steam flow analysis this range was evaluated from 30 c to 100 c because in this case there was a steam load the results of recovery as function of st for steam did not show a significant reduction of nh3 and h2s being less than 0 5 fig 7 this reduction needs an energy supply therefore only in specific cases as to reach concentration limits could be applied in addition heat exchangers are prioritized to use the energy already available in the system when st was varied without the use of steam the st increasing led to lower percentages of nh3 recovery observed in both cases which shows the non influence of composition in the response this behavior is that when we supply heat to column heating the sour water we favor the vaporization of nh3 and h2s it generates a rectification vapor which will promote the moving on balances to the left of reaction eqs 1 4 then leading to vaporization of contaminants and finally to lower concentrations in stripped water 21 silva et al 10 studying a sour water with the same compounds in addition to analyzing the ph influence which varied according to the change in the mass fraction of nh3 verified for a feed temperature range of 60 100 c that the contaminants mass fraction decreased on output column with temperature increasing it became more difficult to remove the contaminants at the top which differs from the results found in this work this probably occurred because the adopted reflux ratio was different of 25 mole therefore there was a higher return to the top of the column which promoted displacement in chemical balance to the left and more removal in the gas inverno et al 23 studied the nh3 concentration in stripped water from sour water separation and also observed a decrease in concentration with temperature overload increasing as the input temperature was varied it was expected that the top product would undergo significant temperature variations the evaluation indicated that the top gas temperature raises with swt increasing and in the analyzed range the lower limit of 82 c was not reached 3 6 pressure p other important parameter pressure p was evaluated in the range from 1 to 14 atm with sour water input and steam if applied also flowing under the same pressure in the case of steam use this interval was shorter spanning between 1 6 at m as the chosen thermodynamic model in this work presented results with errors when p 6 atm this also occurred if p 14 atm in the case of using thermal load that is for the radfrac module with the elecnrtl package reliable results were obtained only at pressures below those mentioned pressure growth resulted in higher concentrations of nh3 and h2s in stripped water and for thermal load use the values were slightly higher than in those ones for steam fig 8 it can also be noted that the nh3 recovery curve shows a peak at p 7 atm for both case studies and for higher p values a tendency to saturation in recovery the values obtained between the cases also point out that the composition did not play an essential role in the recovery response of the compounds as a function of p it was also observed that unlike the other parameters p promoted more h2s recovery than nh3 the top gas temperature evaluated showed an exponential growth with pressure reaching values of up to 190 c for the thermal load configuration even for p 1 atm the temperature was above 82 c in all cases these results indicated that in order to generate stripped water with lower concentrations of nh3 and h2s for reuse or final treatment using p 1 atm is the most suitable condition this is also advantageous from an energetic and economic point of view because maintaining a pressurized column demands energy expenditure a more robust structure and better operational control resulting in a higher cost silva et al 22 found that with pressure increasing more difficult it was to remove nh3 and h2s from the liquid phase to vapor causing higher concentrations in stripped water similar behavior was also observed in this study although inverno et al 23 observed a decrease in concentration with raising pressure lee et al 19 verified that the increasing in nh3 content from sour water feed promoted a rapid pressure growth become the system more unstable in this work even for case study i which feed composition has higher nh3 concentration the pressure did not interfere in recovery response 3 7 optimized configurations in order to summarize the best results obtained by parameter to generate stripped water with lower nh3 and h2s concentrations table 3 shows them using a br 2 5 keeping the other specifications fixed the best efficiency is reached and higher recovery values for the optimal values of si and p considering the analyzed range in addition regardless of the parameter adopted the top gas temperature has always been higher than 82 c the use of thermal load has been neglected in comparison to steam as it always has the highest concentration values a hypothesis for this behavior is that the mechanism responsible to remove both contaminants from sour water is related to stripping performed by the steam which has the solvent role carrying out of the column the sour water stripping is a process where a steam external or from a reboiler for examples allows shift chemical equilibria promoting the contaminants removal 7 21 therefore when thermal load was used rather than steam the efficiency was not the same because the main mechanism of separation is associated to steam which is also commonly called rectification steam this was also shown in the study by inverno et al 23 which verified a decrease in nh3 concentration with the increasing of steam flow silva et al 10 observed that higher steam loads implied a greater removal of contaminants at the top of the column for different proportions among compounds due to the facilitation of volatilization in this work differently the deal was to remove them at the bottom in stripped water however in both cases it was presented that steam plays an important role in the stripping the comparison between the case studies shows no significant changes in the recovery of nh3 and h2s therefore the optimized conditions found here could be adopted for the treatment of water from different origins about the difference in recoveries between nh3 and h2s the first one always showed higher percentages which is already justified in literature as the nh3 is harder to remove 7 in addition a real plant has a certain flexibility that is usually allows to modify some operational parameters such as these evaluated in the study hence they are feasible to changes in order to improve the process achieving better results lee et al 29 in a two columns process simulation found that the change in nh3 concentration changes the column temperature profile more than any other component which was not verified in this study in literature there are studies that varied the proportion of sour water and steam flow and the influence of co2 and hcn on a column process efficiency verifying that the presence of them makes it difficult to remove on top gas requiring a higher flow steam 10 another attested that all input factor analyzed as h2s nh3 molar ratio nh3 molar percentage thermal load of the bottom boilup per mole load influenced the proposed models to a greater or lesser extent 21 beyond the process conditions several other studies approached the financial view from system sujo nava et al 5 proposed a model liable to reducing operating costs in about 52 torres et al 31 also used aspen hysys with matlab as a tool to evaluate the sour water stripping plants performances and to compare the environmental and economic indicators among different plant alternatives zahid 9 using same software explored several designs in sour water stripping system in order to improve the process performance and to verify the most economical and practicable configuration comparing the steam compression mode with conventional ones reported in the literature however a study to evaluate the influence of all these parameters using steam and thermal load and two different compositions to the best of our knowledge has not been verified in the literature yet 3 8 brazilian environmental legislation and top gas destination water treated after column separation process can be reused in other processes at the refinery promoting energy and financial savings however in some cases it is preferred to release it into environment such as the sea in order for the aqueous effluent produced and treated at the refinery as treated sour water to be disposed of in water bodies it is necessary to comply with the environmental legislation from the country which establishes the conditions and concentration limits for each compound as mentioned the composition used in case study ii is from a brazilian work so the sour water treated by stripping could only be discarded if in compliance with resolutions of the national environment council conama an agency related to the ministry of environment in brazil according to the brazilian environmental legislation for disposal of liquid effluents the provisions of conama resolution no 430 of 2011 32 must be complied these regulations deal with the conditions and standards for effluent discharge parameters and guidelines for the management it should also be noted that depending on the location other rules may be applicable according to the competent environmental agency adding more conditions or standards for disposal or making them more restrictive in addition to requiring more appropriate treatment technologies conama resolution no 430 of 2011 presents the maximum values of several compounds for effluents disposal and therefore the limits apply to water stripped from sour water treatment are of 20 n mg l for total ammoniacal nitrogen and 1 s mg l for sulfide 32 disregarding the mass percentage of element h the limit concentration would be 16 4 mg l for nh3 and 0 94 mg l for h2s hence stripped water should achieve in study i a recovery below 0 126 for nh3 and 0 038 for h2s to be discarded in brazilian water bodies and in case ii the process would need to achieve lower recoveries of 0 178 and 6 45 10 3 for nh3 and h2s respectively evaluating the results obtained and shown in table 3 we can verify that for case study i the optimal conditions found for any parameters and use of steam or using br 2 5 mol with thermal load would allow the water to be discarded accordingly to brazilian legislation in case study ii the br values for the use of steam or thermal load or ns for the use of steam would allow the disposal of this stripped water therefore the results of this study in addition to verifying how each parameter influences the sour water separation process in a single column system showed that using steam in the separation process and optimizing parameter values such as br or ns are sufficient to produce water that can be disposed in brazilian water bodies thus could be adopted in national refineries as well as in other locations once the legal limits are verified to disposal the study findings showed that there are some optimized conditions which allow a better water treatment that is with lower recoveries of nh3 and h2s and besides the brazilian legislation compliance to disposal treated water they are relevant as indicate a way to produce a water with lower contaminants values being less environmental prejudicial regarding the knowledge about these chemicals effects 16 33 finally a by product generated during the process is the top acid gas rich in nh3 and h2s being toxic corrosive irritating and with a strong odor due to these characteristics the compounds must be removed to maintain safety human health and mitigate environmental impacts 33 for this a biological process for purifying this gas could be suggested this process type offers a lower cost treatment with less secondary pollution and design simplicity than conventional methods 34 as an example we can mention the airlift reactor which would allow its application on an industrial scale and which model has recent studies proving its effectiveness 33 35 or use the process biofiltration whose studies although still on a smaller scale present potential results for this treatment type 36 37 4 conclusions the study results showed the different operating configurations that offer a stripped water with low nh3 and h2s concentration recovery values close to 0 for some parameters regardless sour water composition based on the results increasing boilup ratio br number of stages ns and sour water temperature st reduced recovery in bottom water while increasing reflux ratio rr stage of input si and pressure p raised these percentages among the parameters analyzed merely reducing br to 2 5 mol treated water presented recoveries of nh3 and h2s lower than 1 10 7 using steam flow instead thermal load recoveries values were over 30 times lower for a same optimal parameter as ns rr si st and p the choice between these must consider operational availability in addition it was verified that some operational configurations could allow the water discard in accordance to brazilian legislation therefore the optimization of one or more parameters in simulator of separation columns from real plant can favor the production of cleaner stripped water which can be reused or discarded the results indicate that the same set of operational parameters can be used to treat non phenolic sour water with different nh3 and h2s concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the

13517,sour water are process streams with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide h2s and ammonia nh3 absorbed during the crude oil refining process in order to comply with environmental legislation and reducing costs it is treated to remove contaminants usually in separation columns despite stripping be widely found in industrial plants including refineries few studies have approached process optimal configurations to application in different scenarios of sour water stripping therefore this work aimed to verify the process configurations influence in non phenolic sour water treatment of two typical compositions and to improve the efficiency assisted by a virtual plant in aspen plus software radfrac module was adopted to simulate the stripping column with elecnrtl thermodynamic model the influence of operation conditions as boilup ratio br reflux ratio rr number of stages ns sour water input position si sour water temperature st and pressure p the composition itself and use of steam or thermal load were studied results showed that regardless of the use of steam or thermal load for bottom stripped water the increase in br ns and st promoted a decrease in nh3 and h2s recovery while the decrease in rr si and p reduced them use of steam performed less recovery values than thermal load process efficiency not changed significantly with composition study findings show the optimized configurations in order to obtain a better efficiency process for a one column system generating water with low h2s and nh3 concentrations which allow water reuse or disposal in accordance with brazilian legislation keywords aspen plus software elecnrtl thermodynamic model radfrac module simulation sour water stripping column 1 introduction water is an essential element for chemical petrochemical and related industries being used in the processes of steam distillation liquid liquid extraction washing operations among others in the oil sector it is estimated that for each barrel of crude oil about 65 90 barrels of water are used in the refinement processes 1 considering only the oil drilling process the ratio for oil and water is about 1 3 2 in refining process there is a produced effluent named sour water due to high levels of hydrogen sulfide h2s which together with ammonia nh3 have a solubility in water almost unlimited 3 4 which the total of h2s and nh3 depends directly on the nature of the oil sweet or sour 5 these streams are generated in the oil processing units through the contact of water or steam with hydrocarbons containing h2s and with nh3 generated in the crude oil fractionation circuit for each barrel of crude oil processed a barrel of sour water is generated 6 in general they are commonly classified as non phenolic and phenolic 4 non phenolic sour water have a composition given only by h2s nh3 and co2 if present at trace level phenolic sour water that in addition to the presence of h2s nh3 and co2 can also contain other compounds such as mercaptans phenols hydrocarbons and suspended solids 7 after the refining stage the produced sour water is sent to the sour water treatment unit swtu with the aim of reducing the contaminants content the removal is usually done in water stripping process as integral part of any refinery 8 9 and consists of submitting the sour water load to a heating and rectification system with steam flow or thermal load where it provides the heat necessary for the separation of contaminants and for reduction in gases partial pressures 10 11 this process is usually carried out with one or two columns 3 9 12 13 using one column h2s and nh3 are stripped and sent to the sulfur recovery unit sru adopting two columns h2s is recovered on top gas at first column because h2s is less soluble in water than nh3 and then nh3 is removed on top of second column and the stripped water reused considering the efficiency in ammonia removing and the economy the single column process is more widely used 13 these process streams are worrisome due to their composition since the increase in the concentration of nh3 and h2s are related to corrosion risk in pipes during oil processing which demands effluent treatment for reuse release into the environment or subsequent treatment 11 13 15 in addition in sour water stripping excessive accumulation of these compounds can increase the nh4hs concentration potential which also leads to severe corrosion in the condensing reflux system 15 once the rigor of environmental legislation has increased and become more restrictive a challenge has been created for those responsible to propose more sustainable as well as economic standards that allow the segregation of contaminants 1 16 nowadays in order to improve the wastewater treatment recent methods have been studied as the fenton and fenton like as examples to catalysis which allow to degrade different molecules pollutants 17 an another is the photocatalysis that is assisted by solar energy to energy conversion and pollutants degradation 18 thus the treatment of sour water in refineries has gained more emphasis so that the dynamics of the process with non linear characteristics has been more recently investigated to verify the optimal operating conditions and the most effective theoretical models comparing the modeled with the real data and improving the treatment 19 to study these processes in a more economical and safe way software for process simulations are adopted which allow different phenomena to be modeled with different parameter assumptions based on the theory in database without however having to carry out experimental tests on the plant as the aspen plus 20 although previous works have been using the software to simulate sour water streams and its treatment in systems of one or two stripping columns 10 19 21 22 there is a scarcity of studies focused on evaluating set of parameters and different sour water compositions brazilian oil for example compared to those commonly found in other countries has an n content higher than the world average modifying the sour water composition 12 21 moreover the s recovery and reduce costs have been the main focus of other papers that used the software and the sour water processes 5 6 8 9 11 13 23 26 when the operational process configurations are modified they can shift the chemical equilibria and to favor or not a separation of compounds in a stripping column in a real plant to perform these changes to a study generally is not suitable as the results can be not predicted therefore to do it in a virtual plant is preferable to vary theses parameters in an interval common to a real system allow to understand how to modify them to improve the efficiency and then to apply in a real one this study has as main purpose to show how some parameters influence the recovery of nh3 and h2s at the bottom of a stripping column from two non phenolic acid water compositions from a south korean industry and a brazilian study considering the gap on literature approaching this set and even though these systems have been installed and operated for decades efforts are still needed to optimize the process aiming to comply the increasingly in environmental laws requirements achieve greater energy efficiency and lower costs 9 the findings stand out showing optimized parameters obtained in a software assisted by appropriate thermodynamical model which could be applied in a real plant and produce stripped water with lower levels of nh3 and h2s furthermore it was noted if variation in sour water composition or adoption of steam or thermal load to rectification induces significative influence on recovery and if the treated water could be discarded according brazilian environmental legislation to the best of our knowledge there are no similar studies published yet which approached all these parameters composition and vapor adoption 2 methodology the simulation of sour water treatment was carried out using the aspen plus software the radfrac module was used in aspen plus to simulate the stripper 13 27 the selected thermodynamic model was appropriate for non ideal solutions with electrolytes in the wastewater as nh3 h2s and co2 which are partially dissociated into ions 13 for the thermodynamic model it was decided to use the elecnrtl because it is suitable for mixing solvents in any concentrations and it uses the redlich kwong equation of state for all vapor phase properties 13 28 29 the chemical equilibria of the electrolytes eqs 1 4 were added in the software 21 28 1 2 h 2 o h 3 o o h 2 n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h 3 h 2 s h 2 o h 3 o h s 4 h s h 2 o h 3 o s 2 two configurations of sour water treatment process were proposed using a stripping column system fig 1 1 feeding by two streams one with sour water h2o h2s and nh3 and another with steam flow 2 feeding only with sour water h2o h2s and nh3 however with a higher temperature thermal load heated input in both configurations acidic gas and the stripped water were removed from distillate stream on the top and at the bottom respectively in addition it is possible to use a heat exchanger to reuse energy from another system stream and also pumps to pressurize the input streams the recovery percentages of nh3 and h2s in the stripped water were evaluated in all studied process configurations initially all simulation parameters were fixed as shown in table 1 based on literature 19 21 22 then the parameters such as boilup ratio br reflux ratio rr number of stages ns sour water input position si sour water temperature st and pressure p were individually varied around these values to investigate the impact on the process performance two sour water with different compositions table 2 were used to evaluate the purification process case study i was a sour water from south korea corporation 19 and case study ii was a sour water from a brazilian work 21 fig 2 summarizes the methodology for evaluating the process parameters showing the different compositions of sour water and the use of steam or thermal load as input and the different column configurations to analyze what process configurations were most suitable the stripped water quality was evaluated in terms of recovery of the compounds therefore lower values of recovery of nh3 and h2s in stripped water represented a better treatment configuration the percentage of recovery presented in the following topics was calculated according to eq 5 5 c o m p o u n d r e c o v e r y c f c i x 100 where ci was the initial concentration of the compound in mg l and cf the final concentration of the compound in mg l the compound could be nh3 or h2s 3 results and discussion the process analysis was conducted in stripped water because there is interest in its reuse or treatment for correct disposal according to the local environmental legislation in addition to the composition and the operational parameters the temperature of the top gas was another important factor evaluated in the range of each configuration temperatures lower than 82 c can cause the precipitation of ammonium salts with the formation of cold spots which can generate pressure loss and corrosive processes 21 3 1 boilup ratio br boilup ratio br was varied from 5 10 5 to 3 0 results obtained showed that regardless of the choice of use of steam or thermal load when lower br values were applied there was a greater remove of nh3 and h2s in stripped water more recovery on the other hand increasing in br values promoted a cleaner stripped water i e with lower recovery values 1 for a br 0 2 for both compounds fig 3 in case study i fig 3a nh3 recovery percentage was higher than h2s for a br up to 0 1 either for the use of steam or thermal load for higher values than br 0 5 both percentages were kept close to zero using a vapor stream configuration the difference between nh3 and h2s recoveries gets much higher of about 28 while for thermal load it decreases for 7 when a br 0 0005 it is observed because nh3 have more affinity with water 21 therefore with vapor stream is more easily removed on the bottom for case study ii fig 3b a similar behavior was observed as in case study i thus the difference in composition did not significantly affect the recovery for values of br 0 5 almost all recovery percentage were slightly lower than these ones from case i nh3 recovery was considerably higher than h2s for same br its difference is also more evident when using steam for br 0 01 the percentage difference between nh3 and h2s recoveries was approximately 20 in the steam use and 8 for thermal load it was observed that a higher br promoted better removal of contaminants on distillate stream the mechanism which supports this behavior is the energy role energy provides the heat used to separate nh3 and h2s and to reduce gases partial pressures 10 11 higher br values meaning that more stream is heated and send to the column hence more energy is added and the vaporization is increased which tends to shift the chemical equilibriums towards the formation of nh3 and h2s vapor phases and favoring their removal on top it is known that there is no risk of nh3 degradation when high temperatures are reached in the boilup different from amines in the regeneration process 21 despite br to be an important parameter in column separation processes few studies have approached this influence on sour water stripping silva et al 22 for example showed that increasing reflux boilup ratio promoted less recovery of nh3 and h2s on bottom and the efficiency was similar when ratio was higher than 0 4 results found out here corroborated these one the temperature of the top gas is an important factor to be considered as it influences the possible precipitation of ammonium salts 21 with values of br 0 1 either with steam or thermal load a top gas with a temperature above 82 c is generated in the application of steam attention should be given when br 0 05 is used as in this case the lower limit is reached 3 2 reflux ratio rr the reflux ratio rr was varied from 1 to 6 results of its influence showed that higher values imply in higher removal of both compounds with a significant increase in the nh3 concentration in sour water fig 4 the use of thermal load also favored nh3 removal compared to steam for the study case i fig 4a in the entire analyzed range there was recovery of less than 1 of each compound when steam was used and less than 10 for thermal load however it is observed that nh3 recovery rate due to rr in the use of thermal load is slightly higher considering the study case ii a very similar behavior was verified fig 4b it can be noted that there was a significant growth in removal compounds in the stripped water with the increasing of rr it means that rr is an important parameter when the column purpose is to separate nh3 from h2s in different streams a model commonly adopted for two or more columns however the aim of the stripping column in this work was to separate both nh3 and h2s in the acid gas stream which will be treated later it occurs because increasing rr implies in a decreasing in rate of the column s distilled flow input flow maintained promoting better separation of volatile compounds 30 as was observed above in addition it was observed that the top gas temperature decreases exponentially as a function of rr values of rr 3 can promote a temperature lower than 82 c higher rr values represent a flow fraction increasing that returns to column causing energy loss lee et al 2004 29 have evaluated some configurations in an industrial scale simulation in stripping sour water even though to a two columns system noted that rr increasing was responsible to less mass fraction on top gas in the first column in this work using only a single column the behavior was the same which reinforce that to raise rr do not improve the efficiency moreover it is related to cost increasing 3 3 number of stages ns number of stages ns was varied from 10 to 30 the feed positions were fixed sour water at ns 2 steam at ns 9 if applicable top gas at ns 1 and the stripped water removed in last stage ns increasing promoted a better separation of the recovered compounds at the top of the column and lower percentages of both compounds at the bottom fig 5 in both cases it is noted that nh3 was recovered in higher percentages and it showed a significant decreasing in its recovery with ns growth the use of thermal load favored the removal of nh3 at the bottom when compared to the use of steam the different composition feed also did not interfere strongly in the process efficiency adopting ns 10 about 4 4 and 1 5 of nh3 and h2s respectively were recovered using thermal load in case i while in case study ii the values were of 4 3 and 1 3 for same conditions that is a small variation in recovery percentage a column with a greater number of stages favors the separation of nh3 and h2s reducing the recoveries at the bottom once a bigger contact area is supplied in addition as zahid 9 also showed that to remove nh3 is more difficult than to remove h2s therefore it is necessary more trays to achieve a similar recovery for both the top gas temperature changed slightly in both case studies for the use of thermal load or steam varying less than 2 c and remained higher than 90 c the use of thermal load induced a temperature of approximately 3 c higher than steam because the sour water already enters on column with a higher temperature this result presented that feed composition did not interfere substantially in the top gas temperature differently from lee et al work 29 which showed that nh3 feed content is the major cause of column temperature changes in addition column configuration was different and feed composition also had co2 and hcn contributions 3 4 stage of input si after analyzing the ns influence it was also necessary to understand how the position of the sour water input interferes in the separation in the chemical balances and more directly in the composition of the stripped water and the top gas temperature for this study ns 10 was fixed and the input was evaluated from the top si 2 to the bottom si 9 as a result when sour water was added near the top lower concentrations of contaminants were found in the stripped water using either steam or thermal load fig 6 in case study i fig 6a for si 3 with steam were found a recovery of about 0 23 and 0 08 for nh3 and h2s respectively and values of 4 71 and 1 90 when thermal load was adopted in case study ii fig 6b for the same si 3 the recovery difference was less than 1 compared to case i showing that the change in composition once more did not induce important differences in recovery efficiency however it is interesting to observe that for si 8 and 9 the concentration levels using steam exceeded that of thermal load a hypothesis for this inversion is that the sour water input together with the steam caused a better dilution and moving in chemical balances favoring the removal at the bottom these results evidenced that for a single column process aiming at obtaining a cleaner stripped water by using an input with lower si 5 better efficiencies are reached this configuration allows the water go through a longer way until it generates stripped water in contact with more superficial area favoring the contaminants vaporization in literature studies which have analyzed this parameter to a single column are scarce lee et al 2004 work 29 observed that nh3 fraction on top column increased with the injected feed stage whilst our findings indicated higher recoveries of nh3 and h2s at the bottom stripped water a hypothesis for this variation is the aim of each work column lee et al used a system of two columns where in the first one nh3 should be removed on top therefore an input near the bottom allows a more rectification section up to the top while here input near the top produce a similar behavior in addition other operational configurations were different top gas temperature raised with the increase of si in both studies for si 1 the temperature was already higher than 90 c not causing possible salt precipitations between the use of steam and thermal load it was observed that the increase in temperature versus si is greater in the use of steam 3 5 sour water temperature st for thermal load analysis the sour water temperature range varied from 100 c to 200 c keeping the other parameters fixed in steam flow analysis this range was evaluated from 30 c to 100 c because in this case there was a steam load the results of recovery as function of st for steam did not show a significant reduction of nh3 and h2s being less than 0 5 fig 7 this reduction needs an energy supply therefore only in specific cases as to reach concentration limits could be applied in addition heat exchangers are prioritized to use the energy already available in the system when st was varied without the use of steam the st increasing led to lower percentages of nh3 recovery observed in both cases which shows the non influence of composition in the response this behavior is that when we supply heat to column heating the sour water we favor the vaporization of nh3 and h2s it generates a rectification vapor which will promote the moving on balances to the left of reaction eqs 1 4 then leading to vaporization of contaminants and finally to lower concentrations in stripped water 21 silva et al 10 studying a sour water with the same compounds in addition to analyzing the ph influence which varied according to the change in the mass fraction of nh3 verified for a feed temperature range of 60 100 c that the contaminants mass fraction decreased on output column with temperature increasing it became more difficult to remove the contaminants at the top which differs from the results found in this work this probably occurred because the adopted reflux ratio was different of 25 mole therefore there was a higher return to the top of the column which promoted displacement in chemical balance to the left and more removal in the gas inverno et al 23 studied the nh3 concentration in stripped water from sour water separation and also observed a decrease in concentration with temperature overload increasing as the input temperature was varied it was expected that the top product would undergo significant temperature variations the evaluation indicated that the top gas temperature raises with swt increasing and in the analyzed range the lower limit of 82 c was not reached 3 6 pressure p other important parameter pressure p was evaluated in the range from 1 to 14 atm with sour water input and steam if applied also flowing under the same pressure in the case of steam use this interval was shorter spanning between 1 6 at m as the chosen thermodynamic model in this work presented results with errors when p 6 atm this also occurred if p 14 atm in the case of using thermal load that is for the radfrac module with the elecnrtl package reliable results were obtained only at pressures below those mentioned pressure growth resulted in higher concentrations of nh3 and h2s in stripped water and for thermal load use the values were slightly higher than in those ones for steam fig 8 it can also be noted that the nh3 recovery curve shows a peak at p 7 atm for both case studies and for higher p values a tendency to saturation in recovery the values obtained between the cases also point out that the composition did not play an essential role in the recovery response of the compounds as a function of p it was also observed that unlike the other parameters p promoted more h2s recovery than nh3 the top gas temperature evaluated showed an exponential growth with pressure reaching values of up to 190 c for the thermal load configuration even for p 1 atm the temperature was above 82 c in all cases these results indicated that in order to generate stripped water with lower concentrations of nh3 and h2s for reuse or final treatment using p 1 atm is the most suitable condition this is also advantageous from an energetic and economic point of view because maintaining a pressurized column demands energy expenditure a more robust structure and better operational control resulting in a higher cost silva et al 22 found that with pressure increasing more difficult it was to remove nh3 and h2s from the liquid phase to vapor causing higher concentrations in stripped water similar behavior was also observed in this study although inverno et al 23 observed a decrease in concentration with raising pressure lee et al 19 verified that the increasing in nh3 content from sour water feed promoted a rapid pressure growth become the system more unstable in this work even for case study i which feed composition has higher nh3 concentration the pressure did not interfere in recovery response 3 7 optimized configurations in order to summarize the best results obtained by parameter to generate stripped water with lower nh3 and h2s concentrations table 3 shows them using a br 2 5 keeping the other specifications fixed the best efficiency is reached and higher recovery values for the optimal values of si and p considering the analyzed range in addition regardless of the parameter adopted the top gas temperature has always been higher than 82 c the use of thermal load has been neglected in comparison to steam as it always has the highest concentration values a hypothesis for this behavior is that the mechanism responsible to remove both contaminants from sour water is related to stripping performed by the steam which has the solvent role carrying out of the column the sour water stripping is a process where a steam external or from a reboiler for examples allows shift chemical equilibria promoting the contaminants removal 7 21 therefore when thermal load was used rather than steam the efficiency was not the same because the main mechanism of separation is associated to steam which is also commonly called rectification steam this was also shown in the study by inverno et al 23 which verified a decrease in nh3 concentration with the increasing of steam flow silva et al 10 observed that higher steam loads implied a greater removal of contaminants at the top of the column for different proportions among compounds due to the facilitation of volatilization in this work differently the deal was to remove them at the bottom in stripped water however in both cases it was presented that steam plays an important role in the stripping the comparison between the case studies shows no significant changes in the recovery of nh3 and h2s therefore the optimized conditions found here could be adopted for the treatment of water from different origins about the difference in recoveries between nh3 and h2s the first one always showed higher percentages which is already justified in literature as the nh3 is harder to remove 7 in addition a real plant has a certain flexibility that is usually allows to modify some operational parameters such as these evaluated in the study hence they are feasible to changes in order to improve the process achieving better results lee et al 29 in a two columns process simulation found that the change in nh3 concentration changes the column temperature profile more than any other component which was not verified in this study in literature there are studies that varied the proportion of sour water and steam flow and the influence of co2 and hcn on a column process efficiency verifying that the presence of them makes it difficult to remove on top gas requiring a higher flow steam 10 another attested that all input factor analyzed as h2s nh3 molar ratio nh3 molar percentage thermal load of the bottom boilup per mole load influenced the proposed models to a greater or lesser extent 21 beyond the process conditions several other studies approached the financial view from system sujo nava et al 5 proposed a model liable to reducing operating costs in about 52 torres et al 31 also used aspen hysys with matlab as a tool to evaluate the sour water stripping plants performances and to compare the environmental and economic indicators among different plant alternatives zahid 9 using same software explored several designs in sour water stripping system in order to improve the process performance and to verify the most economical and practicable configuration comparing the steam compression mode with conventional ones reported in the literature however a study to evaluate the influence of all these parameters using steam and thermal load and two different compositions to the best of our knowledge has not been verified in the literature yet 3 8 brazilian environmental legislation and top gas destination water treated after column separation process can be reused in other processes at the refinery promoting energy and financial savings however in some cases it is preferred to release it into environment such as the sea in order for the aqueous effluent produced and treated at the refinery as treated sour water to be disposed of in water bodies it is necessary to comply with the environmental legislation from the country which establishes the conditions and concentration limits for each compound as mentioned the composition used in case study ii is from a brazilian work so the sour water treated by stripping could only be discarded if in compliance with resolutions of the national environment council conama an agency related to the ministry of environment in brazil according to the brazilian environmental legislation for disposal of liquid effluents the provisions of conama resolution no 430 of 2011 32 must be complied these regulations deal with the conditions and standards for effluent discharge parameters and guidelines for the management it should also be noted that depending on the location other rules may be applicable according to the competent environmental agency adding more conditions or standards for disposal or making them more restrictive in addition to requiring more appropriate treatment technologies conama resolution no 430 of 2011 presents the maximum values of several compounds for effluents disposal and therefore the limits apply to water stripped from sour water treatment are of 20 n mg l for total ammoniacal nitrogen and 1 s mg l for sulfide 32 disregarding the mass percentage of element h the limit concentration would be 16 4 mg l for nh3 and 0 94 mg l for h2s hence stripped water should achieve in study i a recovery below 0 126 for nh3 and 0 038 for h2s to be discarded in brazilian water bodies and in case ii the process would need to achieve lower recoveries of 0 178 and 6 45 10 3 for nh3 and h2s respectively evaluating the results obtained and shown in table 3 we can verify that for case study i the optimal conditions found for any parameters and use of steam or using br 2 5 mol with thermal load would allow the water to be discarded accordingly to brazilian legislation in case study ii the br values for the use of steam or thermal load or ns for the use of steam would allow the disposal of this stripped water therefore the results of this study in addition to verifying how each parameter influences the sour water separation process in a single column system showed that using steam in the separation process and optimizing parameter values such as br or ns are sufficient to produce water that can be disposed in brazilian water bodies thus could be adopted in national refineries as well as in other locations once the legal limits are verified to disposal the study findings showed that there are some optimized conditions which allow a better water treatment that is with lower recoveries of nh3 and h2s and besides the brazilian legislation compliance to disposal treated water they are relevant as indicate a way to produce a water with lower contaminants values being less environmental prejudicial regarding the knowledge about these chemicals effects 16 33 finally a by product generated during the process is the top acid gas rich in nh3 and h2s being toxic corrosive irritating and with a strong odor due to these characteristics the compounds must be removed to maintain safety human health and mitigate environmental impacts 33 for this a biological process for purifying this gas could be suggested this process type offers a lower cost treatment with less secondary pollution and design simplicity than conventional methods 34 as an example we can mention the airlift reactor which would allow its application on an industrial scale and which model has recent studies proving its effectiveness 33 35 or use the process biofiltration whose studies although still on a smaller scale present potential results for this treatment type 36 37 4 conclusions the study results showed the different operating configurations that offer a stripped water with low nh3 and h2s concentration recovery values close to 0 for some parameters regardless sour water composition based on the results increasing boilup ratio br number of stages ns and sour water temperature st reduced recovery in bottom water while increasing reflux ratio rr stage of input si and pressure p raised these percentages among the parameters analyzed merely reducing br to 2 5 mol treated water presented recoveries of nh3 and h2s lower than 1 10 7 using steam flow instead thermal load recoveries values were over 30 times lower for a same optimal parameter as ns rr si st and p the choice between these must consider operational availability in addition it was verified that some operational configurations could allow the water discard in accordance to brazilian legislation therefore the optimization of one or more parameters in simulator of separation columns from real plant can favor the production of cleaner stripped water which can be reused or discarded the results indicate that the same set of operational parameters can be used to treat non phenolic sour water with different nh3 and h2s concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the

subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw packed with heterogonous gravels and cattle dung biochar was established to examine the removal of nitrate no3 n ammonium n nh4 n sulfate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 chemical oxygen demand cod total n tn and total coliforms from domestic wastewater to achieve the goal three setups of vssfcws sb medium biochar 10 v v sbp medium biochar colocasia sp medium colocasia were established and wastewater characteristics ph do no3 n nh4 n tn so4 2 po4 3 cod and total coliforms were monitored after each 24 h interval for 40 d after 70 d of initial acclimatization of the setups sbp showed the highest average removal efficiency for cod 92 6 no3 n 81 7 nh4 n 81 2 so4 2 85 4 po4 3 69 5 total coliforms 97 than sb and sp during of the 40 d treatment

sp setup the treated domestic wastewater by biochar amended vssfcws compliance with the limit set by the national pollution monitoring agency of india role of aeration and varying wastewater strength especially cod load in the performance of colocasia based cws could be undertaken as a research problem for future studies to develop an efficient engineered wetland system for on site wastewater treatment keywords constructed wetlands cod nitrification low cost technology bod coliforms 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are engineered structures designed and operated based on natural wetland principles to treat wastewater from various anthropogenic sources like urban sewage water industrial effluents agriculture and urban runoff water landfill leachates 1 3 in the recent past cws has attracted the attention of policymakers due to the low operation cost and convenience to operate for designing nature based onsite wastewater operations 2 4 cw is found to be efficient in the removal of a variety of organic and inorganic pollutants e g bod cod nitrogen phosphorous potassium sulfate heavy metal industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals residues etc from wastewater through mechanisms like microbial degradation plant uptake chemical oxidation adsorption filtration biological precipitation volatilization and biostabilization 1 4 5 apart to remediation of pollutants from wastewater cws also habitat aquatic organisms improve groundwater recharge rate helps to control urban floods and also generate food resources for human and other organisms 3 6 various factors govern the functioning of cws but carbon content in substrate plays an important role in the microbial colonization and their functioning in such systems gagnon et al 7 found that the addition of external carbon sources in the cw system could improve the nitrogen removal efficiency by 95 in another study chen et al 8 revealed that the high carbon content in cws substrate not only improves the sulfur mineralization efficiently but also helps in simultaneous removal of nitrate from wastewater through sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification connecting sulfur oxidation to nitrate reduction process during nitrification and denitrification in cws the microbes use organic carbon as energy sources that further improves the overall nitrogen reduction rate during the treatment process 9 the commonly used materials for cw substrate e g gravels sand and other zeolites generally lack carbon contents thereby shows low efficiency to remove wastewater nutrient in such engineered systems 10 to overcome this problem biochar could be a valuable source of carbon to improve the overall functioning of engineered wetland systems in the recent past there have been increasing interest in the uses of biochar in cws to improve its efficiency 11 13 biochar is a carbon rich porous material mainly obtained from thermochemical degradation of plant biomass in an oxygen deficient environment apart to a rich source of carbon biochar also contains several nutrients in mineral forms k na ca mg fe and other elements which could act as a plant as well as microbial growth promoting substances in the cws 14 15 biochar exhibits high porosity and surface area that helps in adsorptive removal of charged molecules from wastewater microbial propagation in the substrate and accelerating the redox reactions if applied in a suitable amount in a cw 3 16 the effect of biochar addition on cw working efficiency has been reported by various previous researchers for example kasak et al 11 in their study found that biochar aided cws to show better removal of tn and total phosphorous 20 2 and 22 5 respectively than control setup of the substrate without biochar 13 7 and 16 2 respectively they concluded that biochar could be an advantageous substance in the cw system for enhancement of treatment efficiency of such systems nguyen et al 17 have reported the significant removal of total suspended solids tss cod biological oxygen demand bod nh4 n and total coliform by 71 73 79 91 and 70 respectively in the vertical flow and free water surface cw amended with biochar prepared from pyrolysis of acacia auriculiformis bark at 500 c the removal efficiency was better in those setups which were spiked with biochar in the substrate meng et al 18 investigated the efficiency of a non aerated vertical baffled flow cw spiked with biochar made from a composite material dewatered sludge food waste rice straw and mature compost and they found the significant improvement in removal rate of cod 83 3 nh4 n 95 9 tn 28 total phosphorus 59 5 from domestic sewage while treated with cw de rozari et al 19 have reported about 71 87 81 93 and 65 79 removal rates for tn no3 n and nh4 n load from sewage water treated with a cw containing different amount of biochar hardwood biochar made at 500 c in the substrate guo et al 20 found in their study that addition of zeolite and biochar in verticle flow cw was significantly improved the removal of biogas slurry pollutants and a higher arsenic as removal in cw was noted in the setup with biochar than control without biochar setups it was found in recent studies that addition of biochar in traditional cw system was beneficial in terms of improved root aeration increased root porosity enhancing nh3 n metabolism in rhizomes through plant metabolism and root adsorption process 1 3 4 zhou et al 2 found much higher removal of cod 92 nh3 n 50 and tn 50 from high c n wastewater in a subsurface flow cw amended with biochar however in the majority of previous studies researchers used biochar made of wood and other plant derived substances like tree wood 21 22 bamboo 12 23 crop residues 24 hemp fibres 25 for cw operations since wood and plant derived materials could be utilized for some other applications and industrial productions rather than using as feedstock for biochar production using wood and plant substances for biochar production doesn t seem a resource efficient energy saving and economically viable option under the circular economy system therefore effectors are being made worldwide by the scientific community to find alternate feedstock for biochar preparation for decontamination of wastewater resources 26 27 crop residues could be used as feed for livestock cultivation and production of industrial chemicals fibres and biomanure in the recent past few studies suggested the use of some community waste materials sewage faecal and industrial sludges and animal excreta as a feedstock for the production of low cost biochar for environmental applications 27 28 animal waste dung contains a high amount of carbon and various other nutrients and regardless of such unique properties it is hardly taken as feedstock for biochar preparation although few recent studies indicated the suitability of animal waste as a source for activated carbon production 27 29 cattle dung is a low cost and easily available material for biochar preparation and could help in cutting the overall cost of environmental management operations recent studies indicate the potential of cattle dung biochar in soil fertility improvements 30 adsorptive removal of industrial pollutants from the aqueous medium 31 reclaiming nutrients from wastewater 8 biogas quality improvement in the anaerobic digester 27 antibacterial agents for bacterial decontamination 29 but to the best of the authors knowledge cattle dung biochar potential in cw operation is rarely investigated by any previous researcher the literature review suggested that cattle dung biochar could be a rich source of carbon and soil nutrients na k ca and elements for optimal growth of microbes and plant in engineered wetland systems for enhanced removal of pollutants from wastewater therefore this study aimed to investigate the potential of vssfcw setups amended with cow dung biochar for effective treatment of domestic wastewater under ambient conditions the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the role of colocasia based vssfcw in the removal of chemical pollutants cod nitrogen tn nh4 n and no3 n po4 3 and so4 2 as well as biological contamination total coliform bacteria from domestic wastewater 2 to determine the role of substrate materials in removal mechanism 3 determining the optimal hydraulic retention time hrt for the efficient removal of wastewater pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 cattle dung biochar preparation and characterization for biochar preparation fresh and dried cattle dung pats were procured from a local animal farm dried further at 80 c for 24 h to remove the moisture and then pyrolysed at 400 c for 4 h heating rate was 26 5 c min 1 in a muffle furnace under an anaerobic condition by following the procedure described by joseph et al 32 the literature review suggested that slow pyrolysis could be energy efficient carbonization of biomass to produce carbon and nutrient rich n k ca p etc biochar 27 32 slow pyrolysis also helps in retaining soil nutrients which could be valuable for plant and microbial growth in cws charred dung pats were cooled at room temperature in a desiccator powdered and sieved to particle size 0 25 1 mm biochar was analyzed for various physicochemical characteristics surface morphology surface reactive groups porosity water holding capacity bulk density ph electrical conductivity ash content fixed carbon and volatile matter and results are shown in table 1s 2 2 experimental setup preparation three mesoscale vssfcws sb sbp and sp were operated at solid liquid waste treatment laboratory doon university dehradun india to compare the results of removal of wastewater pollutants in different types of cw setups sb a control setups was run to see the role of filling substrate of cw in removal mechanism through adsorption and oxidation processes all setups were prepared in a plastic container of 30 l capacity Ã¸ 33 5 cm and 37 cm height with the same configuration in all vssfcws a composite multidimensional substrate of 40 cm depth composed of the four layers of different bed frames was used the substrate depth affects the nitrification and oxygen supply in deep layers of vfsscws therefore the depth of the substrate was kept 40 cm including 15 cm top layers of plant rhizome to ensure the proper oxygen supply in the bottom layers of the cw medium the schematic diagram of a vssfcw setup is shown in fig 1 bed frame size of gravel reduced from bottom to top for better aeration included boulders Ã¸ 20 21 mm to a depth of 5 cm above it a coarse gravel Ã¸ 8 12 mm layer of 10 cm a layer of fine gravels Ã¸ 4 6 mm of 10 cm a topmost layer rhizome layer of a homogenized mixture of biochar 0 25 1 mm particle size and final layer of the river bottom sand of 15 cm fig 1 biochar was applied in a dose of 10 v v of the top layer material as suggested in the published literature 11 the inlet pipe of vfsscw was placed in the rhizome part of colocasia the plant used for cw to pour wastewater in setups during the experimental period we operated experimental vfsscws with the minimum energy inputs without mechanical aeration operated under a batch flow system as a low cost operating system for domestic wastewater treatment for the need of rural areas all vfsscws were initially acclimatized for 70 d and the formal experiment began thereafter further operated for 40 days august to november 2019 to track the changes in wastewater parameters during the experimental period sbp and sp setups were planted with colocasia esculenta elephant ear of similar height at a density of about 10 rhizomes per setup genus colocasia is native to asia and belongs to family araceae in colocasia leaves are generally large 30 150 cm of sagittate shape and it is found commonly at marshy lands and muddy river banks we selected colocasia esculenta for cw setups due to its peculiar properties like 1 available locally and shows high adaptability to the changing environment 2 having a high survival rate in polluted water 3 showing a strong efficiency to remove water pollutants 17 4 having a high photosynthetic rate mainly due to very large leaf sizes for experimentation young specimens of colocasia esculenta were collected from the doon university campus acclimatized in the lab for 2 weeks in hoagland medium before planting to experimental setups after acclimatization plants were shown in experimental setups sbp and sp and further irrigated for 5 wk until the plant stand established properly in setups before plantations of colocasia in vssfcws about 1 kg sewage sludge procured from secondary sedimentary sludge tank of a local wastewater treatment plant stp was inoculated in the rhizome layer to develop a microbial community in the vssfcws 33 the experiment was performed using urban sewage water with an hrt of 10 d under ambient environmental conditions 24 25 8 c and natural sunlight 2 3 experimental operation conditions for experimentation the wastewater was collected from an inlet of a mothrowala stp near university campus dehradun india the wastewater was collected in the large plastic jerrican 10 l using an autosampler for continuously 2 wk and all collected wastewater was then mixed tougher to get representative wastewater strength for experimental work the characteristics of influent used for experiment work are given in table 1 four continuous treatment cycles each of 10 d duration were performed to get the significant data for vssfcw performance evaluation from each experimental setup the outlet sample was collected at 24 48 72 96 120 144 168 192 216 and 240 h of operation by the following method by liu et al 34 after completion of a cycle the wastewater was drained from the bottom outlet and new wastewater lot was loaded in vssfcws after each cycle the outlet was kept open for 8 10 h to replenished the setups with oxygen supply 35 the wastewater was loaded gradually 30 45 min in all setups without causing overflow and the hrt counting was started after complete loading of wastewater in vssfcws 2 4 wastewater sampling and analytical procedures during each trial influent 0 d and effluent 24 48 72 96 120 144 168 192 216 and 240 h samples were collected in the evening hours from each vssfcw setup the outlet sample 150 ml was collected in three batches with 15 min gap and all outlet samples were mixed to get a reliable sample for analysis of wastewater parameters the characteristics of wastewater ph cod tn nh4 n no3 n po4 3 so4 2 total coliforms and do were estimated using standard methods as described in apha 36 total coliforms in influent and effluent were analyzed by following multiple tube fermentation technique do concentration in influent after loading to setups and effluent at different retention time was determined with a do meter hq40d hach usa all standards and solutions were prepared in ar grade chemicals with 99 purity mostly provided by merck india 2 5 statistical analysis all results were expressed as a mean of four trials with standard deviation one way anova was used to compare the statistically significant difference among vssfcws for per cent removal turkey s multiple ranged tests were also performed to identify the homogenous sub setups of the mean value for different parameters statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss 20 spss inc chicago usa and statistica software package multivariate analysis including principal component analysis pca cluster analysis and pearsons correlation matrix was also performed to see the interrelationships among the wastewater parameters studied results were considered significant at p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in wastewater chemistry in different vssfcws 3 1 1 ph and do the initial average ph of the wastewater was 8 15 0 56 and that changed to 8 62 in sb 7 41 in sbp and 7 06 in sp at the end of the treatment the ph of outlet increased slightly after 24 h of retention in both biochar setups sb and sbp thereafter it decreased gradually until the end of the treatment process except to a slight increase after 144 h in sb in sp ph decreased continuously until the end of the treatment cycle fig 2 a results of ph change are similar to the finding of liu et al 34 and kasak et al 11 who have reported an initial increase in wastewater ph possibly due to dissolutions of salts from biochar ph range of influent was within the acceptable range 6 8 required for the optimal growth of nitrifying and other associated aerobic communities in the cw the ph dynamics in experimental vssfcws could be explained as follow 1 ph shifting attributed to the changes in the concentration of carbonates bicarbonates ammonia slat hydroxyls and other organic metabolites generated during the degradation of organic substances in wastewater in the aerobic treatment processes 37 2 in sbp and sp the release of hydrogen ions h could be responsible for an overall reduction in ph of the outlet the uptake of nh4 ions by plant roots and nitrification process 2nh4 3o2 2no2 2h2o 4h energy and no2 h2o no3 2h 2e generates h 38 which probably caused a shift in the ph of water 3 probably accumulation of nh4 ions during the later anaerobic phase of sb when do was 1 5 mg l 1 after 144 h could be responsible for the increased ph in sb setup the dynamic in the do level in different vssfcws setups are shown in fig 2 b do in inlet after loading of wastewater ranged between 5 78 and 6 78 mg l 1 suggesting a significant level of do at the time of loading of wastewater in experimental setups in sb setup the do level decreases rapidly and reached to a level below the limitation 1 5 mg l 1 after 144 h required for nitrification process 37 39 in cws in sbp setup the do level increased rapidly until 72 h followed by a slow increase between 96 h and 168 h and a constant decrease in the later period of the treatment the increment in do levels could be attributed to the release of oxygen by the root zone system in the sbp setups results of do increment in cws were in agreement with nguyen et al 17 and oovel et al 40 who have reported an increase in do level in cws during the treatment process mainly contributed by plant stand in such systems planted vssfcws showed the do levels in the ranges of 4 63 to 3 07 mg l 1 average 4 07 0 50 mg l 1 in sbp and 4 64 to 3 58 mg l 1 average 3 96 0 39 mg l 1 in sp setups during the treatment indicating the direct role of plant stand in oxygen supply in the cws a better do level in sbp than sp could be attributed to the biochar addition which might have facilitated the system in do enrichments due to their porous morphology of the biochar the cracks and holes in biochar create a suitable space for do retention in such systems 12 20 do level in the effluent was 0 70 mg l 1 in sb while in sbp and sp setups it was relatively in the higher range 3 07 and 3 58 mg l 1 respectively do 1 5 mg l 1 promotes rapid nitrification through aerobic denitrifies in cws 37 during the photosynthesis plant release oxygen in rhizomes part of the cws which is further utilized by root respiration process about half of it and rest in organic matter oxidations process 41 42 results indicate that biochar addition could be a valuable approach to enhance the do level in cws for improvement of rapid oxidative removal of wastewater pollutants during the treatment by cws 3 1 2 cod removal cod removal from wastewater mainly depends on two factors i e metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria and the kinetics of the oxidative reactions in the treatment setups average influent cod was 326 25 mg l 1 and that decreased to a range of 33 82 108 5 mg l 1 after treatment by different vssfcws table 1 the maximum cod reduction of 92 6 was recorded in sbp 72 h followed by 89 9 sp at 96 h and 47 7 sb at 72 h f 50 216 p 0 001 fig 3 a ii the difference between sp and sb setups for cod removal rate was not statistically significant anova tukey s t test p 0 123 as shown in fig 3a iii the maximum cod reduction occurred after 72 120 h of retention in studied vssfcw setups suggesting the aerobic degradation as the prime mechanism for the cod removal the low removal of cod in sb could be attributed to the do limitations in such setups fig 3 b it is found that limited oxygen in cws suppresses the activities of heterotrophic microbial communities which plays an important role in the removal of cod from wastewater 43 the dynamics of cod in different vssfcws is described in fig 3a i the cod load increased from 152 57 190 67 mg l 1 between 96 120 h and 25 52 42 87 mg l 1 after 96 h in sb and sbp setups respectively but after that the cod decreased considerably until the end of the process in both setups the cod dynamics in vssfcws could be explained as follow 1 oxygen consumption by nitrate reaction during the anoxic degradation of organic matter should be responsible for cod increment 2 the leaching of soluble carbon from biochar might have contributed in the overall load of cod in wastewater 44 in cws strong competition between organic matter degradation and nitrification rate for oxygen consumption plays an important role in cod dynamics in the system 34 42 45 it is presumed that the aerobic degradation of organic matter during the initial phase 72 96 h while nitrification in the later period could be responsible for cod reduction in studied vssfcws significant reduction in nh4 n concentration e g 55 81 and 50 68 in sbp and sp respectively in the later phase of treatment when cod reduction rate was almost in a steady line see fig 3 further supports this hypothesis comparative analysis of cod removal results in sbp and sp setups revealed that biochar addition improves the cod removal significantly in cws probably through mechanisms like adsorption improving microbial habitations during the acclimatization period extra air space through biochar porous structures etc compared to some previous studies on biochar amended cws table 2 the cod reduction was higher in our study than reported results by gupta et al 21 91 liu et al 34 85 feng et al 13 66 18 77 18 nguyen et al 17 73 and lower than that reports by abedi and mojiri 24 99 9 and zhou et al 12 95 97 the difference could be due to factors like initial wastewater strength cw operation mode wetland plant type cod n ratio of wastewater media type and depth biochar dose and its raw material types plant type in cws 3 1 3 ammonium n removal average influent nh4 n concentration was 19 92 1 32 mg l 1 and that reduced to 3 64 12 56 mg l 1 in the effluent from different vssfcw setups table 1 the trend of nh4 n removal in different vssfcw setups during experimental duration is shown in fig 4 a the maximum reduction in nh4 n load was found of 81 7 sbp followed by 68 7 sp and 52 6 sb f 94 417 p 0 001 for all the three setups the nh4 n content spb was almost steady after 144 h of treatment while in sb and sp setups a sharp declining in nh4 n load was noted until the end of the process suggesting efficient nitrification 2nh4 3o2 2no2 2h2o 4h energy and no2 h2o no3 2h 2e and plant uptake of nh4 n in such systems fig 4 a sbp setup showed about 1 19 and 1 33 times higher nh4 n removal from treated effluent than sb and sp setups respectively indicating the direct role of biochar addition and cw plants as well on nh4 n removal in vssfcw our results of nh4 n dynamics could be explained as follow 1 nh4 n removal during the initial phase of the treatment could be due to microbial oxidation of ammonical n in the oxygen rich environment 11 26 2 apart to nitrification and plant uptake and absorptive removal by biochar could be the possible mechanisms for the fractional removal of nh4 n from wastewater 21 biochar also helps in plants rhizome growth which further facilitates in the rapid removal of nh4 n through plant assimilation 46 3 nh4 n concentration increased slightly in sb 144 h and spb between 144 192 h fig 4 a possibly due to the precipitation or desorption of nh4 ions from substratum medium and biochar vymazal 45 revealed that ammonia n adsorbs loosely on the substrate of a cw and that desorbs to water if water chemistry changes further or biochar surface become saturated thus decrease in nh4 n load in cw could be attributed to the desorption and oxidation of released ammonia simultaneously 37 wetland with plant stand showed the highest nh4 n removal in studied vssfcws than material packed setup i e sb also the n kinetics is always proportionate to the available do loads in cws do concertation below 1 5 mg l 1 inhibits the nitrification process in treatment setups 37 probably this could be a reason for low nh4 n removal by sb setup after 120 h when do was 1 5 mg l 1 see section 3 1 1 45 better nh4 n removal rates in sbp than sp indicate the possible role of biochar in nitrification mechanism probably biochar addition could have improved the conditions for nh4 n oxidizing bacterial communities which plays an important role in nh4 n removal in cws 21 47 the porous structure of biochar improves the growth of microbes responsible for nh4 n removal 48 and atmospheric oxygen diffusion rates in the medium 10 other factors like nitrification rate uptake of nh4 n by the planted vegetation microorganism consortia in cws anoxic zones in biofilm food sources for denitrifying bacteria ammonia volatilization rate exchange of cations for ammonium etc also plays an important role in n metabolism in the cws 4 37 our results of nh4 n reduction were higher than reported results by zhou et al 49 22 14 48 14 and lower than saeed and sun 10 99 6 fan et al 50 96 li et al 51 98 the lower nh4 n removal rates could be due to the no aeration mode of the operation of our setups while in the majority of previous studies the intermittent aeration was applied for enhanced o2 supply in such systems 50 52 the final effluent nh4 n content was within the acceptable limit as decided by the national environmental agency in india for surface disposal of treated effluents table 1 3 1 4 nitrate removal influent no3 n load was 28 06 9 05 mg l 1 and that reduced to 7 55 19 4 mg l 1 after treatment by different setups fig 4b no3 n concentration increased initially up to 72 96 h in all setups then decreased significantly until the end of the process the no3 n increment could be attributed to the initial high oxygen content in vssfcws which possible enhanced no3 n species in the substrate through nitrification processes overall no3 n removal rate was found higher in sbp 81 7 followed by sp 57 6 and sb 30 9 f 6 997 p 0 015 sbp caused 1 30 and 1 13 times higher no3 n removal than sb and sp setup respectively the difference between sbp and sp for overall no3 n removals was not statistically significant anova tukey s t test p 0 421 apart to nitrification and denitrification the adsorption 11 and plant uptake could be other pathways for no3 n removal from wastewater in cws 37 45 the metabolic reactions of nitrifying denitrifying and nitrate ammonifying bacterial communities play an important role in n dynamics in cws 45 but the role of oxygen in the substrate is very crucial during microbial mediated n transformation 39 from data it is concluded that no3 n removal in the sb setup was due to the activities of fermentative and nitrate ammonifying bacterial species which converts most of the no3 n into reduced forms i e n2o n2 nh4 n 45 apart to surface adsorption such microbial transformation could have played a vital role in the rapid removal of no3 n the control setups sb in sbp no3 n reduction was achieved 78 after 72 h of retention while in sp the no3 n reduction was very slow and achieved only 30 58 duration of the whole duration of the treatment do limitation could be ruled out for sp setup therefore the observed difference between sbp and sp for no3 n removal could be due to the adsorptive removal by biochar 10 the adsorbed no3 n on biochar could be temporary storage of n for plant utilities for the later phase of the treatments the high residual no3 n in the effluent from sp 14 95 mg l 1 compared to the sbp effluent strengthens this hypothesis results of no3 n removal in cws were in agreement with kasak et al 11 who have reported significant removal of no3 n in biochar amended horizontal flow surface constructed hfcw wetland system planted with typha latifolia 3 1 5 tn removal and overall n dynamics in different systems the average load of tn in influent was 60 94 9 19 mg l 1 and that reduced to an average level of 34 83 7 46 mg l 1 in sb 15 05 1 75 mg l 1 in sbp and 26 33 5 19 mg l 1 in sp after treatment cycle as shown in fig 4c tn increased slightly after 72 h of retention in sbp and sp but decreased smoothly in sb setups tn increase could be attributed to the rapid degradation of organic substances during initial hours of treatment that possibly added n metabolites in water the maximum tn removal occurred in sbp 74 92 followed by sp 56 13 and sb 42 85 the difference between sb and sp setups was not significant anova turkey s t test p 0 135 for tn removal rates results revealed that biochar in substrate supported the nitrification process in cws by providing a surface to nitrifying bacterial activities and also a porous structures for enriched do load in such setups as well it is hypothesized that a low do in sb might have inhibited the nitrification rate but an anoxic environment in later phases of treatment could reduce the overall n load in wastewater through the denitrification mechanism the role of biochar in n adsorption and then in its removal through nitrification denitrification mechanisms in cws have also been reported by few previous researchers 48 53 overall tn removal rate was found comparatively lower than the other parameters studied e g cod nh4 n no3 n the results of tn removal were similar or higher to results by zhou et al 48 53 and kasak et al 11 9 51 20 who operated batch scale cws without any aeration and lower than that of fan et al 50 86 zhao et al 54 74 li et al 51 90 where intermittent aeration and bioaugmentation was used to boost do in the cws apart to aeration the initial n load and c n ratio of the inlet is also important to determine the performance of a cw 13 45 the aeration or another operation tidal flow could be used as possible mechanisms to improve the n reduction in cws but this would increase the overall cost of the operation 3 1 6 sulphate removal influent average so4 2 concentration was 84 95 3 66 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 12 38 1 72 mg l 1 to 42 28 2 26 mg l 1 with an average reduction rate of 50 3 sb 85 4 sbp and 71 6 sp after completion of the process fig 5 a so4 2 removal rate was statistically significant among different treatment setups f 319 26 p 0 001 so4 2 removal in cws is mainly facilitated by processes like sulfur oxidation by sulfur oxidizing bacteria nitrate reduction process plant uptake precipitating with metal ions chemical oxidation processes dissimilatory sulfate reduction etc 55 56 in sb wastewater so4 2 concentration decreased rapidly up to 72 h of retention followed by a trend of stabilization up to120 h and continuous decrease until the end fig 4a probably rapid adsorption during the initial phase and then desorption in later hours could be the possible reasons for observed results of so4 2 in sb setup in sbp the so4 2 removal became steady after 72 h of retention suggesting saturation of medium and biochar surface for its adsorptive removal a study by chen et al 8 revealed that no3 n reduction in wastewater is coupled with sulfur oxidation in cws leading to simultaneous removal of sulfate and nitrate from water during the aerobic treatments probably high nitrification during initial hours could be responsible for the rapid removal of so4 2 in such systems in sb setup so4 2 reduction could be due to immobilization of reduced sulfide in sediments in the absences of oxygen 57 however in our case the oxygen load in cw was not limiting therefore sulfate removal from wastewater could be due to both chemical oxidation and microbial oxidation processes 55 the slow removal of so4 2 in sp indicates the overall removal mechanism mainly governed by plant uptake and chemical oxidation process while in sbp apart from plant uptake microbial oxidation could have played a vital role in so4 2 removal the porous structures of biochar not only creates air packets in substratum but also provides shelter for sulfur oxidizing bacteria facilitating the rapid removal of so4 2 from wastewater the biochar also adsorbs so4 2 and thus acts as a reservoir of plant nutrients to be taken by the plant in the later phase of treatment in cws few earlier studies have also demonstrated efficient removal of so4 2 in cws mainly driven by nitrate removal mechanism and oxidation by root zone system as well 58 59 3 1 7 phosphate removal po4 3 p concentration decreased from 126 75 2 65 mg l 1 in influent to 38 62 79 5 mg l 1 in the effluent in different vssfcw setups sbp showed the maximum removal rate of 69 5 followed by sp 67 and sb 36 6 f 1144 40 p 0 001 for all data fig 5b results revealed that po4 3 removal was comparatively slow in all vssfcws setups and thus for optimal removal the higher retention time could be required literature suggested a microbial mediated phosphorous transformation plant uptake precipitation adsorption etc as key mechanisms for po4 3 removal from water in cws 19 60 the role of biochar amendment in p removal seems a prime mechanism mainly evidenced by higher po4 3 removal in sb than sp setup ayaz et al 61 reported that zeolites play an important role in po4 3 removal from wastewater thus a type of filling material in cws directly affects the po4 3 removal in cws the higher po4 3 removal in sbp than other setups studied suggested that apart from adsorption the biological transformation plant and microbe uptake might have played an important role in the overall removal of po4 3 from the wastewater microbes inhabitants in the porous structure of biochar thus help in the rapid transformation of available p into microbial biomass p the mesopores in biochar also store dissolve organic substance as a feed for these microbes boosting the p biostabilization as well in such systems 62 reports revealed that planted wetlands uptakes and assimilates p in biomass and helps in significant p removal from water in cws 63 however p removal in cws depends on several factors like biochar properties biochar raw material type pyrolysis mechanism wastewater ph anion diversity and concentration biochar doses temperature etc 11 19 therefore further studies on such aspects can unveil the real mechanism of p removal in studied vssfcws the overall trend of the result was in accordance with previous researchers who have reported significant removal of po4 3 by biochar amended cws 19 21 61 3 2 the fate of total coliforms during wastewater treatment the average load of total coliform in influent was 2512 85 4 mpn 100 m l 1 and that reduced significantly p 0 001 to the average value of 950 mpn 100 ml 1 sb 75 mpn 100 m l 1 sbp and 283 mpn 100 m l 1 sp in the effluent after 10 d treatment cycle the highest reduction in total coliforms population was found 97 01 in sbp followed by 88 76 in sp and 62 2 in sb p 0 001 the trend of reduction in coliforms during treatment is shown in fig 6 and results suggested a continuous decrease in total coliforms population until the end of the treatment process better fitting of the removal trend line in spb r 2 0 70 in sbp than the other two setups indicates consistent removal of total coliforms over the treatment duration in cws primarily ï¬ltration through the porous media seems the key mechanism for coliforms removal from wastewater in the cws 64 the optimal removal of total coliforms in cws can be achieved by the addition of finer materials in substrates and by increasing the hrt as well 37 our results of total coliforms removal were in line with reported results by mbow et al 65 90 and higher than those reported by nguyen et al 17 70 removal of total coliforms in cws is a complex process and several factors like retention time ph do medium texture rhizome root structure influent load affects it sbp setup exhibited the better results of total coliforms population reductions possibly due to biochar addition and appropriate do load in such setups de rozari et al 19 also found the significance of biochar addition on total coliform removal from wastewater while treated by cw a load of total coliforms in the effluent was within the desirable standard decided by the national agency for surface disposal of treated water table 1 suggesting the suitability of effluent for surface disposals 3 3 plant biomass changes and n and p uptake rate in sbp and sp setups plant pigment contents and uptake rate in planted vssfcws sp and spb were analyzed in this study and results are presented in table 3 leaf chlorophyll increased by 25 and 16 7 in plants of sbp and sp setups respectively after 40 d of the treatment period the content of blue pigments xanthophyll carotenes also increased by 18 54 and 25 2 in sbp and sp setups respectively the high content of xanthophyll and carotenes in the leaf of colocasia indicates stress in cw plants triggered possibly by wastewater pollutants and other chemicals in wastewater the difference between sbp and sp for leaf pigments content was statistically significant t test p 0 05 increased chlorophyll content after treatment suggested the assimilation of n in leaf biomass average leaf area in colocasia increased 2 97 and 2 03 folds in sbp and sp respectively indicating significant growth in leaf area mass of experimental plants in cws the maximum aboveground biomass g dm m 2 increase was found in sbp setups 3 44 folds significantly higher than sp 2 58 folds p 0 05 n uptake rate by aboveground plant biomass was found 36 81 g n m 2 in sbp and 27 50 g n m 2 in sp p 0 001 after 40 d of the growth period plant uptake contributes about 50 of total n reduction in cws 45 microbial biomass in sediments microbial biomass n also acts as a sink of n in the cws the n uptake efficiency recorded in this study was in the line with reported results 2 0 29 g n m 2 66 22 88 g n m 2 67 p uptake in aboveground biomass was recorded 12 3 g p m 2 in sbp and 7 8 g p m 2 in sp p 0 001 uptake of p was in the in the same range as reported by vymazal 45 0 01 19 g p m 2 but higher than the reported result of kasak et al 11 2 6 5 g p m 2 overall daily plant uptake rate 0 32 0 55 g n d 1 in colocasia was found to be higher than reported results by sim et al 68 0 155 0 344 g n d 1 in common reed and tube sedge biomass the difference in n and p uptake by cw plants varies significantly among different plant species 45 but other factors like retention period substrate type aeration rate ambient temperature and operation process also plays an important role in the overall uptake of n and p by plant biomass 37 66 biochar addition possibly helped in rapid assimilation of n and p in plant biomass through improved uptake rates for plants in cws de rozeri et al 19 also found a direct role of biochar addition on p uptake rates in a cw 3 4 multivariate analysis multivariate analysis was performed to see the interrelations among cod nh4 n no3 n so4 2 po4 3 tn and do in vssfcws during the treatment process results of pca analysis are described in table 4 based on eigenvalue 1 single component pc 1 in both sb 79 9 variance and sp 75 44 variance while 2 components pc 1 69 35 variance and pc 2 16 17 variance in sbp were identified a strong relationship among wastewater parameters was recorded in both sb and sp vssfcws except to do which showed a weak factor loading in sp a high loading factor of do 0 975 in sb than sp 0 549 setups suggested the significant role of oxygen in the performance of sb in sbp pc1 includes all parameters except to do while in pc2 two factors with 0 5 loadings do and cod were observed after varimax rotation only do remain in pc2 of sbp setup this indicates that the concentration of wastewater pollutants over the treatment period is governed by do as well as other processes like precipitation sedimentation plant up and desorption cluster analysis results are presented in fig 1s supplementary section cluster analysis results showed two major clusters a cod and b all other parameters in sb and sp setups in sb cluster b divided into two sub clusters b1 po4 3 and b2 all others in this cluster nh4 n do and no3 n showed close association indicating nitrification as minor mechanism for n dynamics in this setup so4 2 removal can be driven by accumulation or through precipitations cluster b in sp further divided into sub cluster b1 nh4 n and do and b2 all other parameters indicating the direct role of do in nh4 n removal in this setup b2 sub cluster of po4 3 in sp showed the distance from rest of the parameters indicating different removal mechanism such as plant uptake in sbp two major clusters formed cluster a do in nh4 n and cluster b that further formed two sub clusters b1 cod and b2 all other wastewater parameters in this system tn no3 n po4 3 and so4 2 have a distinct route of removal possibly through adsorption precipitation or plant uptake while cod was mainly removed through aerobic degradation process the correlation matrix results indicate significant relationships among all parameters in sb and sp except to do no3 n in sp while in sbp there was a significant relationship among all wastewater parameters except to do table 2s 3 5 characterization of cow dung biochar 3 5 1 chemical characteristics the physical and chemical characteristics of cow dung biochar are presented in table 1s supplementary section the ph of biochar was alkali i e 9 5 mainly due to releasing of alkali species during combustion of biomass but high ph of biochar does not affect the substrate chemistry because most of the salts drain out during the 70 d of acclimatization period in studied vssfcws the bulk density water holding capacity and porosity of cow dung biochar was 0 05 g cm3 80 and 0 36 respectively proximate analysis showed the content of 3 23 moisture 28 49 ash 55 86 volatile matter and 12 421 fixed carbon comparable to the biochar prepared from wheat straw corn straw rice straw soybean straw and rape straw table 3s supplementary section the fixed carbon content in cow dung biochar as compared to other plant straw biochar indicates its suitability for application in wastewater treatment processes as lowcost substance 3 5 2 biochar surface morphology and ftir analysis as shown in fig 7 sem images indicate that initial biochar composed of layered flake like structures with large pores in between the morphology of biochar was smooth and compact with irregularly shaped particles of large surface area after treatment adhering deposited particles can be seen on biochar surface indicating the significant role of biochar in improved removal efficiencies in biochar added cws ftir spectrum fig 7 of raw biochar used in this study indicates the functionals groups assigned to respective peaks as ch out of plane 870 and 992 cm 1 po 1223 cm 1 c h plane bend 1318 cm 1 so 1406 cm 1 aromatic c cc 1573 cm 1 cn 1639 cm 1 ch methylene 2307 2884 cm 1 polymeric oh stretch 3388 cm 1 oh hydroxyl 3235 3700 cm 1 after treatment the peaks reduced significantly especially in spectral areas ranged between 1300 to 1600 cm 1 3000 to 3600 cm 1 and 2300 to 2600 cm 1 both in sbp and sp setups the spectral variability between sbp and sp setups also indicates the different adsorption rate in biochar used in these two setups hydroxyl oh zone showed the highest decrease in peak suggesting the major sink of ionic molecules from wastewater mainly facilitated by hydroxyl reactive groups in sbp the reactive groups at 991 993 ch out of plane acted as prominent reactive groups for adsorptive removals of nutrients from wastewater as compared to the biochar from sp setup 4 conclusions in summary colocasia based vssfcw showed high efficiency for removal of cod n load no3 n nh4 n and tn so4 2 po4 3 after amending with cattle dung biochar tn removal was in the ranges of 56 13 74 92 which can be further improved by introducing the aeration in setups cod reduction was achieved 89 9 92 6 in this study which seems comparable to cws with conventional plant stands like a reed cattails etc results revealed that biochar addition in vssfcw not only improves the oxidative removal of nh4 n so4 2 and po4 3 but also helps in further plant uptakes our data showed better plant uptake rate for n and p comparable to the reported results by previous researchers on cw performance assessment using wetland plant other than colocasia total coliforms reduced by 88 76 97 01 in planted setups than non planted setups 62 2 the treated wastewater by vssfcws showed ranges of water parameters within the discharge standards set by the national environmental agency of india results suggested that cattle dung biochar could be a suitable substitute for wood based biochar for wastewater treatment operations further studies can be

13518,the efficiency of colocasia as well as cattle dung biochar addition in a constructed wetland is not well documented in published literature in this study colocasia esculenta based vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw packed with heterogonous gravels and cattle dung biochar was established to examine the removal of nitrate no3 n ammonium n nh4 n sulfate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 chemical oxygen demand cod total n tn and total coliforms from domestic wastewater to achieve the goal three setups of vssfcws sb medium biochar 10 v v sbp medium biochar colocasia sp medium colocasia were established and wastewater characteristics ph do no3 n nh4 n tn so4 2 po4 3 cod and total coliforms were monitored after each 24 h interval for 40 d after 70 d of initial acclimatization of the setups sbp showed the highest average removal efficiency for cod 92 6 no3 n 81 7 nh4 n 81 2 so4 2 85 4 po4 3 69 5 total coliforms 97 than sb and sp during of the 40 d treatment period plant uptake rate was also measured and biochar amended vssfcw showed the highest values of leaf area biomass growth 2 58 3 44 folds n uptake 36 81 g n m 2 and p uptake rate 12 3 g p m 2 than sp setup the treated domestic wastewater by biochar amended vssfcws compliance with the limit set by the national pollution monitoring agency of india role of aeration and varying wastewater strength especially cod load in the performance of colocasia based cws could be undertaken as a research problem for future studies to develop an efficient engineered wetland system for on site wastewater treatment keywords constructed wetlands cod nitrification low cost technology bod coliforms 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are engineered structures designed and operated based on natural wetland principles to treat wastewater from various anthropogenic sources like urban sewage water industrial effluents agriculture and urban runoff water landfill leachates 1 3 in the recent past cws has attracted the attention of policymakers due to the low operation cost and convenience to operate for designing nature based onsite wastewater operations 2 4 cw is found to be efficient in the removal of a variety of organic and inorganic pollutants e g bod cod nitrogen phosphorous potassium sulfate heavy metal industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals residues etc from wastewater through mechanisms like microbial degradation plant uptake chemical oxidation adsorption filtration biological precipitation volatilization and biostabilization 1 4 5 apart to remediation of pollutants from wastewater cws also habitat aquatic organisms improve groundwater recharge rate helps to control urban floods and also generate food resources for human and other organisms 3 6 various factors govern the functioning of cws but carbon content in substrate plays an important role in the microbial colonization and their functioning in such systems gagnon et al 7 found that the addition of external carbon sources in the cw system could improve the nitrogen removal efficiency by 95 in another study chen et al 8 revealed that the high carbon content in cws substrate not only improves the sulfur mineralization efficiently but also helps in simultaneous removal of nitrate from wastewater through sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification connecting sulfur oxidation to nitrate reduction process during nitrification and denitrification in cws the microbes use organic carbon as energy sources that further improves the overall nitrogen reduction rate during the treatment process 9 the commonly used materials for cw substrate e g gravels sand and other zeolites generally lack carbon contents thereby shows low efficiency to remove wastewater nutrient in such engineered systems 10 to overcome this problem biochar could be a valuable source of carbon to improve the overall functioning of engineered wetland systems in the recent past there have been increasing interest in the uses of biochar in cws to improve its efficiency 11 13 biochar is a carbon rich porous material mainly obtained from thermochemical degradation of plant biomass in an oxygen deficient environment apart to a rich source of carbon biochar also contains several nutrients in mineral forms k na ca mg fe and other elements which could act as a plant as well as microbial growth promoting substances in the cws 14 15 biochar exhibits high porosity and surface area that helps in adsorptive removal of charged molecules from wastewater microbial propagation in the substrate and accelerating the redox reactions if applied in a suitable amount in a cw 3 16 the effect of biochar addition on cw working efficiency has been reported by various previous researchers for example kasak et al 11 in their study found that biochar aided cws to show better removal of tn and total phosphorous 20 2 and 22 5 respectively than control setup of the substrate without biochar 13 7 and 16 2 respectively they concluded that biochar could be an advantageous substance in the cw system for enhancement of treatment efficiency of such systems nguyen et al 17 have reported the significant removal of total suspended solids tss cod biological oxygen demand bod nh4 n and total coliform by 71 73 79 91 and 70 respectively in the vertical flow and free water surface cw amended with biochar prepared from pyrolysis of acacia auriculiformis bark at 500 c the removal efficiency was better in those setups which were spiked with biochar in the substrate meng et al 18 investigated the efficiency of a non aerated vertical baffled flow cw spiked with biochar made from a composite material dewatered sludge food waste rice straw and mature compost and they found the significant improvement in removal rate of cod 83 3 nh4 n 95 9 tn 28 total phosphorus 59 5 from domestic sewage while treated with cw de rozari et al 19 have reported about 71 87 81 93 and 65 79 removal rates for tn no3 n and nh4 n load from sewage water treated with a cw containing different amount of biochar hardwood biochar made at 500 c in the substrate guo et al 20 found in their study that addition of zeolite and biochar in verticle flow cw was significantly improved the removal of biogas slurry pollutants and a higher arsenic as removal in cw was noted in the setup with biochar than control without biochar setups it was found in recent studies that addition of biochar in traditional cw system was beneficial in terms of improved root aeration increased root porosity enhancing nh3 n metabolism in rhizomes through plant metabolism and root adsorption process 1 3 4 zhou et al 2 found much higher removal of cod 92 nh3 n 50 and tn 50 from high c n wastewater in a subsurface flow cw amended with biochar however in the majority of previous studies researchers used biochar made of wood and other plant derived substances like tree wood 21 22 bamboo 12 23 crop residues 24 hemp fibres 25 for cw operations since wood and plant derived materials could be utilized for some other applications and industrial productions rather than using as feedstock for biochar production using wood and plant substances for biochar production doesn t seem a resource efficient energy saving and economically viable option under the circular economy system therefore effectors are being made worldwide by the scientific community to find alternate feedstock for biochar preparation for decontamination of wastewater resources 26 27 crop residues could be used as feed for livestock cultivation and production of industrial chemicals fibres and biomanure in the recent past few studies suggested the use of some community waste materials sewage faecal and industrial sludges and animal excreta as a feedstock for the production of low cost biochar for environmental applications 27 28 animal waste dung contains a high amount of carbon and various other nutrients and regardless of such unique properties it is hardly taken as feedstock for biochar preparation although few recent studies indicated the suitability of animal waste as a source for activated carbon production 27 29 cattle dung is a low cost and easily available material for biochar preparation and could help in cutting the overall cost of environmental management operations recent studies indicate the potential of cattle dung biochar in soil fertility improvements 30 adsorptive removal of industrial pollutants from the aqueous medium 31 reclaiming nutrients from wastewater 8 biogas quality improvement in the anaerobic digester 27 antibacterial agents for bacterial decontamination 29 but to the best of the authors knowledge cattle dung biochar potential in cw operation is rarely investigated by any previous researcher the literature review suggested that cattle dung biochar could be a rich source of carbon and soil nutrients na k ca and elements for optimal growth of microbes and plant in engineered wetland systems for enhanced removal of pollutants from wastewater therefore this study aimed to investigate the potential of vssfcw setups amended with cow dung biochar for effective treatment of domestic wastewater under ambient conditions the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the role of colocasia based vssfcw in the removal of chemical pollutants cod nitrogen tn nh4 n and no3 n po4 3 and so4 2 as well as biological contamination total coliform bacteria from domestic wastewater 2 to determine the role of substrate materials in removal mechanism 3 determining the optimal hydraulic retention time hrt for the efficient removal of wastewater pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 cattle dung biochar preparation and characterization for biochar preparation fresh and dried cattle dung pats were procured from a local animal farm dried further at 80 c for 24 h to remove the moisture and then pyrolysed at 400 c for 4 h heating rate was 26 5 c min 1 in a muffle furnace under an anaerobic condition by following the procedure described by joseph et al 32 the literature review suggested that slow pyrolysis could be energy efficient carbonization of biomass to produce carbon and nutrient rich n k ca p etc biochar 27 32 slow pyrolysis also helps in retaining soil nutrients which could be valuable for plant and microbial growth in cws charred dung pats were cooled at room temperature in a desiccator powdered and sieved to particle size 0 25 1 mm biochar was analyzed for various physicochemical characteristics surface morphology surface reactive groups porosity water holding capacity bulk density ph electrical conductivity ash content fixed carbon and volatile matter and results are shown in table 1s 2 2 experimental setup preparation three mesoscale vssfcws sb sbp and sp were operated at solid liquid waste treatment laboratory doon university dehradun india to compare the results of removal of wastewater pollutants in different types of cw setups sb a control setups was run to see the role of filling substrate of cw in removal mechanism through adsorption and oxidation processes all setups were prepared in a plastic container of 30 l capacity Ã¸ 33 5 cm and 37 cm height with the same configuration in all vssfcws a composite multidimensional substrate of 40 cm depth composed of the four layers of different bed frames was used the substrate depth affects the nitrification and oxygen supply in deep layers of vfsscws therefore the depth of the substrate was kept 40 cm including 15 cm top layers of plant rhizome to ensure the proper oxygen supply in the bottom layers of the cw medium the schematic diagram of a vssfcw setup is shown in fig 1 bed frame size of gravel reduced from bottom to top for better aeration included boulders Ã¸ 20 21 mm to a depth of 5 cm above it a coarse gravel Ã¸ 8 12 mm layer of 10 cm a layer of fine gravels Ã¸ 4 6 mm of 10 cm a topmost layer rhizome layer of a homogenized mixture of biochar 0 25 1 mm particle size and final layer of the river bottom sand of 15 cm fig 1 biochar was applied in a dose of 10 v v of the top layer material as suggested in the published literature 11 the inlet pipe of vfsscw was placed in the rhizome part of colocasia the plant used for cw to pour wastewater in setups during the experimental period we operated experimental vfsscws with the minimum energy inputs without mechanical aeration operated under a batch flow system as a low cost operating system for domestic wastewater treatment for the need of rural areas all vfsscws were initially acclimatized for 70 d and the formal experiment began thereafter further operated for 40 days august to november 2019 to track the changes in wastewater parameters during the experimental period sbp and sp setups were planted with colocasia esculenta elephant ear of similar height at a density of about 10 rhizomes per setup genus colocasia is native to asia and belongs to family araceae in colocasia leaves are generally large 30 150 cm of sagittate shape and it is found commonly at marshy lands and muddy river banks we selected colocasia esculenta for cw setups due to its peculiar properties like 1 available locally and shows high adaptability to the changing environment 2 having a high survival rate in polluted water 3 showing a strong efficiency to remove water pollutants 17 4 having a high photosynthetic rate mainly due to very large leaf sizes for experimentation young specimens of colocasia esculenta were collected from the doon university campus acclimatized in the lab for 2 weeks in hoagland medium before planting to experimental setups after acclimatization plants were shown in experimental setups sbp and sp and further irrigated for 5 wk until the plant stand established properly in setups before plantations of colocasia in vssfcws about 1 kg sewage sludge procured from secondary sedimentary sludge tank of a local wastewater treatment plant stp was inoculated in the rhizome layer to develop a microbial community in the vssfcws 33 the experiment was performed using urban sewage water with an hrt of 10 d under ambient environmental conditions 24 25 8 c and natural sunlight 2 3 experimental operation conditions for experimentation the wastewater was collected from an inlet of a mothrowala stp near university campus dehradun india the wastewater was collected in the large plastic jerrican 10 l using an autosampler for continuously 2 wk and all collected wastewater was then mixed tougher to get representative wastewater strength for experimental work the characteristics of influent used for experiment work are given in table 1 four continuous treatment cycles each of 10 d duration were performed to get the significant data for vssfcw performance evaluation from each experimental setup the outlet sample was collected at 24 48 72 96 120 144 168 192 216 and 240 h of operation by the following method by liu et al 34 after completion of a cycle the wastewater was drained from the bottom outlet and new wastewater lot was loaded in vssfcws after each cycle the outlet was kept open for 8 10 h to replenished the setups with oxygen supply 35 the wastewater was loaded gradually 30 45 min in all setups without causing overflow and the hrt counting was started after complete loading of wastewater in vssfcws 2 4 wastewater sampling and analytical procedures during each trial influent 0 d and effluent 24 48 72 96 120 144 168 192 216 and 240 h samples were collected in the evening hours from each vssfcw setup the outlet sample 150 ml was collected in three batches with 15 min gap and all outlet samples were mixed to get a reliable sample for analysis of wastewater parameters the characteristics of wastewater ph cod tn nh4 n no3 n po4 3 so4 2 total coliforms and do were estimated using standard methods as described in apha 36 total coliforms in influent and effluent were analyzed by following multiple tube fermentation technique do concentration in influent after loading to setups and effluent at different retention time was determined with a do meter hq40d hach usa all standards and solutions were prepared in ar grade chemicals with 99 purity mostly provided by merck india 2 5 statistical analysis all results were expressed as a mean of four trials with standard deviation one way anova was used to compare the statistically significant difference among vssfcws for per cent removal turkey s multiple ranged tests were also performed to identify the homogenous sub setups of the mean value for different parameters statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss 20 spss inc chicago usa and statistica software package multivariate analysis including principal component analysis pca cluster analysis and pearsons correlation matrix was also performed to see the interrelationships among the wastewater parameters studied results were considered significant at p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in wastewater chemistry in different vssfcws 3 1 1 ph and do the initial average ph of the wastewater was 8 15 0 56 and that changed to 8 62 in sb 7 41 in sbp and 7 06 in sp at the end of the treatment the ph of outlet increased slightly after 24 h of retention in both biochar setups sb and sbp thereafter it decreased gradually until the end of the treatment process except to a slight increase after 144 h in sb in sp ph decreased continuously until the end of the treatment cycle fig 2 a results of ph change are similar to the finding of liu et al 34 and kasak et al 11 who have reported an initial increase in wastewater ph possibly due to dissolutions of salts from biochar ph range of influent was within the acceptable range 6 8 required for the optimal growth of nitrifying and other associated aerobic communities in the cw the ph dynamics in experimental vssfcws could be explained as follow 1 ph shifting attributed to the changes in the concentration of carbonates bicarbonates ammonia slat hydroxyls and other organic metabolites generated during the degradation of organic substances in wastewater in the aerobic treatment processes 37 2 in sbp and sp the release of hydrogen ions h could be responsible for an overall reduction in ph of the outlet the uptake of nh4 ions by plant roots and nitrification process 2nh4 3o2 2no2 2h2o 4h energy and no2 h2o no3 2h 2e generates h 38 which probably caused a shift in the ph of water 3 probably accumulation of nh4 ions during the later anaerobic phase of sb when do was 1 5 mg l 1 after 144 h could be responsible for the increased ph in sb setup the dynamic in the do level in different vssfcws setups are shown in fig 2 b do in inlet after loading of wastewater ranged between 5 78 and 6 78 mg l 1 suggesting a significant level of do at the time of loading of wastewater in experimental setups in sb setup the do level decreases rapidly and reached to a level below the limitation 1 5 mg l 1 after 144 h required for nitrification process 37 39 in cws in sbp setup the do level increased rapidly until 72 h followed by a slow increase between 96 h and 168 h and a constant decrease in the later period of the treatment the increment in do levels could be attributed to the release of oxygen by the root zone system in the sbp setups results of do increment in cws were in agreement with nguyen et al 17 and oovel et al 40 who have reported an increase in do level in cws during the treatment process mainly contributed by plant stand in such systems planted vssfcws showed the do levels in the ranges of 4 63 to 3 07 mg l 1 average 4 07 0 50 mg l 1 in sbp and 4 64 to 3 58 mg l 1 average 3 96 0 39 mg l 1 in sp setups during the treatment indicating the direct role of plant stand in oxygen supply in the cws a better do level in sbp than sp could be attributed to the biochar addition which might have facilitated the system in do enrichments due to their porous morphology of the biochar the cracks and holes in biochar create a suitable space for do retention in such systems 12 20 do level in the effluent was 0 70 mg l 1 in sb while in sbp and sp setups it was relatively in the higher range 3 07 and 3 58 mg l 1 respectively do 1 5 mg l 1 promotes rapid nitrification through aerobic denitrifies in cws 37 during the photosynthesis plant release oxygen in rhizomes part of the cws which is further utilized by root respiration process about half of it and rest in organic matter oxidations process 41 42 results indicate that biochar addition could be a valuable approach to enhance the do level in cws for improvement of rapid oxidative removal of wastewater pollutants during the treatment by cws 3 1 2 cod removal cod removal from wastewater mainly depends on two factors i e metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria and the kinetics of the oxidative reactions in the treatment setups average influent cod was 326 25 mg l 1 and that decreased to a range of 33 82 108 5 mg l 1 after treatment by different vssfcws table 1 the maximum cod reduction of 92 6 was recorded in sbp 72 h followed by 89 9 sp at 96 h and 47 7 sb at 72 h f 50 216 p 0 001 fig 3 a ii the difference between sp and sb setups for cod removal rate was not statistically significant anova tukey s t test p 0 123 as shown in fig 3a iii the maximum cod reduction occurred after 72 120 h of retention in studied vssfcw setups suggesting the aerobic degradation as the prime mechanism for the cod removal the low removal of cod in sb could be attributed to the do limitations in such setups fig 3 b it is found that limited oxygen in cws suppresses the activities of heterotrophic microbial communities which plays an important role in the removal of cod from wastewater 43 the dynamics of cod in different vssfcws is described in fig 3a i the cod load increased from 152 57 190 67 mg l 1 between 96 120 h and 25 52 42 87 mg l 1 after 96 h in sb and sbp setups respectively but after that the cod decreased considerably until the end of the process in both setups the cod dynamics in vssfcws could be explained as follow 1 oxygen consumption by nitrate reaction during the anoxic degradation of organic matter should be responsible for cod increment 2 the leaching of soluble carbon from biochar might have contributed in the overall load of cod in wastewater 44 in cws strong competition between organic matter degradation and nitrification rate for oxygen consumption plays an important role in cod dynamics in the system 34 42 45 it is presumed that the aerobic degradation of organic matter during the initial phase 72 96 h while nitrification in the later period could be responsible for cod reduction in studied vssfcws significant reduction in nh4 n concentration e g 55 81 and 50 68 in sbp and sp respectively in the later phase of treatment when cod reduction rate was almost in a steady line see fig 3 further supports this hypothesis comparative analysis of cod removal results in sbp and sp setups revealed that biochar addition improves the cod removal significantly in cws probably through mechanisms like adsorption improving microbial habitations during the acclimatization period extra air space through biochar porous structures etc compared to some previous studies on biochar amended cws table 2 the cod reduction was higher in our study than reported results by gupta et al 21 91 liu et al 34 85 feng et al 13 66 18 77 18 nguyen et al 17 73 and lower than that reports by abedi and mojiri 24 99 9 and zhou et al 12 95 97 the difference could be due to factors like initial wastewater strength cw operation mode wetland plant type cod n ratio of wastewater media type and depth biochar dose and its raw material types plant type in cws 3 1 3 ammonium n removal average influent nh4 n concentration was 19 92 1 32 mg l 1 and that reduced to 3 64 12 56 mg l 1 in the effluent from different vssfcw setups table 1 the trend of nh4 n removal in different vssfcw setups during experimental duration is shown in fig 4 a the maximum reduction in nh4 n load was found of 81 7 sbp followed by 68 7 sp and 52 6 sb f 94 417 p 0 001 for all the three setups the nh4 n content spb was almost steady after 144 h of treatment while in sb and sp setups a sharp declining in nh4 n load was noted until the end of the process suggesting efficient nitrification 2nh4 3o2 2no2 2h2o 4h energy and no2 h2o no3 2h 2e and plant uptake of nh4 n in such systems fig 4 a sbp setup showed about 1 19 and 1 33 times higher nh4 n removal from treated effluent than sb and sp setups respectively indicating the direct role of biochar addition and cw plants as well on nh4 n removal in vssfcw our results of nh4 n dynamics could be explained as follow 1 nh4 n removal during the initial phase of the treatment could be due to microbial oxidation of ammonical n in the oxygen rich environment 11 26 2 apart to nitrification and plant uptake and absorptive removal by biochar could be the possible mechanisms for the fractional removal of nh4 n from wastewater 21 biochar also helps in plants rhizome growth which further facilitates in the rapid removal of nh4 n through plant assimilation 46 3 nh4 n concentration increased slightly in sb 144 h and spb between 144 192 h fig 4 a possibly due to the precipitation or desorption of nh4 ions from substratum medium and biochar vymazal 45 revealed that ammonia n adsorbs loosely on the substrate of a cw and that desorbs to water if water chemistry changes further or biochar surface become saturated thus decrease in nh4 n load in cw could be attributed to the desorption and oxidation of released ammonia simultaneously 37 wetland with plant stand showed the highest nh4 n removal in studied vssfcws than material packed setup i e sb also the n kinetics is always proportionate to the available do loads in cws do concertation below 1 5 mg l 1 inhibits the nitrification process in treatment setups 37 probably this could be a reason for low nh4 n removal by sb setup after 120 h when do was 1 5 mg l 1 see section 3 1 1 45 better nh4 n removal rates in sbp than sp indicate the possible role of biochar in nitrification mechanism probably biochar addition could have improved the conditions for nh4 n oxidizing bacterial communities which plays an important role in nh4 n removal in cws 21 47 the porous structure of biochar improves the growth of microbes responsible for nh4 n removal 48 and atmospheric oxygen diffusion rates in the medium 10 other factors like nitrification rate uptake of nh4 n by the planted vegetation microorganism consortia in cws anoxic zones in biofilm food sources for denitrifying bacteria ammonia volatilization rate exchange of cations for ammonium etc also plays an important role in n metabolism in the cws 4 37 our results of nh4 n reduction were higher than reported results by zhou et al 49 22 14 48 14 and lower than saeed and sun 10 99 6 fan et al 50 96 li et al 51 98 the lower nh4 n removal rates could be due to the no aeration mode of the operation of our setups while in the majority of previous studies the intermittent aeration was applied for enhanced o2 supply in such systems 50 52 the final effluent nh4 n content was within the acceptable limit as decided by the national environmental agency in india for surface disposal of treated effluents table 1 3 1 4 nitrate removal influent no3 n load was 28 06 9 05 mg l 1 and that reduced to 7 55 19 4 mg l 1 after treatment by different setups fig 4b no3 n concentration increased initially up to 72 96 h in all setups then decreased significantly until the end of the process the no3 n increment could be attributed to the initial high oxygen content in vssfcws which possible enhanced no3 n species in the substrate through nitrification processes overall no3 n removal rate was found higher in sbp 81 7 followed by sp 57 6 and sb 30 9 f 6 997 p 0 015 sbp caused 1 30 and 1 13 times higher no3 n removal than sb and sp setup respectively the difference between sbp and sp for overall no3 n removals was not statistically significant anova tukey s t test p 0 421 apart to nitrification and denitrification the adsorption 11 and plant uptake could be other pathways for no3 n removal from wastewater in cws 37 45 the metabolic reactions of nitrifying denitrifying and nitrate ammonifying bacterial communities play an important role in n dynamics in cws 45 but the role of oxygen in the substrate is very crucial during microbial mediated n transformation 39 from data it is concluded that no3 n removal in the sb setup was due to the activities of fermentative and nitrate ammonifying bacterial species which converts most of the no3 n into reduced forms i e n2o n2 nh4 n 45 apart to surface adsorption such microbial transformation could have played a vital role in the rapid removal of no3 n the control setups sb in sbp no3 n reduction was achieved 78 after 72 h of retention while in sp the no3 n reduction was very slow and achieved only 30 58 duration of the whole duration of the treatment do limitation could be ruled out for sp setup therefore the observed difference between sbp and sp for no3 n removal could be due to the adsorptive removal by biochar 10 the adsorbed no3 n on biochar could be temporary storage of n for plant utilities for the later phase of the treatments the high residual no3 n in the effluent from sp 14 95 mg l 1 compared to the sbp effluent strengthens this hypothesis results of no3 n removal in cws were in agreement with kasak et al 11 who have reported significant removal of no3 n in biochar amended horizontal flow surface constructed hfcw wetland system planted with typha latifolia 3 1 5 tn removal and overall n dynamics in different systems the average load of tn in influent was 60 94 9 19 mg l 1 and that reduced to an average level of 34 83 7 46 mg l 1 in sb 15 05 1 75 mg l 1 in sbp and 26 33 5 19 mg l 1 in sp after treatment cycle as shown in fig 4c tn increased slightly after 72 h of retention in sbp and sp but decreased smoothly in sb setups tn increase could be attributed to the rapid degradation of organic substances during initial hours of treatment that possibly added n metabolites in water the maximum tn removal occurred in sbp 74 92 followed by sp 56 13 and sb 42 85 the difference between sb and sp setups was not significant anova turkey s t test p 0 135 for tn removal rates results revealed that biochar in substrate supported the nitrification process in cws by providing a surface to nitrifying bacterial activities and also a porous structures for enriched do load in such setups as well it is hypothesized that a low do in sb might have inhibited the nitrification rate but an anoxic environment in later phases of treatment could reduce the overall n load in wastewater through the denitrification mechanism the role of biochar in n adsorption and then in its removal through nitrification denitrification mechanisms in cws have also been reported by few previous researchers 48 53 overall tn removal rate was found comparatively lower than the other parameters studied e g cod nh4 n no3 n the results of tn removal were similar or higher to results by zhou et al 48 53 and kasak et al 11 9 51 20 who operated batch scale cws without any aeration and lower than that of fan et al 50 86 zhao et al 54 74 li et al 51 90 where intermittent aeration and bioaugmentation was used to boost do in the cws apart to aeration the initial n load and c n ratio of the inlet is also important to determine the performance of a cw 13 45 the aeration or another operation tidal flow could be used as possible mechanisms to improve the n reduction in cws but this would increase the overall cost of the operation 3 1 6 sulphate removal influent average so4 2 concentration was 84 95 3 66 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 12 38 1 72 mg l 1 to 42 28 2 26 mg l 1 with an average reduction rate of 50 3 sb 85 4 sbp and 71 6 sp after completion of the process fig 5 a so4 2 removal rate was statistically significant among different treatment setups f 319 26 p 0 001 so4 2 removal in cws is mainly facilitated by processes like sulfur oxidation by sulfur oxidizing bacteria nitrate reduction process plant uptake precipitating with metal ions chemical oxidation processes dissimilatory sulfate reduction etc 55 56 in sb wastewater so4 2 concentration decreased rapidly up to 72 h of retention followed by a trend of stabilization up to120 h and continuous decrease until the end fig 4a probably rapid adsorption during the initial phase and then desorption in later hours could be the possible reasons for observed results of so4 2 in sb setup in sbp the so4 2 removal became steady after 72 h of retention suggesting saturation of medium and biochar surface for its adsorptive removal a study by chen et al 8 revealed that no3 n reduction in wastewater is coupled with sulfur oxidation in cws leading to simultaneous removal of sulfate and nitrate from water during the aerobic treatments probably high nitrification during initial hours could be responsible for the rapid removal of so4 2 in such systems in sb setup so4 2 reduction could be due to immobilization of reduced sulfide in sediments in the absences of oxygen 57 however in our case the oxygen load in cw was not limiting therefore sulfate removal from wastewater could be due to both chemical oxidation and microbial oxidation processes 55 the slow removal of so4 2 in sp indicates the overall removal mechanism mainly governed by plant uptake and chemical oxidation process while in sbp apart from plant uptake microbial oxidation could have played a vital role in so4 2 removal the porous structures of biochar not only creates air packets in substratum but also provides shelter for sulfur oxidizing bacteria facilitating the rapid removal of so4 2 from wastewater the biochar also adsorbs so4 2 and thus acts as a reservoir of plant nutrients to be taken by the plant in the later phase of treatment in cws few earlier studies have also demonstrated efficient removal of so4 2 in cws mainly driven by nitrate removal mechanism and oxidation by root zone system as well 58 59 3 1 7 phosphate removal po4 3 p concentration decreased from 126 75 2 65 mg l 1 in influent to 38 62 79 5 mg l 1 in the effluent in different vssfcw setups sbp showed the maximum removal rate of 69 5 followed by sp 67 and sb 36 6 f 1144 40 p 0 001 for all data fig 5b results revealed that po4 3 removal was comparatively slow in all vssfcws setups and thus for optimal removal the higher retention time could be required literature suggested a microbial mediated phosphorous transformation plant uptake precipitation adsorption etc as key mechanisms for po4 3 removal from water in cws 19 60 the role of biochar amendment in p removal seems a prime mechanism mainly evidenced by higher po4 3 removal in sb than sp setup ayaz et al 61 reported that zeolites play an important role in po4 3 removal from wastewater thus a type of filling material in cws directly affects the po4 3 removal in cws the higher po4 3 removal in sbp than other setups studied suggested that apart from adsorption the biological transformation plant and microbe uptake might have played an important role in the overall removal of po4 3 from the wastewater microbes inhabitants in the porous structure of biochar thus help in the rapid transformation of available p into microbial biomass p the mesopores in biochar also store dissolve organic substance as a feed for these microbes boosting the p biostabilization as well in such systems 62 reports revealed that planted wetlands uptakes and assimilates p in biomass and helps in significant p removal from water in cws 63 however p removal in cws depends on several factors like biochar properties biochar raw material type pyrolysis mechanism wastewater ph anion diversity and concentration biochar doses temperature etc 11 19 therefore further studies on such aspects can unveil the real mechanism of p removal in studied vssfcws the overall trend of the result was in accordance with previous researchers who have reported significant removal of po4 3 by biochar amended cws 19 21 61 3 2 the fate of total coliforms during wastewater treatment the average load of total coliform in influent was 2512 85 4 mpn 100 m l 1 and that reduced significantly p 0 001 to the average value of 950 mpn 100 ml 1 sb 75 mpn 100 m l 1 sbp and 283 mpn 100 m l 1 sp in the effluent after 10 d treatment cycle the highest reduction in total coliforms population was found 97 01 in sbp followed by 88 76 in sp and 62 2 in sb p 0 001 the trend of reduction in coliforms during treatment is shown in fig 6 and results suggested a continuous decrease in total coliforms population until the end of the treatment process better fitting of the removal trend line in spb r 2 0 70 in sbp than the other two setups indicates consistent removal of total coliforms over the treatment duration in cws primarily ï¬ltration through the porous media seems the key mechanism for coliforms removal from wastewater in the cws 64 the optimal removal of total coliforms in cws can be achieved by the addition of finer materials in substrates and by increasing the hrt as well 37 our results of total coliforms removal were in line with reported results by mbow et al 65 90 and higher than those reported by nguyen et al 17 70 removal of total coliforms in cws is a complex process and several factors like retention time ph do medium texture rhizome root structure influent load affects it sbp setup exhibited the better results of total coliforms population reductions possibly due to biochar addition and appropriate do load in such setups de rozari et al 19 also found the significance of biochar addition on total coliform removal from wastewater while treated by cw a load of total coliforms in the effluent was within the desirable standard decided by the national agency for surface disposal of treated water table 1 suggesting the suitability of effluent for surface disposals 3 3 plant biomass changes and n and p uptake rate in sbp and sp setups plant pigment contents and uptake rate in planted vssfcws sp and spb were analyzed in this study and results are presented in table 3 leaf chlorophyll increased by 25 and 16 7 in plants of sbp and sp setups respectively after 40 d of the treatment period the content of blue pigments xanthophyll carotenes also increased by 18 54 and 25 2 in sbp and sp setups respectively the high content of xanthophyll and carotenes in the leaf of colocasia indicates stress in cw plants triggered possibly by wastewater pollutants and other chemicals in wastewater the difference between sbp and sp for leaf pigments content was statistically significant t test p 0 05 increased chlorophyll content after treatment suggested the assimilation of n in leaf biomass average leaf area in colocasia increased 2 97 and 2 03 folds in sbp and sp respectively indicating significant growth in leaf area mass of experimental plants in cws the maximum aboveground biomass g dm m 2 increase was found in sbp setups 3 44 folds significantly higher than sp 2 58 folds p 0 05 n uptake rate by aboveground plant biomass was found 36 81 g n m 2 in sbp and 27 50 g n m 2 in sp p 0 001 after 40 d of the growth period plant uptake contributes about 50 of total n reduction in cws 45 microbial biomass in sediments microbial biomass n also acts as a sink of n in the cws the n uptake efficiency recorded in this study was in the line with reported results 2 0 29 g n m 2 66 22 88 g n m 2 67 p uptake in aboveground biomass was recorded 12 3 g p m 2 in sbp and 7 8 g p m 2 in sp p 0 001 uptake of p was in the in the same range as reported by vymazal 45 0 01 19 g p m 2 but higher than the reported result of kasak et al 11 2 6 5 g p m 2 overall daily plant uptake rate 0 32 0 55 g n d 1 in colocasia was found to be higher than reported results by sim et al 68 0 155 0 344 g n d 1 in common reed and tube sedge biomass the difference in n and p uptake by cw plants varies significantly among different plant species 45 but other factors like retention period substrate type aeration rate ambient temperature and operation process also plays an important role in the overall uptake of n and p by plant biomass 37 66 biochar addition possibly helped in rapid assimilation of n and p in plant biomass through improved uptake rates for plants in cws de rozeri et al 19 also found a direct role of biochar addition on p uptake rates in a cw 3 4 multivariate analysis multivariate analysis was performed to see the interrelations among cod nh4 n no3 n so4 2 po4 3 tn and do in vssfcws during the treatment process results of pca analysis are described in table 4 based on eigenvalue 1 single component pc 1 in both sb 79 9 variance and sp 75 44 variance while 2 components pc 1 69 35 variance and pc 2 16 17 variance in sbp were identified a strong relationship among wastewater parameters was recorded in both sb and sp vssfcws except to do which showed a weak factor loading in sp a high loading factor of do 0 975 in sb than sp 0 549 setups suggested the significant role of oxygen in the performance of sb in sbp pc1 includes all parameters except to do while in pc2 two factors with 0 5 loadings do and cod were observed after varimax rotation only do remain in pc2 of sbp setup this indicates that the concentration of wastewater pollutants over the treatment period is governed by do as well as other processes like precipitation sedimentation plant up and desorption cluster analysis results are presented in fig 1s supplementary section cluster analysis results showed two major clusters a cod and b all other parameters in sb and sp setups in sb cluster b divided into two sub clusters b1 po4 3 and b2 all others in this cluster nh4 n do and no3 n showed close association indicating nitrification as minor mechanism for n dynamics in this setup so4 2 removal can be driven by accumulation or through precipitations cluster b in sp further divided into sub cluster b1 nh4 n and do and b2 all other parameters indicating the direct role of do in nh4 n removal in this setup b2 sub cluster of po4 3 in sp showed the distance from rest of the parameters indicating different removal mechanism such as plant uptake in sbp two major clusters formed cluster a do in nh4 n and cluster b that further formed two sub clusters b1 cod and b2 all other wastewater parameters in this system tn no3 n po4 3 and so4 2 have a distinct route of removal possibly through adsorption precipitation or plant uptake while cod was mainly removed through aerobic degradation process the correlation matrix results indicate significant relationships among all parameters in sb and sp except to do no3 n in sp while in sbp there was a significant relationship among all wastewater parameters except to do table 2s 3 5 characterization of cow dung biochar 3 5 1 chemical characteristics the physical and chemical characteristics of cow dung biochar are presented in table 1s supplementary section the ph of biochar was alkali i e 9 5 mainly due to releasing of alkali species during combustion of biomass but high ph of biochar does not affect the substrate chemistry because most of the salts drain out during the 70 d of acclimatization period in studied vssfcws the bulk density water holding capacity and porosity of cow dung biochar was 0 05 g cm3 80 and 0 36 respectively proximate analysis showed the content of 3 23 moisture 28 49 ash 55 86 volatile matter and 12 421 fixed carbon comparable to the biochar prepared from wheat straw corn straw rice straw soybean straw and rape straw table 3s supplementary section the fixed carbon content in cow dung biochar as compared to other plant straw biochar indicates its suitability for application in wastewater treatment processes as lowcost substance 3 5 2 biochar surface morphology and ftir analysis as shown in fig 7 sem images indicate that initial biochar composed of layered flake like structures with large pores in between the morphology of biochar was smooth and compact with irregularly shaped particles of large surface area after treatment adhering deposited particles can be seen on biochar surface indicating the significant role of biochar in improved removal efficiencies in biochar added cws ftir spectrum fig 7 of raw biochar used in this study indicates the functionals groups assigned to respective peaks as ch out of plane 870 and 992 cm

peaks reduced significantly especially in spectral areas ranged between 1300 to 1600 cm 1 3000 to 3600 cm 1 and 2300 to 2600 cm 1 both in sbp and sp setups the spectral variability between sbp and sp setups also indicates the different adsorption rate in biochar used in these two setups hydroxyl oh zone showed the highest decrease in peak suggesting the major sink of ionic molecules from wastewater mainly facilitated by hydroxyl reactive groups in sbp the reactive groups at 991 993 ch out of plane acted as prominent reactive groups for adsorptive removals of nutrients from wastewater as compared to the biochar from sp setup 4 conclusions in summary colocasia based vssfcw showed high efficiency for removal of cod n load no3 n nh4 n and tn so4 2 po4 3 after amending with cattle dung biochar tn removal was in the ranges of 56 13 74 92 which can be further improved by introducing the aeration in setups cod reduction was achieved 89 9 92 6 in this study which seems comparable to cws with conventional plant stands like a reed cattails etc results revealed that biochar addition in vssfcw not only improves the oxidative removal of nh4 n so4 2 and po4 3 but also helps in further plant uptakes our data showed better plant uptake rate for n and p comparable to the reported results by previous researchers on cw performance assessment using wetland plant other than colocasia total coliforms reduced by 88 76 97 01 in planted setups than non planted setups 62 2 the treated wastewater by vssfcws showed ranges of water parameters within the discharge standards set by the national environmental agency of india results suggested that cattle dung biochar could be a suitable substitute for wood based biochar for wastewater treatment operations further studies can be

13519,organic fouling which generally gives a more severe effect on anion exchange membranes aems leads to performance degradation of electro membrane processes in this work polyvinyl chloride pvc based aem was prepared by a solution casting method three aems were modified by different hydrophilic additives namely polyethylene glycol 400 peg400 polyethylene glycol 1000 peg1000 and zno nanoparticles m2 m4 membranes then the properties of these modified membranes were compared to the pristine membrane m1 membrane the effect of hydrophilic additives on the anti organic fouling properties of modified membranes was investigated during a simple electrodialysis test of feed water containing humic substances the results of chemical structure analysis show that the additives are successfully incorporated in the membrane matrix the presence of the hydrophilic additive in the membrane matrix increases membrane conductivity the highest increase in conductivity is obtained by the addition of peg400 up to 50 meanwhile water uptake ion exchange capacity and water contact angle of the modified membranes are insignificantly changed in addition the additives can improve membrane resistance toward organic fouling the introduction of additive can suppress the increasing rate of membrane areal resistance by 60 keywords humic substances hydrophilicity ion exchange membrane preparation phase inversion 1 introduction ion exchange membrane iem is a charged membrane that has a strategic role in the field of water treatment and energy storage or conversion in water treatment iem based processes such as electrodialysis and electrodeionization have been commercially applied in producing drinking water and industrial water 1 however their applications are limited by organic fouling when the feed water contains organic substances organic fouling occurs on anion exchange membrane aem due to the interaction between organic substances and the membrane charge 2 aem has fixed functional sites that are positively charged while organic substances such as humate are usually negatively charged 3 4 this makes organic substances are easily deposited on aem surface organic substances deposit increases membrane resistance and decreases ion transfer through the membrane 5 consequently the iem based process requires more energy to maintain a constant ion transfer rate if the fouling occurs in addition fouling leads to the decreasing membrane lifetime 6 the low membrane lifetime will result in the high operational cost which is associated with membrane replacement several strategies have been proposed to address fouling issues generally fouling phenomena are controlled by providing an appropriate pre treatment process optimizing the process conditions modifying membrane properties and selecting suitable cleaning procedures 7 one of the effective strategies is membrane surface modification which prevents fouling by altering membrane foulant interaction 8 results from previous studies show that modifiying membrane surface with materials that have negative charges or have high hydrophilicity can decrease organic fouling 9 13 however the addition of a new layer on the membrane surface will increase membrane thickness and the mass transfer resistance moreover the addition of negatively charged layer which is intended to reduce membrane foulant electrostatic interaction will restrict the permeation of anions through the aem another alternative way to improve membrane hydrophilicity is by introducing the additives into the membrane matrix the incorporation of hydrophilic additives into the matrix of heterogeneous iem have been reported in numerous studies 14 18 as reported in these studies hydrophilic additives are able to improve the properties of heterogeneous iem including membrane conductivity and selectivity the additive can be a hydrophilic polymer or a nanoparticle one of the advantages of polymer additives is that they can be distributed evenly in the membrane matrix one of the most widely used polymers for membrane modification is polyethylene glycol peg 19 21 as reported in previous studies the addition of peg 400 can increase the conductivity and permselectivity of pvc based heterogeneous cation exchange membranes 22 23 combining organic and inorganic compounds is an interesting strategy to increase membrane properties this is generally achieved by using nano sized inorganic compounds the conductive characteristics of the nanoparticles can increase the conductivity of the iem one type of nanoparticles that are low cost and proven to be able to improve the characteristics of heterogeneous iem is zno nanoparticles zno nanoparticles have been shown to improve membrane characteristics such as water uptake conductivity and permselectivity 24 however the effect of hydrophilic additives in the membrane matrix on the anti organic fouling properties of heterogeneous aem is rarely reported therefore this study aims to investigate the effect of hydrophilic additive on the anti fouling properties of the heterogeneous aem in this study four heterogeneous aems m1 m4 were synthesized by the solution casting method the m2 m4 membranes were modified by introducing polyethylene glycol 400 peg400 polyethylene glycol 1000 peg1000 and zno the performance of the prepared membrane during the electrodialysis of solution with the presence of humic acid is analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinyl chloride pvc fj 70 obtained from pt asahimas chemical indonesia tetrahydrofuran thf from merck kgaa emsure germany anion exchange resins amberlite ira 400 cl rohm and haas co were used for the preparation of heterogeneous membrane meanwhile polyethylene glycol with molecular weight of 400 peg400 and 1000 peg1000 obtained from local supplier pt saary indoraya jakarta indonesia and nano sized zno 100 300 nm from local supplier were used for hydrophilic additives other materials including nacl emsure from merck kgaa darmstadt germany naoh emsure from merck kgaa darmstadt germany hcl pro analysis from merck kgaa and demineralized water were used for membrane characterization without further purification in addition natural peat water obtained from local river in pekanbaru riau indonesia ph 3 4 was used for feed solution in the organic fouling test 2 2 membrane preparation procedure the aem membrane was prepared by the solution casting method as per the procedure reported in 22 23 25 membrane preparation procedure consists of preparing ion exchange resin powder synthesizing membrane solution and casting the membrane solution in brief the membrane solution was prepared by dissolving pvc in thf followed by the introduction of ion exchange resin powder sieved by 325 mesh and dried and additive for m4 preparation the additive was firstly mixed with the solution until optically homogeneous before dissolving the pvc the next step was the same as for m1 m3 the membrane solution composition is tabulated in table 1 then the membrane solution was cast on a glass plate and dried at room conditions overnight the dried membrane was immersed in demineralized water for 24 h for removing the remaining solvent afterward the membrane was immersed in 1 m naoh solution for 24 h before characterization the membrane was immersed in naoh solution to convert the ion exchange resin particles in the membrane matrix to the oh form 2 3 membrane characterization the membrane thickness was measured by a dial thickness gauge dt 3701y from delta precision tools precision 0 01 mm the results of the measurement show that the membranes have 0 20 0 03 mm thickness the membrane properties i e water uptake wu g water g dry membrane ion exchange capacity iec meq g and conductivity ms cm were characterized by procedures reported in 22 26 however in iec characterization the titration was conducted by using hcl solution 0 01 n to determine iec the membrane was immersed in 1 m nacl solution for 24 h the membrane was then rinsed with demineralized water the total volume of rinsed water and nacl solution were measured 5 ml of the solution was titrated with hcl solution and phenolphthalein was used as the indicator then the volume requirement of hcl was measured the iec was calculated based on the volume and concentration of hcl required during the titration the total volume of nacl solution used to immerse the membrane and volume of rinse water and the dry weight of the membrane wu is calculated from the difference in dry weight in oven at 60 c for about 24 h and the wet weight of the membrane immersed in demineralized water for 24 h under room conditions the water contact angle wca was determined by using procedure reported in 27 a droplet of demineralized water was placed onto the membrane with a micro syringe hamilton micromesure the water droplet image was then captured with a digital usb microscope the water angle is then measured by using an image processing software the water contact angle was measured five times on the different part of the membrane surface and on three membrane samples the morphology of the membrane cross section was probed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510lv while the chemical properties was analyzed by fourier transform infrared analysis the perkinelmer spectrumtwo 2 4 organic fouling test the procedure for organic fouling test consists of peat water filtration and dilution simple electrodialysis test and membrane cleaning followed by conductivity measurement first the peat water was filtered by ultrafiltration membrane polysulfone membrane 0 12 m2 membrane area average pore size 0 01 Î¼m supplied by gdp filter indonesia at 0 75 bar a 5 l peat water was filtered batchwise until a half of the volume was obtained as permeate then the ultrafiltered peat water or uf permeate with tds 471 mg l conductivity 872 Î¼s cm was diluted with demineralized water 10 times dilution the diluted peat water tds 161 mg l and conductivity 292 Î¼s cm was fed to the simple electrodialysis cell a half cell shown in fig 1 a comparison of visual appearance of ultrafiltered peat water and diluted peat water is shown in fig 1b this test cell has two compartments with a volume of 28 3 cm3 and was equipped with graphite as working electrodes and silver as reference electrodes the membrane sample was inserted between the two compartments the effective membrane area was 2 5 cm2 the dc power supply was capable of supplying 0 48 volts and 0 2 a voltage and current were measured with digital multi meter multi rm99 id dt 860b a simple electrodialysis process was conducted by using diluted peat water and 0 5 m nacl solution as the electrolytes the cell was operated under a constant current 0 1 a and the potential difference was recorded overtime after the process the membrane was immersed in 0 5 m naoh solution for 6 h the membrane then thoroughly rinsed with demineralized water finally the membrane conductivity was measured once again and compared with the initial conductivity the conductivity recovery ratio crr is calculated by comparing the membrane conductivity after cleaning to its initial value 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane morphology and chemical structure fig 2 shows the cross section of the home made heterogeneous aems the membrane morphologies are similar to those of heterogeneous cem reported in previous studies 22 25 as shown in fig 2 the membranes have a fine distribution of anion exchange particles in the membrane matrix wherein the particles are surrounded by pvc a fine distribution of the resin particles will form a membrane with good electrochemical properties and high mechanical strength 28 29 m2 and m3 membranes seem to have more voids showed by dark spots rather than those of m1 and m4 this may be due to the presence of peg peg usually acts as a pore forming agent for the preparation of porous membranes such as ultrafiltration via the wet phase inversion method 25 here during the preparation of the membrane the remaining solvent was removed by immersing the membrane in demineralized water the presence of peg which is hydrophilic may attract more water that is involved in solvent non solvent exchange process resulting the formation of voids in the membrane matrix another phenomenon that may contribute to the formation of the void is the removal of some peg content from the membrane during this immersion meanwhile the presence of zno in the m4 membrane is not successfully captured in the sem analysis this may be due to the small size of the zno compared to the ion exchange particles chemical structure of the membrane is characterized by ftir as shown fig 3 a and 3b the synthesized membrane comprises pvc as the membrane matrix anion exchange particles as the functional group container and additives i e peg and zno particles a peak found at 686 cm 1 confirms c cl bonds that are associated with pvc 30 the ir spectra also show a peak at 1616 cm 1 band in m1 m4 fig 3a confirming the strong vibration of cc bonds of the benzene ring 27 the benzene ring belongs to the matrix of the resin particles because ira 400 cl is aminated copolymer of styrene divinyl benzene furthermore the presence of anion exchange resin is indicated by a peak at 890 cm 1 the peak at this wavenumber shows n ch3 3 group 27 which acts as functional group for ion exchange process the quaternary ammonium group has a strong charge and thus it is expected to form a highly conductive membrane a broad band appears at wavenumber of 3000 cm 1 to 3500 cm 1 in all membranes are associated with oh groups the presence of oh groups may indicate moisture content in the membrane in addition m2 and m3 membranes show more peak intensity at these wavenumbers it may imply that m2 and m3 membranes have more hydroxyl groups rather than m1 and m4 since m2 and m3 use peg for the additive another important peak at 547 cm 1 is found in ir spectra of m4 this peak which does not appear in other membranes belongs to zn o bonds 31 32 this result reveals that zno particles are successfully incorporated into the m4 membrane matrix 3 2 properties of pvc based heterogeneous aems fig 4 a to 4f show properties of synthesized membranes including ion exchange capacity water uptake water contact angle conductivity and fixed ion concentration m2 and m3 show higher iec than m1 and m4 showing the positive effect of peg addition to the membrane properties iec represent the capacity of the membrane in adsorbing counter ion iec is generally associated with the total amount of fixed ion per membrane mass a high iec means a high functional group content which is important for providing selectivity and conductivity to the membrane this effect may be due to the formation of voids in the membrane matrix which helps ion to access the functional sites 14 33 as the result counter ions or in this case is cl from the nacl solution can interact with the functional sites easier another possibility that causes an increase in iec in membranes with peg is that the counter ion is easier to access functional groups in the membrane matrix because the membrane has more voids so that more counter ions are adsorbed by the membrane when the membrane is immersed in nacl solution during characterization see section 2 3 urthermore peg400 produces a membrane with higher conductivity wu and iec than the peg1000 in the membrane formation process the solvent is removed in two steps first the solvent is removed in the drying process while in the second solvent non solvent exchange occurs in a coagulation bath peg400 may produce a membrane solution with lower viscosity than peg1000 due to its smaller molecular weight as a result a membrane with more porosity is formed which is associated with the easier removal of solvent from the less viscous solution 34 consequently the functional groups of resin particles in the membrane matrix are more accessible to the ions the formation of voids is evidenced by sem images fig 2 and by the value of water uptake depicted in fig 4 b when the membrane is immersed in demineralized water membrane adsorbs and stores water in the membrane matrix functional sites and voids in the membrane matrix contribute to this process in addition the presence of functional sites leads to the membrane swelling process where the water absorption process occurs therefore m2 and m3 membranes exhibit higher wu values than other membranes peg and zno are hydrophilic substances that are employed to improve membrane hydrophilicity it is intended to improve the anti organic fouling properties of the membrane hydrophilic properties will decrease the attachment of organic foulant which is generally hydrophobic on the membrane surface due to the presence of a water layer 35 as shown in fig 4c the membranes have a similar wca value it is obvious because the ion exchange resin is already hydrophilic when additives are introduced to the membrane solution the portion of pvc and anion exchange resins are replaced by the additive by 10 wt or in other words in the same membrane mass the addition of hydrophilic additives will not affect the overall wca however the addition of peg increases the conductivity significantly fig 4d since functional sites represented by iec and ionic path represented by wu are increased the ionic transfer through the membrane represented by conductivity is also improved even though the fixed ion concentration is almost constant fic for all membranes but the increasing iec in m2 and m3 can enhance the membrane conductivity progressively fig 4f it is obvious since more functional site content promotes more conductive membrane table 2 shows the comparison of membrane properties synthesized in this work with heterogeneous aems reported by other works as shown in table 2 m1 m4 display comparable properties to other membranes m1 m4 also show higher wca than those reported in 36 this may be due to the content of ion exchange resin used in the preparation of membrane solution m1 m4 membranes use 60 wt of ion exchange powder while those in 36 were prepared with 50 wt however iec of m1 m4 are relatively lower than others the lower iec may be attributed to the properties of the ion exchange resin 3 3 organic fouling analysis results of fouling test are depicted in fig 5 a e when the cell was operated under constant current the applied voltage increased overtime fig 5a the increasing electrical potential is needed to maintain a constant current due to the loss of membrane conductivity the loss of membrane conductivity is associated with the fouling formation on the membrane surface as negative ion of organic substances such as humic acid migrate toward the membrane organic attach on membrane surface creating new layer the layer is formed as the result of electrostatic interaction of organic membrane 11 13 therefore the membrane shows increasing areal resistance fig 5b fig 5 c shows that the increasing rates of areal resistance of m2 m4 membrane are lower than m1 the slope of r is lowered by almost 70 in m3 table 3 heterogeneous iem contains pvc material which is hydrophobic in addition to the interaction of positive charged of ion exchange resin with organic component the hydrophobicity of pvc also contributes to the higher tendency of organic fouling formation on heterogeneous membrane it was reported in 41 a pvc film shows wca of 116 confirming the hydrophobicity of pvc even though ion exchange resins are also hydrophilic the positive charge will interact with organic fouling so the hydrophilicity provided by the ion exchange particle cannot be used to improve organic fouling resistance of the membrane results shown in fig 5a d reveal that the hydrophilic additive are able improve the organic fouling resistance by suppressing organic fouling formation by introducing hydrophilic additives the electrostatic of interaction of organic foulant and the membrane charge can be reduced this is because the presence of additive decreases ion exchange powder in the membrane composition 10 of membrane mass is replaced by additive even though the portion of additive in the membrane matrix cut the portion of functional sites the properties of the membrane is still maintained or even improved the results indicate that the addition of additives which reduce the portion of ion exchange particles in the membrane matrix helps decrease the membrane affinity towards organic compounds so that the fouling formation can be suppressed another important impact of the introduction of hydrophilic additive is the increase of conductivity recovery ratio crr fig 5d here fouled membrane is cleaned with caustic solution to remove organic foulant from the membrane surface the conductivity of the cleaned membrane was measured and compared to its initial value a higher crr means a more organic foulant is removed from the membrane as shown in fig 5d the conductivity of m2 m3 membranes are successfully recovered to 95 this result reveals that the hydrophilic additive helps loosen the attachment of the foulant on the membrane surface to show the interaction of humic substances with ion exchange resins ultrafiltered peat water was placed in a bottle and filled with ion exchange resins with a half of the total volume three types of ion exchange resins were used cationic anionic and mixed bed ion exchange resin after 24 h of immersion peat water with anionic and mixed bed ion exchange resins show the formation of precipitate on the resins surface it is evidenced from this result that humic substances are attracted to the anion exchange resins due to electrostatic interaction therefore by decreasing the charge or positive charge of anion exchange resins in the membrane matrix it is possible to improve organic fouling resistance 4 conclusion in this work hydrophilic additives including peg400 peg1000 and zno are introduced into heterogeneous aem by a simple additive blending method ir spectra of ftir analysis reveals that the additives are successfully incorporated into the membrane matrix sem images show that the synthesized membranes show fine distribution of ion exchange particles in the membrane matrix the presence of hydrophilic additive helps improving membrane properties the presence of additive increases membrane conductivity toward cl almost double compared to the pristine membrane in addition membranes with additive exhibit lower increasing resistance during the electrodialysis of feed water containing humic substances this result confirm the positive effect hydrophilic additives introduction on organic fouling resistance especially for heterogeneous aem another important result is the organic fouling becomes easier to remove from the membrane surface therefore the conductivity of the fouled membrane can be recovered up to 95 after chemical cleaning the experimental results indicate that the addition of peg400 can increase the conductivity and wu of the membrane as well as increase the antifouling characteristics of organic compounds better than the other two additives therefore it can be used to modify heterogeneous aems for the treatment of water containing organic compounds although the rate of increase in electrical resistance is still relatively high this can be combined with an appropriate cleaning method so that the conductivity of the membrane can be recovered more effectively when fouling occurs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

13519,organic fouling which generally gives a more severe effect on anion exchange membranes aems leads to performance degradation of electro membrane processes in this work polyvinyl chloride pvc based aem was prepared by a solution casting method three aems were modified by different hydrophilic additives namely polyethylene glycol 400 peg400 polyethylene glycol 1000 peg1000 and zno nanoparticles m2 m4 membranes then the properties of these modified membranes were compared to the pristine membrane m1 membrane the effect of hydrophilic additives on the anti organic fouling properties of modified membranes was investigated during a simple electrodialysis test of feed water containing humic substances the results of chemical structure analysis show that the additives are successfully incorporated in the membrane matrix the presence of the hydrophilic additive in the membrane matrix increases membrane conductivity the highest increase in conductivity is obtained by the addition of peg400 up to 50 meanwhile water uptake ion exchange capacity and water contact angle of the modified membranes are insignificantly changed in addition the additives can improve membrane resistance toward organic fouling the introduction of additive can suppress the increasing rate of membrane areal resistance by 60 keywords humic substances hydrophilicity ion exchange membrane preparation phase inversion 1 introduction ion exchange membrane iem is a charged membrane that has a strategic role in the field of water treatment and energy storage or conversion in water treatment iem based processes such as electrodialysis and electrodeionization have been commercially applied in producing drinking water and industrial water 1 however their applications are limited by organic fouling when the feed water contains organic substances organic fouling occurs on anion exchange membrane aem due to the interaction between organic substances and the membrane charge 2 aem has fixed functional sites that are positively charged while organic substances such as humate are usually negatively charged 3 4 this makes organic substances are easily deposited on aem surface organic substances deposit increases membrane resistance and decreases ion transfer through the membrane 5 consequently the iem based process requires more energy to maintain a constant ion transfer rate if the fouling occurs in addition fouling leads to the decreasing membrane lifetime 6 the low membrane lifetime will result in the high operational cost which is associated with membrane replacement several strategies have been proposed to address fouling issues generally fouling phenomena are controlled by providing an appropriate pre treatment process optimizing the process conditions modifying membrane properties and selecting suitable cleaning procedures 7 one of the effective strategies is membrane surface modification which prevents fouling by altering membrane foulant interaction 8 results from previous studies show that modifiying membrane surface with materials that have negative charges or have high hydrophilicity can decrease organic fouling 9 13 however the addition of a new layer on the membrane surface will increase membrane thickness and the mass transfer resistance moreover the addition of negatively charged layer which is intended to reduce membrane foulant electrostatic interaction will restrict the permeation of anions through the aem another alternative way to improve membrane hydrophilicity is by introducing the additives into the membrane matrix the incorporation of hydrophilic additives into the matrix of heterogeneous iem have been reported in numerous studies 14 18 as reported in these studies hydrophilic additives are able to improve the properties of heterogeneous iem including membrane conductivity and selectivity the additive can be a hydrophilic polymer or a nanoparticle one of the advantages of polymer additives is that they can be distributed evenly in the membrane matrix one of the most widely used polymers for membrane modification is polyethylene glycol peg 19 21 as reported in previous studies the addition of peg 400 can increase the conductivity and permselectivity of pvc based heterogeneous cation exchange membranes 22 23 combining organic and inorganic compounds is an interesting strategy to increase membrane properties this is generally achieved by using nano sized inorganic compounds the conductive characteristics of the nanoparticles can increase the conductivity of the iem one type of nanoparticles that are low cost and proven to be able to improve the characteristics of heterogeneous iem is zno nanoparticles zno nanoparticles have been shown to improve membrane characteristics such as water uptake conductivity and permselectivity 24 however the effect of hydrophilic additives in the membrane matrix on the anti organic fouling properties of heterogeneous aem is rarely reported therefore this study aims to investigate the effect of hydrophilic additive on the anti fouling properties of the heterogeneous aem in this study four heterogeneous aems m1 m4 were synthesized by the solution casting method the m2 m4 membranes were modified by introducing polyethylene glycol 400 peg400 polyethylene glycol 1000 peg1000 and zno the performance of the prepared membrane during the electrodialysis of solution with the presence of humic acid is analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinyl chloride pvc fj 70 obtained from pt asahimas chemical indonesia tetrahydrofuran thf from merck kgaa emsure germany anion exchange resins amberlite ira 400 cl rohm and haas co were used for the preparation of heterogeneous membrane meanwhile polyethylene glycol with molecular weight of 400 peg400 and 1000 peg1000 obtained from local supplier pt saary indoraya jakarta indonesia and nano sized zno 100 300 nm from local supplier were used for hydrophilic additives other materials including nacl emsure from merck kgaa darmstadt germany naoh emsure from merck kgaa darmstadt germany hcl pro analysis from merck kgaa and demineralized water were used for membrane characterization without further purification in addition natural peat water obtained from local river in pekanbaru riau indonesia ph 3 4 was used for feed solution in the organic fouling test 2 2 membrane preparation procedure the aem membrane was prepared by the solution casting method as per the procedure reported in 22 23 25 membrane preparation procedure consists of preparing ion exchange resin powder synthesizing membrane solution and casting the membrane solution in brief the membrane solution was prepared by dissolving pvc in thf followed by the introduction of ion exchange resin powder sieved by 325 mesh and dried and additive for m4 preparation the additive was firstly mixed with the solution until optically homogeneous before dissolving the pvc the next step was the same as for m1 m3 the membrane solution composition is tabulated in table 1 then the membrane solution was cast on a glass plate and dried at room conditions overnight the dried membrane was immersed in demineralized water for 24 h for removing the remaining solvent afterward the membrane was immersed in 1 m naoh solution for 24 h before characterization the membrane was immersed in naoh solution to convert the ion exchange resin particles in the membrane matrix to the oh form 2 3 membrane characterization the membrane thickness was measured by a dial thickness gauge dt 3701y from delta precision tools precision 0 01 mm the results of the measurement show that the membranes have 0 20 0 03 mm thickness the membrane properties i e water uptake wu g water g dry membrane ion exchange capacity iec meq g and conductivity ms cm were characterized by procedures reported in 22 26 however in iec characterization the titration was conducted by using hcl solution 0 01 n to determine iec the membrane was immersed in 1 m nacl solution for 24 h the membrane was then rinsed with demineralized water the total volume of rinsed water and nacl solution were measured 5 ml of the solution was titrated with hcl solution and phenolphthalein was used as the indicator then the volume requirement of hcl was measured the iec was calculated based on the volume and concentration of hcl required during the titration the total volume of nacl solution used to immerse the membrane and volume of rinse water and the dry weight of the membrane wu is calculated from the difference in dry weight in oven at 60 c for about 24 h and the wet weight of the membrane immersed in demineralized water for 24 h under room conditions the water contact angle wca was determined by using procedure reported in 27 a droplet of demineralized water was placed onto the membrane with a micro syringe hamilton micromesure the water droplet image was then captured with a digital usb microscope the water angle is then measured by using an image processing software the water contact angle was measured five times on the different part of the membrane surface and on three membrane samples the morphology of the membrane cross section was probed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510lv while the chemical properties was analyzed by fourier transform infrared analysis the perkinelmer spectrumtwo 2 4 organic fouling test the procedure for organic fouling test consists of peat water filtration and dilution simple electrodialysis test and membrane cleaning followed by conductivity measurement first the peat water was filtered by ultrafiltration membrane polysulfone membrane 0 12 m2 membrane area average pore size 0 01 Î¼m supplied by gdp filter indonesia at 0 75 bar a 5 l peat water was filtered batchwise until a half of the volume was obtained as permeate then the ultrafiltered peat water or uf permeate with tds 471 mg l conductivity 872 Î¼s cm was diluted with demineralized water 10 times dilution the diluted peat water tds 161 mg l and conductivity 292 Î¼s cm was fed to the simple electrodialysis cell a half cell shown in fig 1 a comparison of visual appearance of ultrafiltered peat water and diluted peat water is shown in fig 1b this test cell has two compartments with a volume of 28 3 cm3 and was equipped with graphite as working electrodes and silver as reference electrodes the membrane sample was inserted between the two compartments the effective membrane area was 2 5 cm2 the dc power supply was capable of supplying 0 48 volts and 0 2 a voltage and current were measured with digital multi meter multi rm99 id dt 860b a simple electrodialysis process was conducted by using diluted peat water and 0 5 m nacl solution as the electrolytes the cell was operated under a constant

finally the membrane conductivity was measured once again and compared with the initial conductivity the conductivity recovery ratio crr is calculated by comparing the membrane conductivity after cleaning to its initial value 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane morphology and chemical structure fig 2 shows the cross section of the home made heterogeneous aems the membrane morphologies are similar to those of heterogeneous cem reported in previous studies 22 25 as shown in fig 2 the membranes have a fine distribution of anion exchange particles in the membrane matrix wherein the particles are surrounded by pvc a fine distribution of the resin particles will form a membrane with good electrochemical properties and high mechanical strength 28 29 m2 and m3 membranes seem to have more voids showed by dark spots rather than those of m1 and m4 this may be due to the presence of peg peg usually acts as a pore forming agent for the preparation of porous membranes such as ultrafiltration via the wet phase inversion method 25 here during the preparation of the membrane the remaining solvent was removed by immersing the membrane in demineralized water the presence of peg which is hydrophilic may attract more water that is involved in solvent non solvent exchange process resulting the formation of voids in the membrane matrix another phenomenon that may contribute to the formation of the void is the removal of some peg content from the membrane during this immersion meanwhile the presence of zno in the m4 membrane is not successfully captured in the sem analysis this may be due to the small size of the zno compared to the ion exchange particles chemical structure of the membrane is characterized by ftir as shown fig 3 a and 3b the synthesized membrane comprises pvc as the membrane matrix anion exchange particles as the functional group container and additives i e peg and zno particles a peak found at 686 cm 1 confirms c cl bonds that are associated with pvc 30 the ir spectra also show a peak at 1616 cm 1 band in m1 m4 fig 3a confirming the strong vibration of cc bonds of the benzene ring 27 the benzene ring belongs to the matrix of the resin particles because ira 400 cl is aminated copolymer of styrene divinyl benzene furthermore the presence of anion exchange resin is indicated by a peak at 890 cm 1 the peak at this wavenumber shows n ch3 3 group 27 which acts as functional group for ion exchange process the quaternary ammonium group has a strong charge and thus it is expected to form a highly conductive membrane a broad band appears at wavenumber of 3000 cm 1 to 3500 cm 1 in all membranes are associated with oh groups the presence of oh groups may indicate moisture content in the membrane in addition m2 and m3 membranes show more peak intensity at these wavenumbers it may imply that m2 and m3 membranes have more hydroxyl groups rather than m1 and m4 since m2 and m3 use peg for the additive another important peak at 547 cm 1 is found in ir spectra of m4 this peak which does not appear in other membranes belongs to zn o bonds 31 32 this result reveals that zno particles are successfully incorporated into the m4 membrane matrix 3 2 properties of pvc based heterogeneous aems fig 4 a to 4f show properties of synthesized membranes including ion exchange capacity water uptake water contact angle conductivity and fixed ion concentration m2 and m3 show higher iec than m1 and m4 showing the positive effect of peg addition to the membrane properties iec represent the capacity of the membrane in adsorbing counter ion iec is generally associated with the total amount of fixed ion per membrane mass a high iec means a high functional group content which is important for providing selectivity and conductivity to the membrane this effect may be due to the formation of voids in the membrane matrix which helps ion to access the functional sites 14 33 as the result counter ions or in this case is cl from the nacl solution can interact with the functional sites easier another possibility that causes an increase in iec in membranes with peg is that the counter ion is easier to access functional groups in the membrane matrix because the membrane has more voids so that more counter ions are adsorbed by the membrane when the membrane is immersed in nacl solution during characterization see section 2 3 urthermore peg400 produces a membrane with higher conductivity wu and iec than the peg1000 in the membrane formation process the solvent is removed in two steps first the solvent is removed in the drying process while in the second solvent non solvent exchange occurs in a coagulation bath peg400 may produce a membrane solution with lower viscosity than peg1000 due to its smaller molecular weight as a result a membrane with more porosity is formed which is associated with the easier removal of solvent from the less viscous solution 34 consequently the functional groups of resin particles in the membrane matrix are more accessible to the ions the formation of voids is evidenced by sem images fig 2 and by the value of water uptake depicted in fig 4 b when the membrane is immersed in demineralized water membrane adsorbs and stores water in the membrane matrix functional sites and voids in the membrane matrix contribute to this process in addition the presence of functional sites leads to the membrane swelling process where the water absorption process occurs therefore m2 and m3 membranes exhibit higher wu values than other membranes peg and zno are hydrophilic substances that are employed to improve membrane hydrophilicity it is intended to improve the anti organic fouling properties of the membrane hydrophilic properties will decrease the attachment of organic foulant which is generally hydrophobic on the membrane surface due to the presence of a water layer 35 as shown in fig 4c the membranes have a similar wca value it is obvious because the ion exchange resin is already hydrophilic when additives are introduced to the membrane solution the portion of pvc and anion exchange resins are replaced by the additive by 10 wt or in other words in the same membrane mass the addition of hydrophilic additives will not affect the overall wca however the addition of peg increases the conductivity significantly fig 4d since functional sites represented by iec and ionic path represented by wu are increased the ionic transfer through the membrane represented by conductivity is also improved even though the fixed ion concentration is almost constant fic for all membranes but the increasing iec in m2 and m3 can enhance the membrane conductivity progressively fig 4f it is obvious since more functional site content promotes more conductive membrane table 2 shows the comparison of membrane properties synthesized in this work with heterogeneous aems reported by other works as shown in table 2 m1 m4 display comparable properties to other membranes m1 m4 also show higher wca than those reported in 36 this may be due to the content of ion exchange resin used in the preparation of membrane solution m1 m4 membranes use 60 wt of ion exchange powder while those in 36 were prepared with 50 wt however iec of m1 m4 are relatively lower than others the lower iec may be attributed to the properties of the ion exchange resin 3 3 organic fouling analysis results of fouling test are depicted in fig 5 a e when the cell was operated under constant current the applied voltage increased overtime fig 5a the increasing electrical potential is needed to maintain a constant current due to the loss of membrane conductivity the loss of membrane conductivity is associated with the fouling formation on the membrane surface as negative ion of organic substances such as humic acid migrate toward the membrane organic attach on membrane surface creating new layer the layer is formed as the result of electrostatic interaction of organic membrane 11 13 therefore the membrane shows increasing areal resistance fig 5b fig 5 c shows that the increasing rates of areal resistance of m2 m4 membrane are lower than m1 the slope of r is lowered by almost 70 in m3 table 3 heterogeneous iem contains pvc material which is hydrophobic in addition to the interaction of positive charged of ion exchange resin with organic component the hydrophobicity of pvc also contributes to the higher tendency of organic fouling formation on heterogeneous membrane it was reported in 41 a pvc film shows wca of 116 confirming the hydrophobicity of pvc even though ion exchange resins are also hydrophilic the positive charge will interact with organic fouling so the hydrophilicity provided by the ion exchange particle cannot be used to improve organic fouling resistance of the membrane results shown in fig 5a d reveal that the hydrophilic additive are able improve the organic fouling resistance by suppressing organic fouling formation by introducing hydrophilic additives the electrostatic of interaction of organic foulant and the membrane charge can be reduced this is because the presence of additive decreases ion exchange powder in the membrane composition 10 of membrane mass is replaced by additive even though the portion of additive in the membrane matrix cut the portion of functional sites the properties of the membrane is still maintained or even improved the results indicate that the addition of additives which reduce the portion of ion exchange particles in the membrane matrix helps decrease the membrane affinity towards organic compounds so that the fouling formation can be suppressed another important impact of the introduction of hydrophilic additive is the increase of conductivity recovery ratio crr fig 5d here fouled membrane is cleaned with caustic solution to remove organic foulant from the membrane surface the conductivity of the cleaned membrane was measured and compared to its initial value a higher crr means a more organic foulant is removed from the membrane as shown in fig 5d the conductivity of m2 m3 membranes are successfully recovered to 95 this result reveals that the hydrophilic additive helps loosen the attachment of the foulant on the membrane surface to show the interaction of humic substances with ion exchange resins ultrafiltered peat water was placed in a bottle and filled with ion exchange resins with a half of the total volume three types of ion exchange resins were used cationic anionic and mixed bed ion exchange resin after 24 h of immersion peat water with anionic and mixed bed ion exchange resins show the formation of precipitate on the resins surface it is evidenced from this result that humic substances are attracted to the anion exchange resins due to electrostatic interaction therefore by decreasing the charge or positive charge of anion exchange resins in the membrane matrix it is possible to improve organic fouling resistance 4 conclusion in this work hydrophilic additives including peg400 peg1000 and zno are introduced into heterogeneous aem by a simple additive blending method ir spectra of ftir analysis reveals that the additives are successfully incorporated into the membrane matrix sem images show that the synthesized membranes show fine distribution of ion exchange particles in the membrane matrix the presence of hydrophilic additive helps improving membrane properties the presence of additive increases membrane conductivity toward cl almost double compared to the pristine membrane in addition membranes with additive exhibit lower increasing resistance during the electrodialysis of feed water containing humic substances this result confirm the positive effect hydrophilic additives introduction on organic fouling resistance especially for heterogeneous aem another important result is the organic fouling becomes easier to remove from the membrane surface therefore the conductivity of the fouled membrane can be recovered up to 95 after chemical cleaning the experimental results indicate that the addition of peg400 can increase the conductivity and wu of the membrane as well as increase the antifouling characteristics of organic compounds better than the other two additives therefore it can be used to modify heterogeneous aems for the treatment of water containing organic compounds although the rate of increase in electrical resistance is still relatively high this can be combined with an appropriate cleaning method so that the conductivity of the membrane can be recovered more effectively when fouling occurs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work
