16535,souring is the unwanted formation of hydrogen sulfide h2s by sulfate reducing microorganisms srm in sewer systems and seawater flooded oil reservoirs nitrate treatment nt is one of the major methods to alleviate souring the mechanism of souring remediation by nt is stimulation of nitrate reducing microorganisms nrm that depending on the nitrate reduction pathway can outcompete srm for common electron donors or oxidize sulfide to sulfate however some nitrate reduction pathways may challenge the efficacy of nt therefore a precise understanding of souring rate nitrate reduction rate and pathways is crucial for efficient souring management here we investigate the necessity of incorporating two thermodynamic dependent kinetic parameters namely the growth yield y and ft a parameter related to the minimum catabolic energy production required by cells to utilize a given catabolic reaction we first show that depending on physiochemical conditions y and ft for srm change significantly in the range of 0 0 4 mole biomass per mole electron donor and 0 0006 0 5 respectively suggesting that these parameters should not be considered constant and that it is important to couple souring models with thermodynamic models then we highlight this further by showing an experimental dataset that can be modeled very well by considering variable ft next we show that nitrate based lithotrophic sulfide oxidation to sulfate lnrm3 is the dominant nitrate reduction pathway then arguing that thermodynamics would suggest that s consumption should proceed faster than s0 production we infer that the reason for frequently observed s0 accumulation is its low solubility last we suggest that nitrate based souring treatment will suffer less from s0 accumulation if we i act

donor ea electron acceptor nt nitrate treatment 1 introduction biologic hydrogen sulfide h2s production due to the activity of sulfate reducing microorganisms srm or the so called souring process is a common problem in sewer systems jiang et al 2014 and secondary oil recovery by seawater flooding veshareh and ayatollahi 2019 due to the odorant corrosive and toxic nature of h2s nitrate treatment nt is one of the intervention methods to control souring by stimulating nitrate reducing microorganisms an et al 2010 nitrate can suppress souring by various mechanisms such as activating organotrophic nitrate reducing microorganisms onrm that may outcompete srm for the available organic matter agrawal et al 2012 and reducing sulfide concentration by stimulating lithotrophic nitrate reducing microorganisms lnrm veshareh et al 2021 lithotrophic nitrate reduction based sulfide oxidation can be associated with biogenic elemental sulfur s0 huang et al 2015 due to the corrosive character of s0 lahme et al 2019 schmitt 1991 its accumulation can reduce the efficiency of nt dolfing and hubert 2017 therefore an understanding of likely nitrate reduction pathways as well as kinetics of sulfate and nitrate reduction is essential for designing promising nt plans respiring prokaryotes catalyze redox reactions called catabolic reactions to derive energy for growth and maintenance jin 2012 the amount of free energy available from various redox reactions or gibbs free energy of catabolic reaction δ g cat has been used by scientists as a method to compare the likelihood of different metabolisms pathways for example dolfing and hubert 2017 used this method to predict nitrate reduction pathways in nitrate based oil reservoir souring mitigation since under typical oil reservoir conditions δ g cat of nitrate reduction coupled to acetate oxidation was higher than nitrate reduction coupled to sulfide oxidation they proposed that under realistic oil field conditions nitrate reduction is more likely to be organotrophic rather than lithotrophic dolfing and hubert 2017 claimed that lithotrophic nitrate reduction coupled to partial oxidation of sulfide to sulfur is an exception and can be more favorable than organotrophic nitrate reduction as far as acetate to sulfide molar ratio is less than 0 001 or the temperature is sufficiently low additionally showing that per mole of nitrate sulfide oxidation to s0 releases slightly more energy than sulfide oxidation to sulfate they suggested that s0 accumulation is likely to occur under nitrate limiting conditions the assessment of dolfing and hubert labels one metabolism pathway as favorable and the other as unfavorable and does not allow an energy based quantitative comparison between the occurrence likelihood of each metabolism we are not aware of any previous research that has used thermodynamics to make a quantitative comparison between the occurrence likelihood of various nitrate reduction pathways in presence of sulfide and s0 however for some other metabolisms such as syntrophic oxidation iron reduction sulfate reduction and methanogenesis jin and kirk 2016 and jin and kirk 2018 used a thermodynamic limiting factor ft that relates the rate of microbial metabolisms to δ g cat the ft coefficient is not the only term that links thermodynamics to metabolism kinetics growth yield y is another parameter that controls the kinetics of microbial metabolisms and is a function of δ g cat and of the gibbs free energy of anabolic reaction δ g an jin and roden 2011 smeaton and van cappellen 2018 to the best of our knowledge no previous research work has used growth yield to relate thermodynamics of microbial reactions to their kinetics note that y and ft have been assumed to be constant in biomass explicit microbial kinetic models used over the last decades to simulate souring and its mitigation with nitrate hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 sharma et al 2008 veshareh and nick 2019 2021a 2021b as such the error associated with assuming y and ft parameters to be constant in simulation of souring process and nitrate based souring mitigation measures is unknown to address the abovementioned gaps in this article we calculate y and ft to evaluate the range in which they vary under various physiochemical conditions such as electron donor ed and electron acceptor ea availability ph and temperature relevant to sewer systems and petroleum reservoirs we then use y to link thermodynamics of sulfur and nitrogen cycle to their kinetics using this link we first revisit the questions raised by dolfing and hubert 2017 by illuminating whether nitrate reduction is more likely to be organotrophic or lithotrophic and whether or not s0 accumulation during nt is due to a thermodynamic drive lastly we suggest some measures to minimize s0 accumulation in nt of souring 2 theory lithotrophic nitrate reducers can obtain their energy by i oxidation of sulfide to sulfur lnrm1 ii oxidation of sulfur to sulfate lnrm2 and iii direct oxidation of sulfide to sulfate lnrm3 regardless of whether nitrate is reduced through lnrm or onrm it is reduced either to nitrogen gases through denitrification or to ammonium through dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnra callbeck et al 2013 however various research works e g veshareh and nick 2019 and marietou et al 2020 have shown that dnra is the responsible nitrate reduction pathway in nitrate mitigation of reservoir souring therefore here we do not consider redox reactions related to the denitrification pathway lithotrophic nitrate reducing microorganisms can be autotrophic lanrm hamilton et al 2015 or heterotrophic lhnrm miroshnichenko et al 2003 various organic compounds can serve as the ed of srm and onrm however dolfing and hubert 2017 showed that the energy yield of srm and onrm metabolisms is independent of the type of the organic ed used therefore here we only consider acetate as the ed and as the organic carbon source for cell synthesis of organotrophic and lithoheterotrophic metabolisms catabolic and anabolic reactions are from or are based on the methodology introduced by smeaton and van cappellen 2018 table 1 and 2 list the catabolic and anabolic reactions that represent various metabolisms studied in this work chemical compounds in the aqueous phase can lose or obtain protons or hydroxide due to reaction with water molecules or combine with other ions or molecules in a process called speciation jin and kirk 2018 due to speciation chemical compounds dissolved in water can exist in various forms or chemical species as a result environmental ph can affect the energetics of redox reactions directly by changing the chemical activity of protons for redox reactions that consume or produce protons or indirectly by controlling the speciation of reactants and products in this work all reactions are written using dominant chemical species at ph 7 at a neutral ph hydrogen sulfide hs occurs in relatively equal proportions as dihydrogen sulfide h2s following smeaton and van cappellen 2018 we choose hs catabolic and anabolic reactions are written per mole ed and per mole biomass respectively 3 methodology according to the thermodynamically consistent rate law jin and bethke 2005 2007 respiration rate r mol ed s 1 can be written as follows 1 r v max x f k f t where v max mol ed mol biomass 1 s 1 is the maximum rate of a metabolism x is the biomass concentration mol kg water 1 f k is a kinetic limiting term and f t is a thermodynamic limiting term according to monod 1949 and larowe et al 2014 f k and f t can be defined as follows 2 f k c ed k ed c ed c ea k ea c ea 3 f t 1 exp δ g cat f δ ψ rt 1 for δ g cat 0 0 for δ g cat 0 where c mol kg water 1 is concentration k is half saturation constant δ g cat j mol e 1 is the gibbs free energy of a metabolism s catabolic reaction under non standard conditions f c mol 1 is the faraday constant r j mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant t k 1 is temperature and δ ψ v is the electric potential across the membrane the subscripts ed and ea denote electron donor and electron acceptor respectively even though the value of δ ψ can be different for various low energy environments and for various metabolisms an evaluation of investigations on several distinct organisms led to the proposition that 120 mv can be considered a representative value for δ ψ dimroth et al 2003 kadenbach 2003 toei et al 2007 and daniels et al 1984 reported a value of 118 mv for δ ψ therefore here we assume that δ ψ is equal to 120 mv for all the considered metabolisms gibbs free energy of a reaction under non standard condition can be calculated as follow 4 δ g δ g rtlnq where δ g is the gibbs free energy of a reaction under biochemical standard conditions 25 c 1 atm ph 7 and chemical activity of unity jin and kirk 2018 and can be calculated by subtracting the sum of gibbs free energy of formation δ g f of substrates from that of products q is the reaction quotient for a hypothetical reaction aa bb cc dd reaction quotient is equal to 5 q c c d d a a b b where s is the activity of a reactant product s a b c d chemical speciation and activity of species are calculated using llnl thermodynamic database delany and lundeen 1990 and phreeqc v 3 ph redox equilibrium written in the c programming language parkhurst and appelo 2013 activity of s0 is assumed to be equal to its concentration gibbs helmholtz equation is used to correct δ g for non standard temperatures 6 δ g t δ g 298 15 t 298 15 δ h 298 15 298 15 t t where δ h 298 15 is the enthalpy of a reaction in standard conditions and can be calculated by subtracting the sum of enthalpies of formation of substrates δ h f from that of products the value of δ g f and δ h f for acetate is obtained from shock 1995 for inorganic species from shock et al 1997 and for biomass from roels 1980 the rate of biomass x formation is given by 7 dx dt μ b x where µ s 1 is the specific growth rate and b s 1 is the specific maintenance rate the specific growth rate is linked to respiration rate using growth yield y mol biomass mol ed 1 through the following relationship 8 μ y r x growth yield y is dependent on δ g cat δ g an and energy utilization efficiency of organisms vanbriesen 2002 in order to study the effect of changes in chemical variation in species concentrations and ph and physical e g temperature conditions the gibbs energy dynamic yield method gedym of smeaton and van cappellen 2018 is employed 9 y α δ g cat 2 β δ g cat δ g cat α v δ g cat 2 δ g cat β υ δ g cat α δ g an δ g an m δ g cat δ g an where α and β are model parameters and equal to 0 0004 and 0 0694 for a broad range of metabolisms including all major eas fermentation methanogenesis and acetogenesis smeaton and van cappellen only considered hydrogen as the non organic ed note that gedym has not been validated for nitrate reduction and sulfide oxidation pathways however as the model is valid for all the other metabolisms mentioned above here we assume that y for nitrate reduction and for sulfide oxidation pathways follows equation 9 as well according to equation 7 the biomass growth depends on the thermodynamic dependent terms of y and f t assuming that microorganisms that derive their energy from the various metabolisms i are all present ii have the same kinetic parameters such as v max ka and kd and iii have the same initial biomass concentration x terms y and f t determine which metabolism proceeds faster for each metabolism we consider a set of ph temperature and concentration of reactants and products in the range observed in petroleum reservoirs and sewer systems referred to as the base condition in order to analyze the temperature effect the temperature range of 1 to 110 c is evaluated this is because contrary to sewer systems where souring occurs in a relatively narrow temperature range in petroleum reservoirs souring can occur in a relatively broad temperature range anywhere between the injection temperature e g between 4 to 25 c if north sea water is injected climate data org 2021 to the reservoir temperature the temperature of subsurface reservoirs depends on their depth e g willems nick 2019 souring in temperatures higher than 110 c can be ignored as these temperatures preclude microbial activity thaysen et al 2021 since chemical compounds depending on temperature and ph can appear in water in various forms we define the base condition based on the sum of various forms in the base condition the water phase is saturated with s0 elemental sulfur solubility is calculated by exponential regression of data reported by kamyshny jr 2009 table 3 lists the base condition c 4 stands for the sum of carbonate species including carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate hco 3 carbonate co 3 2 and dissolved carbon dioxide co2 aq s 2 stands for the sum of sulfide species including dihydrogen sulfide h2s hydrogen sulfide hs and sulfide s2 n 3 stands for the sum of ammonium nh 4 and ammonia nh3 and c 0 stands for sum of acetate and acetic acid we investigate the variations in y and ft due to deviations from the base case by changing physical e g temperature and chemical conditions e g ph and ea concentration 4 results 4 1 variations in y and ft for sulfate reduction 4 1 1 effect of substrate concentration fig 1 a and b show y and ft of srm for various ed acetate and ea sulfate concentrations for the base case the value of y changes significantly from 0 4 for ea ed concentration of 0 028 m to zero if ea and ed concentration are both less than 10 5 m fig 1a this is because according to equation 4 by reducing the concentration of ea and ed reactants of srm catabolic reaction and ed reactant of srm anabolic reaction respectively the energy yield of the catabolic reaction δ g cat decreases and the energy demand of the anabolic reaction δ g an increases the value of ft follows a similar trend as y and decreases from a maximum of around 0 5 when ed and ea are high 0 028 m to around zero 6 10 4 m when ea and ed are minimal 10 10 m fig 1b 4 1 2 effect of ph fig 1c demonstrates the effect of ph on y and ft of srm for the base case in the ph range of 6 6 to 9 8 ft variations are relatively low and y shows only a small reduction considering the catabolic reaction of srm and equation 3 ft depends only on δ g cat and δ g cat depends on the activity of hco 3 h s and acetate since the activity of these species is relatively ph independent in the ph range of 6 6 to 9 8 δ g cat and consequently ft stay relatively constant the value of y depends on both δ g cat and δ g an while δ g cat is relatively constant in the range of 6 6 to 9 8 due to decrease in nh 4 fig 2 d δ g an increases slightly and this leads to a small reduction in y from 0 18 to 0 14 for ph values less than 6 6 and above 9 8 decreases in the activity of hco 3 and h s result in increases in y and ft for ph values less than 6 6 the decrease in acetate activity cancels out the effect of reduction in hco 3 and h s activity therefore the slope of ft that is the absolute value of the derivative of ft is slightly sharper for ph values higher than 9 8 0 19 per unit ph than ph 6 6 0 16 per unit ph for ph values above 9 8 a significant decrease in nh 4 activity causes a significant increase in δ g an the increase in δ g an cancels out the decrease in δ g cat and as a result the increase in y values due to an increase in ph above 9 8 0 04 mol biomass per mol ed is less than the increase in y values due to a decrease in ph below 6 8 0 13 mol biomass per mol ed 4 1 3 effect of temperature fig 1d illustrates the impact of temperature on y and ft of srm for the base case increase in temperature increases the catabolic energy yield δ g cat as well as δ g an while y decreases slightly from 0 19 to 0 17 mol biomass per mol ed as it depends on both δ g cat and δ g an ft increases by a factor of 2 from 0 13 to 0 26 since it is only dependent on δ g cat fig 1e demonstrates how h s concentration affects y and ft as h s is the product of the catabolic reaction of srm the reduction in h s increases δ g cat and as a result both y and ft for srm increase 4 2 variations in y and ft for nitrate reduction various nitrate reduction pathways considered in this study have a sufficiently high δ g cat such that ft for all of them is equal to one under the conditions for which y is plotted in fig 3 4 2 1 effect of substrate concentration fig 3 shows y for the various nitrate reduction pathways listed in table 1 for the base case when the ed concentration increases growth yield increases for all nitrate reduction pathways the smallest y values are associated with lanrm1 and lhnrm1 maximum 0 12 and 0 34 respectively fig 3a since these two metabolisms have the lowest δ g cat 181 96 kj per mol ed the value of δ g an for lanrm1 82 09 kj per mol biomass is the smallest value among δ g an of other nitrate reduction metabolisms listed in table 1 however the value of δ g an for lanrm1 as function of ed concentration h s varies from 1 1 to 145 kj per mol biomass therefore while lanrm1 and lhnrm1 have the same δ g cat lanrm1 has a lower δ g an compared to lhnrm1 41 84 kj per mol biomass for ed concentrations greater than 2 4 10 5 a smaller δ g an for lanrm1 does not cause a higher y value compared to lhnrm1 as y depends also on the number of moles of ed υ that is utilized in order to synthesize 1 mol of biomass smeaton and van cappellen 2018 in lanrm1 metabolism υ 2 1 only 1 2 1 y fraction of the ed black dashed line in fig 3b is oxidized for energy production while in lhnrm1 metabolism υ 0 the ed oxidation only serves for energy production this can be the reason why y values of lhnrm1 are higher than those of lanrm1 despite having an equal δ g cat and a higher δ g an the y values for a given ed concentration e g 10 4 m ed are higher for onrm 0 77 fig 3b than lanrm3 0 64 fig 3b since onrm metabolism has a higher δ g cat 536 0 kj per mol ed than lanrm3 487 9 kj per mol ed the metabolism of onrm has also a higher δ g cat compared to lhnrm3 however the value of υ is equal to 0 525 for onrm and 0 for lhnrm3 that is while δ g cat of onrm is equal to 536 0 kj per mol ed only between 50 to 74 of it solid line fig 3b is used for energy production as a result the energy produced by oxidation of 1 mol ed in onrm metabolism is in the range of 57 to 82 of that of lhnrm3 dotted line in fig 3b therefore for a given ed concentration e g 10 4 m ed y values for lhnrm3 1 1 mol biomass per mol ed are higher than for onrm 0 77 similar to the plot of y versus ed concentration fig 3a the plot of y versus ea concentration fig 3c has a positive slope for all nitrate reduction metabolisms however the slope of y versus log of ea concentration is smaller than the slope of y versus log of ed concentration for metabolisms with υ 0 this is because ed is present in both catabolic and anabolic reaction whereas ea is only present in the anabolic reaction for metabolisms that partially oxidize hs the stoichiometric coefficient of ea is a quarter of the stoichiometric coefficient of ed consequently δ g cat is a stronger function of ed concentration than of ea concentration 4 2 2 effect of ph fig 3d illustrates that in general an increase in ph decreases y for all the nitrate reducing metabolisms as they are all proton consuming however for low ph values from 3 to 5 the influence of increasing ph on δ g cat is canceled out by an increase in hs activity fig 2b for lanrm1 and lhnrm1 the stoichiometric ratio of hs to h is bigger for complete oxidation of sulfide compared to the partial oxidation in consequence in the ph range of 3 to 5 the impact of an increase in hs concentration on δ g cat of lhnrm3 and lanrm3 is higher than the impact of an increase in ph leading to an increase in y the ph increase effect in onrm metabolism is canceled out by the increase in acetate concentration fig 2c in the ph range of 3 to 4 the reduction in y decreases in ph values higher than 10 for all metabolisms due to reduction of nh 4 concentration for onrm metabolism ph values higher than 10 also reduce hco 3 concentration consequently the y value for onrm levels off relatively at ph 10 4 2 3 effect of temperature and sulfate concentration similar to srm metabolism temperature influence on y value of onrm lhnrm3 lanrm3 is relatively insignificant maximum 3 6 6 0 and 4 0 change respectively the y values of lhnrm1 and lanrm1 increase significantly from 0 27 to 0 41 and from 0 07 to 0 14 by a reduction in temperature from 110 to 4 c since the decrease in temperature reduces s0 solubility kamyshny jr 2009 among all nitrate reducing metabolisms y of lanrm3 and lhnrm3 depend on sulfate concentration fig 3f shows that y of lanrm3 is greater than y of onrm for sulfate concentrations lower than 10 5m 5 discussion 5 1 importance of taking into account variations in y and ft srm activity has caused detrimental consequences such as corrosion and reservoir plugging for seawater injection into oil reservoirs youssef et al 2009 in sewer systems the h2s produced by srm is a major source of odor nuisance jiang et al 2015 and corrosion of concrete sewer pipes pikaar et al 2019 modeling srm activity is also essential for mainstream anaerobic digestion technology development durán et al 2020 microbial sulfate reduction models have been used to predict the extent of reservoir souring aiming to minimize the impacts and costs of srm activity to the best of our knowledge in these models y has been always assumed to be a constant and the energy that srm require to maintain transmembrane electric potentials has been ignored i e ft 1 e g cheng et al 2016 haghshenas et al 2012 veshareh et al 2021 underestimation or overestimation of souring in seawater injection can cause erroneous material design for injection production wells and surface facilities johnson et al 2017 additionally inaccurate estimate of souring does not allow efficient treatment design for example in nitrate treatment over usage of nitrate can lead to accumulation of nitrite which increases corrosion in production wells huang and zhang 2006 the growth yield of srm varies significantly from around 0 33 when the concentration of srm ed and ea is around the maximum concentration observed in typical seawater flooding processes 0 028 m vigneron et al 2017 to zero for ed and ea concentrations smaller than 1µm fig 1a in sewer systems petroleum reservoirs as well as the biofilm of bioreactors there is invariably a gradient of substrates as our results show the value of y that controls souring in time and space domains is significantly dependent on the substrate concentrations assuming a constant y value the value of which depends on the laboratory conditions under which y has been determined will thus cause over or underestimation of souring rates in that given time and location due to the low exergonicity of srm catabolic reaction and depending on the concentration of ed and ea srm kinetics will be thermodynamically limited by 60 to around 100 ft 0 to 0 4 fig 1b that is while assuming a constant y may over or underestimate souring rate ignoring ft will always lead to overestimation of souring therefore accurate souring simulation requires considering both of these thermodynamic dependent parameters among various environmental conditions ph is a classical physiological parameter in order to tolerate acidic or alkaline conditions microorganisms require special surface properties that protect cells from proton or hydroxide ions golyshina and timmis 2005 horikoshi 1999 very low or high ph values restrict microbial reactions due to various reasons for example at low ph conjugate acids become abundant and diffuse into cell membrane destabilizing the membrane and dissipating proton motive force russell and dombrowski 1980 our results show that in near neutral ph with an increase in ph the srm rate decreases due to reduction in both ft and y the effect of ph on srm activity has been well studied in the context of wastewater treatment since the ph of waste water can be subject to significant changes due to processes such as fermentation of organics or treatment with alkali sharma et al 2013 gutierrez et al 2009 reported that a ph increase from 7 6 to 8 6 and 9 0 reduces the biological sulfate reduction by 30 to 50 to further highlight the importance of considering the effect of thermodynamics on souring kinetics we compare our data with experimental and modelling data published by sharma et al 2014 these authors conducted several batch experiments using a sewer biofilm reactor at various ph values in the range of 4 0 to 9 0 and observed that sulfate reduction rate is maximal at ph 6 3 and decreases when ph deviates from this value in order to model the ph effect sharma et al 2014 used the ph inhibition expression proposed by angelidaki et al 1993 for ph values lower than 6 75 and for higher ph values they employed the non competitive inhibition model of siegrist et al 2002 that is focused on free ammonia the model developed by sharma et al 2014 predicts that souring rate in the range of 6 4 to 8 3 is independent from ph i e is constant whereas experimental data shows that souring rate decreases with increase in ph in this range fig 4 a the model of sharma et al 2014 ignores variations in y due to ph change and does not take into account any thermodynamic limiting factor since the rate of sulfate reduction in the course of sharma et al 2014 experiments fig 2 in their work is constant the effect of y variations can be neglected to evaluate whether the variations in sulfate reduction rate in the ph range of 6 4 to 8 3 is related to changes in ft we consider the value of sulfate reduction rate at a reference value and predict other sulfate reduction rates using the following equation 10 r ph r ref f t ph f t ref fig 4a shows a good agreement between the values predicted using equation 10 and the experimental data therefore considering ft with δ ψ 100 mv can explain changes in sulfate reduction rate in the ph range of 6 4 to 8 3 the strong correlation between ft and rates is probably due to the minimal impact of physiological parameters as ph values are relatively close to neutral note that in ph higher than 7 δ g cat is less than 45 kj fig 4b i e the model introduced by jin and bethke 2003 would predict ft to be equal to zero therefore using the thermodynamic limitation factor proposed by larowe et al 2012 seems to be more appropriate for modeling souring high ph values also decrease h2s liquid to gas mass transfer increasing the total dissolved sulfide ganigue et al 2011 higher dissolved sulfide concentrations reduce srm activity not only due to its toxicity kushkevych et al 2019 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 but also by reducing the δ g cat of sulfate reduction fig 1e 5 2 is it valid to use the gedym for lnrm pathways as mentioned earlier in the methodology section we assume that gedym is valid for estimating the growth yield of lithotrophic metabolisms listed in table 1 zeng and zhang 2005 conducted two batch experiments and measured the growth yield for lanrm2 to be 0 75 and 0 85 the growth yield values calculated in this work using gedym fig 3e matches these experimental values suggesting that gedym holds true also for lithotrophic nitrate reduction based sulfide oxidation 5 3 what nitrate reduction pathway is expected to be faster thermodynamically assuming i a diverse microbial community that can sustain the various nitrate reduction pathways considered in this study ii all community members have the same kinetic parameters and initial biomass concentration and iii the concentration of ea and ed is equal for all metabolisms lhnrm3 is around two times faster than onrm pathway for various physiochemical conditions found in typical petroleum reservoirs this is in disagreement with the work of dolfing and hubert 2017 where except for special conditions such as low temperature or low acetate to h2s ratios onrm pathway is predicted to prevail this is because dolfing and hubert 2017 consider the pathway with a higher δ g cat as the dominant pathway while not considering the anabolic reaction our results highlights that to find the dominant metabolism among metabolic pathways with high catabolic energy yields i e ft 1 δ g cat cannot be used directly to reveal the dominant pathway as it has been used for other metabolisms such as methanogenesis or acetogenesis jin and kirk 2018 note that while the value of y allows a quantitative comparison between the rate of two metabolisms in a system at its initial condition the relationship of respiration rate and y is not linear and rather exponential equations 1 7 and 8 therefore a two time higher y of lhnrm3 compared to that of onrm can lead to lhnrm3 domination this is in agreement with various studies available in the literature hubert et al 2003 injected nitrate into a soured bioreactor sulfide concentration of 12 mm and observed that despite injection of 25 mm lactate nitrate reduction was entirely coupled to sulfide oxidation to sulfate lambo et al 2008 showed that lithotrophic reduction of nitrate always preceded organotrophic reduction of nitrate mathioudakis et al 2006 by conducting experiments on sour waste water samples sulfide concentration of around 1mm reported that nitrate reduction is preferentially autotrophic and that heterotrophic nitrate reduction only commenced after sulfide had been completely oxidized in another study okabe et al 2003 observed that in sewer biofilm experiments 65 of the h2s produced by srm residing in deeper layers of the biofilm was oxidized via lnrm in shallower layers a similar observation has been reported by garcia de lomas et al 2007 dolfing and hubert 2017 discussed whether lnrm1 or lnrm3 is expected to be the dominant lnrm pathways by comparing the δg of acetate driven reduction of sulfate and s0 they proposed that because δg of acetate driven reduction of s0 is less than acetate driven reduction of sulfate lnrm1 is the dominant lnrm pathway they suggested that the dominance of lnrm1 is more likely at lower temperatures as the differences between δg of acetate driven reduction of s0 and that of acetate driven reduction of sulfate increases with temperature according to our results fig 3 under all studied conditions lithotrophic sulfide based nitrate reduction is envisaged to be through lnrm3 pathways rather than lnrm1 due to significantly higher y values 1 6 to 17 times 5 4 why does elemental sulfur accumulation occur the low growth yield of lithotrophic nitrate reduction coupled to partial sulfide oxidation to sulfur lanrm1 and lhnrm1 does not imply that nitrate treatment does not cause s0 production it merely means that if all the parameters that affect various nitrate reduction pathways are equal and if oxidation of sulfide to sulfate in a single step is possible thermodynamically a lower fraction of nitrate reduction is coupled to partial sulfide oxidation and a higher fraction of nitrate is coupled to either complete sulfide oxidation or to oxidation of organic compounds veshareh et al 2021 showed that nitrate treatment by desulfobacterium autotrophicum and a microbial community of a production water enrichment that contained organotrophic nitrate reducing members from delta and gammaproteobacteria caused s concentrations of 17 to 22 µm jiang et al 2009 observed that lithotrophic nitrate reduction based sulfide oxidation occurs first by oxidation of sulfide to sulfur lnrm1 followed by oxidation of sulfur to sulfate lnrm2 these authors reported that the rate of lnrm2 is 15 of that of lnrm1 yang et al 2005 observed that elemental sulfur was the end product of nitrate based sulfide oxidation the accumulation of s0 due to nt has also been reported by liang et al 2016 fig 3 shows that lnrm2 metabolisms have higher y values than lnrm1 metabolisms due to significantly higher δ g cat values i e based on thermodynamics the rate of lnrm2 should be higher than that of lnrm1 fig 4c demonstrates why lnrm2 can be slower than lnrm1 even though it is thermodynamically more favorable sulfur solubility in water is extremely low and increases exponentially with temperature from 6 3 10 9 at 4 c to 6 3 10 7 m at 80 c kamyshny jr 2009 by considering 1 7 10 5 m mora et al 2015 as the half saturation constant for sulfur and assuming that the environment is saturated with sulfur the limiting kinetic term fk will be between 2 10 4 and 4 10 3 for 4 c and 80 c respectively that is if we ignore the dependency of lnrm1 on any other factor reduction in temperature from 80 to 4 c makes lnrm1 20 times slower merely because of the reduction in s0 solubility therefore decrease in temperature does not promote s0 accumulation only by increasing the growth yield of lnrm1 due to an increase in y but mainly by reducing s0 solubility and thereby reducing the rate of s0 oxidation to sulfate this explains why in sewer systems where the temperature is relatively low around ambient temperature nt is associated with elemental sulfur production as shown by liang et al 2016 and jiang et al 2009 in reservoir souring processes s0 accumulation can be expected to occur mainly in injection tubing and near the well bore area however the extent of s0 accumulation can spread to the production well provided presence of fractures reduce the travel time between the injection and production wells and thereby reducing the water temperature in the production well given the abovementioned temperature dependence of s0 accumulation one can conclude that heating injection water can remediate the s0 related corrosion associated with nt of reservoir souring note that in fig 4 only the range of 4 to 80 c has been considered because we did not have s0 solubility data outside this range 5 5 single step sulfide oxidation vs two step sulfide oxidation single step nitrate based oxidation of sulfide lnrm3 seems to have both the thermodynamic advantage as well as the kinetic advantage as no elemental sulfur is produced as an intermediate however cui et al 2019 reported that nitrate reducers that catalyze single step sulfide oxidation to sulfate can only harvest two electrons per nitrate reduced as the nitrate reduction pathways stops at nitrite due to a lack of nitrite reductase the nitrite produced in the single step oxidation of sulfide to sulfate is then reduced further by nitrate reducers that oxidize sulfide in two steps therefore two step sulfide oxidation has a physiological advantage and is expected to always co occur with the single step sulfide oxidation as the organisms involved can reduce nitrite cui et al 2019 showed that compared to the two step sulfide oxidation single step oxidation of sulfide is more sensitive to sulfide suggesting that the physiological advantage of two step sulfide oxidation when nitrate treatment is applied increases with the souring level these observations have implications for souring management where i low temperatures ii limited nitrate availability compared to sulfide or iii limited travel time between the injection and production well can cause elemental sulfur accumulation therefore we speculate that souring treatment efficiency by nitrate injection can be improved by i early treatment ii increasing temperature iii making sure that stoichiometrically enough nitrate is available for sulfide oxidation and iv reducing injection flow rate in the case of souring in petroleum reservoirs such that sufficient time is given to lnrm2 to complete sulfide oxidation from sulfur to sulfate note that half hearted measures that include only some of these conditions may cause even more severe souring problems as for example increase in temperature can increase h2s emission from the liquid phase to the gas phase 6 caveats and future directions zhang et al 2018 have shown that polysulfide formation substantially increases the rate of organotrophic sulfur reduction to sulfide qiu et al 2020 showed that sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is substantially enhanced due to polysulfide formation this is why zhang et al 2021 introduced polysulfide as an electron shuttle that accelerates sulfur oxidation or reduction indeed the polysulfide formation step should not be ignored in the simulation of sulfide sulfur sulfate transformations when the exact value of elemental sulfur accumulation or the rate of accumulation is to be evaluated however in this study polysulfide formation from sulfide and elemental sulfur and polysulfide oxidation to sulfide has been ignored in the sulfur cycle because rather than estimating the pool sizes of the s0 species the aim was to predict the likelihood of elemental sulfur accumulation future work can validate the proposed methodology in this paper for polysulfide oxidation and study whether the faster oxidation reduction rates of polysulfide is due to the thermodynamic advantage of this species under varied physiochemical conditions 7 conclusions the key findings of this study can be summarized as follows growth yield can be used to link the differences in energetics of microbial reactions with their kinetics for metabolisms that have a sufficiently high δ g cat such that thermodynamic limiting factor is equal to one since the kinetic parameters of souring processes can be substantially affected by thermodynamics it is essential to couple souring models to a thermodynamic model that takes into account the effect of variations in catabolic energy yield and anabolic energy demand on the metabolism rate compared to other nitrate reduction pathways such as organotrophic nitrate reduction based on the magnitude of growth yield single step lithoheterotrophic nitrate reduction driven sulfide oxidation to sulfate is expected to be the dominant nitrate reduction pathway in sour systems even though nitrate reduction sulfur oxidation to sulfate is thermodynamically expected to be faster than nitrate reduction sulfide oxidation to sulfur it is slower due to the low solubility of elemental sulfur elemental sulfur accumulation associated with nitrate reduction driven sulfide oxidation is prevalent at lower temperatures due to the exponential decrease of sulfur solubility with temperature declaration of

16535,souring is the unwanted formation of hydrogen sulfide h2s by sulfate reducing microorganisms srm in sewer systems and seawater flooded oil reservoirs nitrate treatment nt is one of the major methods to alleviate souring the mechanism of souring remediation by nt is stimulation of nitrate reducing microorganisms nrm that depending on the nitrate reduction pathway can outcompete srm for common electron donors or oxidize sulfide to sulfate however some nitrate reduction pathways may challenge the efficacy of nt therefore a precise understanding of souring rate nitrate reduction rate and pathways is crucial for efficient souring management here we investigate the necessity of incorporating two thermodynamic dependent kinetic parameters namely the growth yield y and ft a parameter related to the minimum catabolic energy production required by cells to utilize a given catabolic reaction we first show that depending on physiochemical conditions y and ft for srm change significantly in the range of 0 0 4 mole biomass per mole electron donor and 0 0006 0 5 respectively suggesting that these parameters should not be considered constant and that it is important to couple souring models with thermodynamic models then we highlight this further by showing an experimental dataset that can be modeled very well by considering variable ft next we show that nitrate based lithotrophic sulfide oxidation to sulfate lnrm3 is the dominant nitrate reduction pathway then arguing that thermodynamics would suggest that s consumption should proceed faster than s0 production we infer that the reason for frequently observed s0 accumulation is its low solubility last we suggest that nitrate based souring treatment will suffer less from s0 accumulation if we i act

common problem in sewer systems jiang et al 2014 and secondary oil recovery by seawater flooding veshareh and ayatollahi 2019 due to the odorant corrosive and toxic nature of h2s nitrate treatment nt is one of the intervention methods to control souring by stimulating nitrate reducing microorganisms an et al 2010 nitrate can suppress souring by various mechanisms such as activating organotrophic nitrate reducing microorganisms onrm that may outcompete srm for the available organic matter agrawal et al 2012 and reducing sulfide concentration by stimulating lithotrophic nitrate reducing microorganisms lnrm veshareh et al 2021 lithotrophic nitrate reduction based sulfide oxidation can be associated with biogenic elemental sulfur s0 huang et al 2015 due to the corrosive character of s0 lahme et al 2019 schmitt 1991 its accumulation can reduce the efficiency of nt dolfing and hubert 2017 therefore an understanding of likely nitrate reduction pathways as well as kinetics of sulfate and nitrate reduction is essential for designing promising nt plans respiring prokaryotes catalyze redox reactions called catabolic reactions to derive energy for growth and maintenance jin 2012 the amount of free energy available from various redox reactions or gibbs free energy of catabolic reaction δ g cat has been used by scientists as a method to compare the likelihood of different metabolisms pathways for example dolfing and hubert 2017 used this method to predict nitrate reduction pathways in nitrate based oil reservoir souring mitigation since under typical oil reservoir conditions δ g cat of nitrate reduction coupled to acetate oxidation was higher than nitrate reduction coupled to sulfide oxidation they proposed that under realistic oil field conditions nitrate reduction is more likely to be organotrophic rather than lithotrophic dolfing and hubert 2017 claimed that lithotrophic nitrate reduction coupled to partial oxidation of sulfide to sulfur is an exception and can be more favorable than organotrophic nitrate reduction as far as acetate to sulfide molar ratio is less than 0 001 or the temperature is sufficiently low additionally showing that per mole of nitrate sulfide oxidation to s0 releases slightly more energy than sulfide oxidation to sulfate they suggested that s0 accumulation is likely to occur under nitrate limiting conditions the assessment of dolfing and hubert labels one metabolism pathway as favorable and the other as unfavorable and does not allow an energy based quantitative comparison between the occurrence likelihood of each metabolism we are not aware of any previous research that has used thermodynamics to make a quantitative comparison between the occurrence likelihood of various nitrate reduction pathways in presence of sulfide and s0 however for some other metabolisms such as syntrophic oxidation iron reduction sulfate reduction and methanogenesis jin and kirk 2016 and jin and kirk 2018 used a thermodynamic limiting factor ft that relates the rate of microbial metabolisms to δ g cat the ft coefficient is not the only term that links thermodynamics to metabolism kinetics growth yield y is another parameter that controls the kinetics of microbial metabolisms and is a function of δ g cat and of the gibbs free energy of anabolic reaction δ g an jin and roden 2011 smeaton and van cappellen 2018 to the best of our knowledge no previous research work has used growth yield to relate thermodynamics of microbial reactions to their kinetics note that y and ft have been assumed to be constant in biomass explicit microbial kinetic models used over the last decades to simulate souring and its mitigation with nitrate hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 sharma et al 2008 veshareh and nick 2019 2021a 2021b as such the error associated with assuming y and ft parameters to be constant in simulation of souring process and nitrate based souring mitigation measures is unknown to address the abovementioned gaps in this article we calculate y and ft to evaluate the range in which they vary under various physiochemical conditions such as electron donor ed and electron acceptor ea availability ph and temperature relevant to sewer systems and petroleum reservoirs we then use y to link thermodynamics of sulfur and nitrogen cycle to their kinetics using this link we first revisit the questions raised by dolfing and hubert 2017 by illuminating whether nitrate reduction is more likely to be organotrophic or lithotrophic and whether or not s0 accumulation during nt is due to a thermodynamic drive lastly we suggest some measures to minimize s0 accumulation in nt of souring 2 theory lithotrophic nitrate reducers can obtain their energy by i oxidation of sulfide to sulfur lnrm1 ii oxidation of sulfur to sulfate lnrm2 and iii direct oxidation of sulfide to sulfate lnrm3 regardless of whether nitrate is reduced through lnrm or onrm it is reduced either to nitrogen gases through denitrification or to ammonium through dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnra callbeck et al 2013 however various research works e g veshareh and nick 2019 and marietou et al 2020 have shown that dnra is the responsible nitrate reduction pathway in nitrate mitigation of reservoir souring therefore here we do not consider redox reactions related to the denitrification pathway lithotrophic nitrate reducing microorganisms can be autotrophic lanrm hamilton et al 2015 or heterotrophic lhnrm miroshnichenko et al 2003 various organic compounds can serve as the ed of srm and onrm however dolfing and hubert 2017 showed that the energy yield of srm and onrm metabolisms is independent of the type of the organic ed used therefore here we only consider acetate as the ed and as the organic carbon source for cell synthesis of organotrophic and lithoheterotrophic metabolisms catabolic and anabolic reactions are from or are based on the methodology introduced by smeaton and van cappellen 2018 table 1 and 2 list the catabolic and anabolic reactions that represent various metabolisms studied in this work chemical compounds in the aqueous phase can lose or obtain protons or hydroxide due to reaction with water molecules or combine with other ions or molecules in a process called speciation jin and kirk 2018 due to speciation chemical compounds dissolved in water can exist in various forms or chemical species as a result environmental ph can affect the energetics of redox reactions directly by changing the chemical activity of protons for redox reactions that consume or produce protons or indirectly by controlling the speciation of reactants and products in this work all reactions are written using dominant chemical species at ph 7 at a neutral ph hydrogen sulfide hs occurs in relatively equal proportions as dihydrogen sulfide h2s following smeaton and van cappellen 2018 we choose hs catabolic and anabolic reactions are written per mole ed and per mole biomass respectively 3 methodology according to the thermodynamically consistent rate law jin and bethke 2005 2007 respiration rate r mol ed s 1 can be written as follows 1 r v max x f k f t where v max mol ed mol biomass 1 s 1 is the maximum rate of a metabolism x is the biomass concentration mol kg water 1 f k is a kinetic limiting term and f t is a thermodynamic limiting term according to monod 1949 and larowe et al 2014 f k and f t can be defined as follows 2 f k c ed k ed c ed c ea k ea c ea 3 f t 1 exp δ g cat f δ ψ rt 1 for δ g cat 0 0 for δ g cat 0 where c mol kg water 1 is concentration k is half saturation constant δ g cat j mol e 1 is the gibbs free energy of a metabolism s catabolic reaction under non standard conditions f c mol 1 is the faraday constant r j mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant t k 1 is temperature and δ ψ v is the electric potential across the membrane the subscripts ed and ea denote electron donor and electron acceptor respectively even though the value of δ ψ can be different for various low energy environments and for various metabolisms an evaluation of investigations on several distinct organisms led to the proposition that 120 mv can be considered a representative value for δ ψ dimroth et al 2003 kadenbach 2003 toei et al 2007 and daniels et al 1984 reported a value of 118 mv for δ ψ therefore here we assume that δ ψ is equal to 120 mv for all the considered metabolisms gibbs free energy of a reaction under non standard condition can be calculated as follow 4 δ g δ g rtlnq where δ g is the gibbs free energy of a reaction under biochemical standard conditions 25 c 1 atm ph 7 and chemical activity of unity jin and kirk 2018 and can be calculated by subtracting the sum of gibbs free energy of formation δ g f of substrates from that of products q is the reaction quotient for a hypothetical reaction aa bb cc dd reaction quotient is equal to 5 q c c d d a a b b where s is the activity of a reactant product s a b c d chemical speciation and activity of species are calculated using llnl thermodynamic database delany and lundeen 1990 and phreeqc v 3 ph redox equilibrium written in the c programming language parkhurst and appelo 2013 activity of s0 is assumed to be equal to its concentration gibbs helmholtz equation is used to correct δ g for non standard temperatures 6 δ g t δ g 298 15 t 298 15 δ h 298 15 298 15 t t where δ h 298 15 is the enthalpy of a reaction in standard conditions and can be calculated by subtracting the sum of enthalpies of formation of substrates δ h f from that of products the value of δ g f and δ h f for acetate is obtained from shock 1995 for inorganic species from shock et al 1997 and for biomass from roels 1980 the rate of biomass x formation is given by 7 dx dt μ b x where µ s 1 is the specific growth rate and b s 1 is the specific maintenance rate the specific growth rate is linked to respiration rate using growth yield y mol biomass mol ed 1 through the following relationship 8 μ y r x growth yield y is dependent on δ g cat δ g an and energy utilization efficiency of organisms vanbriesen 2002 in order to study the effect of changes in chemical variation in species concentrations and ph and physical e g temperature conditions the gibbs energy dynamic yield method gedym of smeaton and van cappellen 2018 is employed 9 y α δ g cat 2 β δ g cat δ g cat α v δ g cat 2 δ g cat β υ δ g cat α δ g an δ g an m δ g cat δ g an where α and β are model parameters and equal to 0 0004 and 0 0694 for a broad range of metabolisms including all major eas fermentation methanogenesis and acetogenesis smeaton and van cappellen only considered hydrogen as the non organic ed note that gedym has not been validated for nitrate reduction and sulfide oxidation pathways however as the model is valid for all the other metabolisms mentioned above here we assume that y for nitrate reduction and for sulfide oxidation pathways follows equation 9 as well according to equation 7 the biomass growth depends on the thermodynamic dependent terms of y and f t assuming that microorganisms that derive their energy from the various metabolisms i are all present ii have the same kinetic parameters such as v max ka and kd and iii have the same initial biomass concentration x terms y and f t determine which metabolism proceeds faster for each metabolism we consider a set of ph temperature and concentration of reactants and products in the range observed in petroleum reservoirs and sewer systems referred to as the base condition in order to analyze the temperature effect the temperature range of 1 to 110 c is evaluated this is because contrary to sewer systems where souring occurs in a relatively narrow temperature range in petroleum reservoirs souring can occur in a relatively broad temperature range anywhere between the injection temperature e g between 4 to 25 c if north sea water is injected climate data org 2021 to the reservoir temperature the temperature of subsurface reservoirs depends on their depth e g willems nick 2019 souring in temperatures higher than 110 c can be ignored as these temperatures preclude microbial activity thaysen et al 2021 since chemical compounds depending on temperature and ph can appear in water in various forms we define the base condition based on the sum of various forms in the base condition the water phase is saturated with s0 elemental sulfur solubility is calculated by exponential regression of data reported by kamyshny jr 2009 table 3 lists the base condition c 4 stands for the sum of carbonate species including carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate hco 3 carbonate co 3 2 and dissolved carbon dioxide co2 aq s 2 stands for the sum of sulfide species including dihydrogen sulfide h2s hydrogen sulfide hs and sulfide s2 n 3 stands for the sum of ammonium nh 4 and ammonia nh3 and c 0 stands for sum of acetate and acetic acid we investigate the variations in y and ft due to deviations from the base case by changing physical e g temperature and chemical conditions e g ph and ea concentration 4 results 4 1 variations in y and ft for sulfate reduction 4 1 1 effect of substrate concentration fig 1 a and b show y and ft of srm for various ed acetate and ea sulfate concentrations for the base case the value of y changes significantly from 0 4 for ea ed concentration of 0 028 m to zero if ea and ed concentration are both less than 10 5 m fig 1a this is because according to equation 4 by reducing the concentration of ea and ed reactants of srm catabolic reaction and ed reactant of srm anabolic reaction respectively the energy yield of the catabolic reaction δ g cat decreases and the energy demand of the anabolic reaction δ g an increases the value of ft follows a similar trend as y and decreases from a maximum of around 0 5 when ed and ea are high 0 028 m to around zero 6 10 4 m when ea and ed are minimal 10 10 m fig 1b 4 1 2 effect of ph fig 1c demonstrates the effect of ph on y and ft of srm for the base case in the ph range of 6 6 to 9 8 ft variations are relatively low and y shows only a small reduction considering the catabolic reaction of srm and equation 3 ft depends only on δ g cat and δ g cat depends on the activity of hco 3 h s and acetate since the activity of these species is relatively ph independent in the ph range of 6 6 to 9 8 δ g cat and consequently ft stay relatively constant the value of y depends on both δ g cat and δ g an while δ g cat is relatively constant in the range of 6 6 to 9 8 due to decrease in nh 4 fig 2 d δ g an increases slightly and this leads to a small reduction in y from 0 18 to 0 14 for ph values less than 6 6 and above 9 8 decreases in the activity of hco 3 and h s result in increases in y and ft for ph values less than 6 6 the decrease in acetate activity cancels out the effect of reduction in hco 3 and h s activity therefore the slope of ft that is the absolute value of the derivative of ft is slightly sharper for ph values higher than 9 8 0 19 per unit ph than ph 6 6 0 16 per unit ph for ph values above 9 8 a significant decrease in nh 4 activity causes a significant increase in δ g an the increase in δ g an cancels out the decrease in δ g cat and as a result the increase in y values due to an increase in ph above 9 8 0 04 mol biomass per mol ed is less than the increase in y values due to a decrease in ph below 6 8 0 13 mol biomass per mol ed 4 1 3 effect of temperature fig 1d illustrates the impact of temperature on y and ft of srm for the base case increase in temperature increases the catabolic energy yield δ g cat as well as δ g an while y decreases slightly from 0 19 to 0 17 mol biomass per mol ed as it depends on both δ g cat and δ g an ft increases by a factor of 2 from 0 13 to 0 26 since it is only dependent on δ g cat fig 1e demonstrates how h s concentration affects y and ft as h s is the product of the catabolic reaction of srm the reduction in h s increases δ g cat and as a result both y and ft for srm increase 4 2 variations in y and ft for nitrate reduction various nitrate reduction pathways considered in this study have a sufficiently high δ g cat such that ft for all of them is equal to one under the conditions for which y is plotted in fig 3 4 2 1 effect of substrate concentration fig 3 shows y for the various nitrate reduction pathways listed in table 1 for the base case when the ed concentration increases growth yield increases for all nitrate reduction pathways the smallest y values are associated with lanrm1 and lhnrm1 maximum 0 12 and 0 34 respectively fig 3a since these two metabolisms have the lowest δ g cat 181 96 kj per mol ed the value of δ g an for lanrm1 82 09 kj per mol biomass is the smallest value among δ g an of other nitrate reduction metabolisms listed in table 1 however the value of δ g an for lanrm1 as function of ed concentration h s varies from 1 1 to 145 kj per mol biomass therefore while lanrm1 and lhnrm1 have the same δ g cat lanrm1 has a lower δ g an compared to lhnrm1 41 84 kj per mol biomass for ed concentrations greater than 2 4 10 5 a smaller δ g an for lanrm1 does not cause a higher y value compared to lhnrm1 as y depends also on the number of moles of ed υ that is utilized in order to synthesize 1 mol of biomass smeaton and van cappellen 2018 in lanrm1 metabolism υ 2 1 only 1 2 1 y fraction of the ed black dashed line in fig 3b is oxidized for energy production while in lhnrm1 metabolism υ 0 the ed oxidation only serves for energy production this can be the reason why y values of lhnrm1 are higher than those of lanrm1 despite having an equal δ g cat and a higher δ g an the y values for a given ed concentration e g 10 4 m ed are higher for onrm 0 77 fig 3b than lanrm3 0 64 fig 3b since onrm metabolism has a higher δ g cat 536 0 kj per mol ed than lanrm3 487 9 kj per mol ed the metabolism of onrm has also a higher δ g cat compared to lhnrm3 however the value of υ is equal to 0 525 for onrm and 0 for lhnrm3 that is while δ g cat of onrm is equal to 536 0 kj per mol ed only between 50 to 74 of it solid line fig 3b is used for energy production as a result the energy produced by oxidation of 1 mol ed in onrm metabolism is in the range of 57 to 82 of that of lhnrm3 dotted line in fig 3b therefore for a given ed concentration e g 10 4 m ed y values for lhnrm3 1 1 mol biomass per mol ed are higher than for onrm 0 77 similar to the plot of y versus ed concentration fig 3a the plot of y versus ea concentration fig 3c has a positive slope for all nitrate reduction metabolisms however the slope of y versus log of ea concentration is smaller than the slope of y versus log of ed concentration for metabolisms with υ 0 this is because ed is present in both catabolic and anabolic reaction whereas ea is only present in the anabolic reaction for metabolisms that partially oxidize hs the stoichiometric coefficient of ea is a quarter of the stoichiometric coefficient of ed consequently δ g cat is a stronger function of ed concentration than of ea concentration 4 2 2 effect of ph fig 3d illustrates that in general an increase in ph decreases y for all the nitrate reducing metabolisms as they are all proton consuming however for low ph values from 3 to 5 the influence of increasing ph on δ g cat is canceled out by an increase in hs activity fig 2b for lanrm1 and lhnrm1 the stoichiometric ratio of hs to h is bigger for complete oxidation of sulfide compared to the partial oxidation in consequence in the ph range of 3 to 5 the impact of an increase in hs concentration on δ g cat of lhnrm3 and lanrm3 is higher than the impact of an increase in ph leading to an increase in y the ph increase effect in onrm metabolism is canceled out by the increase in acetate concentration fig 2c in the ph range of 3 to 4 the reduction in y decreases in ph values higher than 10 for all metabolisms due to reduction of nh 4 concentration for onrm metabolism ph values higher than 10 also reduce hco 3 concentration consequently the y value for onrm levels off relatively at ph 10 4 2 3 effect of temperature and sulfate concentration similar to srm metabolism temperature influence on y value of onrm lhnrm3 lanrm3 is relatively insignificant maximum 3 6 6 0 and 4 0 change respectively the y values of lhnrm1 and lanrm1 increase significantly from 0 27 to 0 41 and from 0 07 to 0 14 by a reduction in temperature from 110 to 4 c since the decrease in temperature reduces s0 solubility kamyshny jr 2009 among all nitrate reducing metabolisms y of lanrm3 and lhnrm3 depend on sulfate concentration fig 3f shows that y of lanrm3 is greater than y of onrm for sulfate concentrations lower than 10 5m 5 discussion 5 1 importance of taking into account variations in y and ft srm activity has caused detrimental consequences such as corrosion and reservoir plugging for seawater injection into oil reservoirs youssef et al 2009 in sewer systems the h2s produced by srm is a major source of odor nuisance jiang et al 2015 and corrosion of concrete sewer pipes pikaar et al 2019 modeling srm activity is also essential for mainstream anaerobic digestion technology development durán et al 2020 microbial sulfate reduction models have been used to predict the extent of reservoir souring aiming to minimize the impacts and costs of srm activity to the best of our knowledge in these models y has been always assumed to be a constant and the energy that srm require to maintain transmembrane electric potentials has been ignored i e ft 1 e g cheng et al 2016 haghshenas et al 2012 veshareh et al 2021 underestimation or overestimation of souring in seawater injection can cause erroneous material design for injection production wells and surface facilities johnson et al 2017 additionally inaccurate estimate of souring does not allow efficient treatment design for example in nitrate treatment over usage of nitrate can lead to accumulation of nitrite which increases corrosion in production wells huang and zhang 2006 the growth yield of srm varies significantly from around 0 33 when the concentration of srm ed and ea is around the maximum concentration observed in typical seawater flooding processes 0 028 m vigneron et al 2017 to zero for ed and ea concentrations smaller than 1µm fig 1a in sewer systems petroleum reservoirs as well as the biofilm of bioreactors there is invariably a gradient of substrates as our results show the value of y that controls souring in time and space domains is significantly dependent on the substrate concentrations assuming a constant y value the value of which depends on the laboratory conditions under which y has been determined will thus cause over or underestimation of souring rates in that given time and location due to the low exergonicity of srm catabolic reaction and depending on the concentration of ed and ea srm kinetics will be thermodynamically limited by 60 to around 100 ft 0 to 0 4 fig 1b that is while assuming a constant y may over or underestimate souring rate ignoring ft will always lead to overestimation of souring therefore accurate souring simulation requires considering both of these thermodynamic dependent parameters among various environmental conditions ph is a classical physiological parameter in order to tolerate acidic or alkaline conditions microorganisms require special surface properties that protect cells from proton or hydroxide ions golyshina and timmis 2005 horikoshi 1999 very low or high ph values restrict microbial reactions due to various reasons for example at low ph conjugate acids become abundant and diffuse into cell membrane destabilizing the membrane and dissipating proton motive force russell and dombrowski 1980 our results show that in near neutral ph with an increase in ph the srm rate decreases due to reduction in both ft and y the effect of ph on srm activity has been well studied in the context of wastewater treatment since the ph of waste water can be subject to significant changes due to processes such as fermentation of organics or treatment with alkali sharma et al 2013 gutierrez et al 2009 reported that a ph increase from 7 6 to 8 6 and 9 0 reduces the biological sulfate reduction by 30 to 50 to further highlight the importance of considering the effect of thermodynamics on souring kinetics we compare our data with experimental and modelling data published by sharma et al 2014 these authors conducted several batch experiments using a sewer biofilm reactor at various ph values in the range of 4 0 to 9 0 and observed that sulfate reduction rate is maximal at ph 6 3 and decreases when ph deviates from this value in order to model the ph effect sharma et al 2014 used the ph inhibition expression proposed by angelidaki et al 1993 for ph values lower than 6 75 and for higher ph values they employed the non competitive inhibition model of siegrist et al 2002 that is focused on free ammonia the model developed by sharma et al 2014 predicts that souring rate in the range of 6 4 to 8 3 is independent from ph i e is constant whereas experimental data shows that souring rate decreases with increase in ph in this range fig 4 a the model of sharma et al 2014 ignores variations in y due to ph change and does not take into account any thermodynamic limiting factor since the rate of sulfate reduction in the course of sharma et al 2014 experiments fig 2 in their work is constant the effect of y variations can be neglected to evaluate whether the variations in sulfate reduction rate in the ph range of 6 4 to 8 3 is related to changes in ft we consider the value of sulfate reduction rate at a reference value and predict other sulfate reduction rates using the following equation 10 r ph r ref f t ph f t ref fig 4a shows a good agreement between the values predicted using equation 10 and the experimental data therefore considering ft with δ ψ 100 mv can explain changes in sulfate reduction rate in the ph range of 6 4 to 8 3 the strong correlation between ft and rates is probably due to the minimal impact of physiological parameters as ph values are relatively close to neutral note that in ph higher than 7 δ g cat is less than 45 kj fig 4b i e the model introduced by jin and bethke 2003 would predict ft to be equal to zero therefore using the thermodynamic limitation factor proposed by larowe et al 2012 seems to be more appropriate for modeling souring high ph values also decrease h2s liquid to gas mass transfer increasing the total dissolved sulfide ganigue et al 2011 higher dissolved sulfide concentrations reduce srm activity not only due to its toxicity kushkevych et al 2019 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 but also by reducing the δ g cat of sulfate reduction fig 1e 5 2 is it valid to use the gedym for lnrm pathways as mentioned earlier in the methodology section we assume that gedym is valid for estimating the growth yield of lithotrophic metabolisms listed in table 1 zeng and zhang 2005 conducted two batch experiments and measured the growth yield for lanrm2 to be 0 75 and 0 85 the growth yield values calculated in this work using gedym fig 3e matches these experimental values suggesting that gedym holds true also for lithotrophic nitrate reduction based sulfide oxidation 5 3 what nitrate reduction pathway is expected to be faster thermodynamically assuming i a diverse microbial community that can sustain the various nitrate reduction pathways considered in this study ii all community members have the same kinetic parameters and initial biomass concentration and iii the concentration of ea and ed is equal for all metabolisms lhnrm3 is around two times faster than onrm pathway for various physiochemical conditions found in typical petroleum reservoirs this is in disagreement with the work of dolfing and hubert 2017 where except for special conditions such as low temperature or low acetate to h2s ratios onrm pathway is predicted to prevail this is because dolfing and hubert 2017 consider the pathway with a higher δ g cat as the dominant pathway while not considering the anabolic reaction our results highlights that to find the dominant metabolism among metabolic pathways with high catabolic energy yields i e ft 1 δ g cat cannot be used directly to reveal the dominant pathway as it has been used for other metabolisms such as methanogenesis or acetogenesis jin and kirk 2018 note that while the value of y allows a quantitative comparison between the rate of two metabolisms in a system at its initial condition the relationship of respiration rate and y is not linear and rather exponential equations 1 7 and 8 therefore a two time higher y of lhnrm3 compared to that of onrm can lead to lhnrm3 domination this is in agreement with various studies available in the literature hubert et al 2003 injected nitrate into a soured bioreactor sulfide concentration of 12 mm and observed that despite injection of 25 mm lactate nitrate reduction was entirely coupled to sulfide oxidation to sulfate lambo et al 2008 showed that lithotrophic reduction of nitrate always preceded organotrophic reduction of nitrate mathioudakis et al 2006 by conducting experiments on sour waste water samples sulfide concentration of around 1mm reported that nitrate reduction is preferentially autotrophic and that heterotrophic nitrate reduction only commenced after sulfide had been completely oxidized in another study okabe et al 2003 observed that in sewer biofilm experiments 65 of the h2s produced by srm residing in deeper layers of the biofilm was oxidized via lnrm in shallower layers a similar observation has been reported by garcia de lomas et al 2007 dolfing and hubert 2017 discussed whether lnrm1 or lnrm3 is expected to be the dominant lnrm pathways by comparing the δg of acetate driven reduction of sulfate and s0 they proposed that because δg of acetate driven reduction of s0 is less than acetate driven reduction of sulfate lnrm1 is the dominant lnrm pathway they suggested that the dominance of lnrm1 is more likely at lower temperatures as the differences between δg of acetate driven reduction of s0 and that of acetate driven reduction of sulfate increases with temperature according to our results fig 3 under all studied conditions lithotrophic sulfide based nitrate reduction is envisaged to be through lnrm3 pathways rather than lnrm1 due to significantly higher y values 1 6 to 17 times 5 4 why does elemental sulfur accumulation occur the low growth yield of lithotrophic nitrate reduction coupled to partial sulfide oxidation to sulfur lanrm1 and lhnrm1 does not imply that nitrate treatment does not cause s0 production it merely means that if all the parameters that affect various nitrate reduction pathways are equal and if oxidation of sulfide to sulfate in a single step is possible thermodynamically a lower fraction of nitrate reduction is coupled to partial sulfide oxidation and a higher fraction of nitrate is coupled to either complete sulfide oxidation or to oxidation of organic compounds veshareh et al 2021 showed that nitrate treatment by desulfobacterium autotrophicum and a microbial community of a production water enrichment that contained organotrophic nitrate reducing members from delta and gammaproteobacteria caused s concentrations of 17 to 22 µm jiang et al 2009 observed that lithotrophic nitrate reduction based sulfide oxidation occurs first by oxidation of sulfide to sulfur lnrm1 followed by oxidation of sulfur to sulfate lnrm2 these authors reported that the rate of lnrm2 is 15 of that of lnrm1 yang et al 2005 observed that elemental sulfur was the end product of nitrate based sulfide oxidation the accumulation of s0 due to nt has also been reported by liang et al 2016 fig 3 shows that lnrm2 metabolisms have higher y values than lnrm1 metabolisms due to significantly higher δ g cat values i e based on thermodynamics the rate of lnrm2 should be higher than that of lnrm1 fig 4c demonstrates why lnrm2 can be slower than lnrm1 even though it is thermodynamically more favorable sulfur solubility in water is extremely low and increases exponentially with temperature from 6 3 10 9 at 4 c to 6 3 10 7 m at 80 c kamyshny jr 2009 by considering 1 7 10 5 m mora et al 2015 as the half saturation constant for sulfur and assuming that the environment is saturated with sulfur the limiting kinetic term fk will be between 2 10 4 and 4 10 3 for 4 c and 80 c respectively that is if we ignore the dependency of lnrm1 on any other factor reduction in temperature from 80 to 4 c makes lnrm1 20 times slower merely because of the reduction in s0 solubility therefore decrease in temperature does not promote s0 accumulation only by increasing the growth yield of lnrm1 due to an increase in y but mainly by reducing s0 solubility and thereby reducing the rate of s0 oxidation to sulfate this explains why in sewer systems where the temperature is relatively low around ambient temperature nt is associated with elemental sulfur production as shown by liang et al 2016 and jiang et al 2009 in reservoir souring processes s0 accumulation can be expected to occur mainly in injection tubing and near the well bore area however the extent of s0 accumulation can spread to the production well provided presence of fractures reduce the travel time between the injection and production wells and thereby reducing the water temperature in the production well given the abovementioned temperature dependence of s0 accumulation one can conclude that heating injection water can remediate the s0 related corrosion associated with nt of reservoir souring note that in fig 4 only the range of 4 to 80 c has been considered because we did not have s0 solubility data outside this range 5 5 single step sulfide oxidation vs two step sulfide oxidation single step nitrate based oxidation of sulfide lnrm3 seems to have both the thermodynamic advantage as well as the kinetic advantage as no elemental sulfur is produced as an intermediate however cui et al 2019 reported that nitrate reducers that catalyze single step sulfide oxidation to sulfate can only harvest two electrons per nitrate reduced as the nitrate reduction pathways stops at nitrite due to a lack of nitrite reductase the nitrite produced in the single step oxidation of sulfide to sulfate is then reduced further by nitrate reducers that oxidize sulfide in two steps therefore two step sulfide oxidation has a physiological advantage and is expected to always co occur with the single step sulfide oxidation as the organisms involved can reduce nitrite cui et al 2019 showed that compared to the two step sulfide oxidation single step oxidation of sulfide is more sensitive to sulfide suggesting that the physiological advantage of two step sulfide oxidation when nitrate treatment is applied increases with the souring level these observations have implications for souring management where i low temperatures ii limited nitrate availability compared to sulfide or iii limited travel time between the injection and production well can cause elemental sulfur accumulation therefore we speculate that souring treatment efficiency by nitrate injection can be improved by i early treatment ii increasing temperature iii making sure that stoichiometrically enough nitrate is available for sulfide oxidation and iv reducing injection flow rate in the case of souring in petroleum reservoirs such that sufficient time is given to lnrm2 to complete sulfide oxidation from sulfur to sulfate note that half hearted measures that include only some of these conditions may cause even more severe souring problems as for example increase in temperature can increase h2s emission from the liquid phase to the gas phase 6 caveats and future directions zhang et al 2018 have shown that polysulfide formation substantially increases the rate of organotrophic sulfur reduction to sulfide qiu et al 2020 showed that sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is substantially enhanced due to polysulfide formation this is why zhang et al 2021 introduced polysulfide as an electron shuttle that accelerates sulfur oxidation or reduction indeed the polysulfide formation step should not be ignored in the simulation of sulfide sulfur sulfate transformations when the exact value of elemental sulfur accumulation or the rate of accumulation is to be evaluated however in this study polysulfide formation from sulfide and elemental sulfur and polysulfide oxidation to sulfide has been ignored in the sulfur cycle because rather than estimating the pool sizes of the s0 species the aim was to predict the likelihood of elemental sulfur accumulation future work can validate the proposed methodology in this paper for polysulfide oxidation and study whether the faster oxidation reduction rates of polysulfide is due to the thermodynamic advantage of this species under varied physiochemical conditions 7 conclusions the key findings of this study can be summarized as follows growth yield can be used to link the differences in energetics of microbial reactions with their kinetics for metabolisms that have a sufficiently high δ g cat such that thermodynamic limiting factor is equal to one since the kinetic parameters of souring processes can be substantially affected by thermodynamics it is essential to couple souring models to a thermodynamic model that takes into account the effect of variations in catabolic energy yield and anabolic energy demand on the metabolism rate compared to other nitrate reduction pathways such as organotrophic nitrate reduction based on the magnitude of growth yield single step lithoheterotrophic nitrate reduction driven sulfide oxidation to sulfate is expected to be the dominant nitrate reduction pathway in sour systems even though nitrate reduction sulfur oxidation to sulfate is thermodynamically expected to be faster than nitrate reduction sulfide oxidation to sulfur it is slower due to the low solubility of elemental sulfur elemental sulfur accumulation associated with nitrate reduction driven sulfide oxidation is prevalent at lower temperatures due to the exponential decrease of sulfur solubility with temperature declaration of

16536,anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected data samples in datasets automated anomaly detection is either performed using supervised machine learning models which require a labelled dataset for their calibration or unsupervised models which do not require labels while academic research has produced a vast array of tools and machine learning models for automated anomaly detection the research community focused on environmental systems still lacks a comparative analysis that is simultaneously comprehensive objective and systematic this knowledge gap is addressed for the first time in this study where 15 different supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models are evaluated on 5 different environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems to this end anomaly detection performance labelling efforts as well as the impact of model and algorithm tuning are taken into account as a result our analysis reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches in an objective manner without bias for any particular paradigm in machine learning most importantly our results show that expert based data annotation is

of federally sponsored research in accordance with the doe public access plan http www energy gov downloads doe public access plan 1 introduction over the past decade there has been a drastic increase in the amount of data collected for environmental monitoring in both engineered and natural systems in order to manage this vast quantity of data dedicated tools are required this includes implementing standard procedures for sensor validation data importation and storage as well as data retrieval furthermore it also becomes necessary to ensure high data quality anomaly detection ad aims to identify unusual patterns in the data that do not conform to the typical behaviour of the system anomalies can also be categorised according to their context a point anomaly is a single measurement that is considered anomalous irrespective of the time or location of the measurement a contextual anomaly is a single data point that is considered anomalous when taking the time or location of measurement into account e g the data point could be acceptable considering the sensor measurement range but may still be atypical for the considered location or the considered time of day or time in the year a collective anomaly is a collection of measurements produced by different instruments at different locations or at different times which individually appear normal but are found anomalous when analysed jointly usually point anomalies can be detected automatically using some basic quality methods as out of range checks chandola et al 2009 collective and contextual anomalies on the other hand may need application specific rules ramanathan et al 2006 or visual inspection of the data by a domain expert both can be tedious and time consuming if not impossible to implement in many cases to solve this problem there has been an increasing interest in automated ad techniques for environmental monitoring as well as for other domains such as medical imaging intrusion detection and so on these techniques based on machine learning ml are more flexible than the classical mechanistic models approaches ciavatta et al 2004 as they can take advantage of data rich environments specifically ml models support domain experts by automatically detecting unusual patterns or samples thus removing the need for manual inspection ml models can be broadly divided in supervised and unsupervised models supervised models are calibrated i e trained using the data with associated labels most typically the labels are the ideal typical anomalous classification provided by a human expert after calibration the models can be used to predict the target label for each new unseen data point a drawback of supervised methods is that they require large and representative datasets for which both input data and the associated labels are available in practice obtaining target labels is difficult and time consuming because it requires domain expert reviewing the each data point and assigning a binary normal or anomalous label to it for this reason unsupervised models which do not require labels are commonly studied as an alternative to supervised models aguado et al 2007 aguado and rosen 2008 aguado et al 2005 alferes et al 2013 baert et al 2012 lee et al 2005 lee and vanrolleghem 2003 rosén and lennox 2001 villez et al 2008 in recent years academic research has applied a wide variety of tools for anomaly detection using both ml settings for supervised ml techniques such as support vector machines ni et al 2011 and artificial neural networks hill and minsker 2010 for wind speed sensor data streams have been used for unsupervised ml self organizing maps postolache et al 2005 and clustering techniques bezdek et al 2011 have been applied in inoue et al 2017 unsupervised deep neural networks were evaluated one class support vector machines ocsvm are used as well and are often referred to as an unsupervised learning method amer et al 2013 liu et al 2014 however ocsvm is calibrated with an anomaly free dataset for model calibration thus requiring an expert based separation between anomalous and normal data records in the data used for calibration for this reason we consider the calibration of one class models a special case of supervised classification hendrycks et al 2019 khan and madden 2014 sillito and fisher 2008 ml models for ad in environmental monitoring are often presented as a single one size fits all tool trilles et al 2017 unfortunately most of these methods have been evaluated only on one dataset or with a limited number of models fuente et al 1996 lee and vanrolleghem 2003 rosén and lennox 2001 yu 2012 thus inviting scepticism with respect to the reported benefits for example in muharemi et al 2019 the authors test several supervised models on one dataset and based on performance results choose one to solve the challenge of ad for water quality the burden of data labelling for supervised ad is not described in candelieri 2017 the authors use supervised learning specifically support vector regression for water demand forecasting and ad the approach is validated on one urban water network in the city of milan in inoue et al 2017 a deep neural network is proposed for ad in a water treatment system however the approach was tested only against a one class support vector machine model and on one dataset in miau and hung 2020 a supervised deep learning approach is proposed to detect abnormal water levels and perform river flooding forecasting however the method was only tested on one dataset although one particular model may outperform another for a specific domain see e g corominas et al 2011 leigh et al 2019 there is no guarantee that reported performance levels can be extrapolated to other systems or other tasks this challenge has been discussed in several works corominas et al 2018 garrido baserba et al 2020 gibert et al 2018 2010 in response to this need corominas et al 2011 benchmark 5 different univariate techniques for fault detection in wastewater treatment processes however only in a simulation environment in this sense benchmarking refers to the evaluation and comparison of ml methods on different datasets benchmarking results can be then used as standards for subsequent studies one benchmarking study at full scale is reported in lee et al 2008 although it is limited to 5 cases of the same unit process to this day these two studies remain the most comprehensive benchmarking studies concerning data validation in the urban water cycle it is therefore evident that i current works are almost exclusively limited to results within a single case ii the usage of supervised unsupervised one class setups is often performed casually without mentioning the burden of data labelling and or model tuning and iii a comprehensive comparative analysis of commonly applied ml models for different environmental applications is missing this is especially true in environmental datasets which may present a number of important challenges not encountered elsewhere in fact environmental datasets are characterised by a high level of heterogeneity in data since they are produced by a variety of instruments with noted differences in format resolution and quality also environmental systems present high levels of complexity because of interactions between several components climate humans animals etc producing effects that are not understood well the processes are often claimed to be highly nonlinear and can exhibit stochastic or cyclic behaviours these appear at different scales depending on the specific application as a result case specific results are difficult to generalise with this paper we compare different supervised one class and unsupervised ad models on several environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems with this evaluation we specifically aim to assess the relative advantages of data annotation by human experts while also accounting for the strengths and weaknesses of the different model structures their performance as well as their sensitivity to manual parameter tuning in addition this paper also enables effective benchmarking of data driven anomaly detection models by publishing both the code and the datasets this is the first time such a step is done in environmental applications where to make real progress benchmarking of the already existing models is direly needed 2 methods 2 1 machine learning in this section we describe the different ml setups and the procedures for calibration and testing applied to all models under study finally we explain the performance metrics used to evaluate these models 2 1 1 data preprocessing data preprocessing is an important step in ml practice for a number of reasons kotsiantis et al 2006 first these operations can improve the chances and the rate of convergence to optimal parameter values second they can affect the modelled relationship when using models based on distance measures like k nearest neighbours third this ensures that the data matches the expected format for a particular model see e g gurden et al 2001 fourth data preprocessing allows to incorporate expert knowledge through feature engineering into the ml model in this work we center and scale each input variable separately to zero mean and unit variance prior to model calibration in order to ensure that we evaluate the utility of ml methods and not the utility of domain expertise we have also carefully eliminated any knowledge based feature engineering the main reason is that such feature engineering could improve performance of the ml models thus confounding our evaluation of the ml setups we only applied feature engineering in one case study oncyt where each sample was transformed into structured data by means of binning this step was needed to transform the data into a format suitable for the considered ml models and performed in accordance with the domain expert s instruction this is described in detail in the supporting information 2 1 2 model calibration setups for anomaly detection the main goal of calibration is to identify a model s parameters that enable the prediction of the class y for any data point represented as a d dimensional input vector x containing the values for d variables measured at the same time in ad applications the class y can only acquire two label values that is y y 0 1 here the normal data is generally named as negative class with label value 0 and the anomalies are named positive class with label value 1 for our purposes we group the selected models into three ml setups based on the data and target labels y i that are available for calibration these setups are illustrated in fig 1 and described next 1 supervised learning sup is the setup where each calibration data point is paired with a target label y i it is also known as binary classification during calibration of a supervised ad model the model ϕ is calibrated with the calibration dataset x i y i i 1 n to predict the label these predictions are compared with the target labels and the parameters of the model are adjusted to minimise discrepancies during testing the calibrated model ϕ predicts a probability value between 0 to 1 for each new unseen test data point in the test dataset t indicating how likely the data belongs to the anomalous class a threshold α is used to convert the probability to a binary prediction y normal anomaly if the predictive probability is higher than this threshold the test data point is considered anomalous otherwise normal 2 one class supervised learning ocsup is a special case of sup where the calibration dataset only consists of anomaly free data chalapathy et al 2018 ruff et al 2018 while labels are not strictly required as an input during calibration this setup assumes that all data points in the calibration dataset belong to the negative class once the model is identified it is used to evaluate how much a new data point x deviates from the calibration data the measure of deviation is known as the anomaly score similarly to the sup setup a threshold is also set to convert the anomaly score to a binary prediction setting this threshold is typically more subjective as the anomaly score cannot be interpreted as a probability 3 unsupervised learning unsup setup is a setup where the ad model scores the data solely based on the patterns in the calibration dataset d and uses the complete calibration dataset without any target label hastie et al 2009 leung and leckie 2005 this eliminates a tedious examination of the data set available for calibration similarly to ocsup the model produces an anomaly score for every new data point and a threshold is set to convert this to a binary prediction normal anomaly the unsup is expected to work best if the calibration data are contaminated with a negligible or non existent amount of anomalies as noted in the introduction the distinction between unsup and ocsup learning is rarely provided in the ad literature amer et al 2013 sabokrou et al 2018 quite often this implies that the task of removing anomalies from the calibration data has been executed perfectly with the above definitions we stress that the use of a supervised model being either binary or one class requires the input of a domain expert 2 1 3 anomaly detection models in this work we benchmark a wide range of ml model structures the main purpose of this is to ensure that the quantified utility of expert provided labels does not hinge on the choice of a particular model structure the following criteria were used for selection of these paradigms the selected model structures should be fairly popular in the ml community the selected model structures should be available in on the shelf softwares e g scikit learn matlab ml toolbox spark mllib weka and the selected implementation should be compatible with the apache license 2 0 the selected model structures should be available for each of the above learning setups as an example we include a random forest as a binary classifier and an isolation forest for the corresponding one class models five model structures were found that satisfy these requirements they are based on five distinct paradigms which are a mixture of gaussians b nearest neighbours c ensembles of decision trees d models based on the kernel trick and support vectors and e feed forward artificial neural networks these model structures are listed in table 1 each model type can be configured with different hyperparameters hyperparameters are those parameters that determine the detailed structure and flexibility of the models these do not change during model calibration and are typically set based on prior knowledge experience and or exploratory analysis of the calibration data the chosen models and their hyperparameters are discussed in detail in the supporting information 2 2 performance evaluation evaluating the performance of ad models in real world practice is not as straightforward as in typical text book examples the main challenge is that we are dealing with an unbalanced dataset that is the classes are not represented equally indeed the fraction of anomalies in the studied datasets is fairly low as a result detection accuracy metrics e g ratio of correctly identified data samples vs total number of data samples should not be used géron 2019 the selected performance metrics are described next roc curve it is important to note that ad models as defined above deliver a class membership or an anomaly score which needs to be compared to a threshold value to determine the predicted class this means that the resulting model performance critically depends on the choice of threshold in order to evaluate all models fairly irrespective of the chosen threshold we evaluate the model performance for every candidate threshold rather than picking one this results in multiple values for the true positives rate tpr and the false positives rate fpr which change monotonically with the threshold these values are computed as t p r t p t p f n and f p r f p f p t n where true positives tp is the number of correctly identified anomalies y 1 y 1 true negatives tn is the number of correctly classified normal data y 0 y 0 false negatives fn and false positives rp are respectively the number of incorrectly classified normal data y 0 y 1 and anomalies y 1 y 0 a receiver operating characteristic roc curve is then computed for each model by plotting the tpr against the fpr maxion and roberts 2004 in ad applications we would like our models to learn a complete separation of the two underlying distributions normal and anomalous a roc curve corresponding to better separation is located closer to the upper left hand corner in the roc space and thus enables visualisation of the model performance one advantage of roc curves is that they enable visual and quick assessment of the performance of the classifier over its entire operating range fawcett 2006 we remind the reader that a single model corresponds to a unique combination of calibration setup model structure and model hyperparameters the list of evaluated hyperparameters can be found in the supporting information pareto roc curve in addition to the roc for single models i e unique set of hyperparameter values we also compute a pareto roc by selecting those points for which the fpr and tpr values are the highest and therefore optimal among all models sharing the same ml setup this new roc is the upper envelope of the individual roc and thus presents the best results one can obtain through systematic hyper parameter tuning this leads to 15 pareto rocs 5 case studies 3 setups and gives a general insight into the utility of the three calibration setups but ignores differences in sensitivity to the selected model structure and the tuning of the hyper parameters area under the roc curve additionally the area under the curve auc is chosen to summarize the model performance into a single measure fawcett 2006 which ranges from 0 to 1 excellent models with a good measure of separability have an auc near 1 for our purposes the auc is computed first for each model then the mean and standard deviation for these aucs is reported for each of the 15 model structures by reporting the averaged auc as well as the standard deviation for each model we can assess both average performance and sensitivity of the model structures to hyperparameter tuning although the auc is a helpful indicator of model performance it is still an aggregate measure which excludes details shown in the roc for this reason our main conclusions will be based on the rocs and pareto rocs described above 2 3 case studies the datasets used for this study stem from a set of five engineered and natural systems that are currently operational at eawag dübendorf switzerland these infrastructures exhibit several common challenges such as mechanical sensor faults the presence of biological processes with their nonlinearity and seasonality and the presence of natural stochastic events on the other hand they also present a diverse set of measured variables time resolutions and spatio temporal correlations to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a diverse set of domains covering a wide variety of data types present in the water sector seasonal non seasonal urban environmental water quantity quality etc are used for benchmarking of ml models within one study a summary about the datasets characteristics is given in table 2 all datasets have been made publicly available at https doi org 10 25678 0002wj the code developed for labelling the data has also been made available at https doi org 10 25678 0002pc the datasets are described next with particular focus on their type of anomalies and variables used for model calibration specific details regarding data collection and labelling for each case can be found in the supporting information note that a sixth domain léxplore was also studied within this study however the provided labels do not reflect an unbiased opinion of the domain experts since they were provided by an automated tool consequently we have ignored this dataset for benchmarking and discuss the results in the supporting information eawag ponds this is a multivariate time series data of high spatial and temporal resolution that was collected as part of a long term ecological experiment described in lürig et al 2020 narwani et al 2019 the experiment used pond ecosystems hereafter ponds 16 of such ponds were set up at eawag dübendorf switzerland with macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum and dreissena mussels dreissena polymorpha were added progressively to the ponds together with inorganic nutrients each of these ponds was equipped with sensors for eight variables conductivity chlorophyll and phycocyanin fluorescence dissolved organic matter fluorescence dissolved oxygen saturation and concentration ph and temperature measurements of these water parameters were recorded simultaneously in each multi sensor with a fixed time interval of 15 min as for the variables used for model training our domain expert has supplied us with the anomaly labels for specific conductivity and we have trained our models based on this sole information the domain expert manually labelled anomalies for specific conductivity presenting both spiky and long term anomalous events this resulted in a labelled data set containing n 22464 data records with d 8 variables the measured water quality variables the data set covers a period of 234 consecutive days and includes 2 anomalies online flow cytometry this dataset is a time series of high temporal resolution and was collected as part of multiple applied research projects on microbial monitoring besmer et al 2016 2014 the measurements were carried out on water samples directly extracted from water streams by an automated flow cytometry system flow cytometric analysis of water samples was typically carried out every 15 min after sample preparation including tagging of bacteria with fluorescent dyes based on experience 7 categories of potential anomalies were defined and individual flow cytometric measurements were labelled manually by the leading expert user the domain expert reported that most of the time he was confident about the labelled anomaly type after labelling all anomalous labels were grouped as one single anomaly to enable anomaly detection with binary classification resulting in a total of 10 2 anomalies urban water observatory uwo this case study presents data from a long term in sewer process monitoring initiative in the municipality of fehraltorf near zurich in switerland www eawag ch uwo the data used in this study are in sewer flow rates which had been recorded during a period of 1 5 years with a temporal resolution of 5 min two datasets covering the periods 26 march 25 april 2017 and 1 september 12 november 2017 were selected and manually labelled by two domain experts this resulted in two labelled data sets namely uwo s1 and uwo s2 it is important to note that differently to uwo s1 the uwo s2 data set was filtered to eliminate simple point anomalies before labelling to shift the focus to collective anomalies therefore uwo s1 mainly shows simple contextual anomalies while uwo s2 presents complex collective type of anomalies water hub in the water hub researchers from eawag investigate sustainable decentralized and source separated waste water treatment greywater collected from wash basins and showers within the building is treated with a two step process a membrane bioreactor mbr is followed by a biological activated carbon bac filter we focused on the data measured with four pressure sensors placed in the mbr and in the bac respectively two in each process these sensors are installed to monitor the water levels to control the system and to keep track of the hydraulic performance of the system data from all four sensors was analysed to detect process anomalies which were i foam in the mbr ii clogging of the membrane iii blocked level switch in the mbr iv pressure loss drop in the bac and v lack of data the domain expert manually labelled process anomalies for the mbr and the bac separately resulting in a labelled data set containing n 436320 data records of which 13 3 are anomalies with d 4 variables the pressure variables the data set covers a period of 10 months 3 results in this section we show the benchmarking results obtained for each model and domain first we focus on the pareto rocs which give a broad overview of the results of each ml setup this is followed by a detailed discussion of the auc results for every model in every domain we conclude the section with the results related to model selection note that all test were run without the use of a gpu 3 1 pareto roc curves the pareto rocs in fig 2 are obtained by selecting the pareto optimal combinations of the fpr and tpr values obtained for all models for a given calibration setup i e across a all model structures b all applied hyper parameter settings for each model structure and c each threshold for a given model in most cases the sup models perform better than the ocsup and unsup models in one case oncyt the ocsup models show the same performance as the sup models ocsup models show only slight improvements over the unsup models in all cases except oncyt and uwo s2 it can also be seen that although the uwo s1 and s2 domains belong to the same domain of application i e the measured variables are the same the presence of different types of anomalies which was discussed with our domain experts makes a substantial difference in the performance of the ad methods 3 2 auc and sensitivity to hyperparameters to evaluate whether it is important to select a particular set of hyperparameter values we have summarised each roc by means of the average auc and the standard deviation for each model structure and for each domain under study these are visualised in fig 3 in general sup models outperform the others in all domains which corroborates our findings on the importance of having labels to achieve the best possible performance in ad applications the same results are quantitatively reported in the form of summary statistic in the supporting information note that some results related to the svm implementation are not present due to the high computation time of the models calibration time 10h this is due to the large size of the kernel matrix where feasible only the linear lin kernel functions for svm was implemented inspecting fig 3 makes clear that ml models may suffer from a high degree of intra domain variability in addition to inter domain variability indeed the uwo domain cases s1 and s2 are very similar in the nature of the data but produce dissimilar model performance levels we speculate that this is due to different types of anomalies in the two datasets after discussing with our domain expert we concluded that uwo s1 contains more simpler point and contextual anomalies while uwo s2 contains a high number of collective anomalies importantly this means that extrapolating the performance of ml models from one domain to the next is likely to remain difficult even if such domains are considered similar 3 3 model related roc curves finally in fig 4 we show the pareto roc curves in a unique combination of domain and model structure these plots visually highlight the difference in performance between each model for the different domains and confirm the above results that is sup models perform better than the ocsup and unsup models moreover the ocsup and unsup models produce more variable performance levels as already shown previously consequently this means that choosing the best model structures and hyperparameters is important for the ocsup and unsup setups in contrast the variability of model performance among the sup models is far lower suggesting that model structure selection and hyperparameter tuning is far less important in this case 4 discussion we discuss below the main findings of our study we include our practical recommendations for the implementation of ad strategies and in particular data labelling and conclude with an outlook at future research machine learning setups and the value of labels for anomaly detection our study offers a clear indication that the sup learning setup is preferred over the ocsup and unsup setups clearly this means the collection of trusted data labels are critical to maximise the performance of data driven ad ocsup or unsup models while requiring less effort in the labelling step need a higher effort in hyperparameter tuning to obtain a performance that is as close as possible to the sup model performance levels moreover the dominance of the sup setup over the ocsup setup suggests that having access to labelled anomalous data are especially valuable this corroborates the major conclusion of russo et al 2020 model type selection for anomaly detection a key notion in model assessment is model selection that is given two or more ml models choosing the best one for future deployment model selection can be performed based on a specific set of performance metrics dictated by the problem domain e g which fpr is tolerated or which trp is needed we discuss below the specific performance for the tested models to provide help for model selection in fig 2 it is shown that the studied models performed poorly when the dataset contained complex anomalies as in the case of uwo s2 on the contrary it appears that models with a simpler structure specifically danb performed well on the ponds oncyt and uwo s1 datasets these results may be explained by the nature of the anomalous data points visual inspection of the data although subjective suggested that the anomalies are very distinct from normal data points in these domains and easy to spot even for non experts ml models falling in the danb category are generative models that make assumptions on the distribution of the data in cases where the data is well distributed such models could reach high performance possibly because their generative assumptions prevent overfitting ng and jordan 2002 however that is not always true in environmental applications where normal data might not be generated from the same distribution as it presents baseline changes due to different seasons and anomalies may be generated by different events which do not show the same pattern in fact as a general detection performance result more flexible models like ann and ae performed well across the different datasets with aes being sensitive to noisy data that is in the unsup setup where the calibration data contains anomalies they lead to lower performance compared to their ocsup setup implementation this suggests that the generative version of such models that is denoising or variational ae an and cho 2015 could be valuable in such cases these flexible models also have a higher sensitivity to hyperparameters which implies that hyperparameter tuning and so an increased effort in the design of the model architecture is necessary for achieving such performance finally and more importantly the results of this study provide insights on the utility of expert based data labelling given the above results we recommend to perform data labelling and sup modelling if the nature of anomalies in the dataset is complex that is if the anomalies are contextual not well defined and varying over time if however the application domain presents more simple collective anomalies ocsup and unsup modelling could be performed choosing flexible models we envisage that more complex models are needed for the ocsup and unsup setups these can be an ensemble of models baruque and corchado 2011 models with bayesian priors baimuratov et al 2019 reflecting generally applicable domain knowledge or models that use a background or garbage class e g an unsup two class setup where only class is learned and the other one is fixed for more details on this and related concepts please see dhamija et al 2018 limitations of the study and future research in this work 5 selected data sets have been used to benchmark several ml setups and models it is important to note that it is rather difficult if not impossible to evaluate whether these could be completely representative of typical data in water research we do however believe that such a combination of full scale natural and engineered environmental monitoring systems and careful labelling procedure is unprecedented additionally we have assumed that the domain expert provides labels without error or uncertainty this is unlikely and should be accounted for in future work several methods to account for imperfect labels during calibration exist donmez and carbonell 2008 du and ling 2010 liu et al 2013 but require much higher computational requirements one can also employ a higher number of domain experts for the same dataset to quantify uncertainty in the provided labels this increases the labelling effort significantly active learning russo et al 2020 and semi supervised learning zhu and goldberg 2009 could however be combined with labelling by multiple experts to minimize this effort note that a sixth case was included within this study at first unfortunately we found that the provided labels could not be considered an unbiased opinion of the domain experts this is explained particularly by the fact that this dataset is so complex that anomalies are not easily spotted even by application experts russo et al 2019 when so one may chose to incorporate domain knowledge during data preprocessing zheng and casari 2018 or model construction as was applied in this case while this prevents an objective study of the merits of expert based labelling this can lead to useful hybrid models for ad the embedded expertise can be based on temporal correlation redundancy hardware redundancy physical chemical relationships spatial redundancy etc ocsup or unsup models that incorporate temporal dynamics explicitly are also a specific way to include the existence of temporal correlation into the model this would include classical time series analysis models such as arima pena et al 2013 or recurrent neural networks or long short term memory networks which exist in the family of the deep learning models malhotra et al 2015 the utility of domain expertise in ad either through knowledge based feature engineering or hybrid modelling could not be quantified yet this should be considered for evaluation both with or without target labels and can be benchmarked with the provided data sets 5 conclusions a comprehensive evaluation of 15 distinct combinations of model structure and calibration setup was executed with datasets produced by 5 full scale environmental monitoring systems the primary interest was to evaluate the utility of expert based data labelling for anomaly detection purposes this is the first time this has been studied at this scale for aquatic applications our most important conclusions are supervised models are better than models based on unsupervised learning this is true for all of the 5 domains this means that access to labelled data is critical for effective use of machine learning for anomaly detection in environmental systems data additionally we have shown that if the anomalies are not complex then one class models which require less time for labelling could be used the comparison of one class and unsupervised models underlines the value of expert labelling as these models only differ in the provided data for calibration and not in the objective function across all studied domains anomaly detection performance with one class models is better than with unsupervised models this is true for all models with exception of the one class support vector machine models which however perform poorly always the quantified anomaly detection performance of any particular machine learning algorithm depends strongly on the particular domain indeed our results show that evaluated classification accuracy metrics like the area under the curve auc cannot be extrapolated from one domain to the next this is especially true for the one class and unsupervised models where anomaly detection performances were shown to vary between 0 39 and 0 93 even in the sup setting the reported auc varies between 0 77 which is unlikely to be acceptable for online deployment and 0 99 which we expect to exceed minimum requirements unfortunately yet true this means that broad statements on the expected utility of machine learning algorithms should not be trusted our results do not indicate a strong preference for any particular model structure the best available supervised models were artificial neural networks uwo s2 k nearest neighbours ponds waterhub and random forest oncyt uwo s1 among the one class models one class support vector machines perform particularly poorly in all domains it is therefore reasonable to exclude it as a suitable candidate model in future work in absence of data labels unsupervised models the models with best auc include auto encoders oncyt uwo s1 gaussian mixture models ponds isolation forest waterhub and local outlier factor uwo s2 this shows again that a general

16536,anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected data samples in datasets automated anomaly detection is either performed using supervised machine learning models which require a labelled dataset for their calibration or unsupervised models which do not require labels while academic research has produced a vast array of tools and machine learning models for automated anomaly detection the research community focused on environmental systems still lacks a comparative analysis that is simultaneously comprehensive objective and systematic this knowledge gap is addressed for the first time in this study where 15 different supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models are evaluated on 5 different environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems to this end anomaly detection performance labelling efforts as well as the impact of model and algorithm tuning are taken into account as a result our analysis reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches in an objective manner without bias for any particular paradigm in machine learning most importantly our results show that expert based data annotation is

in the amount of data collected for environmental monitoring in both engineered and natural systems in order to manage this vast quantity of data dedicated tools are required this includes implementing standard procedures for sensor validation data importation and storage as well as data retrieval furthermore it also becomes necessary to ensure high data quality anomaly detection ad aims to identify unusual patterns in the data that do not conform to the typical behaviour of the system anomalies can also be categorised according to their context a point anomaly is a single measurement that is considered anomalous irrespective of the time or location of the measurement a contextual anomaly is a single data point that is considered anomalous when taking the time or location of measurement into account e g the data point could be acceptable considering the sensor measurement range but may still be atypical for the considered location or the considered time of day or time in the year a collective anomaly is a collection of measurements produced by different instruments at different locations or at different times which individually appear normal but are found anomalous when analysed jointly usually point anomalies can be detected automatically using some basic quality methods as out of range checks chandola et al 2009 collective and contextual anomalies on the other hand may need application specific rules ramanathan et al 2006 or visual inspection of the data by a domain expert both can be tedious and time consuming if not impossible to implement in many cases to solve this problem there has been an increasing interest in automated ad techniques for environmental monitoring as well as for other domains such as medical imaging intrusion detection and so on these techniques based on machine learning ml are more flexible than the classical mechanistic models approaches ciavatta et al 2004 as they can take advantage of data rich environments specifically ml models support domain experts by automatically detecting unusual patterns or samples thus removing the need for manual inspection ml models can be broadly divided in supervised and unsupervised models supervised models are calibrated i e trained using the data with associated labels most typically the labels are the ideal typical anomalous classification provided by a human expert after calibration the models can be used to predict the target label for each new unseen data point a drawback of supervised methods is that they require large and representative datasets for which both input data and the associated labels are available in practice obtaining target labels is difficult and time consuming because it requires domain expert reviewing the each data point and assigning a binary normal or anomalous label to it for this reason unsupervised models which do not require labels are commonly studied as an alternative to supervised models aguado et al 2007 aguado and rosen 2008 aguado et al 2005 alferes et al 2013 baert et al 2012 lee et al 2005 lee and vanrolleghem 2003 rosén and lennox 2001 villez et al 2008 in recent years academic research has applied a wide variety of tools for anomaly detection using both ml settings for supervised ml techniques such as support vector machines ni et al 2011 and artificial neural networks hill and minsker 2010 for wind speed sensor data streams have been used for unsupervised ml self organizing maps postolache et al 2005 and clustering techniques bezdek et al 2011 have been applied in inoue et al 2017 unsupervised deep neural networks were evaluated one class support vector machines ocsvm are used as well and are often referred to as an unsupervised learning method amer et al 2013 liu et al 2014 however ocsvm is calibrated with an anomaly free dataset for model calibration thus requiring an expert based separation between anomalous and normal data records in the data used for calibration for this reason we consider the calibration of one class models a special case of supervised classification hendrycks et al 2019 khan and madden 2014 sillito and fisher 2008 ml models for ad in environmental monitoring are often presented as a single one size fits all tool trilles et al 2017 unfortunately most of these methods have been evaluated only on one dataset or with a limited number of models fuente et al 1996 lee and vanrolleghem 2003 rosén and lennox 2001 yu 2012 thus inviting scepticism with respect to the reported benefits for example in muharemi et al 2019 the authors test several supervised models on one dataset and based on performance results choose one to solve the challenge of ad for water quality the burden of data labelling for supervised ad is not described in candelieri 2017 the authors use supervised learning specifically support vector regression for water demand forecasting and ad the approach is validated on one urban water network in the city of milan in inoue et al 2017 a deep neural network is proposed for ad in a water treatment system however the approach was tested only against a one class support vector machine model and on one dataset in miau and hung 2020 a supervised deep learning approach is proposed to detect abnormal water levels and perform river flooding forecasting however the method was only tested on one dataset although one particular model may outperform another for a specific domain see e g corominas et al 2011 leigh et al 2019 there is no guarantee that reported performance levels can be extrapolated to other systems or other tasks this challenge has been discussed in several works corominas et al 2018 garrido baserba et al 2020 gibert et al 2018 2010 in response to this need corominas et al 2011 benchmark 5 different univariate techniques for fault detection in wastewater treatment processes however only in a simulation environment in this sense benchmarking refers to the evaluation and comparison of ml methods on different datasets benchmarking results can be then used as standards for subsequent studies one benchmarking study at full scale is reported in lee et al 2008 although it is limited to 5 cases of the same unit process to this day these two studies remain the most comprehensive benchmarking studies concerning data validation in the urban water cycle it is therefore evident that i current works are almost exclusively limited to results within a single case ii the usage of supervised unsupervised one class setups is often performed casually without mentioning the burden of data labelling and or model tuning and iii a comprehensive comparative analysis of commonly applied ml models for different environmental applications is missing this is especially true in environmental datasets which may present a number of important challenges not encountered elsewhere in fact environmental datasets are characterised by a high level of heterogeneity in data since they are produced by a variety of instruments with noted differences in format resolution and quality also environmental systems present high levels of complexity because of interactions between several components climate humans animals etc producing effects that are not understood well the processes are often claimed to be highly nonlinear and can exhibit stochastic or cyclic behaviours these appear at different scales depending on the specific application as a result case specific results are difficult to generalise with this paper we compare different supervised one class and unsupervised ad models on several environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems with this evaluation we specifically aim to assess the relative advantages of data annotation by human experts while also accounting for the strengths and weaknesses of the different model structures their performance as well as their sensitivity to manual parameter tuning in addition this paper also enables effective benchmarking of data driven anomaly detection models by publishing both the code and the datasets this is the first time such a step is done in environmental applications where to make real progress benchmarking of the already existing models is direly needed 2 methods 2 1 machine learning in this section we describe the different ml setups and the procedures for calibration and testing applied to all models under study finally we explain the performance metrics used to evaluate these models 2 1 1 data preprocessing data preprocessing is an important step in ml practice for a number of reasons kotsiantis et al 2006 first these operations can improve the chances and the rate of convergence to optimal parameter values second they can affect the modelled relationship when using models based on distance measures like k nearest neighbours third this ensures that the data matches the expected format for a particular model see e g gurden et al 2001 fourth data preprocessing allows to incorporate expert knowledge through feature engineering into the ml model in this work we center and scale each input variable separately to zero mean and unit variance prior to model calibration in order to ensure that we evaluate the utility of ml methods and not the utility of domain expertise we have also carefully eliminated any knowledge based feature engineering the main reason is that such feature engineering could improve performance of the ml models thus confounding our evaluation of the ml setups we only applied feature engineering in one case study oncyt where each sample was transformed into structured data by means of binning this step was needed to transform the data into a format suitable for the considered ml models and performed in accordance with the domain expert s instruction this is described in detail in the supporting information 2 1 2 model calibration setups for anomaly detection the main goal of calibration is to identify a model s parameters that enable the prediction of the class y for any data point represented as a d dimensional input vector x containing the values for d variables measured at the same time in ad applications the class y can only acquire two label values that is y y 0 1 here the normal data is generally named as negative class with label value 0 and the anomalies are named positive class with label value 1 for our purposes we group the selected models into three ml setups based on the data and target labels y i that are available for calibration these setups are illustrated in fig 1 and described next 1 supervised learning sup is the setup where each calibration data point is paired with a target label y i it is also known as binary classification during calibration of a supervised ad model the model ϕ is calibrated with the calibration dataset x i y i i 1 n to predict the label these predictions are compared with the target labels and the parameters of the model are adjusted to minimise discrepancies during testing the calibrated model ϕ predicts a probability value between 0 to 1 for each new unseen test data point in the test dataset t indicating how likely the data belongs to the anomalous class a threshold α is used to convert the probability to a binary prediction y normal anomaly if the predictive probability is higher than this threshold the test data point is considered anomalous otherwise normal 2 one class supervised learning ocsup is a special case of sup where the calibration dataset only consists of anomaly free data chalapathy et al 2018 ruff et al 2018 while labels are not strictly required as an input during calibration this setup assumes that all data points in the calibration dataset belong to the negative class once the model is identified it is used to evaluate how much a new data point x deviates from the calibration data the measure of deviation is known as the anomaly score similarly to the sup setup a threshold is also set to convert the anomaly score to a binary prediction setting this threshold is typically more subjective as the anomaly score cannot be interpreted as a probability 3 unsupervised learning unsup setup is a setup where the ad model scores the data solely based on the patterns in the calibration dataset d and uses the complete calibration dataset without any target label hastie et al 2009 leung and leckie 2005 this eliminates a tedious examination of the data set available for calibration similarly to ocsup the model produces an anomaly score for every new data point and a threshold is set to convert this to a binary prediction normal anomaly the unsup is expected to work best if the calibration data are contaminated with a negligible or non existent amount of anomalies as noted in the introduction the distinction between unsup and ocsup learning is rarely provided in the ad literature amer et al 2013 sabokrou et al 2018 quite often this implies that the task of removing anomalies from the calibration data has been executed perfectly with the above definitions we stress that the use of a supervised model being either binary or one class requires the input of a domain expert 2 1 3 anomaly detection models in this work we benchmark a wide range of ml model structures the main purpose of this is to ensure that the quantified utility of expert provided labels does not hinge on the choice of a particular model structure the following criteria were used for selection of these paradigms the selected model structures should be fairly popular in the ml community the selected model structures should be available in on the shelf softwares e g scikit learn matlab ml toolbox spark mllib weka and the selected implementation should be compatible with the apache license 2 0 the selected model structures should be available for each of the above learning setups as an example we include a random forest as a binary classifier and an isolation forest for the corresponding one class models five model structures were found that satisfy these requirements they are based on five distinct paradigms which are a mixture of gaussians b nearest neighbours c ensembles of decision trees d models based on the kernel trick and support vectors and e feed forward artificial neural networks these model structures are listed in table 1 each model type can be configured with different hyperparameters hyperparameters are those parameters that determine the detailed structure and flexibility of the models these do not change during model calibration and are typically set based on prior knowledge experience and or exploratory analysis of the calibration data the chosen models and their hyperparameters are discussed in detail in the supporting information 2 2 performance evaluation evaluating the performance of ad models in real world practice is not as straightforward as in typical text book examples the main challenge is that we are dealing with an unbalanced dataset that is the classes are not represented equally indeed the fraction of anomalies in the studied datasets is fairly low as a result detection accuracy metrics e g ratio of correctly identified data samples vs total number of data samples should not be used géron 2019 the selected performance metrics are described next roc curve it is important to note that ad models as defined above deliver a class membership or an anomaly score which needs to be compared to a threshold value to determine the predicted class this means that the resulting model performance critically depends on the choice of threshold in order to evaluate all models fairly irrespective of the chosen threshold we evaluate the model performance for every candidate threshold rather than picking one this results in multiple values for the true positives rate tpr and the false positives rate fpr which change monotonically with the threshold these values are computed as t p r t p t p f n and f p r f p f p t n where true positives tp is the number of correctly identified anomalies y 1 y 1 true negatives tn is the number of correctly classified normal data y 0 y 0 false negatives fn and false positives rp are respectively the number of incorrectly classified normal data y 0 y 1 and anomalies y 1 y 0 a receiver operating characteristic roc curve is then computed for each model by plotting the tpr against the fpr maxion and roberts 2004 in ad applications we would like our models to learn a complete separation of the two underlying distributions normal and anomalous a roc curve corresponding to better separation is located closer to the upper left hand corner in the roc space and thus enables visualisation of the model performance one advantage of roc curves is that they enable visual and quick assessment of the performance of the classifier over its entire operating range fawcett 2006 we remind the reader that a single model corresponds to a unique combination of calibration setup model structure and model hyperparameters the list of evaluated hyperparameters can be found in the supporting information pareto roc curve in addition to the roc for single models i e unique set of hyperparameter values we also compute a pareto roc by selecting those points for which the fpr and tpr values are the highest and therefore optimal among all models sharing the same ml setup this new roc is the upper envelope of the individual roc and thus presents the best results one can obtain through systematic hyper parameter tuning this leads to 15 pareto rocs 5 case studies 3 setups and gives a general insight into the utility of the three calibration setups but ignores differences in sensitivity to the selected model structure and the tuning of the hyper parameters area under the roc curve additionally the area under the curve auc is chosen to summarize the model performance into a single measure fawcett 2006 which ranges from 0 to 1 excellent models with a good measure of separability have an auc near 1 for our purposes the auc is computed first for each model then the mean and standard deviation for these aucs is reported for each of the 15 model structures by reporting the averaged auc as well as the standard deviation for each model we can assess both average performance and sensitivity of the model structures to hyperparameter tuning although the auc is a helpful indicator of model performance it is still an aggregate measure which excludes details shown in the roc for this reason our main conclusions will be based on the rocs and pareto rocs described above 2 3 case studies the datasets used for this study stem from a set of five engineered and natural systems that are currently operational at eawag dübendorf switzerland these infrastructures exhibit several common challenges such as mechanical sensor faults the presence of biological processes with their nonlinearity and seasonality and the presence of natural stochastic events on the other hand they also present a diverse set of measured variables time resolutions and spatio temporal correlations to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a diverse set of domains covering a wide variety of data types present in the water sector seasonal non seasonal urban environmental water quantity quality etc are used for benchmarking of ml models within one study a summary about the datasets characteristics is given in table 2 all datasets have been made publicly available at https doi org 10 25678 0002wj the code developed for labelling the data has also been made available at https doi org 10 25678 0002pc the datasets are described next with particular focus on their type of anomalies and variables used for model calibration specific details regarding data collection and labelling for each case can be found in the supporting information note that a sixth domain léxplore was also studied within this study however the provided labels do not reflect an unbiased opinion of the domain experts since they were provided by an automated tool consequently we have ignored this dataset for benchmarking and discuss the results in the supporting information eawag ponds this is a multivariate time series data of high spatial and temporal resolution that was collected as part of a long term ecological experiment described in lürig et al 2020 narwani et al 2019 the experiment used pond ecosystems hereafter ponds 16 of such ponds were set up at eawag dübendorf switzerland with macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum and dreissena mussels dreissena polymorpha were added progressively to the ponds together with inorganic nutrients each of these ponds was equipped with sensors for eight variables conductivity chlorophyll and phycocyanin fluorescence dissolved organic matter fluorescence dissolved oxygen saturation and concentration ph and temperature measurements of these water parameters were recorded simultaneously in each multi sensor with a fixed time interval of 15 min as for the variables used for model training our domain expert has supplied us with the anomaly labels for specific conductivity and we have trained our models based on this sole information the domain expert manually labelled anomalies for specific conductivity presenting both spiky and long term anomalous events this resulted in a labelled data set containing n 22464 data records with d 8 variables the measured water quality variables the data set covers a period of 234 consecutive days and includes 2 anomalies online flow cytometry this dataset is a time series of high temporal resolution and was collected as part of multiple applied research projects on microbial monitoring besmer et al 2016 2014 the measurements were carried out on water samples directly extracted from water streams by an automated flow cytometry system flow cytometric analysis of water samples was typically carried out every 15 min after sample preparation including tagging of bacteria with fluorescent dyes based on experience 7 categories of potential anomalies were defined and individual flow cytometric measurements were labelled manually by the leading expert user the domain expert reported that most of the time he was confident about the labelled anomaly type after labelling all anomalous labels were grouped as one single anomaly to enable anomaly detection with binary classification resulting in a total of 10 2 anomalies urban water observatory uwo this case study presents data from a long term in sewer process monitoring initiative in the municipality of fehraltorf near zurich in switerland www eawag ch uwo the data used in this study are in sewer flow rates which had been recorded during a period of 1 5 years with a temporal resolution of 5 min two datasets covering the periods 26 march 25 april 2017 and 1 september 12 november 2017 were selected and manually labelled by two domain experts this resulted in two labelled data sets namely uwo s1 and uwo s2 it is important to note that differently to uwo s1 the uwo s2 data set was filtered to eliminate simple point anomalies before labelling to shift the focus to collective anomalies therefore uwo s1 mainly shows simple contextual anomalies while uwo s2 presents complex collective type of anomalies water hub in the water hub researchers from eawag investigate sustainable decentralized and source separated waste water treatment greywater collected from wash basins and showers within the building is treated with a two step process a membrane bioreactor mbr is followed by a biological activated carbon bac filter we focused on the data measured with four pressure sensors placed in the mbr and in the bac respectively two in each process these sensors are installed to monitor the water levels to control the system and to keep track of the hydraulic performance of the system data from all four sensors was analysed to detect process anomalies which were i foam in the mbr ii clogging of the membrane iii blocked level switch in the mbr iv pressure loss drop in the bac and v lack of data the domain expert manually labelled process anomalies for the mbr and the bac separately resulting in a labelled data set containing n 436320 data records of which 13 3 are anomalies with d 4 variables the pressure variables the data set covers a period of 10 months 3 results in this section we show the benchmarking results obtained for each model and domain first we focus on the pareto rocs which give a broad overview of the results of each ml setup this is followed by a detailed discussion of the auc results for every model in every domain we conclude the section with the results related to model selection note that all test were run without the use of a gpu 3 1 pareto roc curves the pareto rocs in fig 2 are obtained by selecting the pareto optimal combinations of the fpr and tpr values obtained for all models for a given calibration setup i e across a all model structures b all applied hyper parameter settings for each model structure and c each threshold for a given model in most cases the sup models perform better than the ocsup and unsup models in one case oncyt the ocsup models show the same performance as the sup models ocsup models show only slight improvements over the unsup models in all cases except oncyt and uwo s2 it can also be seen that although the uwo s1 and s2 domains belong to the same domain of application i e the measured variables are the same the presence of different types of anomalies which was discussed with our domain experts makes a substantial difference in the performance of the ad methods 3 2 auc and sensitivity to hyperparameters to evaluate whether it is important to select a particular set of hyperparameter values we have summarised each roc by means of the average auc and the standard deviation for each model structure and for each domain under study these are visualised in fig 3 in general sup models outperform the others in all domains which corroborates our findings on the importance of having labels to achieve the best possible performance in ad applications the same results are quantitatively reported in the form of summary statistic in the supporting information note that some results related to the svm implementation are not present due to the high computation time of the models calibration time 10h this is due to the large size of the kernel matrix where feasible only the linear lin kernel functions for svm was implemented inspecting fig 3 makes clear that ml models may suffer from a high degree of intra domain variability in addition to inter domain variability indeed the uwo domain cases s1 and s2 are very similar in the nature of the data but produce dissimilar model performance levels we speculate that this is due to different types of anomalies in the two datasets after discussing with our domain expert we concluded that uwo s1 contains more simpler point and contextual anomalies while uwo s2 contains a high number of collective anomalies importantly this means that extrapolating the performance of ml models from one domain to the next is likely to remain difficult even if such domains are considered similar 3 3 model related roc curves finally in fig 4 we show the pareto roc curves in a unique combination of domain and model structure these plots visually highlight the difference in performance between each model for the different domains and confirm the above results that is sup models perform better than the ocsup and unsup models moreover the ocsup and unsup models produce more variable performance levels as already shown previously consequently this means that choosing the best model structures and hyperparameters is important for the ocsup and unsup setups in contrast the variability of model performance among the sup models is far lower suggesting that model structure selection and hyperparameter tuning is far less important in this case 4 discussion we discuss below the main findings of our study we include our practical recommendations for the implementation of ad strategies and in particular data labelling and conclude with an outlook at future research machine learning setups and the value of labels for anomaly detection our study offers a clear indication that the sup learning setup is preferred over the ocsup and unsup setups clearly this means the collection of trusted data labels are critical to maximise the performance of data driven ad ocsup or unsup models while requiring less effort in the labelling step need a higher effort in hyperparameter tuning to obtain a performance that is as close as possible to the sup model performance levels moreover the dominance of the sup setup over the ocsup setup suggests that having access to labelled anomalous data are especially valuable this corroborates the major conclusion of russo et al 2020 model type selection for anomaly detection a key notion in model assessment is model selection that is given two or more ml models choosing the best one for future deployment model selection can be performed based on a specific set of performance metrics dictated by the problem domain e g which fpr is tolerated or which trp is needed we discuss below the specific performance for the tested models to provide help for model selection in fig 2 it is shown that the studied models performed poorly when the dataset contained complex anomalies as in the case of uwo s2 on the contrary it appears that models with a simpler structure specifically danb performed well on the ponds oncyt and uwo s1 datasets these results may be explained by the nature of the anomalous data points visual inspection of the data although subjective suggested that the anomalies are very distinct from normal data points in these domains and easy to spot even for non experts ml models falling in the danb category are generative models that make assumptions on the distribution of the data in cases where the data is well distributed such models could reach high performance possibly because their generative assumptions prevent overfitting ng and jordan 2002 however that is not always true in environmental applications where normal data might not be generated from the same distribution as it presents baseline changes due to different seasons and anomalies may be generated by different events which do not show the same pattern in fact as a general detection performance result more flexible models like ann and ae performed well across the different datasets with aes being sensitive to noisy data that is in the unsup setup where the calibration data contains anomalies they lead to lower performance compared to their ocsup setup implementation this suggests that the generative version of such models that is denoising or variational ae an and cho 2015 could be valuable in such cases these flexible models also have a higher sensitivity to hyperparameters which implies that hyperparameter tuning and so an increased effort in the design of the model architecture is necessary for achieving such performance finally and more importantly the results of this study provide insights on the utility of expert based data labelling given the above results we recommend to perform data labelling and sup modelling if the nature of anomalies in the dataset is complex that is if the anomalies are contextual not well defined and varying over time if however the application domain presents more simple collective anomalies ocsup and unsup modelling could be performed choosing flexible models we envisage that more complex models are needed for the ocsup and unsup setups these can be an ensemble of models baruque and corchado 2011 models with bayesian priors baimuratov et al 2019 reflecting generally applicable domain knowledge or models that use a background or garbage class e g an unsup two class setup where only class is learned and the other one is fixed for more details on this and related concepts please see dhamija et al 2018 limitations of the study and future research in this work 5 selected data sets have been used to benchmark several ml setups and models it is important to note that it is rather difficult if not impossible to evaluate whether these could be completely representative of typical data in water research we do however believe that such a combination of full scale natural and engineered environmental monitoring systems and careful labelling procedure is unprecedented additionally we have assumed that the domain expert provides labels without error or uncertainty this is unlikely and should be accounted for in future work several methods to account for imperfect labels during calibration exist donmez and carbonell 2008 du and ling 2010 liu et al 2013 but require much higher computational requirements one can also employ a higher number of domain experts for the same dataset to quantify uncertainty in the provided labels this increases the labelling effort significantly active learning russo et al 2020 and semi supervised learning zhu and goldberg 2009 could however be combined with labelling by multiple experts to minimize this effort note that a sixth case was included within this study at first unfortunately we found that the provided labels could not be considered an unbiased opinion of the domain experts this is explained particularly by the fact that this dataset is so complex that anomalies are not easily spotted even by application experts russo et al 2019 when so one may chose to incorporate domain knowledge during data preprocessing zheng and casari 2018 or model construction as was applied in this case while this prevents an objective study of the merits of expert based labelling this can lead to useful hybrid models for ad the embedded expertise can be based on temporal correlation redundancy hardware redundancy physical chemical relationships spatial redundancy etc ocsup or unsup models that incorporate temporal dynamics explicitly are also a specific way to include the existence of temporal correlation into the model this would include classical time series analysis models such as arima pena et al 2013 or recurrent neural networks or long short term memory networks which exist in the family of the deep learning models malhotra et al 2015 the utility of domain expertise in ad either through knowledge based feature engineering or hybrid modelling could not be quantified yet this should be considered for evaluation both with or without target labels and can be benchmarked with the provided data sets 5 conclusions a comprehensive evaluation of 15 distinct combinations of model structure and calibration setup was executed with datasets produced by 5 full scale environmental monitoring systems the primary interest was to evaluate the utility of expert based data labelling for anomaly detection purposes this is the first time this has been studied at this scale for aquatic applications our most important conclusions are supervised models are better than models based on unsupervised learning this is true for all of the 5 domains this means that access to labelled data is critical for effective use of machine learning for anomaly detection in environmental systems data additionally we have shown that if the anomalies are not complex then one class models which require less time for labelling could be used the comparison of one class and unsupervised models underlines the value of expert labelling as these models only differ in the provided data for calibration and not in the objective function across all studied domains anomaly detection performance with one class models is better than with unsupervised models this is true for all models with exception of the one class support vector machine models which however perform poorly always the quantified anomaly detection performance of any particular machine learning algorithm depends strongly on the particular domain indeed our results show that evaluated classification accuracy metrics like the area under the curve auc cannot be extrapolated from one domain to the next this is especially true for the one class and unsupervised models where anomaly detection performances were shown to vary between 0 39 and 0 93 even in the sup setting the reported auc varies between 0 77 which is unlikely to be acceptable for online deployment and 0 99 which we expect to exceed minimum requirements unfortunately yet true this means that broad statements on the expected utility of machine learning algorithms should not be trusted our results do not indicate a strong preference for any particular model structure the best available supervised models were artificial neural networks uwo s2 k nearest neighbours ponds waterhub and random forest oncyt uwo s1 among the one class models one class support vector machines perform particularly poorly in all domains it is therefore reasonable to exclude it as a suitable candidate model in future work in absence of data labels unsupervised models the models with best auc include auto encoders oncyt uwo s1 gaussian mixture models ponds isolation forest waterhub and local outlier factor uwo s2 this shows again that a general preference for a particular modelling paradigm cannot be based on anomaly detection performance alone author contribution a h and e m provided data for the waterhub domain a h conducted the labelling

16537,amphetamine amp methamphetamine mamp and 3 4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma occur in wastewater not only as a result of illicit consumption but also in some cases from prescription drug use or by direct drug disposal into the sewage system enantiomeric profiling of these chiral drugs could give more insight into the origin of their occurrence in this manuscript a new analytical methodology for the enantiomeric analysis of amphetamine like substances in wastewater has been developed the method consists of a solid phase extraction spe followed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms which showed low quantification limits in the 2 4 5 5 ng l 1 range the lc ms ms method was first applied to characterize a total of 38 solid street drug samples anonymously provided by consumers the results of these analysis showed that amp and mdma trafficked into spain are synthesized as racemate while mamp is exclusively produced as the s enantiomer then the analytical method was employed to analyse urban wastewater samples collected from the wastewater treatment plants wwtps of five different cities in 2018 and 2019 consumption estimated through normalized population loads in wastewater showed an increased pattern of amp use in the basque country furthermore the enantiomeric profiling of wastewater samples was contrasted to lisdexamfetamine lis and selegiline sel prescription figures two pharmaceuticals which metabolize to s amp and to r amp and r mamp respectively from this analysis and considering uncertainties derived from metabolism and adherence to treatment it was concluded that lis is a relevant source of amp in those cases with low wastewater loads i e up to a maximum of 60 of amp detected in wastewater in some samples could originate from lis prescription while sel does not represent a significant source of amp nor mamp finally removal efficiencies could be evaluated for the wwtp serving ca 860 000 inhabitants with higher amp influent concentrations the removal of amp was satisfactory with rates higher than 99 whereas mdma showed an average removal of approximately 60 accompanied by an enrichment of r mdma graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drug abuse chiral drugs enantiomers sewage wastewater based epidemiology prescription 1 introduction amphetamine amp methamphetamine mamp and 3 4 methylendioxymethamphetamine mdma are synthetic derivatives of phenylethylamine that were used in the past to treat narcolepsy and spastic states of the gastrointestinal tract myerson 1939 however their stimulating effects have also been associated to a high risk of addiction guttmann and sargant 1942 lemere 1967 therefore actions were taken to restrict their clandestine consumption besides classical population surveys hospital related admissions and other epidemiological indicators efforts to detect illicit drugs use in a fast and non invasive way led to the first study using wastewater based epidemiology wbe in 2005 by zuccato et al zuccato et al 2005 they estimated cocaine consumption in a specific population through the analysis of wastewater as an complementary tool to the established epidemiological approaches nowadays this methodology has been applied in many countries to get a near real time profiling of the community wide use of illicit drugs bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 alcohol and tobacco castiglioni et al 2015 gao et al 2020 lópez garcía et al 2020 montes et al 2020 rodríguez álvarez et al 2015 2014a 2014b ryu et al 2016 tscharke et al 2016 additionally wbe has been extended to estimate unwanted exposure to chemicals senta et al 2020 such as pesticides rousis et al 2016 flame retardants been et al 2018 castro et al 2020 bisphenol a lopardo et al 2019 and plasticizers estévez danta et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2021 2017 and more recently as a useful tool to follow and predict the evolution of covid 19 ahmed et al 2020 alygizakis et al 2020 medema et al 2020 a key factor in wbe studies is the selection of appropriate human biomarkers however the estimation of amp mamp and mdma consumption is sometimes troublesome because the biomarkers usually measured in wastewater are the parent compounds i e unchanged excreted fraction which can occur in wastewater not only as a result of illicit consumption but also from prescription drug use or direct disposal from waste of illegal drug production emke et al 2014 yet these three drugs are chiral and contain one asymmetric carbon atom that leads to two enantiomers r and s in the human body this chirality implies different biological activity and consequently different distribution and metabolism kalant 2001 kasprzyk hordern et al 2010 illicit amp and mdma are usually synthetized by the leuckart method to yield a racemic mixture emcdda 2021a b emke et al 2018 hauser et al 2020 kalant 2001 king 2009 whereas mamp is mainly produced as pure s enantiomer across europe with the only reported exception of norway where the synthesis facilities are different than in central europe and usually synthetize mamp as a racemate castrignanò et al 2018 amp and mamp are used in some countries as a prescribed medication to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd narcolepsy or as a dietary supplement to lose weight cody 2002 in spain amp is not prescribed itself but as the prodrug lisdexamfetamine lis used to treat adhd which is metabolized to s amp in the human body comiran et al 2021 krishnan et al 2008 pennick 2013 mamp and mdma do not currently have medical applications however selegiline sel a medication used in parkinson treatment metabolizes to produce the r enantiomer of amp and mamp reynolds et al 1978 thus both lis and sel could be potential sources of amp and mamp in sewage besides illicit consumption castrignanò et al 2018 lertxundi et al 2021 in the case of these three amphetamine like substances the s enantiomer is more active and therefore metabolizes faster than the r enantiomer kasprzyk hordern 2010 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 this consequently results in a change of the enantiomeric ratio towards the enrichment of the r enantiomer thus mainly the r enantiomer is detected in untreated wastewater if the racemic drug is consumed hence enantiomeric analyses can complement traditional wbe estimates by applying analytical methods that allow the determination of different chiral drug enantiomers and therefore differentiate between licit prescription or illicit use or direct dumping in the sewage network castrignanò et al 2018 emke et al 2014 gao et al 2018 enantiomeric profiling has been mainly performed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms in combination with a previous sample concentration usually a solid phase extraction spe kaspryzk horden and baker kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 were the first to address chiral analysis of these substances in that first study oasis mcx cartridges were used for spe due to the basic nature of the illicit drugs studied however oasis hlb cartridges have also been employed in some other studies archer et al 2018 castrignanò et al 2016 vazquez roig et al 2014 although there are some wbe derived studies targeting enantiomeric separation in different countries archer et al 2018 castrignanò et al 2018 emke et al 2014 gao et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 in spain enantiomeric profiling has been applied only to two cities castellón and valencia of the valencian community region castrignanò et al 2018 vazquez roig et al 2014 moreover in a more recent study on wbe of illicit drugs in spain bijlsma et al 2021 high levels of amp were observed in the area of bilbao however the origin of such substance could not be fully clarified lertxundi et al 2021 even when a preliminary version of the enantiomeric profiling method presented here was used hence the aim of this work was to delve into spatial differences by including 5 mid to large cities and their metropolitan areas located in five spanish regions and covering around 2 million people overall to that end we have developed and validated a new enantiomeric analysis method and applied it to amp mamp and mdma street drug samples obtained from different locations in spain to evaluate their enantiomeric fractions and purity also wastewater samples from the above mentioned regions were collected in 2018 and 2019 and analysed finally a detailed discussion on the contribution of the prescription drugs lis and sel to the amounts of amp and mamp detected in wastewater is presented for the first time 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents individual solutions of 1 mg ml 1 of amp mamp and mdma and of 0 1 mg ml 1 of their deuterated analogues amp d6 mamp d5 and mdma d5 used as internal standards iss were supplied by cerilliant round rock tx usa as racemic mixtures individual solutions of 1 mg ml 1 of the s enantiomer of amp mamp and mdma were supplied by merck darmstadt germany ultrapure water was obtained with a millipore milli q gradient a 10

across organics thermo fischer scientific geel belgium 2 2 drug dose samples street drug samples were supplied by energy control and ai laket as powder or crystal these two spanish organizations aim to reduce risks related to recreational drug use by providing fast and anonymous information to users on the composition of the drugs they are going to consume hence such drugs were submitted to the harm reduction drug checking services in an anonymous way and were then shipped to santiago de compostela for analysis these drug samples were diluted to a nominal concentration of 250 ng ml 1 of powder in meoh spiked with the iss 100 ng ml 1 each of and injected into the lc ms ms system 2 3 wastewater samples composite 24 h raw wastewater samples were collected at five wastewater treatment plants wwtps located in spain for 7 consecutive days in spring 2018 and 2019 except in the wwtp of palma for which samples were only collected in 2018 details on each location population served by each wwtp and sampling are displayed in table s1 in addition in 2019 treated wastewater samples from the wwtp of galindo bilbao and its large metropolitan area in which high concentrations of amp were detected were collected with a delay of 24 h with respect to raw wastewater june 12th 18th in order to assess enantioselective removal efficiencies on request of the wwtp managers this wwtp treats the wastewater from over 850 000 inhabitants with an average flow of ca 250 000 m3 day 1 table s1 the wwtp is equipped with a primary treatment flocculation and coagulation and a secondary conventional activated sludge treatment including anoxic anaerobic and aerobic treatments the average hydraulic and sludge retention times are 24 h and 22 5 days respectively 2 4 wastewater samples pretreatment sample preparation was performed by two different analytical methods to identify and quantify chiral drugs in wastewater 2 4 1 method a all samples except those from castellón and madrid see 2 4 2 were processed in santiago de compostela with method a following the protocol described by gonzález mariño et al 2018 with some modifications see discussion on 3 2 briefly 100 ml of samples were vacuum filtered through 0 7 µm gf a glass microfiber filters whatman kent uk and 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters millipore and spiked with the iss 100 ng l 1 each spe was performed by mixed mode reversed phase strong cation exchange cartridges oasis mcx 150 mg waters milford ma usa previously rinsed with 5 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh followed by 5 ml of ultrapure water after loading sorbents were dried under a nitrogen stream during 30 min washed with 4 ml of meoh as a clean up solution and analytes were then eluted with 3 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh eluates were evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream using a turbo vap ii zymark hopkinton ma usa and a mini vap supelco steinheim germany concentrators finally extracts were redissolved in 100 µl of meoh filtered through 0 22 µm pvdf syringe driven filters merck and injected into the lc ms system 2 4 2 method b samples from castellón and madrid were extracted in the laboratory of the university jaume i following the protocol described by bijlsma et al 2014a hereinafter method b in brief 25 ml of sample were four times diluted with ultrapure water spiked with 1 ng ml 1 of iss mixture and filtered through 0 45 µm cellulose filters millipore then spe was performed by oasis hlb 60 mg reversed phase cartridges waters previously rinsed with 4 ml of meoh followed by 4 ml of ultrapure water after loading sorbents were dried under a nitrogen stream during 30 min and analytes eluted with 5 ml of meoh eluates were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen using a turbo vap ii and a mini vap concentrators finally extracts were redissolved in 1 ml of 10 meoh in ultrapure water these extracts were shipped frozen to santiago de compostela where they were evaporated to dryness redissolved in 100 µl of meoh and filtered through 0 22 µm pvdf syringe driven filters being then ready for lc ms ms analysis 2 5 instrumental analysis instrumental analysis was performed with a waters acquity uplc h class system equipped with a quaternary solvent pump a thermostated lc column compartment and a sample manager the uplc system was interfaced to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer xevo tqd from waters the chromatographic separation was performed at 40 c on a lux amp chiral column 150 3 mm i d 3 µm particle size from phenomenex torrance ca usa under final working conditions a dual eluent system consisting of a ultrapure water with 50 mm nh3 and b meoh was used at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min 1 the linear gradient consisted of the following stages 0 min 60 b 15 min 60 b 20 min 95 b 25 min 95 b 25 1 min 60 b and 30 min 60 b injection volume was set at 10 µl the interface between the uplc system and the xevo tqd mass spectrometer was an electrospray ionization esi source operating in positive mode at a fixed capillary voltage of 3 kv and a temperature of 150 c nitrogen provided by a nitrogen generator from peak scientific barcelona spain was used as desolvation gas at 600 l h 1 and 450 c and as cone gas at 10 l h 1 analyses were performed by ms ms in selected reaction monitoring srm mode acquiring one precursor product ion transitions per is and two transitions per analyte one of them used for quantification and the second one for confirmatory purposes argon was used as collision gas table s2 compiles chemical formulae retention times rt transitions q and optimal cone voltages cv and collision energies ce for every analyte 2 6 method performance and quality assurance instrumental detection and quantification limits idls and iqls were estimated from the lowest concentration level of the calibration curve providing a signal to noise ratio s n of 3 and 10 respectively calibration curves were prepared in meoh and ranged from the iql to 2500 ng ml 1 for amp enantiomers and from the iql to 500 ng ml 1 for the enantiomers of the remaining compounds spiked is concentration referred to the final extract and each enantiomer 100 ng ml 1 for method a and 10 ng ml 1 for method b intra day and inter day instrumental precision were assessed by the relative standard deviation rsd of seven injections of two calibration standards containing 5 ng ml 1 and 50 ng ml 1 of all analytes and 100 ng ml 1 of is injections were performed within the same day intra day precision and in four different days within a month inter day precision trueness and precision of the whole spe lc ms ms method a were assessed by recovery studies in ultrapure water and wastewater spiked with 12 5 ng l 1 and 125 ng l 1 respectively of all the analytes 100 ng l 1 of is wastewater aliquots spiked only with iss were also analysed to account for analyte levels in this matrix matrix effects mes were calculated as the signal analyte peak area percentage in a 125 ng ml 1 spiked wastewater extract after non spiked sample signal subtraction and referred to the signal of a 125 ng ml 1 standard method detection limits mdls and method quantification limits mqls were calculated from non spiked wastewater samples for a signal to noise ratio s n of 3 and 10 respectively in the case of method b quality of data was assured by analysing additional extracts provided by the university jaume i which had been previously already analysed in such university and were used as quality controls qc thus four samples of wastewater samples were spiked at two concentration levels two of them with 50 ng l 1 and the remaining two with 400 ng l 1 referring to each enantiomer were extracted at the university jaume i following sample pretreatment method b the resulting extracts were shipped to the university of santiago de compostela where they were analysed to assess method s trueness and precision and to calculate the mdls and mqls extrapolated from the lowest level spiked sample 2 7 calculations of enantiomeric fractions the elution order of enantiomers was confirmed by the analysis of s enantiomerically pure standards the concentration of each enantiomer was calculated by the internal standard calibration method then the concentration of each enantiomer cr for the r enantiomer and cs for s enantiomer was used to obtain the enantiomeric fraction ef in this work ef is presented as efr i e the ratio between the concentrations of the r enantiomer and the sum of both enantiomers as shown in eq 1 1 e f r c r c r c s 2 8 estimation of human illicit drugs consumption drug concentration sum of

gracia lor et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry separation was performed on a lux amp column a dual eluent system consisting of a ultrapure water and b meoh was used with the addition of three different modifiers to the aqueous phase 5 mm of ammonium bicarbonate at ph 11 recommended by the column supplier 50 mm of nh3 at ph 11 and 5 mm of ammonium acetate at ph 9 an adequate separation of enantiomers was observed at ph 11 independently of the modifier used ammonium bicarbonate and nh3 conversely ammonium acetate at ph 9 could not resolve the chromatographic peaks of the enantiomers likely due to the incomplete neutralization of the target species at this ph fig s1 finally 50 mm of nh3 at ph 11 was selected as aqueous mobile phase additive due to the higher signal intensity and lower noise observed as compared to the addition of ammonium bicarbonate fig s1 instrumental parameters investigated include linearity idls iqls and intra and inter day precision table 1 the representation of the analyte area is area response versus spiked analyte concentration iql 2500 ng ml 1 range for each amp enantiomer and iql 500 ng ml 1 range for the remaining enantiomers fitted a linear model with determination coefficients r2 higher than 0 997 idl and iql values varied between 0 2 ng ml 1 and 0 4 ng ml 1 and between 0 6 ng ml 1 and 1 4 ng ml 1 respectively rsd values from the intra day precision varied between 0 7 and 4 3 for the 5 ng ml 1 standard and between 0 5 and 3 3 for the 50 ng ml 1 level rsd from the inter day precision was 8 6 at 50 ng ml 1 and 4 8 at 5 ng ml 1 except for s mamp for which it was 12 3 2 solid phase extraction the extraction protocol applied in method a was based on a previous study gonzález mariño et al 2018 but modified in order to improve its selectivity by including a clean up step and optimizing the elution solvent volume first absolute recoveries for samples extracted with oasis mcx 125 ng l 1 spike level were compared to the sample preparation recoveries obtained when introducing a clean up step with 4 ml of meoh before the elution performed with 5 nh3 in meoh in both cases fig s2a both protocols showed good and comparable recoveries thus no significant losses were observed due to the clean up also mes were tested for both protocols since previous studies had reported improvements in this regard after the introduction of a clean up step gonzález mariño et al 2012 2009 senta et al 2013 significantly lower matrix effects were observed i e values of me close to 100 when the clean up step was included fig s2b finally the elution volume was optimized by collecting three consecutive fractions of 3 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh which were analysed independently more than 94 of all analytes eluted in the first fraction data not shown and consequently the elution volume was reduced from 10 ml in the former method gonzález mariño et al 2018 to only 3 ml 3 3 method performance method a was validated in terms of trueness precision mdls and mqls table 1 percentages of recovery r for triplicate analyses of ultrapure water samples spiked with 12 5 ng l 1 of all analytes and 100 ng l 1 of is varied between 90 and 105 with rsds between 1 and 6 in raw wastewater samples spiked with 125 ng l 1 of all enantiomers and 100 ng l 1 of is r varied between 82 and 116 and rsd between 4 and 15 mdls ranged from 0 7 ng l 1 to 1 8 ng l 1 and mqls from 2 4 ng l 1 to 5 5 ng l 1 table s3 compares the performance of the proposed method versus other analytical methods developed for the determination of chiral amphetamine like substances in raw wastewater iqls and mqls were at the same order of magnitude than those reported in other methodologies archer et al 2018 castrignanò et al 2016 castrignanò et al 2018 gao et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2010 however all those methods rely on the application of reversed phase oasis hlb cartridges which can perform well in terms of trueness see also below but do not offer the same degree of selectivity as obtained by mixed mode spe a further advantage of the method proposed here is that the chromatographic separation is performed under gradient conditions which increases column lifetime when a complex matrix as is the case of wastewater is analysed finally the run time of the chromatographic method developed here is 30 min considerably lower than over 140 min required for other chiral separations kasprzyk hordern 2010 vazquez roig et al 2014 since the samples from castellón and madrid had already been extracted by another spe protocol based on oasis hlb cartridges method b and the enrichment increased by further evaporation of the extracts see 2 4 2 the performance of this protocol was evaluated through recovery studies with the qc samples as it is displayed in table s4 recoveries varied between 66 and 125 and rsd 17 thus this spe protocol was acceptable in terms of trueness and precision mql values estimated from the lowest concentration qc samples ranged from 3 8 to 8 3 ng l 1 3 4 drug samples characterization sample code main drug origin purity and efr of each drug sample herein analysed are listed in table s5 the 38 drug dose samples were submitted to the two drug checking services energy control and ai laket by anonymous drug consumers consumers labelled them as the drugs they expected them to contain 18 were labelled as amp 6 as mamp and 14 as mdma sample purity evaluated as explained in 2 2 is summarized in table 2 details in table s5 amp samples presented a variable purity ranging from 2 7 to 103 mamp purity was more consistent and ranged between 54 and 76 while mdma purity varied between 0 and 107 no mdma was found in the sample coded mdma 4 collected in andalucía table s5 the results as regards efr show a concordance with the reported synthesis route of these drugs in europe castrignanò et al 2018 king 2009 thus amp and mdma samples were all racemate mixtures while mamp samples were all the pure s enantiomer table 2 summarizes also the results shown in table s5 the limited number of samples does not allow us to address regional patterns 3 5 wastewater analysis efr of the amphetamine like substances found in wastewater were calculated from the concentrations measured in this matrix see eq 1 following wbe calculations loads eq 2 and human consumption eq 3 were subsequently estimated the total concentration sum of the two enantiomers measured is summarized in table 3 detailed results are provided in table s6 excretion loads and estimated consumption values per city substance and year are summarized in table 3 further details in tables s7 and s8 weekend peaks in loads consumption tables s7 and s8 were observed in most locations for mdma while this was not so clear in the case of amp or mamp a potential explanation is that these two last substances may originate either from daily abusers or prescription patients particularly in the case of amp as further discussed below similar results have been observed in several other countries castrignanò et al 2018 thomas et al 2012 3 5 1 amphetamine amp was positively detected in all the wastewater samples the high concentration levels found in bilbao and its metropolitan area in 2018 mean 663 ng l 1 bijlsma et al 2021 were confirmed in 2019 mean 1375 ng l 1 table 3 although considerably lower the second highest concentrations were detected in palma mean values 106 ng l 1 only samples from 2018 available the highest loads were observed in bilbao in 2019 mean 277 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 even higher than the loads reported in 2018 mean 203 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 in the remaining cities the estimated loads of amp was lower than 45 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table 3 these results match former observations in spain and confirms the distinct pattern of consumption in the area of bilbao which is closer to the patterns observed in other countries such as belgium western germany been et al 2016 or some nordic countries where amp is one of the most prevalent drugs gonzález mariño et al 2020 the enantiomeric analysis showed a slight enrichment of r amp in the wastewater of most cities with efr higher than 0 5 table 3 details in table s9 this matches the data obtained from the analysis of urine of 165 abusers with provided and average efr of 0 508 george and braithwaite 2000 and highlights the fact that enrichment of r amp due to faster metabolization of s amp in the human body is not as high as in the case of mdma see 3 5 3 therefore making it difficult to differentiate illicit consumption from dumping events that would lead to racemic amp on the basis of enantiomeric analysis only as described by emke et al 2014 despites this fact dumping it is unlikely to play a major role in our study since even in the case of bilbao where very high loads would point to direct disposal no abnormal lead peak was detected on any singular day and associated to a change in the value of efr tables s6 s9 as already observed for instance for amp and mdma dumping events in the netherlands emke et al 2014 yet the efr obtained here are similar to those reported in other cities across europe castrignanò et al 2018 including valencia vazquez roig et al 2014 in the case of castellón the efr laid between 0 49 0 03 and 0 50 0 02 table 3 which is equivalent to a racemic mixture samples from castellón were also measured in 2015 by castrignanò et al castrignanò et al 2018 yet amp was not detected that study conversely an enrichment of s amp was detected in madrid northern area in 2018 with an average efr of 0 41 0 03 while only the s isomer was detected above the mql in 2019 table 3 such observation could be partly related to a high contribution of lis prescription in that area in order to evaluate the potential contribution of medical prescription of lis to wbe derived consumption estimations these data were compared with the available lis prescription data from four of the five studied regions galicia basque country balearic islands and community of madrid data from the community of valencia was not available these data as defined daily doses ddd day 11 000 inhabitants 1 were obtained on a month basis for the province or municipality see details in table s10 prescription data were converted into excretion loads of amp considering the ddd of lis 30 mg https www whocc no atc ddd index the average excretion of s amp from lis 44 75 and the molecular weights of both drugs the excretion value of 44 75 was derived as the average from two studies performed with 7 individuals each where s amp accounted for 48 5 and 41 of the lis dose respectively comiran et al 2021 krishnan et al 2008 table s11 as it is displayed in table 4 the expected loads of s amp from lis prescription range from 1 0 to 7 0 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 when compared to the loads of amp sum of both enantiomers actually found in wastewater the prescription of lis would account for less than 1 of the amp consumption estimated in bilbao and its metropolitan area clearly pointing to illicit drug use conversely in madrid northern area about 58 of amp consumption in 2018 could be explained by prescription which together with efr results 0 50 in 2018 r amp below mql in 2019 could confirm a mixed origin illicit use and lis prescription in santiago de compostela medical prescription contribution is expected to be relatively high over 37 44 table 4 but the efr was above 0 53 table s9 in all samples which could then indicate that illicit consumption would be more relevant than lis prescription this disagreement may be explained by the fact that the external psychology consultations at the santiago s hospital cover a larger healthcare area thus many of the patients do not live in this area and thus do no contribute to the wastewater samples further factors contributing to the uncertainty of the estimations made are non adherence to prescription which has been calculated to be a 30 in spain siffel et al 2020 therefore data presented in table 4 would likely represent an overestimating scenario maximum contribution of prescription and the real contribution of lis would be lower even with these data in mind some efr values would be higher than 0 5 in locations where prescription should be a relevant source this is further limited by the fact that when pure george and braithwaite 2000 or enriched enantiomer cody et al 2003 medications are prescribed a certain degree of interconversion occurs over time which would lead to excretion of some r amp and not only pure s amp considering these limitations it seems still evident that the contribution of lis prescription should be taken into account in future studies particularly in those areas where the amount of amp measured in wastewater is rather low as regards the contribution of sel prescription to r amp in wastewater the expectable loads would range from 0 0028 to 0 022 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table s12 those data were obtained from sel prescription figures considering a 15 4 excretion rate as the weighted average of 4 different studies with a total of 21 individuals detailed in table s13 elsworth et al 1978 heinonen et al 1989 liebowitz et al 1985 reynolds et al 1978 and the corresponding molecular weights such loads can be considered as negligible as they are two orders of magnitude lower than those from lis therefore representing less than 0 2 of the total amp in any of the wwtps actually even in palma where the prescription of sel was higher and with a dry precipitation regime thus lower wwtp inflows such loads will translate into ca 0 2 ng l 1 concentrations of r amp i e below the mdl of the method 3 5 2 methamphetamine only s mamp was detected in wastewater and the concentrations were low in all cities with average values below 45 ng l 1 table 3 and maximum values up to 54 ng l 1 table s6 s mamp average loads were lower than 13 mg day 1 1000 inhabitants 1 tables 3 and s7 confirming previous observations in spain with barcelona not analysed here being the exception bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 the prescription of sel would be equivalent to loads in the 0 0090 0 072 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table s12 after considering an average excretion of r mamp of 45 5 from sel according to the metabolism data compiled in table s13 elsworth et al 1978 heinonen et al 1989 liebowitz et al 1985 reynolds et al 1978 again as in the case of amp considering palma as the place where the highest contribution of sel prescription towards r mamp is expected this would result into concentrations of ca 0 6 ng l 1 which is below the mdl thus as regards the enantiomeric profiling of mamp efr was always 0 i e r mamp was below mdl in all samples table s9 these data reinforces the results observed in 3 4 that indicated that mamp consumed in spain is synthesized as pure s mamp as in most parts of europe while the contribution of sel is negligible this would prevent from detecting any direct dumping event but since no particularly high concentrations could be detected this was not expected to have occurred in any of the wwtps investigated during the sampling period 3 5 3 mdma as for amp the two enantiomers of mdma were detected in wastewater the mean mdma concentration as sum of both isomers ranged from mql up to 374 ng l 1 table s6 the highest concentrations were found in the wastewater from palma but once corrected for population and flows this does not translate into higher loads average loads varied between 2 and 38 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table 3 which is in the range of the already estimated mdma loads in spain in former studies gonzález mariño et al 2020 the efr average for mdma was 0 61 0 05 being above 0 5 in all samples table s9 thus indicating the predominance of r mdma in wastewater these values match with urinary data where 6 volunteers administered 100 mg of racemic mdma leaded to an average efr of 0 657 over 24 h pizarro et al 2002 furthermore an autopsy study revealed an efr of 0 57 moore et al 1996 as mdma is trafficked as racemate see 3 4 and the s enantiomer is metabolized faster in the human body the observed enrichment of r mdma corroborates illicit consumption as the main source of mdma in wastewater castrignanò et al 2018 no event of drug disposal in the sewage network was detected 3 5 4 treated wastewater given the high concentrations of amp detected in the wwtp of bilbao and its metropolitan area in both 2018 and 2019 treated wastewater samples were also collected in 2019 and in the same way as raw wastewater but with a delay of 24 h to account for the hydraulic residence time in the plant amp and mamp levels were below the mql in all treated wastewater samples whereas mdma was detected in all samples as detailed in table s14 mdma levels ranged from 31 to 99 ng l 1 average 57 ng l 1 which is similar to the median value of 56 ng l 1 measured in the effluents of 42 wwtps from the region of catalonia spain collected during 2006 and 2007 huerta fontela et al 2008 little is known about the ecotoxicological effects of mdma but the anticipated value of predicted non effect concentration for this substance is 220 ng l 1 fernández rubio et al 2019 hence emissions from the wwtp are not expected to generate ecotoxicological effects yet there is a clear need for further experimental data particularly considering the co occurrence of different enantiomers sanganyado et al 2017 these data imply that the removal of amp in the wwtp considering the mql was higher than 99 while mdma nominal removal was 61 when considering the average concentrations measured in the effluent and influent mamp was below the mql in both types of wastewater similar good removal rates for amp but a higher variability in the case of mdma have been reported in the literature bijlsma et al 2012 2014b huerta fontela et al 2008 yadav et al 2017 furthermore the efr of mdma shifted from 0 68 0 07 in the influent to 0 88 0 04 in the effluent which implies a further prevalence of the less biologically active enantiomer r mdma after the wastewater treatment and a clear distinct elimination profile of both enantiomers i e average removals of 21 and 77 for r mdma and s mdma respectively such enantioselective elimination has already been observed in a wwtp in valencia studied in 2012 vazquez roig et al 2014 but as mentioned ecotoxicological implications remain unknown 4 conclusions an analytical methodology based on spe and lc ms ms has been successfully developed for the determination of three chiral amphetamine like substances in urban wastewater and street drug samples the analyses of consumer donated street drugs clearly indicated that amp and mdma are produced as racemic mixtures for the spanish illicit market while mamp is produced as the pure active s enantiomer the enantiomeric profiling from wastewater analyses indicated that much higher levels of amp occur in the metropolitan area of bilbao compared to other spanish cities which combined with lis and sel prescription data indicate that its origin can be attributed mainly to illicit consumption conversely in the remaining spanish cities investigated where amp levels are low the prescription of lis may become a relevant source of amp whereas the contribution of the prescription of the pharmaceutical sel to amp and mamp loads is negligible finally the analysis of effluent samples in the area of bilbao showed that amp is well removed in a wwtp equipped with conventional biological water treatments while the removal of mdma is relatively high for the s enantiomer but much more limited for r mdma credit authorship contribution statement andrea estévez danta investigation

16537,amphetamine amp methamphetamine mamp and 3 4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma occur in wastewater not only as a result of illicit consumption but also in some cases from prescription drug use or by direct drug disposal into the sewage system enantiomeric profiling of these chiral drugs could give more insight into the origin of their occurrence in this manuscript a new analytical methodology for the enantiomeric analysis of amphetamine like substances in wastewater has been developed the method consists of a solid phase extraction spe followed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms which showed low quantification limits in the 2 4 5 5 ng l 1 range the lc ms ms method was first applied to characterize a total of 38 solid street drug samples anonymously provided by consumers the results of these analysis showed that amp and mdma trafficked into spain are synthesized as racemate while mamp is exclusively produced as the s enantiomer then the analytical method was employed to analyse urban wastewater samples collected from the wastewater treatment plants wwtps of five different cities in 2018 and 2019 consumption estimated through normalized population loads in wastewater showed an increased pattern of amp use in the basque country furthermore the enantiomeric profiling of wastewater samples was contrasted to lisdexamfetamine lis and selegiline sel prescription figures two pharmaceuticals which metabolize to s amp and to r amp and r mamp respectively from this analysis and considering uncertainties derived from metabolism and adherence to treatment it was concluded that lis is a relevant source of amp in those cases with low wastewater loads i e up to a maximum of 60 of amp detected in wastewater in some samples could originate from lis prescription while sel does not represent a significant source of amp nor mamp finally removal efficiencies could be evaluated for the wwtp serving ca 860 000 inhabitants with higher amp influent concentrations the removal of amp was satisfactory with rates higher than 99 whereas mdma showed an average removal of approximately 60 accompanied by an enrichment of r mdma graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drug abuse chiral drugs enantiomers sewage wastewater based epidemiology prescription 1 introduction amphetamine amp methamphetamine mamp and 3 4 methylendioxymethamphetamine mdma are synthetic derivatives of phenylethylamine that were used in the past to treat narcolepsy and spastic states of the gastrointestinal tract myerson 1939 however their stimulating effects have also been associated to a high risk of addiction guttmann and sargant 1942 lemere 1967 therefore actions were taken to restrict their clandestine consumption besides classical population surveys hospital related admissions and other epidemiological indicators efforts to detect illicit drugs use in a fast and non invasive way led to the first study using wastewater based epidemiology wbe in 2005 by zuccato et al zuccato et al 2005 they estimated cocaine consumption in a specific population through the analysis of wastewater as an complementary tool to the established epidemiological approaches nowadays this methodology has been applied in many countries to get a near real time profiling of the community wide use of illicit drugs bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 alcohol and tobacco castiglioni et al 2015 gao et al 2020 lópez garcía et al 2020 montes et al 2020 rodríguez álvarez et al 2015 2014a 2014b ryu et al 2016 tscharke et al 2016 additionally wbe has been extended to estimate unwanted exposure to chemicals senta et al 2020 such as pesticides rousis et al 2016 flame retardants been et al 2018 castro et al 2020 bisphenol a lopardo et al 2019 and plasticizers estévez danta et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2021 2017 and more recently as a useful tool to follow and predict the evolution of covid 19 ahmed et al 2020 alygizakis et al 2020 medema et al 2020 a key factor in wbe studies is the selection of appropriate human biomarkers however the estimation of amp mamp and mdma consumption is sometimes troublesome because the biomarkers usually measured in wastewater are the parent compounds i e unchanged excreted fraction which can occur in wastewater not only as a result of illicit consumption but also from prescription drug use or direct disposal from waste of illegal drug production emke et al 2014 yet these three drugs are chiral and contain one asymmetric carbon atom that leads to two enantiomers r and s in the human body this chirality implies different biological activity and consequently different distribution and metabolism kalant 2001 kasprzyk hordern et al 2010 illicit amp and mdma are usually synthetized by the leuckart method to yield a racemic mixture emcdda 2021a b emke et al 2018 hauser et al 2020 kalant 2001 king 2009 whereas mamp is mainly produced as pure s enantiomer across europe with the only reported exception of norway where the synthesis facilities are different than in central europe and usually synthetize mamp as a racemate castrignanò et al 2018 amp and mamp are used in some countries as a prescribed medication to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd narcolepsy or as a dietary supplement to lose weight cody 2002 in spain amp is not prescribed itself but as the prodrug lisdexamfetamine lis used to treat adhd which is metabolized to s amp in the human body comiran et al 2021 krishnan et al 2008 pennick 2013 mamp and mdma do not currently have medical applications however selegiline sel a medication used in parkinson treatment metabolizes to produce the r enantiomer of amp and mamp reynolds et al 1978 thus both lis and sel could be potential sources of amp and mamp in sewage besides illicit consumption castrignanò et al 2018 lertxundi et al 2021 in the case of these three amphetamine like substances the s enantiomer is more active and therefore metabolizes faster than the r enantiomer kasprzyk hordern 2010 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 this consequently results in a change of the enantiomeric ratio towards the enrichment of the r enantiomer thus mainly the r enantiomer is detected in untreated wastewater if the racemic drug is consumed hence enantiomeric analyses can complement traditional wbe estimates by applying analytical methods that allow the determination of different chiral drug enantiomers and therefore differentiate between licit prescription or illicit use or direct dumping in the sewage network castrignanò et al 2018 emke et al 2014 gao et al 2018 enantiomeric profiling has been mainly performed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms in combination with a previous sample concentration usually a solid phase extraction spe kaspryzk horden and baker kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 were the first to address chiral analysis of these substances in that first study oasis mcx cartridges were used for spe due to the basic nature of the illicit drugs studied however oasis hlb cartridges have also been employed in some other studies archer et al 2018 castrignanò et al 2016 vazquez roig et al 2014 although there are some wbe derived studies targeting enantiomeric separation in different countries archer et al 2018 castrignanò et al 2018 emke et al 2014 gao et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 in spain enantiomeric profiling has been applied only to two cities castellón and valencia of the valencian community region castrignanò et al 2018 vazquez roig et al 2014 moreover in a more recent study on wbe of illicit drugs in spain bijlsma et al 2021 high levels of amp were observed in the area of bilbao however the origin of such substance could not be fully clarified lertxundi et al 2021 even when a preliminary version of the enantiomeric profiling method presented here was used hence the aim of this work was to delve into spatial differences by including 5 mid to large cities and their metropolitan areas located in five spanish regions and covering around 2 million people overall to that end we have developed and validated a new enantiomeric analysis method and applied it to amp mamp and mdma street drug samples obtained from different locations in spain to evaluate their enantiomeric fractions and purity also wastewater samples from the above mentioned regions were collected in 2018 and 2019 and analysed finally a detailed discussion on the contribution of the prescription drugs lis and sel to the amounts of amp and mamp detected in wastewater is presented for the first time 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents individual solutions of 1 mg ml 1 of amp mamp and mdma and of 0 1 mg ml 1 of their deuterated analogues amp d6 mamp d5 and mdma d5 used as internal standards iss were supplied by cerilliant round rock tx usa as racemic mixtures individual solutions of 1 mg ml 1 of the s enantiomer of amp mamp and mdma were supplied by merck darmstadt germany ultrapure water was obtained with a millipore milli q gradient a 10 system bedford ma usa lc ms grade methanol meoh formic acid 95 97 ammonium bicarbonate 99 5 and ammonia nh3 solution in water 25 were supplied by merck ammonia solution in meoh 7 n was supplied by across organics thermo fischer scientific geel belgium 2 2 drug dose samples street drug samples were supplied by energy control and ai laket as powder or crystal these two spanish organizations aim to reduce risks related to recreational drug use by providing fast and anonymous information to users on the composition of the drugs they are going to consume hence such drugs were submitted to the harm reduction drug checking services in an anonymous way and were then shipped to santiago de compostela for analysis these drug samples were diluted to a nominal concentration of 250 ng ml 1 of powder in meoh spiked with the iss 100 ng ml 1 each of and injected into the lc ms ms system 2 3 wastewater samples composite 24 h raw wastewater samples were collected at five wastewater treatment plants wwtps located in spain for 7 consecutive days in spring 2018 and 2019 except in the wwtp of palma for which samples were only collected in 2018 details on each location population served by each wwtp and sampling are displayed in table s1 in addition in 2019 treated wastewater samples from the wwtp of galindo bilbao and its large metropolitan area in which high concentrations of amp were detected were collected with a delay of 24 h with respect to raw wastewater june 12th 18th in order to assess enantioselective removal efficiencies on request of the wwtp managers this wwtp treats the wastewater from over 850 000 inhabitants with an average flow of ca 250 000 m3 day 1 table s1 the wwtp is equipped with a primary treatment flocculation and coagulation and a secondary conventional activated sludge treatment including anoxic anaerobic and aerobic treatments the average hydraulic and sludge retention times are 24 h and 22 5 days respectively 2 4 wastewater samples pretreatment sample preparation was performed by two different analytical methods to identify and quantify chiral drugs in wastewater 2 4 1 method a all samples except those from castellón and madrid see 2 4 2 were processed in santiago de compostela with method a following the protocol described by gonzález mariño et al 2018 with some modifications see discussion on 3 2 briefly 100 ml of samples were vacuum filtered through 0 7 µm gf a glass microfiber filters whatman kent uk and 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters millipore and spiked with the iss 100 ng l 1 each spe was performed by mixed mode reversed phase strong cation exchange cartridges oasis mcx 150 mg waters milford ma usa previously rinsed with 5 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh followed by 5 ml of ultrapure water after loading sorbents were dried under a nitrogen stream during 30 min washed with 4 ml of meoh as a clean up solution and analytes were then eluted with 3 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh eluates were evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream using a turbo vap ii zymark hopkinton ma usa and a mini vap supelco steinheim germany concentrators finally extracts were redissolved in 100 µl of meoh filtered through 0 22 µm pvdf syringe driven filters merck and injected into the lc ms system 2 4 2 method b samples from castellón and madrid were extracted in the laboratory of the university jaume i following the protocol described by bijlsma et al 2014a hereinafter method b in brief 25 ml of sample were four times diluted with ultrapure water spiked with 1 ng ml 1 of iss mixture and filtered through 0 45 µm cellulose filters millipore then spe was performed by oasis hlb 60 mg reversed phase cartridges waters previously rinsed with 4 ml of meoh followed by 4 ml of ultrapure water after loading sorbents were dried under a nitrogen stream during 30 min and analytes eluted with 5 ml of meoh eluates were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen using a turbo vap ii and a mini vap concentrators finally extracts were redissolved in 1 ml of 10 meoh in ultrapure water these extracts were shipped frozen to santiago de compostela where they were evaporated to dryness redissolved in 100 µl of meoh and filtered through 0 22 µm pvdf syringe driven filters being then ready for lc ms ms analysis 2 5 instrumental analysis instrumental analysis was performed with a waters acquity uplc h class system equipped with a quaternary solvent pump a thermostated lc column compartment and a sample manager the uplc system was interfaced to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer xevo tqd from waters the chromatographic separation was performed at 40 c on a lux amp chiral column 150 3 mm i d 3 µm particle size from phenomenex torrance ca usa under final working conditions a dual eluent system consisting of a ultrapure water with 50 mm nh3 and b meoh was used at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min 1 the linear gradient consisted of the following stages 0 min 60 b 15 min 60 b 20 min 95 b 25 min 95 b 25 1 min 60 b and

collision energies ce for every analyte 2 6 method performance and quality assurance instrumental detection and quantification limits idls and iqls were estimated from the lowest concentration level of the calibration curve providing a signal to noise ratio s n of 3 and 10 respectively calibration curves were prepared in meoh and ranged from the iql to 2500 ng ml 1 for amp enantiomers and from the iql to 500 ng ml 1 for the enantiomers of the remaining compounds spiked is concentration referred to the final extract and each enantiomer 100 ng ml 1 for method a and 10 ng ml 1 for method b intra day and inter day instrumental precision were assessed by the relative standard deviation rsd of seven injections of two calibration standards containing 5 ng ml 1 and 50 ng ml 1 of all analytes and 100 ng ml 1 of is injections were performed within the same day intra day precision and in four different days within a month inter day precision trueness and precision of the whole spe lc ms ms method a were assessed by recovery studies in ultrapure water and wastewater spiked with 12 5 ng l 1 and 125 ng l 1 respectively of all the analytes 100 ng l 1 of is wastewater aliquots spiked only with iss were also analysed to account for analyte levels in this matrix matrix effects mes were calculated as the signal analyte peak area percentage in a 125 ng ml 1 spiked wastewater extract after non spiked sample signal subtraction and referred to the signal of a 125 ng ml 1 standard method detection limits mdls and method quantification limits mqls were calculated from non spiked wastewater samples for a signal to noise ratio s n of 3 and 10 respectively in the case of method b quality of data was assured by analysing additional extracts provided by the university jaume i which had been previously already analysed in such university and were used as quality controls qc thus four samples of wastewater samples were spiked at two concentration levels two of them with 50 ng l 1 and the remaining two with 400 ng l 1 referring to each enantiomer were extracted at the university jaume i following sample pretreatment method b the resulting extracts were shipped to the university of santiago de compostela where they were analysed to assess method s trueness and precision and to calculate the mdls and mqls extrapolated from the lowest level spiked sample 2 7 calculations of enantiomeric fractions the elution order of enantiomers was confirmed by the analysis of s enantiomerically pure standards the concentration of each enantiomer was calculated by the internal standard calibration method then the concentration of each enantiomer cr for the r enantiomer and cs for s enantiomer was used to obtain the enantiomeric fraction ef in this work ef is presented as efr i e the

b meoh was used with the addition of three different modifiers to the aqueous phase 5 mm of ammonium bicarbonate at ph 11 recommended by the column supplier 50 mm of nh3 at ph 11 and 5 mm of ammonium acetate at ph 9 an adequate separation of enantiomers was observed at ph 11 independently of the modifier used ammonium bicarbonate and nh3 conversely ammonium acetate at ph 9 could not resolve the chromatographic peaks of the enantiomers likely due to the incomplete neutralization of the target species at this ph fig s1 finally 50 mm of nh3 at ph 11 was selected as aqueous mobile phase additive due to the higher signal intensity and lower noise observed as compared to the addition of ammonium bicarbonate fig s1 instrumental parameters investigated include linearity idls iqls and intra and inter day precision table 1 the representation of the analyte area is area response versus spiked analyte concentration iql 2500 ng ml 1 range for each amp enantiomer and iql 500 ng ml 1 range for the remaining enantiomers fitted a linear model with determination coefficients r2 higher than 0 997 idl and iql values varied between 0 2 ng ml 1 and 0 4 ng ml 1 and between 0 6 ng ml 1 and 1 4 ng ml 1 respectively rsd values from the intra day precision varied between 0 7 and 4 3 for the 5 ng ml 1 standard and between 0 5 and 3 3 for the 50 ng ml 1 level rsd from the inter day precision was 8 6 at 50 ng ml 1 and 4 8 at 5 ng ml 1 except for s mamp for which it was 12 3 2 solid phase extraction the extraction protocol applied in method a was based on a previous study gonzález mariño et al 2018 but modified in order to improve its selectivity by including a clean up step and optimizing the elution solvent volume first absolute recoveries for samples extracted with oasis mcx 125 ng l 1 spike level were compared to the sample preparation recoveries obtained when introducing a clean up step with 4 ml of meoh before the elution performed with 5 nh3 in meoh in both cases fig s2a both protocols showed good and comparable recoveries thus no significant losses were observed due to the clean up also mes were tested for both protocols since previous studies had reported improvements in this regard after the introduction of a clean up step gonzález mariño et al 2012 2009 senta et al 2013 significantly lower matrix effects were observed i e values of me close to 100 when the clean up step was included fig s2b finally the elution volume was optimized by collecting three consecutive fractions of 3 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh which were analysed independently more than 94 of all analytes eluted in the first fraction data not shown and consequently the elution volume was reduced from 10 ml in the former method gonzález mariño et al 2018 to only 3 ml 3 3 method performance method a was validated in terms of trueness precision mdls and mqls table 1 percentages of recovery r for triplicate analyses of ultrapure water samples spiked with 12 5 ng l 1 of all analytes and 100 ng l 1 of is varied between 90 and 105 with rsds between 1 and 6 in raw wastewater samples spiked with 125 ng l 1 of all enantiomers and 100 ng l 1 of is r varied between 82 and 116 and rsd between 4 and 15 mdls ranged from 0 7 ng l 1 to 1 8 ng l 1 and mqls from 2 4 ng l 1 to 5 5 ng l 1 table s3 compares the performance of the proposed method versus other analytical methods developed for the determination of chiral amphetamine like substances in raw wastewater iqls and mqls were at the same order of magnitude than those reported in other methodologies archer et al 2018 castrignanò et al 2016 castrignanò et al 2018 gao et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2010 however all those methods rely on the application of reversed phase oasis hlb cartridges which can perform well in terms of trueness see also below but do not offer the same degree of selectivity as obtained by mixed mode spe a further advantage of the method proposed here is that the chromatographic separation is performed under gradient conditions which increases column lifetime when a complex matrix as is the case of wastewater is analysed finally the run time of the chromatographic method developed here is 30 min considerably lower than over 140 min required for other chiral separations kasprzyk hordern 2010 vazquez roig et al 2014 since the samples from castellón and madrid had already been extracted by another spe protocol based on oasis hlb cartridges method b and the enrichment increased by further evaporation of the extracts see 2 4 2 the performance of this protocol was evaluated through recovery studies with the qc samples as it is displayed in table s4 recoveries varied between 66 and 125 and rsd 17 thus this spe protocol was acceptable in terms of trueness and precision mql values estimated from the lowest concentration qc samples ranged from 3 8 to 8 3 ng l 1 3 4 drug samples characterization sample code main drug origin purity and efr of each drug sample herein analysed are listed in table s5 the 38 drug dose samples were submitted to the two drug checking services energy control and ai laket by anonymous drug consumers consumers labelled them as the drugs they expected them to contain 18 were labelled as amp 6 as mamp and 14 as mdma sample purity evaluated as explained in 2 2 is summarized in table 2 details in table s5 amp samples presented a variable purity ranging from 2 7 to 103 mamp purity was more consistent and ranged between 54 and 76 while mdma purity varied between 0 and 107 no mdma was found in the sample coded mdma 4 collected in andalucía table s5 the results as regards efr show a concordance with the reported synthesis route of these drugs in europe castrignanò et al 2018 king 2009 thus amp and mdma samples were all racemate mixtures while mamp samples were all the pure s enantiomer table 2 summarizes also the results shown in table s5 the limited number of samples does not allow us to address regional patterns 3 5 wastewater analysis efr of the amphetamine like substances found in wastewater were calculated from the concentrations measured in this matrix see eq 1 following wbe calculations loads eq 2 and human consumption eq 3 were subsequently estimated the total concentration sum of the two enantiomers measured is summarized in table 3 detailed results are provided in table s6 excretion loads and estimated consumption values per city substance and year are summarized in table 3 further details in tables s7 and s8 weekend peaks in loads consumption tables s7 and s8 were observed in most locations for mdma while this was not so clear in the case of amp or mamp a potential explanation is that these two last substances may originate either from daily abusers or prescription patients particularly in the case of amp as further discussed below similar results have been observed in several other countries castrignanò et al 2018 thomas et al 2012 3 5 1 amphetamine amp was positively detected in all the wastewater samples the high concentration levels found in bilbao and its metropolitan area in 2018 mean 663 ng l 1 bijlsma et al 2021 were confirmed in 2019 mean 1375 ng l 1 table 3 although considerably lower the second highest concentrations were detected in palma mean values 106 ng l 1 only samples from 2018 available the highest loads were observed in bilbao in 2019 mean 277 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 even higher than the loads reported in 2018 mean 203 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 in the remaining cities the estimated loads of amp was lower than 45 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table 3 these results match former observations in spain and confirms the distinct pattern of consumption in the area of bilbao which is closer to the patterns observed in other countries such as belgium western germany been et al 2016 or some nordic countries where amp is one of the most prevalent drugs gonzález mariño et al 2020 the enantiomeric analysis showed a slight enrichment of r amp in the wastewater of most cities with efr higher than 0 5 table 3 details in table s9 this matches the data obtained from the analysis of urine of 165 abusers with provided and average efr of 0 508 george and braithwaite 2000 and highlights the fact that enrichment of r amp due to faster metabolization of s amp in the human body is not as high as in the case of mdma see 3 5 3 therefore making it difficult to differentiate illicit consumption from dumping events that would lead to racemic amp on the basis of enantiomeric analysis only as described by emke et al 2014 despites this fact dumping it is unlikely to play a major role in our study since even in the case of bilbao where very high loads would point to direct disposal no abnormal lead peak was detected on any singular day and associated to a change in the value of efr tables s6 s9 as already observed for instance for amp and mdma dumping events in the netherlands emke et al 2014 yet the efr obtained here are similar to those reported in other cities across europe castrignanò et al 2018 including valencia vazquez roig et al 2014 in the case of castellón the efr laid between 0 49 0 03 and 0 50 0 02 table 3 which is equivalent to a racemic mixture samples from castellón were also measured in 2015 by castrignanò et al castrignanò et al 2018 yet amp was not detected that study conversely an enrichment of s amp was detected in madrid northern area in 2018 with an average efr of 0 41 0 03 while only the s isomer was detected above the mql in 2019 table 3 such observation could be partly related to a high contribution of lis prescription in that area in order to evaluate the potential contribution of medical prescription of lis to wbe derived consumption estimations these data were compared with the available lis prescription data from four of the five studied regions galicia basque country balearic islands and community of madrid data from the community of valencia was not available these data as defined daily doses ddd day 11 000 inhabitants 1 were obtained on a month basis for the province or municipality see details in table s10 prescription data were converted into excretion loads of amp considering the ddd of lis 30 mg https www whocc no atc ddd index the average excretion of s amp from lis 44 75 and the molecular weights of both drugs the excretion value of 44 75 was derived as the average from two studies performed with 7 individuals each where s amp accounted for 48 5 and 41 of the lis dose respectively comiran et al 2021 krishnan et al 2008 table s11 as it is displayed in table 4 the expected loads of s amp from lis prescription range from 1 0 to 7 0 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 when compared to the loads of amp sum of both enantiomers actually found in wastewater the prescription of lis would account for less than 1 of the amp consumption estimated in bilbao and its metropolitan area clearly pointing to illicit drug use conversely in madrid northern area about 58 of amp consumption in 2018 could be explained by prescription which together with efr results 0 50 in 2018 r amp below mql in 2019 could confirm a mixed origin illicit use and lis prescription in santiago de compostela medical prescription contribution is expected to be relatively high over 37 44 table 4 but the efr was above 0 53 table s9 in all samples which could then indicate that illicit consumption would be more relevant than lis prescription this disagreement may be explained by the fact that the external psychology consultations at the santiago s hospital cover a larger healthcare area thus many of the patients do not live in this area and thus do no contribute to the wastewater samples further factors contributing to the uncertainty of the estimations made are non adherence to prescription which has been calculated to be a 30 in spain siffel et al 2020 therefore data presented in table 4 would likely represent an overestimating scenario maximum contribution of prescription and the real contribution of lis would be lower even with these data in mind some efr values would be higher than 0 5 in locations where prescription should be a relevant source this is further limited by the fact that when pure george and braithwaite 2000 or enriched enantiomer cody et al 2003 medications are prescribed a certain degree of interconversion occurs over time which would lead to excretion of some r amp and not only pure s amp considering these limitations it seems still evident that the contribution of lis prescription should be taken into account in future studies particularly in those areas where the amount of amp measured in wastewater is rather low as regards the contribution of sel prescription to r amp in wastewater the expectable loads would range from 0 0028 to 0 022 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table s12 those data were obtained from sel prescription figures considering a 15 4 excretion rate as the weighted average of 4 different studies with a total of 21 individuals detailed in table s13 elsworth et al 1978 heinonen et al 1989 liebowitz et al 1985 reynolds et al 1978 and the corresponding molecular weights such loads can be considered as negligible as they are two orders of magnitude lower than those from lis therefore representing less than 0 2 of the total amp in any of the wwtps actually even in palma where the prescription of sel was higher and with a dry precipitation regime thus lower wwtp inflows such loads will translate into ca 0 2 ng l 1 concentrations of r amp i e below the mdl of the method 3 5 2 methamphetamine only s mamp was detected in wastewater and the concentrations were low in all cities with average values below 45 ng l 1 table 3 and maximum values up to 54 ng l 1 table s6 s mamp average loads were lower than 13 mg day 1 1000 inhabitants 1 tables 3 and s7 confirming previous observations in spain with barcelona not analysed here being the exception bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 the prescription of sel would be equivalent to loads in the 0 0090 0 072 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table s12 after considering an average excretion of r mamp of 45 5 from sel according to the metabolism data compiled in table s13 elsworth et al 1978 heinonen et al 1989 liebowitz et al 1985 reynolds et al 1978 again as in the case of amp considering palma as the place where the highest contribution of sel prescription towards r mamp is expected this would result into concentrations of ca 0 6 ng l 1 which is below the mdl thus as regards the enantiomeric profiling of mamp efr was always 0 i e r mamp was below mdl in all samples table s9 these data reinforces the results observed in 3 4 that indicated that mamp consumed in spain is synthesized as pure s mamp as in most parts of europe while the contribution of sel is negligible this would prevent from detecting any direct dumping event but since no particularly high concentrations could be detected this was not expected to have occurred in any of the wwtps investigated during the sampling period 3 5 3 mdma as for amp the two enantiomers of mdma were detected in wastewater the mean mdma concentration as sum of both isomers ranged from mql up to 374 ng l 1 table s6 the highest concentrations were found in the wastewater from palma but once corrected for population and flows this does not translate into higher loads average loads varied between 2 and 38 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 table 3 which is in the range of the already estimated mdma loads in spain in former studies gonzález mariño et al 2020 the efr average for mdma was 0 61 0 05 being above 0 5 in all samples table s9 thus indicating the predominance of r mdma in wastewater these values match with urinary data where 6 volunteers administered 100 mg of racemic mdma leaded to an average efr of 0 657 over 24 h pizarro et al 2002 furthermore an autopsy study revealed an efr of 0 57 moore et al 1996 as mdma is trafficked as racemate see 3 4 and the s enantiomer is metabolized faster in the human body the observed enrichment of r mdma corroborates illicit consumption as the main source of mdma in wastewater castrignanò et al 2018 no event of drug disposal in the sewage network was detected 3 5 4 treated wastewater given the high concentrations of amp detected in the wwtp of bilbao and its metropolitan area in both 2018 and 2019 treated wastewater samples were also collected in 2019 and in the same way as raw wastewater but with a delay of 24 h to account for the hydraulic residence time in the plant amp and mamp levels were below the mql in all treated wastewater samples whereas mdma was detected in all samples as detailed in table s14 mdma levels ranged from 31 to 99 ng l 1 average 57 ng l 1 which is similar to the median value of 56 ng l 1 measured in the effluents of 42 wwtps from the region of catalonia spain collected during 2006 and 2007 huerta fontela et al 2008 little is known about the ecotoxicological effects of mdma but the anticipated value of predicted non effect concentration for this substance is 220 ng l 1 fernández rubio et al 2019 hence emissions from the wwtp are not expected to generate ecotoxicological effects yet there is a clear need for further experimental data particularly considering the co occurrence of different enantiomers sanganyado et al 2017 these data imply that the removal of amp in the wwtp considering the mql was higher than 99 while mdma nominal removal was 61 when considering the average concentrations measured in the effluent and influent mamp was below the mql in both types of wastewater similar good removal rates for amp but a higher variability in the case of mdma have been reported in the literature bijlsma et al 2012 2014b huerta fontela et al 2008 yadav et al 2017 furthermore the efr of mdma shifted from 0 68 0 07 in the influent to 0 88 0 04 in the effluent which implies a further prevalence of the less biologically active enantiomer r mdma after the wastewater treatment and a clear distinct elimination profile of both enantiomers i e average removals of 21 and 77 for r mdma and s mdma respectively such enantioselective elimination has already been observed in a wwtp in valencia studied in 2012 vazquez roig et al 2014 but as mentioned ecotoxicological implications remain unknown 4 conclusions an analytical methodology based on spe and lc ms ms has been successfully developed for the determination of three chiral amphetamine like substances in urban wastewater and street drug samples the analyses of consumer donated street drugs clearly indicated that amp and mdma are produced as racemic mixtures for the spanish illicit market while mamp is produced as the pure active s enantiomer the enantiomeric profiling from wastewater analyses indicated that much higher levels of amp occur in the metropolitan area of bilbao compared to other spanish cities which combined with lis and sel prescription data indicate that its origin can be attributed mainly to illicit consumption conversely in the remaining spanish cities investigated where amp levels are low the prescription of lis may become a relevant source of amp whereas the contribution of the prescription of the pharmaceutical sel to amp and mamp loads is negligible finally the analysis of effluent samples in the area of bilbao showed that amp is well removed in a wwtp equipped with conventional biological water treatments while the removal of mdma is relatively high for the s enantiomer but much more limited for r mdma credit authorship contribution statement andrea estévez danta investigation

16538,although the photochemical behavior of surface water and its effects on pollutant transformation have been studied extensively in recent years the photochemistry of paddy water remains largely unknown in this study we examined the photochemical processes involving paddy water samples collected at four different cultivation stages of rice triplet dissolved organic matter 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh were found to be the dominant reactive intermediates ris and their apparent quantum yields and steady state concentrations were quantified compared with the typical surface water quantum yields of 3dom and oh were comparable while quantum yields of 1o2 were about 2 4 6 7 times higher than those of surface water fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem spectra fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms and statistical analysis revealed that dom properties and nitrite concentration were the main factor influencing ris generation the results suggest that dom with lower molecular weight and humification extent generated more ris and nitrite contributed to 23 9 100 of oh generation eem and fticr ms data showed that dom with more saturated and less aromatic formulas could produce more 3dom under the irradiation while the polyphenolic components of dom inhibited the formation of ris moreover ris significantly enhanced arsenite as iii oxidation with oxidation rate increased by 1 8 4 1 times in paddy water and oh and 3dom were the main ris responsible for as iii oxidation this study provides new insight into the pathways of arsenite abiotic transformation in paddy soil and water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords paddy water reactive intermediate dissolved organic matter nitrite photochemistry arsenite oxidation 1 introduction rice is the main staple food for approximately half of the global population and one of the most widely cultivated crops on earth occupying 162 million ha cultivated land in 2020 fao 2021 because long periods of flooding are needed during rice planting paddy water is becoming an important sink of contaminants such as herbicides pesticides and heavy metal loid s e g arsenic carena et al 2017 jiang et al 2009 arsenic as is a common pollutant of concern in paddy soil particularly in bangladesh india and vietnam campbell and nordstrom 2014 with concentrations in rice irrigation water as high as 0 05 0 92 mg l owing to the high toxicity of as liu et al 2021 the food and agricultural organization recommends that the concentration of as in irrigation water should be below 100 µg l however elevated concentrations of as were found in large areas of rice fields that arose from both natural geochemical sources and anthropogenic activities such as usages of contaminated irrigation water and herbicides mining and industrial emissions kumarathilaka et al 2018 the intermittent flooding of paddy fields as required for land preparation and rice growth generates a particular water environment that is different from surface water the oxygen profile in paddy water and associated distribution of functional groups of microorganisms were considered as the governing factors for the redox reactions of many chemical species including as dong et al 2014 zecchin et al 2017 the reducing conditions at soil water interface transform as into more toxic mobile and bioavailable as iii or less toxic methylated as species via microbial mediated methylation kumarathilaka et al 2018 while the oxygenation in surface paddy water coupled with biochemical processes contributed to the reoxidation of as iii however the potential contribution of photochemical processes occurring in paddy water to as iii oxidation during the cultivation stages of rice is largely unknown both dissolved organic matter dom and nitrogen species are ubiquitous components of natural surface water and agricultural paddy water dom and no2 no3 are photoactive species which can produce transient reactive intermediates ris that contribute to pollutant transformation filipe et al 2020 wu et al 2020 for instance photochemical processes involving dom usually comprise electron and energy transfers which induce the formation of reactive oxygen species ros e g h2o2 oh 1o2 ro and triplet dissolved organic matter 3dom garcía et al 2019 vione et al 2014 the photolysis of aqueous no2 no3 generates several reactive species including oh no no2 and o2 ge et al 2019 ris are strong oxidants but have different reactivities toward the transformation of different contaminants ros such as oh and 1o2 play an important role in both heavy metal loid oxidation e g arsenic and antimony chen et al 2018 and organic contaminant degradation e g metoprolol imazapic significantly filipe et al 2020 remucal 2014 meanwhile 3dom has limited reactivity for organic contaminant degradation tian et al 2019a but can efficiently oxidize heavy metal loid s li et al 2020 for example it has been reported that 3dom was the dominant photooxidant to oxidize antimony by energy transfer in humic acid photochemical process buschmann et al 2005 while electron transfer was mainly responsible for as iii oxidation by aqds 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid in the presence of light jiang et al 2009 consequently we hypothesized that the photochemical processes occurring in paddy water would also produce ris which play an important role in the transformation of pollutants particularly for as iii oxidation however these processes have rarely been explored compared with surface water the concentrations of nitrite nitrate and dom in paddy water are usually higher due to the extensive application of nitrogen fertilizers and release of dom from microbial degradation of soil organic matter liu et al 2021 owing to long term flooding during rice cultivation desorption of soil humic substances reductive dissolution of mineral om complexes and root exudation release a large amount of dom into paddy water bais et al 2006 kumarathilaka et al 2018 in addition the photochemical reactivity of dom depends on its source and structure berg et al 2019 which vary widely among natural waters and in agricultural regions therefore the source and chemical components of dom in paddy water differ significantly from those in natural surface water suggesting that the photoinduced ris processes are significantly different tian et al 2019 several reports focused on the photoproduction of various reactive species in natural surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes marchisio et al 2015 while few studies on the photochemical properties of paddy water are available a recent study investigated the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol and propanil in paddy water under irradiation but the authors mainly focused on the pollutant degradation pathway and products carena et al 2017 chiron et al 2007 the underlying mechanisms such as ris formation conversion and their rate step of generation processes have not been fully elucidated furthermore systematic studies on the photoproduction of ris during rice cultivation stages are still lacking therefore the objectives of this study are i to examine the photochemical reactivity of paddy water during rice cultivation and quantify the apparent quantum yields and steady state concentrations of ris in surface waters sampled at different growth stages ii to establish the relationships between paddy water parameters including water chemistry and dom properties or structure and ris generation with the aim to elucidate the underlying mechanism of ris generation iii to evaluate the effect of photoinduced ris on the oxidation of as iii and explore the potential environmental significance of these processes 2 materials and

germany the ffa tmp p nitroacetophenone and pyridine concentrations were measured with an agilent 1260 infinity liquid chromatograph equipped with a lc 18 column and a dad detector agilent america the concentration of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid was determined by a shimadzu 2030c hplc system equipped with a c 18 column and a fluorescence spectrophotometer shimadzu japan apparent quantum yields f tmp φ1o2 φ oh and steady state concentrations 3dom ss 1o2 ss oh ss were calculated using the formation rate of htpa and the observed loss rates of ffa and tmp based on previous studies zhou et al 2017 additional details are reported in text s4 the concentrations of as iii were measured by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry baode instrument china for the as iii determination an aliquot of sample solution was prepared in 0 4 m citric buffer ph 4 5 with 0 1 m citric acid as carrier solution to determine astot as iii as v the sample was pretreated with a reducing agent containing 5 w v thiourea and 5 w v ascorbic acid to reduce as v to as iii prior to hydride generation the astot concentration remained stable during the photochemistry experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 paddy water properties 3 1 1 paddy water chemistry parameters the water chemistry parameters and bulk dom properties of paddy water were determined and are listed in tables s1 and s2 the measured doc was used to represent the concentration of bulk dom as shown in fig 1 a and table s1 doc ranged from 18 1 to 33 5 mg l at seedling stage but decreased significant to 6 39 8 56 mg l at heading stage the main reason was that the field remained dry for up to a season before rice planting and the flooding period after rice planting caused a large amount of dom to be released from the soil into paddy water in addition with the growth of rice the doc of paddy water decreased gradually possibly due to the utilization of carbon by rice growth and photobleaching effects niu et al 2014 the nitrate and nitrite concentrations in paddy water exhibited a similar trend fig 1b and table s1 at the seedling stage they varied in the 21 9 79 4 and 3 8 62 3 µm ranges respectively and both decreased below 10 µm after the tillering stage the nitrite concentration in paddy water was significantly higher than that observed in natural surface waters which is usually at sub µm levels vione et al 2014 nitrite was probably generated from the microbial reduction of nitrate during soil flooding xing 1998 nitrite and nitrate are common anions in paddy fields and the nitrate concentration increases significantly after fertilization liu et al 2021 a basic fertilizer usually containing urea was used in the early stage of rice growth and high nitrogen concentrations were thus found in paddy water while only 27 50 of n originating from fertilizers was utilized by plants or immobilized by soil said pullicino et al 2014 the nitrite and nitrate concentrations at seedling were up to 13 8 and 10 times higher than those in irrigation water respectively due to the basic fertilizer added before cultivation according to these results discussed above it was concluded that paddy water at the seedling stage had higher no2 and dom contents which would influence ris generation and pollutant transformation the corresponding processes will be discussed in the following sections 3 1 2 bulk properties and molecular composition of dom uv vis and eem spectroscopies were used to further elucidate the changes of dom property in paddy water during rice growth as shown in fig 1c f and table s2 the e 2 e 3 ratios varied in the range observed in natural surface waters stedmon et al 2003 while the suva254 values were slightly higher at the tillering stage the bulk composition of dom in paddy water changed significantly during rice cultivation the uv vis spectra show that suva254 was generally higher at the first two stages fig 1c while the e 2 e 3 ratio was higher in the last two stages fig 1d as suva254 is strongly correlated with the aromatic substance content in dom weishaar et al 2003 whereas e 2 e 3 is inversely proportional to the molecular weight berg et al 2019 the observed changes suggest that dom became less aromatic and its molecular weight decreased the eem spectra of the samples collected at different stages are presented in fig s3 peaks a and c ex em 260 380 460 nm and 320 360 420 460 nm were observed in all samples these peaks are generally related to uv and visible humic like substances similar peaks can be found in natural surface water samples stedmon et al 2003 however protein like substances usually found in rivers and lakes were absent in paddy water which suggests that the latter mainly contained humic like organic matter a unique t peak ex em 275 340 nm was detected in sample t4 aquatic plants and algae were observed in the t4 field representing protein like tryptophan moieties produced from the decomposition of plants stedmon et al 2003 the bix and hix parameters were calculated from the eem spectra as shown in fig 1e f hix exhibited a similar trend to suva254 and bix increased during cultivation except for the t4 sample suggesting an increased contribution of recently produced autochthonous dom during rice cultivation fticr ms was used to identify the molecular composition of dom at different stages as shown in fig s4 4032 6515 formulas were identified in eight paddy water samples the cumulative relative intensity of n containing compounds chon chonp chonsp were the highest in tillering samples and lowest in heading samples these changes may be attributed to the n input through fertilization and to the dissolved organic nitrogen released from soil at tillering stage which was consistent with the nitrate nitrite concentrations detected in paddy water fig 1b the intensity weighted average formulas provide further insight into the changes in dom composition during rice cultivation table 1 the h cw and o cw values increased and decreased after tillering respectively the tillering sample had the highest aromaticity index aimodw and dbe c values of 0 32 and 0 54 respectively in agreement with the observed suva254 changes these results suggest that dom had higher aromaticity at early cultivation stages while more aliphatic compounds were produced or released in the latter two stages to gain additional insight into the dom changes the obtained molecular formulas were classified into carbohydrates amino sugars n containing unsaturated compounds tannins lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules cram unsaturated hydrocarbons condensed aromatic structures and others fig 2 table s4 the seedling dom mainly contained lignin cram like structures 62 1 67 5 tannins 23 3 28 0 and condensed aromatic structures 4 6 4 7 during rice cultivation the distribution of molecular formulas became broader the percentage of lignin increased to 77 8 82 3 while that of tannins and condensed aromatic structures decreased to 9 1 12 3 and 1 34 2 08 respectively considering the decrease in doc in fig 1a it can be inferred that the content of tannins and condensed aromatic structures decreased during cultivation consistent with the changes in suva254 and aimodw tannins are polyphenolic compounds with complex structures chang et al 2019 mainly derived from plants at the beginning of the rice crop the rice stalks left in the field after the previous harvest decompose and release large amounts of tannins as discussed above the tillering stage dom included more aromatic and humified species while jointing and heading stage dom contained higher amounts of fresh and autochthonous components the different properties of paddy water at different stages of rice growth can also influence the generation of ris and will be discussed in detail in the following sections 3 2 ri generation from paddy water under illumination ris such as oh 1o2 and 3dom play an important role in pollutant transformation in surface water vione et al 2014 to further explore the photochemical behavior of paddy water we examined the generation of the above ris first epr technique coupled with dmpo as spin trapping agent was used to examine the generation of free radicals in paddy water under irradiation in the presence of dmpo paddy water exhibited a four line spectrum with an 1 2 2 1 intensity ratio and hyperfine splitting constants of 14 89 g fig s5 which were typical patterns of oh adducted to dmpo fang et al 2014 no dmpo oh signals were observed in ultrapure water under irradiation or paddy water samples without irradiation this indicates the generation of oh in paddy water under visible light irradiation chemical probe methods were used to probe other ris generated in paddy water using tpa ffa and tmp to probe oh 1o2 and 3dom respectively further details on the fitting and calculation procedures are provided in text s4 and table s3 fig s6 confirms the presence of above ris whose steady state concentrations were also measured the oh ss 1o2 ss and 3dom ss values were 0 37 4 66 10 18 0 96 6 99 10 13 and 3 31 10 3 10 14 mol l respectively to quantify the produced ris their quantum yields φ oh φ1o2 f tmp were calculated and used to assess the photoreactivity of the paddy water samples the φ oh 1 04 7 49 10 5 and f tmp 31 7 91 9 values in paddy water were within the range of previously reported values for natural surface water samples fig s7 however the φ1o2 values in paddy water 2 00 15 59 10 2 were about 2 4 6 7 times higher than those of surface water 0 12 6 50 10 2 and three orders of magnitude higher than φ oh fig 3 the higher value of φ1o2 may be due to the dom composition as discussed in section 3 1 2 protein like substances absent in paddy water but usually found in surface water could react with 1o2 davies 2003 and thus reduce the quantum yield 1o2 ss was 0 1 orders of magnitude higher than 3dom ss in agreement with previously reported trends for ris generated in river water samples maizel and remucal 2017b wasswa et al 2020 previous research revealed that dom is first photoexcited and undergoes intersystem crossing to form 3dom which may then transfer electrons or energy to oxygen and form reactive oxygen species e g h2o2 ho 1o2 ro vione et al 2014 as shown in fig 3 the quantum yields coefficient and steady state concentrations of ris at different rice growth stages were significantly different owing to differences in paddy water parameters and dom properties in addition other water parameters such as no3 and no2 concentrations would also contribute to ri generation therefore we analyzed the relationships between water parameters bulk dom properties and generated ris to elucidate the mechanism of ri production 3 3 mechanism of ri formation from paddy water 3 3 1 correlations between ri generation and paddy water properties pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the source of ris in paddy water under irradiation fig 4 a positive correlations were observed between doc and both 3dom ss and 1o2 ss fig 4b pearson s r 0 67 and 0 67 p 0 05 attributed to higher concentration of dom that could be excited by light for instance paddy water at seedling stage containing a higher doc fig 1a produced more 3dom and 1o2 species fig 2e f 3dom ss exhibited positive correlations with 1o2 ss and oh ss pearson s r 0 69 and 0 62 p 0 05 which indicated that 3dom is an important precursor of oh and 1o2 although the underlying mechanism of 3dom induced oh has not been well established in previous studies berg et al 2019 wasswa et al 2020 in addition a positive correlation was also observed between no2 and oh ss pearson s r 0 84 p 0 05 suggesting that no2 may be another important source of oh in paddy waters fig s9 shows that photoinduced oh in paddy water increased rapidly with the addition of nitrite indicating that the latter species significantly influenced oh formation considering the multiple formation pathways of oh in these processes further analysis is discussed in section 3 3 3 pearson correlation analysis of bulk dom properties and ri quantum yields further revealed how the dom structure influenced the paddy water photoreactivity f tmp was negatively correlated to the hix and suva254 parameters pearson s r 0 74 and 0 56 p 0 05 which are strongly related to the degree of humification and aromaticity of dom fig 4c these data indicate that dom with lower aromatic content and humification extent could produce more ris in agreement with previous results berg et al 2019 wasswa et al 2020 it has been hypothesized that intermolecular complexes formed between electron donating and accepting moieties in organic matter result in long wavelength absorption which is inefficient at driving triplet state photochemistry sharpless et al 2014 in addition the s r β α and bix parameters were all inversely correlated to the steady state concentrations of 3dom and 1o2 p 0 05 this suggests that freshly produced autotrophic dom with smaller molecular size could produce higher amounts of photoinduced 3dom and 1o2 accordingly although the dom concentration in paddy water was higher at the tillering stage the ri quantum yields were lower owing to the more condensed and aromatic composition of dom the quantum yield coefficients of jointing stage samples were generally higher because their dom presented more autochthonous and less aromatic compositions 3 3 2 molecular level relationships between φ oh φ1o2 f tmp and dom composition the above analyses revealed that dom plays an important role in paddy water photochemistry and its structure also influences the photoinduced ris therefore fticr ms was used to provide additional insight into the relation between ri generation and dom composition we determined the correlations between the dom molecular parameters obtained by fticr ms and quantum yields coefficient fig s8 similar to suva254 aimodw was negatively correlated with f tmp pearson s r 0 86 p 0 05 conforming that dom with higher aromaticity formed less 3dom per photon absorbed furthermore the dbe cw unsaturation index showed negative correlations with f tmp and φ1o2 pearson s r 0 94 and 0 51 p 0 05 while h cw was positively correlated with f tmp pearson s r 0 92 p 0 05 these results suggest that higher amounts of aliphatic and saturated organic matter were more efficient in producing 3dom and 1o2 in addition the relationship of quantum yields coefficient at molecular level was calculated a total of 2078 common molecular formulas were found in the samples spearman rank correlations between the relative intensities of these formulas and the quantum yields coefficient are presented in van krevelen diagrams fig 5 shows that specific dom pools were most strongly associated with ri formation a very similar dom pool associated with the formation of oh 1o2 and 3dom was also observed further indicating 3dom is an important precursor to oh and 1o2 positive correlations were observed between quantum yields coefficient and protein like h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 1 0 52 and lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 67 are observed it should be mentioned that not all lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules are positively correlated to quantum yields coefficient only the highly saturated aliphatic ones high h c low o c showed this correlation these highly saturated or acyclic formulas may represent the composition of precursors to photoinduced 3dom negative correlations were observed between quantum yields coefficient and condensed aromatic structures and tannins rich in polyphenols revealing an inverse relationship between aromatic or polyphenolic content and 3dom quantum yield coefficient 3 3 3 proposed framework for ris generation from paddy water as discussion above both dom and nitrite were mainly responsible for ris generation from paddy water and the underlying mechanism of these processes were elucidated in the following sections 3 3 3 1 contribution of dom to 3dom 1o2 and oh production based on our experimental results and literature reports on the important role of dom in 3dom 1o2 and oh production the pathways of 3dom 1o2 and oh generation from paddy water were proposed in scheme 1 dom is first excited to produce 1dom under the light which is then converted to longer lived 3dom by intersystem crossing eqs 1 and 2 then 3dom may transfer energy to oxygen and form 1o2 garcía et al 2019 which can be verified by the strong positive correlation between 3dom ss and 1o2 ss as shown in fig 4 in addition 3dom would induce to form charge separated species dom via donor acceptor electron transfer which can also be formed directly through charge transfer ct absorption by dom sharpless and blough 2014 epr detected dom formation in both two paddy water samples t3 j1 as shown in fig 6 a a broad singlet signal devoid of hyperfine structure was observed with g factors of 2 0043 and 2 0044 respectively which were the characteristic epr peak of dom according to previous studies polewski et al 2005 in addition the experimental results in 3 3 3 suggest that smaller dom molecules with more saturated and less aromatic compositions would induce the formation of more 3dom while it was confirmed that intermolecular ct complexes are commonly present in highly aromatic structures del vecchio and blough 2004 these combined results suggest that ct pathways with photoexcitation of dom coexisted with the 3dom formation processes as depicted in scheme 1 according to experimental results discussed in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 3dom would contribute to oh generation which comprised two potential pathways first the charge transfer of 3dom to form dom or direct ct absorption by dom which transfers electron to o2 to generate o2 and further yields h2o2 and oh eqs 3 7 another pathway is that 3dom could abstract h atom from water to form oh eq 8 1 d o m h v 1 do m 2 1 do m i s c 3 do m 3 3 do m do m 4 d o m h v do m 5 do m o 2 do m o 2 6 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 h v 2 oh 8 3 do m h 2 o do m oh to further clarify these processes the paddy water samples were analyzed by epr and radical quenching studies under different reaction conditions to test electron transfer process from dom to oxygen eq 5 epr spectra of paddy water in the presence and absence of o2 were collected as shown in fig 6 b c dmpo oh signals reduced by 63 7 67 0 in absence of oxygen which suggested that o2 played an important role in oh formation superoxide dismutase sod is an effective scavenger of o2 and thus is used coupling with epr to test the formation of o2 fang et al 2014 the peak intensity of dmpo oh decreased by 57 3 63 6 with the addition of 200 u ml sod which indicated that o2 mediated oh formation sod transforms o2 into h2o2 but the produced h2o2 would lose its activity to produce oh by interaction with sod fang et al 2014 as a result the amount of h2o2 available for oh formation decreased in addition catalase cat was used as a scavenger to clarify the role of h2o2 in oh formation the peak intensities of dmpo oh decreased by 73 3 73 8 in the presence of 200 u ml cat this phenomenon was due to the fast decomposition of h2o2 by cat thereby diminishing oh formation which suggested h2o2 is an important intermediate in oh production these combined results suggest that 3dom induces dom were mainly responsible for oh generation while the direct h abstraction of water by 3dom has limited contribution to oh generation 3 3 3 2 contribution of nitrite to oh formation in addition to 3dom nitrite and nitrate also contributed to oh generation eqs 9 11 according to the correlation analyses fig 4 in addition no2 ss exhibited the highest positive correlation with oh ss fig s9 also showed that photoinduced oh in paddy water increased rapidly with the addition of nitrite indicating that nitrite significantly influenced oh formation thus we examined the contributions of nitrite and nitrate to photoinduced oh formation in paddy water 9 no 3 h v n o 2 o 10 no 2 h v no o 11 o h oh ultrapure water with different concentrations of nano2 and nano3 was irradiated and the formation rates of oh r oh were monitored the concentrations covered the ranges of no2 and no3 in all samples fig s10 the r oh value of nitrite was 5 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of nitrate indicating that a negligible amount of oh was formed by nitrate in paddy water this is caused by the fact that nitrite and nitrate mainly absorb sunlight in the uva amax 355 nm and uvb amax 305 nm fig s11 regions respectively vione et al 2014 thus we only evaluated the contribution of nitrite to oh formation in paddy water to take into account the light screening effect of dom the expression of oh formation rate from nitrite r oh nitrite was adjusted using the shading coefficient k 12 r oh nitrite k r oh exp 13 k r a n o 2 r a t o t 14 r a t o t λ e p λ 0 1 10 a t o t λ

absorbance of species i e p λ 0 is the spectral photon irradiance of the xenon lamp note that in most cases atot λ adom λ vione et al 2014 the contribution of nitrite to the photoinduced oh generation rate was estimated by dividing r oh nitrite by r oh of each paddy water sample table s5 the calculated nitrite contribution in irrigation water was 62 9 0 7 but increased to 73 5 100 at seedling stage and then decreased to 36 6 100 and 23 9 24 5 for tillering and jointing stages respectively finally it was increased to 93 9 100 at the heading stage these results suggest nitrite contributed to 23 9 100 while dom accounted for approximately 0 76 1 of oh generation from the photochemical processes of paddy water these results suggest nitrite contributed to 23 9 100 while dom accounted for approximately 0 76 1 of oh generation from the photochemical processes of paddy water and both contributions varied depending on dom property and nitrite concentration 3 4 contribution of ris to as iii oxidation in paddy water as iii is a common pollutant in rice fields during flooding periods in order to explore the effect of paddy water on as iii removal 100 µg l sodium arsenite was added in the s3 t3 j1 and h1 paddy water samples as iii can be oxidized upon exposure to oxygen and light buschmann et al 2005 as shown in fig 7 a the oxidation of as iii was significantly accelerated in paddy water which was attributed to the production of various active substances in this environment under illumination as discussed above as tot did not change significantly during the photochemistry experiment indicating that the adsorption of as iii on organic matter was negligible after subtracting the contribution to the oxidation of as iii by oxygen during the dark reaction the oxidation rate in paddy water samples increased by 1 8 4 1 times compared to that in ultrapure water this increase is due to the ris in rice field water in other words the contribution of the ris formed in paddy field water to the oxidation of as iii was 64 5 80 5 methanol nan3 and sorbic acid were used to identify the contributions of different ris as the ph changed slightly by less than one unit when the scavengers were added the corresponding effect could be neglected methanol is an efficient scavenger of oh with a rate constant of 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2021 as shown in fig 7b the presence of methanol significantly inhibited as iii oxidation in each sample which implies that oh played an important role previous studies showed that oh can rapidly oxidize as iii with a rate constant of 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2014 nan3 could simultaneously quench oh and 1o2 the addition of nan3 did not significantly inhibit the oxidation of as iii compared to the addition of methanol indicating that 1o2 was not a major photooxidant of as iii buschmann et al 2005 sorbic acid an efficient triplet quencher with a rate constant of 12 9 108 m 1 s 1 as determined from several dom samples was employed to investigate the role of 3dom in the photochemical as iii photodegradation moor et al 2019 upon sa addition k obs decreased by 52 1 48 7 74 2 and 94 8 for s3 t3 j1 and h1 respectively fig 7b showing that 3dom played a major role in inducing indirect photooxidation of as iii the inhibition effect was lower in samples s3 and t3 because oh species formed from high no2 levels at seedling and tillering stages could not be scavenged by sa to evaluate the significance of as iii abiotic oxidation in paddy water the second order reaction rate constant of as iii oxidation by 3dom k 3 do m as iii was calculated with steady state model eq 16 16 k obs k d k 3 do m as iii 3 do m ss k oh as iii oh ss where k obs is the observed pseudo first order oxidation rate of as iii and k d is the pseudo first order rate of direct as iii oxidation by sunlight water 1 2 1 4 10 5 s 1 in this study k oh as iii is the second order reaction rate constant for as iii oxidation with oh 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 as reported kim et al 2014 consequently the calculated k 3 do m as iii was 7 6 22 10 7 m 1 s 1 which was about 200 650 times higher than that of as iii oxidation by biological enzyme catalyzed reaction lièvremont et al 2003 sehlin and lindstrom 1992 these results suggest the as iii abiotic oxidation by ris in paddy water might be a non negligible pathway for as transformation in paddy soil 4 conclusions this work focused on the photoreactivity of paddy water at different rice cultivation stages we measured the formation rates of ris such as oh 1o2 and 3dom upon irradiation of paddy water samples and observed high quantum yields at seedling and jointing stages the ri formation rates were found to depend on the paddy water parameters due to fertilization rice growth and alternated flooding paddy waters experience changing water chemistry and dom properties during rice cultivation we observed that i samples at seedling stage contained higher no2 and dom amounts ii tillering stage dom presented more aromatic and humified components iii jointing and heading stage dom had higher contents of fresh and autochthonous species iv tannins and condensed aromatic structures decreased during rice cultivation eem fticr ms and statistical analysis showed significant correlations between photoreactivity and dom properties dom with lower relative molecular weight and humification extent produced more ris more saturated and less aromatic dom compositions were most efficient at forming 3dom under irradiation while polyphenols inhibited the formation of ris nitrite was the primary source of oh species in paddy water contributing to 23 9 100 of their formation in addition ris had a significant contribution to as iii oxidation in paddy water in which oh and 3dom played important roles compared with the conventional knowledge that the biotic process was dominant for as transformation in paddy soil zhang et al 2015 this study shows that the abiotic oxidation of as iii by ris would also play an important role in as transformation in paddy water these results also provide new insight into the mechanism of abiotic transformation of as in paddy soil to best of our knowledge this work represents the first systematic study of the photoreactivity of paddy waters at different rice cultivation stages focused on the influence of water chemistry and dom composition the results also provide the first direct link between photoinduced reactive intermediates and the composition of paddy water dom at molecular level the photochemical characterization of paddy waters has important implications for carbon and contaminant transformation in agricultural regions further research is needed to characterize the transformations of other organic pollutants in

16538,although the photochemical behavior of surface water and its effects on pollutant transformation have been studied extensively in recent years the photochemistry of paddy water remains largely unknown in this study we examined the photochemical processes involving paddy water samples collected at four different cultivation stages of rice triplet dissolved organic matter 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh were found to be the dominant reactive intermediates ris and their apparent quantum yields and steady state concentrations were quantified compared with the typical surface water quantum yields of 3dom and oh were comparable while quantum yields of 1o2 were about 2 4 6 7 times higher than those of surface water fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem spectra fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms and statistical analysis revealed that dom properties and nitrite concentration were the main factor influencing ris generation the results suggest that dom with lower molecular weight and humification extent generated more ris and nitrite contributed to 23 9 100 of oh generation eem and fticr ms data showed that dom with more saturated and less aromatic formulas could produce more 3dom under the irradiation while the polyphenolic components of dom inhibited the formation of ris moreover ris significantly enhanced arsenite as iii oxidation with oxidation rate increased by 1 8 4 1 times in paddy water and oh and 3dom were the main ris responsible for as iii oxidation this study provides new insight into the pathways of

oxidation 1 introduction rice is the main staple food for approximately half of the global population and one of the most widely cultivated crops on earth occupying 162 million ha cultivated land in 2020 fao 2021 because long periods of flooding are needed during rice planting paddy water is becoming an important sink of contaminants such as herbicides pesticides and heavy metal loid s e g arsenic carena et al 2017 jiang et al 2009 arsenic as is a common pollutant of concern in paddy soil particularly in bangladesh india and vietnam campbell and nordstrom 2014 with concentrations in rice irrigation water as high as 0 05 0 92 mg l owing to the high toxicity of as liu et al 2021 the food and agricultural organization recommends that the concentration of as in irrigation water should be below 100 µg l however elevated concentrations of as were found in large areas of rice fields that arose from both natural geochemical sources and anthropogenic activities such as usages of contaminated irrigation water and herbicides mining and industrial emissions kumarathilaka et al 2018 the intermittent flooding of paddy fields as required for land preparation and rice growth generates a particular water environment that is different from surface water the oxygen profile in paddy water and associated distribution of functional groups of microorganisms were considered as the governing factors for the redox reactions of many chemical species including as dong et al 2014 zecchin et al 2017 the reducing conditions at soil water interface transform as into more toxic mobile and bioavailable as iii or less toxic methylated as species via microbial mediated methylation kumarathilaka et al 2018 while the oxygenation in surface paddy water coupled with biochemical processes contributed to the reoxidation of as iii however the potential contribution of photochemical processes occurring in paddy water to as iii oxidation during the cultivation stages of rice is largely unknown both dissolved organic matter dom and nitrogen species are ubiquitous components of natural surface water and agricultural paddy water dom and no2 no3 are photoactive species which can produce transient reactive intermediates ris that contribute to pollutant transformation filipe et al 2020 wu et al 2020 for instance photochemical processes involving dom usually comprise electron and energy transfers which induce the formation of reactive oxygen species ros e g h2o2 oh 1o2 ro and triplet dissolved organic matter 3dom garcía et al 2019 vione et al 2014 the photolysis of aqueous no2 no3 generates several reactive species including oh no no2 and o2 ge et al 2019 ris are strong oxidants but have different reactivities toward the transformation of different contaminants ros such as oh and 1o2 play an important role in both heavy metal loid oxidation e g arsenic and antimony chen et al 2018 and organic contaminant degradation e g metoprolol imazapic significantly filipe et al 2020 remucal 2014 meanwhile 3dom has limited reactivity for organic contaminant degradation tian et al 2019a but can efficiently oxidize heavy metal loid s li et al 2020 for example it has been reported that 3dom was the dominant photooxidant to oxidize antimony by energy transfer in humic acid photochemical process buschmann et al 2005 while electron transfer was mainly responsible for as iii oxidation by aqds 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid in the presence of light jiang et al 2009 consequently we hypothesized that the photochemical processes occurring in paddy water would also produce ris which play an important role in the transformation of pollutants particularly for as iii oxidation however these processes have rarely been explored compared with surface water the concentrations of nitrite nitrate and dom in paddy water are usually higher due to the extensive application of nitrogen fertilizers and release of dom from microbial degradation of soil organic matter liu et al 2021 owing to long term flooding during rice cultivation desorption of soil humic substances reductive dissolution of mineral om complexes and root exudation release a large amount of dom into paddy water bais et al 2006 kumarathilaka et al 2018 in addition the photochemical reactivity of dom depends on its source and structure berg et al 2019 which vary widely among natural waters and in agricultural regions therefore the source and chemical components of dom in paddy water differ significantly from those in natural surface water suggesting that the photoinduced ris processes are significantly different tian et al 2019 several reports focused on the photoproduction of various reactive species in natural surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes marchisio et al 2015 while few studies on the photochemical properties of paddy water are available a recent study investigated the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol and propanil in paddy water under irradiation but the authors mainly focused on the pollutant degradation pathway and products carena et al 2017 chiron et al 2007 the underlying mechanisms such as ris formation conversion and their rate step of generation processes have not been fully elucidated furthermore systematic studies on the photoproduction of ris during rice cultivation stages are still lacking therefore the objectives of this study are i to examine the photochemical reactivity of paddy water during rice cultivation and quantify the apparent quantum yields and steady state concentrations of ris in surface waters sampled at different growth stages ii to establish the relationships between paddy water parameters including water chemistry and dom properties or structure and ris generation with the aim to elucidate the underlying mechanism of ris generation iii to evaluate the effect of photoinduced ris on the oxidation of as iii and explore the potential environmental significance of these processes 2 materials and

additional details are reported in text s4 the concentrations of as iii were measured by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry baode instrument china for the as iii determination an aliquot of sample solution was prepared in 0 4 m citric buffer ph 4 5 with 0 1 m citric acid as carrier solution to determine astot as iii as v the sample was pretreated with a reducing agent containing 5 w v thiourea and 5 w v ascorbic acid to reduce as v to as iii prior to hydride generation the astot concentration remained stable during the photochemistry experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 paddy water properties 3 1 1 paddy water chemistry parameters the water chemistry parameters and bulk dom properties of paddy water were determined and are listed in tables s1 and s2 the measured doc was used to represent the concentration of bulk dom as shown in fig 1 a and table s1 doc ranged from 18 1 to 33 5 mg l at seedling stage but decreased significant to 6 39 8 56 mg l at heading stage the main reason was that the field remained dry for up to a season before rice planting and the flooding period after rice planting caused a large amount of dom to be released from the soil into paddy water in addition with the growth of rice the doc of paddy water decreased gradually possibly due to the utilization of carbon by rice growth and photobleaching effects niu et al 2014 the nitrate and nitrite concentrations in paddy water exhibited a similar trend fig 1b and table s1 at the seedling stage they varied in the 21 9 79 4 and 3 8 62 3 µm ranges respectively and both decreased below 10 µm after the tillering stage the nitrite concentration in paddy water was significantly higher than that observed in natural surface waters which is usually at sub µm levels vione et al 2014 nitrite was probably generated from the microbial reduction of nitrate during soil flooding xing 1998 nitrite and nitrate are common anions in paddy fields and the nitrate concentration increases significantly after fertilization liu et al 2021 a basic fertilizer usually containing urea was used in the early stage of rice growth and high nitrogen concentrations were thus found in paddy water while only 27 50 of n originating from fertilizers was utilized by plants or immobilized by soil said pullicino et al 2014 the nitrite and nitrate concentrations at seedling were up to 13 8 and 10 times higher than those in irrigation water respectively due to the basic fertilizer added before cultivation according to these results discussed above it was concluded that paddy water at the seedling stage had higher no2 and dom contents which would influence ris generation and pollutant transformation the corresponding processes will be discussed in the following sections 3 1 2 bulk properties and molecular composition of dom uv vis and eem spectroscopies were used to further elucidate the changes of dom property in paddy water during rice growth as shown in fig 1c f and table s2 the e 2 e 3 ratios varied in the range observed in natural surface waters stedmon et al 2003 while the suva254 values were slightly higher at the tillering stage the bulk composition of dom in paddy water changed significantly during rice cultivation the uv vis spectra show that suva254 was generally higher at the first two stages fig 1c while the e 2 e 3 ratio was higher in the last two stages fig 1d as suva254 is strongly correlated with the aromatic substance content in dom weishaar et al 2003 whereas e 2 e 3 is inversely proportional to the molecular weight berg et al 2019 the observed changes suggest that dom became less aromatic and its molecular weight decreased the eem spectra of the samples collected at different stages are presented in fig s3 peaks a and c ex em 260 380 460 nm and 320 360 420 460 nm were observed in all samples these peaks are generally related to uv and visible humic like substances similar peaks can be found in natural surface water samples stedmon et al 2003 however protein like substances usually found in rivers and lakes were absent in paddy water which suggests that the latter mainly contained humic like organic matter a unique t peak ex em 275 340 nm was detected in sample t4 aquatic plants and algae were observed in the t4 field representing protein like tryptophan moieties produced from the decomposition of plants stedmon et al 2003 the bix and hix parameters were calculated from the eem spectra as shown in fig 1e f hix exhibited a similar trend to suva254 and bix increased during cultivation except for the t4 sample suggesting an increased contribution of recently produced autochthonous dom during rice cultivation fticr ms was used to identify the molecular composition of dom at different stages as shown in fig s4 4032 6515 formulas were identified in eight paddy water samples the cumulative relative intensity of n containing compounds chon chonp chonsp were the highest in tillering samples and lowest in heading samples these changes may be attributed to the n input through fertilization and to the dissolved organic nitrogen released from soil at tillering stage which was consistent with the nitrate nitrite concentrations detected in paddy water fig 1b the intensity weighted average formulas provide further insight into the changes in dom composition during rice cultivation table 1 the h cw and o cw values increased and decreased after tillering respectively the tillering sample had the highest aromaticity index aimodw and dbe c values of 0 32 and 0 54 respectively in agreement with the observed suva254 changes these results suggest that dom had higher aromaticity at early cultivation stages while more aliphatic compounds were produced or released in the latter two stages to gain additional insight into the dom changes the obtained molecular formulas were classified into carbohydrates amino sugars n containing unsaturated compounds tannins lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules cram unsaturated hydrocarbons condensed aromatic structures and others fig 2 table s4 the seedling dom mainly contained lignin cram like structures 62 1 67 5 tannins 23 3 28 0 and condensed aromatic structures 4 6 4 7 during rice cultivation the distribution of molecular formulas became broader the percentage of lignin increased to 77 8 82 3 while that of tannins and condensed aromatic structures decreased to 9 1 12 3 and 1 34 2 08 respectively considering the decrease in doc in fig 1a it can be inferred that the content of tannins and condensed aromatic structures decreased during cultivation consistent with the changes in suva254 and aimodw tannins are polyphenolic compounds with complex structures chang et al 2019 mainly derived from plants at the beginning of the rice crop the rice stalks left in the field after the previous harvest decompose and release large amounts of tannins as discussed above the tillering stage dom included more aromatic and humified species while jointing and heading stage dom contained higher amounts of fresh and autochthonous components the different properties of paddy water at different stages of rice growth can also influence the generation of ris and will be discussed in detail in the following sections 3 2 ri generation from paddy water under illumination ris such as oh 1o2 and 3dom play an important role in pollutant transformation in surface water vione et al 2014 to further explore the photochemical behavior of paddy water we examined the generation of the above ris first epr technique coupled with dmpo as spin trapping agent was used to examine the generation of free radicals in paddy water under irradiation in the presence of dmpo paddy water exhibited a four line spectrum with an 1 2 2 1 intensity ratio and hyperfine splitting constants of 14 89 g fig s5 which were typical patterns of oh adducted to dmpo fang et al 2014 no dmpo oh signals were observed in ultrapure water under irradiation or paddy water samples without irradiation this indicates the generation of oh in paddy water under visible light irradiation chemical probe methods were used to probe other ris generated in paddy water using tpa ffa and tmp to probe oh 1o2 and 3dom respectively further details on the fitting and calculation procedures are provided in text s4 and table s3 fig s6 confirms the presence of above ris whose steady state concentrations were also measured the oh ss 1o2 ss and 3dom ss values were 0 37 4 66 10 18 0 96 6 99 10 13 and 3 31 10 3 10 14 mol l respectively to quantify the produced ris their quantum yields φ oh φ1o2 f tmp were calculated and used to assess the photoreactivity of the paddy water samples the φ oh 1 04 7 49 10 5 and f tmp 31 7 91 9 values in paddy water were within the range of previously reported values for natural surface water samples fig s7 however the φ1o2 values in paddy water 2 00 15 59 10 2 were about 2 4 6 7 times higher than those of surface water 0 12 6 50 10 2 and three orders of magnitude higher than φ oh fig 3 the higher value of φ1o2 may be due to the dom composition as discussed in section 3 1 2 protein like substances absent in paddy water but usually found in surface water could react with 1o2 davies 2003 and thus reduce the quantum yield 1o2 ss was 0 1 orders of magnitude higher than 3dom ss in agreement with previously reported trends for ris generated in river water samples maizel and remucal 2017b wasswa et al 2020 previous research revealed that dom is first photoexcited and undergoes intersystem crossing to form 3dom which may then transfer electrons or energy to oxygen and form reactive oxygen species e g h2o2 ho 1o2 ro vione et al 2014 as shown in fig 3 the quantum yields coefficient and steady state concentrations of ris at different rice growth stages were significantly different owing to differences in paddy water parameters and dom properties in addition other water parameters such as no3 and no2 concentrations would also contribute to ri generation therefore we analyzed the relationships between water parameters bulk dom properties and generated ris to elucidate the mechanism of ri production 3 3 mechanism of ri formation from paddy water 3 3 1 correlations between ri generation and paddy water properties pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the source of ris in paddy water under irradiation fig 4 a positive correlations were observed between doc and both 3dom ss and 1o2 ss fig 4b pearson s r 0 67 and 0 67 p 0 05 attributed to higher concentration of dom that could be excited by light for instance paddy water at seedling stage containing a higher doc fig 1a produced more 3dom and 1o2 species fig 2e f 3dom ss exhibited positive correlations with 1o2 ss and oh ss pearson s r 0 69 and 0 62 p 0 05 which indicated that 3dom is an important precursor of oh and 1o2 although the underlying mechanism of 3dom induced oh has not been well established in previous studies berg et al 2019 wasswa et al 2020 in addition a positive correlation was also observed between no2 and oh ss pearson s r 0 84 p 0 05 suggesting that no2 may be another important source of oh in paddy waters fig s9 shows that photoinduced oh in paddy water increased rapidly with the addition of nitrite indicating that the latter species significantly influenced oh formation considering the multiple formation pathways of oh in these processes further analysis is discussed in section 3 3 3 pearson correlation analysis of bulk dom properties and ri quantum yields further revealed how the dom structure influenced the paddy water photoreactivity f tmp was negatively correlated to the hix and suva254 parameters pearson s r 0 74 and 0 56 p 0 05 which are strongly related to the degree of humification and aromaticity of dom fig 4c these data indicate that dom with lower aromatic content and humification extent could produce more ris in agreement with previous results berg et al 2019 wasswa et al 2020 it has been hypothesized that intermolecular complexes formed between electron donating and accepting moieties in organic matter result in long wavelength absorption which is inefficient at driving triplet state photochemistry sharpless et al 2014 in addition the s r β α and bix parameters were all inversely correlated to the steady state concentrations of 3dom and 1o2 p 0 05 this suggests that freshly produced autotrophic dom with smaller molecular size could produce higher amounts of photoinduced 3dom and 1o2 accordingly although the dom concentration in paddy water was higher at the tillering stage the ri quantum yields were lower owing to the more condensed and aromatic composition of dom the quantum yield coefficients of jointing stage samples were generally higher because their dom presented more autochthonous and less aromatic compositions 3 3 2 molecular level relationships between φ oh φ1o2 f tmp and dom composition the above analyses revealed that dom plays an important role in paddy water photochemistry and its structure also influences the photoinduced ris therefore fticr ms was used to provide additional insight into the relation between ri generation and dom composition we determined the correlations between the dom molecular parameters obtained by fticr ms and quantum yields coefficient fig s8 similar to suva254 aimodw was negatively correlated with f tmp pearson s r 0 86 p 0 05 conforming that dom with higher aromaticity formed less 3dom per photon absorbed furthermore the dbe cw unsaturation index showed negative correlations with f tmp and φ1o2 pearson s r 0 94 and 0 51 p 0 05 while h cw was positively correlated with f tmp pearson s r 0 92 p 0 05 these results suggest that higher amounts of aliphatic and saturated organic matter were more efficient in producing 3dom and 1o2 in addition the relationship of quantum yields coefficient at molecular level was calculated a total of 2078 common molecular formulas were found in the samples spearman rank correlations between the relative intensities of these formulas and the quantum yields coefficient are presented in van krevelen diagrams fig 5 shows that specific dom pools were most strongly associated with ri formation a very similar dom pool associated with the formation of oh 1o2 and 3dom was also observed further indicating 3dom is an important precursor to oh and 1o2 positive correlations were observed between quantum yields coefficient and protein like h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 1 0 52 and lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 67 are observed it should be mentioned that not all lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules are positively correlated to quantum yields coefficient only the highly saturated aliphatic ones high h c low o c showed this correlation these highly saturated or acyclic formulas may represent the composition of precursors to photoinduced 3dom negative correlations were observed between quantum yields coefficient and condensed aromatic structures and tannins rich in polyphenols revealing an inverse relationship between aromatic or polyphenolic content and 3dom quantum yield coefficient 3 3 3 proposed framework for ris generation from paddy water as discussion above both dom and nitrite were mainly responsible for ris generation from paddy water and the underlying mechanism of these processes were elucidated in the following sections 3 3 3 1 contribution of dom to 3dom 1o2 and oh production based on our experimental results and literature reports on the important role of dom in 3dom 1o2 and oh production the pathways of 3dom 1o2 and oh generation from paddy water were proposed in scheme 1 dom is first excited to produce 1dom under the light which is then converted to longer lived 3dom by intersystem crossing eqs 1 and 2 then 3dom may transfer energy to oxygen and form 1o2 garcía et al 2019 which can be verified by the strong positive correlation between 3dom ss and 1o2 ss as shown in fig 4 in addition 3dom would induce to form charge separated species dom via donor acceptor electron transfer which can also be formed directly through charge transfer ct absorption by dom sharpless and blough 2014 epr detected dom formation in both two paddy water samples t3 j1 as shown in fig 6 a a broad singlet signal devoid of hyperfine structure was observed with g factors of 2 0043 and 2 0044 respectively which were the characteristic epr peak of dom according to previous studies polewski et al 2005 in addition the experimental results in 3 3 3 suggest that smaller dom molecules with more saturated and less aromatic compositions would induce the formation of more 3dom while it was confirmed that intermolecular ct complexes are commonly present in highly aromatic structures del vecchio and blough 2004 these combined results suggest that ct pathways with photoexcitation of dom coexisted with the 3dom formation processes as depicted in scheme 1 according to experimental results discussed in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 3dom would contribute to oh generation which comprised two potential pathways first the charge transfer of 3dom to form dom or direct ct absorption by dom which transfers electron to o2 to generate o2 and further yields h2o2 and oh eqs 3 7 another pathway is that 3dom could abstract h atom from water to form oh eq 8 1 d o m h v 1 do m 2 1 do m i s c 3 do m 3 3 do m do m 4 d o m h v do m 5 do m o 2 do m o 2 6 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 h v 2 oh 8 3 do m h 2 o do m oh to further clarify these processes the paddy water samples were analyzed by epr and radical quenching studies under different reaction conditions to test electron transfer process from dom to oxygen eq 5 epr spectra of paddy water in the presence and absence of o2 were collected as shown in fig 6 b c dmpo oh signals reduced by 63 7 67 0 in absence of oxygen which suggested that o2 played an important role in oh formation superoxide dismutase sod is an effective scavenger of o2 and thus is used coupling with epr to test the formation of o2 fang et al 2014 the peak intensity of dmpo oh decreased by 57 3 63 6 with the addition of 200 u ml sod which indicated that o2 mediated oh formation sod transforms o2 into h2o2 but the produced h2o2 would lose its activity to produce oh by interaction with sod fang et al 2014 as a result the amount of h2o2 available for oh formation decreased in addition catalase cat was used as a scavenger to clarify the role of h2o2 in oh formation the peak intensities of dmpo oh decreased by 73 3 73 8 in the presence of 200 u ml cat this phenomenon was due to the fast decomposition of h2o2 by cat thereby diminishing oh formation which suggested h2o2 is an important intermediate in oh production these combined results suggest that 3dom induces dom were mainly responsible for oh generation while the direct h abstraction of water by 3dom has limited contribution to oh generation 3 3 3 2 contribution of nitrite to oh formation in addition to 3dom nitrite and nitrate also contributed to oh generation eqs 9 11 according to the correlation analyses fig 4 in addition no2 ss exhibited the highest positive correlation with oh ss fig s9 also showed that photoinduced oh in paddy water increased rapidly with the addition of nitrite indicating that nitrite significantly influenced oh formation thus we examined the contributions of nitrite and nitrate to photoinduced oh formation in paddy water 9 no 3 h v n o 2 o 10 no 2 h v no o 11 o h oh ultrapure water with different concentrations of nano2 and nano3 was irradiated and the formation rates of oh r oh were monitored the concentrations covered the ranges of no2 and no3 in all samples fig s10 the r oh value of nitrite was 5 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of nitrate indicating that a negligible amount of oh was formed by nitrate in paddy water this is caused by the fact that nitrite and nitrate mainly absorb sunlight in the uva amax 355 nm and uvb amax 305 nm fig s11 regions respectively vione et al 2014 thus we only evaluated the contribution of nitrite to oh formation in paddy water to take into account the light screening effect of dom the expression of oh formation rate from nitrite r oh nitrite was adjusted using the shading coefficient k 12 r oh nitrite k r oh exp 13 k r a n o 2 r a t o t 14 r a t o t λ e p λ 0 1 10 a t o t λ

absorbance of species i e p λ 0 is the spectral photon irradiance of the xenon lamp note that in most cases atot λ adom λ vione et al 2014 the contribution of nitrite to the photoinduced oh generation rate was estimated by dividing r oh nitrite by r oh of each paddy water sample table s5 the calculated nitrite contribution in irrigation water was 62 9 0 7 but increased to 73 5 100 at seedling stage and then decreased to 36 6 100 and 23 9 24 5 for tillering and jointing stages respectively finally it was increased to 93 9 100 at the heading stage these results suggest nitrite contributed to 23 9 100 while dom accounted for approximately 0 76 1 of oh generation from the photochemical processes of paddy water these results suggest nitrite contributed to 23 9 100 while dom accounted for approximately 0 76 1 of oh generation from the photochemical processes of paddy water and both contributions varied depending on dom property and nitrite concentration 3 4 contribution of ris to as iii oxidation in paddy water as iii is a common pollutant in rice fields during flooding periods in order to explore the effect of paddy water on as iii removal 100 µg l sodium arsenite was added in the s3 t3 j1 and h1 paddy water samples as iii can be oxidized upon exposure to oxygen and light buschmann et al 2005 as shown in fig 7 a the oxidation of as iii was significantly accelerated in paddy water which was attributed to the production of various active substances in this environment under illumination as discussed above as tot did not change significantly during the photochemistry experiment indicating that the adsorption of as iii on organic matter was negligible after subtracting the contribution to the oxidation of as iii by oxygen during the dark reaction the oxidation rate in paddy water samples increased by 1 8 4 1 times compared to that in ultrapure water this increase is due to the ris in rice field water in other words the contribution of the ris formed in paddy field water to the oxidation of as iii was 64 5 80 5 methanol nan3 and sorbic acid were used to identify the contributions of different ris as the ph changed slightly by less than one unit when the scavengers were added the corresponding effect could be neglected methanol is an efficient scavenger of oh with a rate constant of 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2021 as shown in fig 7b the presence of methanol significantly inhibited as iii oxidation in each sample which implies that oh played an important role previous studies showed that oh can rapidly oxidize as iii with a rate constant of 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2014 nan3 could simultaneously quench oh and 1o2 the addition of nan3 did not significantly inhibit the oxidation of as iii compared to the addition of methanol indicating that 1o2 was not a major photooxidant of as iii buschmann et al 2005 sorbic acid an efficient triplet quencher with a rate constant of 12 9 108 m 1 s 1 as determined from several dom samples was employed to investigate the role of 3dom in the photochemical as iii photodegradation moor et al 2019 upon sa addition k obs decreased by 52 1 48 7 74 2 and 94 8 for s3 t3 j1 and h1 respectively fig 7b showing that 3dom played a major role in inducing indirect photooxidation of as iii the inhibition effect was lower in samples s3 and t3 because oh species formed from high no2 levels at seedling and tillering stages could not be scavenged by sa to evaluate the significance of as iii abiotic oxidation in paddy water the second order reaction rate constant of as iii oxidation by 3dom k 3 do m as iii was calculated with steady state model eq 16 16 k obs k d k 3 do m as iii 3 do m ss k oh as iii oh ss where k obs is the observed pseudo first order oxidation rate of as iii and k d is the pseudo first order rate of direct as iii oxidation by sunlight water 1 2 1 4 10 5 s 1 in this study k oh as iii is the second order reaction rate constant for as iii oxidation with oh 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 as reported kim et al 2014 consequently the calculated k 3 do m as iii was 7 6 22 10 7 m 1 s 1 which was about 200 650 times higher than that of as iii oxidation by biological enzyme catalyzed reaction lièvremont et al 2003 sehlin and lindstrom 1992 these results suggest the as iii abiotic oxidation by ris in paddy water might be a non negligible pathway for as transformation in paddy soil 4 conclusions this work focused on the photoreactivity of paddy water at different rice cultivation stages we measured the formation rates of ris such as oh 1o2 and 3dom upon irradiation of paddy water samples and observed high quantum yields at seedling and jointing stages the ri formation rates were found to depend on the paddy water parameters due to fertilization rice growth and alternated flooding paddy waters experience changing water chemistry and dom properties during rice cultivation we observed that i samples at seedling stage contained higher no2 and dom amounts ii tillering stage dom presented more aromatic and humified components iii jointing and heading stage dom had higher contents of fresh and autochthonous species iv tannins and condensed aromatic structures decreased during rice cultivation eem fticr ms and statistical analysis showed significant correlations between photoreactivity and dom properties dom with lower relative molecular weight and humification extent produced more ris more saturated and less aromatic dom compositions were most efficient at forming 3dom under irradiation while polyphenols inhibited the formation of ris nitrite was the primary source of oh species in paddy water contributing to 23 9 100 of their formation in addition ris had a significant contribution to as iii oxidation in paddy water in which oh and 3dom played important roles compared with the conventional knowledge that the biotic process was dominant for as transformation in paddy soil zhang et al 2015 this study shows that the abiotic oxidation of as iii by ris would also play an important role in as transformation in paddy water these results also provide new insight into the mechanism of abiotic transformation of as in paddy soil to best of our knowledge this work represents the first systematic study of the photoreactivity of paddy waters at different rice cultivation stages focused on the influence of water chemistry and dom

16539,numerous studies report on the synergy between ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation tio2 uva which could open the way to the application of photocatalytic ozonation pcoz in water treatment with the aim of establishing the existence of this synergy and its origin in this work using tio2 p25 365 nm uva leds and ozone transferred doses up to 5 mg mg doc0 1 doc0 7 10 mg l 1 a systematic study has been carried out featuring the effect of ph alkalinity and water matrix in each of the systems involved in pcoz with special attention to the role of organics adsorption onto tio2 in ultrapure water an increase in ph and carbonates content exerted a slight negative effect on the photocatalytic degradation of primidone low adsorption onto tio2 and mainly abated by free ho this effect being higher on its mineralization the negative effect of ph and alkalinity was much stronger for oxalic acid high tendency to adsorb and mainly oxidized by positive holes accordingly the results obtained at ph phpzc point of zero charge of the catalyst in ultrapure water cannot at all be extrapolated to secondary effluents since their composition negatively affects the photocatalytic performance at the experimental conditions applied only for the secondary effluent a synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva systems was observed this synergy would be related on the one hand to the generation from the matrix itself of reactive entities or intermediates that promote the decomposition of ozone into ho and on the other hand to an increase in catalyst activity as the matrix uva absorption decreases rather than from direct interactions between both systems despite de above ozone requirement to achieve a significant reduction of doc is high and would only be an interesting strategy for the elimination of ozone refractory micropollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalytic ozonation synergy high intensity uva leds water matrix micropollutants and doc removal 1 introduction 1 1 tio2 photoexcitation background photoexcitation of tio2 in water generates positive holes h and ho at the catalyst surface as well as o2 and h2o2 nosaka and nosaka 2016 2017 since the redox potential of positive holes and surface ho is practically the same nosaka and nosaka 2016 both will be referred as h in the present work surface ho can diffuse to the bulk hereafter denoted as free ho and when rutile phase is present as it is the case of tio2 p25 anatase rutile ratio 5 3 0 28 ohtani et al 2010 h2o2 could also improve the release of ho through the formation of a peroxo titanium complex and further cleavage of the oo bond by h contrary to the classical mechanism accepted the formation of ho from the reaction between h2o2 and e does not seem to be possible and must be disregarded nosaka and nosaka 2016 accordingly the amount of h generated at the surface is higher than that of ho in the liquid bulk 1 2 the role of the adsorption process on tio2 photocatalysis although any compound could react with free ho only those capable of being adsorbed on tio2 can interact with h implying that h is much more selective than free ho the adsorption of a given compound will depend on its structure and ionization state pka at the ph of the medium together with the phpzc of the catalyst point of zero charge the latter being 6 3 6 9 for tio2 p25 kosmulski 2009 rosal et al 2009 perez holmberg et al 2013 literature includes numerous studies supporting the efficiency of the tio2 uva system under acidic slightly acidic conditions that is ph phpzc for the degradation of model contaminants and their mineralization in ultrapure water beltrán et al 2008 rodríguez et al 2010 tong et al 2012 moreira et al 2015 rimoldi et al 2017 jallouli et al 2018 in many cases identifying ho and h as the main species responsible for the transformation of compounds with low or high tendency to be adsorbed on the catalyst respectively in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc mineralization if the conversion of final products carboxylic acids ketones and aldehydes of low molecular weight to co2 and h2o relies at least in part in their adsorption and further oxidation by h for final products with pka phpzc the mineralization efficiency will decrease at ph phpzc due to electrostatic repulsion the presence of carbonates bicarbonates alkalinity negatively affect doc removal due to their adsorption and occupation of active centers and possible decrease of phpzc farner budarz et al 2017 hence having in mind the typical composition and characteristics of secondary effluents se from municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp that is ph phpzc p25 and medium high alkalinity content in se the direct contribution of h to doc mineralization is expected to be minimal 1 3 agglomeration aggregation of catalyst particles during tio2 photocatalysis se composition could favor the agglomeration aggregation reversible irreversible of catalyst particles negatively affecting the diffusion of ho ivanova et al 2016 although the role of salts commonly present in se on the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency is controversial farner budarz et al 2017 reported that at ph 7 9 cl so4 and no3 present in se at relatively high concentrations have low or no tendency to be adsorbed on tio2 but even at concentrations as low as 0 5 mm these anions can cause the significant aggregation of tio2 particles decreasing the diffusion of ho to the liquid divalent cations as ca2 also favor the agglomeration aggregation of tio2 particles whereas organic matter seems to contribute to their stabilization zhang et al 2009 1 4 other effects of water matrix on tio2 photocatalysis although under 365 nm uva radiation the photolysis of common ions in se is not relevant the organic matter of the effluent efom can absorb radiation and generate reactive species lee et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 however the attenuation of uva radiation by the matrix can negatively affect the photoexcitation of the catalyst and hence the generation of h and free ho moreover depending on their concentration and reactivity all the organics inorganics present in se may act as ho sink brame et al 2015 farner budarz et al 2017 maghsoodi et al 2019 or compete for catalyst active sites diminishing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process 1 5 photocatalytic ozonation pcoz background compared to tio2 uva several studies report the higher efficiency of the o3 tio2 uva system photocatalytic ozonation pcoz both in the elimination of microcontaminants and reduction of doc during pcoz application micropollutants are degraded through different mechanisms such as molecular ozone attack direct indirect photolysis and reaction with h and or free ho free ho generated through ozone decomposition tio2 photoexcitation and even by efom photolysis is usually considered the main responsible for the degradation of ozone refractory compounds and doc elimination mehrjouei et al 2015 beltrán and rey 2017 mecha and chollom 2020 as for tio2 uva the nature of the contaminants and the characteristics of the water matrix are key parameters in pcoz efficiency thus working with model compounds in ultrapure water or without ph control usually ph sharply decreases due to carboxylic acids formation results in a process efficiency much higher than at higher ph especially in terms of doc mineralization beltrán et al 2008 márquez et al 2014 moreira et al 2016 jallouli et al 2018 lado ribeiro et al 2019 this influence of ph in pcoz could be related at least in part to an increase in the participation of h as the ph decreases and be misinterpreted as a synergy between systems the potential synergy should be validated respect to tio2 uva and o3 uva from experiments performed at the same conditions with special attention to ph 1 6 synergy in pcoz the synergy between simpler systems observed by different authors has been mainly attributed i to the role of ozone as scavenger of e at the catalyst surface allowing the generation of o3 and diminishing e h recombination mehrjouei et al 2015 fathinia et al 2016 beltrán and rey 2017 suligoj et al 2021 however although the reactivity of o3 towards e is twice that of o2 3 6 1010 m 1s 1 vs 1 9 1010 m 1s 1 bahnemann and hart 1982 buxton et al 1988 considering the much higher concentration of o2 in the feeding gas and the higher solubility of o2 e would be mainly captured by o2 to form o2 and ii to the reaction between o2 and o3 leading to o3 which seems more probable suligoj et al 2021 from experiments performed at ph 3 using p25 concluded that the lower the adsorption of the compound onto the catalyst the higher the synergy between systems and this synergy also increased with the o3 dose 1 7 objectives of the present work in wastewater treatment implementation of a tertiary advanced oxidation step may be needed for a safe discharge of the treated water and or its reuse in periods of drought or water shortage pcoz can be considered as one of these advanced processes provided the existence of a synergy between ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation in a previous work figueredo et al 2020 the application of pcoz on the degradation and mineralization of primidone prm as probe compound in ultrapure water was studied from the results obtained a mechanism was proposed and applied at specific conditions without considering the effect of matrix properties ph alkalinity etc the present work aims at identifying the existence of synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva on the elimination of pollutants and doc although doc reduction represents the importance of a full oxidation step which is not the objective in a real mwwtp this parameter can bring important information to clarify the existence of any synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva primidone was selected as probe compound as it has no tendency to adsorb onto tio2 or photolyze under uva oxalic acid oxal a carboxylic acid usually detected in the final stages of organic matter oxidation was also selected due to its high tendency to adsorb onto tio2 no uva absorption very low reactivity towards o3 and relatively low reactivity with ho aqueous solutions of both compounds and the secondary effluent from a mwwtp spiked in some cases with different micropollutants with low medium reactivity towards o3 prm caffeine caf and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba were treated by tio2 uva o3 o3 uva and o3 tio2 uva working at different ph and alkalinity content in an attempt to substantiate the effect of the operating parameters it was tried to correlate different phenomena occurring including adsorption agglomeration aggregation role of holes and free radicals etc to the potential synergy of the pcoz system specific objectives were to assess i the effect of experimental conditions and water matrix on the removal of target compounds and doc ii the species and mechanisms involved and iii the existence of synergies between systems and parameters governing the synergy extent 2 experimental 2 1 reagents all the reagents and eluents used in this work analytical grade and hplc gradient grade respectively were obtained from sigma aldrich vwr and fischer scientific and used as received tio2 p25 aeroxide was from evonik industries essen germany ultrapure water produced by a millipore milli q academic system darmstadt germany and pressurized oxygen purity 99 5 supplied by linde chemical structures pka values and apparent second order rate constant of the reaction of the selected compounds with ho and o3 are shown in table s1 supplementary information the secondary effluent se came from the secondary decanter of the mwwtp rincón de caya badajoz spain where a biological treatment based on an activated sludge process is applied the se was filtered whatman grade 1 and frozen until use main characteristics of the se are given in table s2 supporting information 2 2 experimental setup the experimental set up see fig s1 has been previously described figueredo et al 2020 briefly it consisted of an agitated tank borosilicate glass 1 3 l capacity magnetic stirring with inlets outlets for gasses and sampling the tank was initially filled with 1 l of the water to be treated and then pumped peristaltic pump ql 7 7 l h 1 to a tubular photoreactor borosilicate glass 50 cm long 2 8 cm internal diameter total volume 0 36 l in recirculation mode the tube was permanently covered by a stainless steel reflector as radiation source 6 leds lz4 04uv00 led engin 3 w radiant power each λmax 365 nm located under the glass tube were used using nitrite as actinometer a photon flux of 3 92 10 5 einstein l s 1 reaching the liquid was determined figueredo et al 2020 in a typical experiment using tio2 the whole installation was draped by aluminum foil the tank filled a sample taken and the catalyst added 10 500 mg l 1 then the stirring and pumping systems were turned on and the o2 stream qg 15 l h 1 fed to the tank through a glass diffuser after 30 min adsorption period in the dark a new sample was taken t 0 min the aluminum foil removed and the leds switched on then taking samples at different times a similar procedure was followed when ozone was used starting the o2 o3 bubbling in the ozonation tank qg 15 l h 1 and o3g in 10 mg l 1 once the photoreactor was filled single ozonation the leds were switched on photolytic ozonation o3 uva or after the adsorption period in the dark photocatalytic ozonation considering the gas flow rate the concentration of o3 in the gas inlet and outlet the reaction volume and the initial doc content the evolution of transferred ozone dose tod per unit of doc0 tod doc0 mg o3 mg doc0 1 was determined in all cases ozone transferred doses up to 5 mg o3 mg doc0 1 in 2 h were applied according to the installation design the concentration of ozone entering the photoreactor at a given time corresponds to the dissolved ozone present in the tank as will be seen later this configuration will be useful to determine the interactions between systems all the experiments were carried out at room temperature after 2 h total reaction time the increase in temperature was less than 2 c in experiments using prm caf and or pcba as probe compounds concentrated solutions were prepared in ultrapure water then adding the volume needed to obtain the desired concentration in 1 l final volume prm 14 mg l 1 in ultrapure water prm caf and pcba 100 µg l 1 each in se when oxal was used as probe compound the working solution 35 mg l 1 of c2h2o4 2h2o in ultrapure water was directly prepared before the experiment in experiments in the presence of tert butanol tbuoh 0 1 m as ho scavenger 10 ml of pure tbuoh were added to 1 l of the reaction medium when needed some drops of concentrated naoh or hclo4 were added to correct the initial ph hclo4 was also used to remove inorganic carbon ic from se in experiments in ultrapure water in the presence of ic 30 mg l 1 ph was first corrected to 7 5 with naoh the required amount of nahco3 added and the ph corrected to ph 8 4 if needed 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of ozone in the gas streams inlet outlet was monitored by an anseros ozomat gm 6000 pro analyzer prm caf and pcba concentration were analyzed by hplc agilent 1100 series with uv vis detector using a kromasil c18 column 150 4 mm 100 å pore size 5 µm particle size inorganic anions and short chain organic acids were analyzed by ion chromatography with chemical suppression metrohm 881 compact pro and conductivity detection using a metrosep a supp 7 column 4 150 mm 5 µm the description of the chromatographic methods and the limits of detection lod and quantitation loq are given in text s1 the concentration of doc and ic in water was determined using a shimadzu toc vsch analyzer and the concentration of ozone and hydrogen peroxide by the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 and cobalt bicarbonate method masschelein et al 1977 respectively nnh4 was determined using a spectroquant test kit merck cod and ntotal using hach lange test kits and bod5 using an oxitop device spectrophotometric measurements were performed by means of an uv vis evolution 201 thermo scientific spectrophotometer after purging dissolved ozone if present with air the samples were filtered 0 45 µm pvdf millipore and analyzed 2 4 kinetic data processing when the photocatalytic oxidation of an aqueous contaminant c mainly develops through its reaction with ho and additionally no direct photolysis occurs degradation kinetics can be modelled by a simple pseudo first order kinetics krýsa et al 2006 pseudo first order kinetics is far away from considering the actual mechanism but it is a useful tool for comparison purposes accordingly the following equation applies 1 ln c c 0 k obs c t where 2 k obs c k c ho h o ss in eq 1 kobs c stands for the observed pseudo first order rate constant s 1 kc ho is the second order rate constant of the reaction between the compound c and ho m 1 s 1 and ho ss represents the average molar concentration of hydroxyl radicals under steady state conditions if concentration data of c versus time and kc ho are known eqs 1 and 2 allow kobs c and ho ss to be determined these two parameters give a measure of the efficiency in ho generation as a function of the operating conditions applied similarly regardless of the species involved in the process h and or ho the mineralization of contaminants can also be assumed to follow pseudo first order kinetics this hypothesis is applicable when the adsorption stage in case it takes place follows the langmuir hinshelwood model and the doc content is sufficiently low krýsa et al 2006 3 ln doc doc 0 k obs doc t where doc is the concentration of doc and kobs doc the observed pseudo first order rate constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic oxidation using tio2 p25 and uva leds 3 1 1 primidone the role of free ho radicals in a first experimental series prm was used as a model compound in ultrapure water using different p25 doses under continuous bubbling of pure oxygen alkalinity and ph effects were also studied to understand the main features governing the process according to a previous work figueredo et al 2019 the initial photocatalytic transformation of prm in the presence of tio2 p25 is mainly caused by its reaction with free ho in addition as experimentally proven the photolysis of prm under 365 nm radiation provided by leds and its adsorption on tio2 are negligible fig 1 a shows kobs prm values obtained after fitting the experimental results to eq 1 and the stationary hydroxyl radical concentration ho ss eq 2 fig 1b displays the values of kobs doc eq 3 the fitting process is shown in figs s2 and s3 and ph evolution in fig s4 at ph0 6 ph gradually decreased to 4 7 after 2 h fig s4 as inferred from fig 1a an increase in tio2 load from 10 to 250 mg l 1 led to an exponential increase in free ho production with estimated ho ss and kobs prm values ranging from 5 10 14 m to 2 5 10 13 m and from 0 017 min 1 to 0 100 min 1 respectively no further improvement at higher tio2 doses was experienced at the experimental conditions applied from prm initial removal rates that is assuming there is no ho consumption by intermediates a maximum apparent efficiency of 0 002 mol ho einstein 1 was estimated the optimal catalyst dose in ultrapure water being in the proximity of 100 mg l 1 see text s2 regarding mineralization fig 1b at ph0 6 catalyst doses from 10 to 250 mg l 1 led to kobs doc from 0 0017 min 1 to 0 025 min 1 doc reduction ranging from 20 to 95 after 2 h fig s3 again there was no further improvement in kobs doc at higher titania doses according to the values shown in fig 1a and b at ph0 6 the ratio kobs doc kobs prm increased with the catalyst dose from 0 1 10 mg l 1 to 0 23 250 500 mg l 1 hence the positive effect of the amount of catalyst is higher in prm mineralization than in its initial transformation which suggests the development of different oxidation mechanisms compared to measurements conducted at ph0 6 with 100 mg l 1 of tio2 an increase of initial ph to 8 4 led to a decrease in kobs prm of roughly 15 in the absence of ic and 35 when 30 mg l 1 of ic were added since the effect of prm speciation can be disregarded prm pka 11 5 the slight negative effect of ph and alkalinity in ho ss would be related to the influence of both parameters in the agglomeration aggregation of p25 particles autin et al 2013 jefferson et al 2016 li et al 2016 wang 2017 and or occupation of active sites by carbonates bicarbonates additionally alkalinity may act as ho scavenger consequence of the following equilibria and reactions buxton and elliot 1986 real et al 2009 4 h 2 c o 3 pka 6 34 h hco 3 pka 10 37 2 h co 3 5 hco 3 h o k 8 5 x 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 co 3 h 2 o 6 co 3 h o k 4 2 x 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 co 3 o h 7 prm h o k 6 7 x 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 intermediate according to equilibria 4 at ph0 8 4 ic is mainly present as hco3 considering the initial concentrations of prm and hco3 together with the values of the second order rate constant of their reaction with ho approximately 95 of ho should be captured by prm so the scavenging effect of hco3 on kobs prm would be negligible the increase of the initial ph from 6 to 8 4 also caused a reduction of 22 in kobs doc similar to the 15 decrease in kobs prm the negative effect of ph was significantly amplified in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ic with a kobs doc reduction of 75 twice that of kobs prm 35 the fact that the effect of alkalinity is more pronounced in prm mineralization than in its initial transformation suggests either the refractory character of some of the intermediates towards ho not being able to compete with hco3 and or again that the species involved in both processes differ thus given the high tendency of carbonates bicarbonates to adsorb onto tio2 dolamic and bürgi 2007 farner budarz et al 2017 they could inhibit decrease the development of oxidation reactions involving h and their contribution to mineralization fig 2 a shows the generation evolution of some low molecular weight carboxylic acids and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in solution i e nnh4 and nno3 nno2 remained below the lod for runs at ph0 6 after reaching different doc conversions as observed formic for oxalic oxal and acetic ace acids were the main carboxylic acids detected after an initial increase acids concentration gradually decreased with doc conversion while din increased mainly in the form of nnh4 see also text s3 the low conversion of nnh4 to nno3 would be the result of its low adsorption onto tio2 absence of oxidation by h and low reactivity towards free ho buxton et al 1988 bonsen et al 1997 zhu et al 2005 huang et al 2008 fig 2b shows the influence of ph and alkalinity on the concentration of low molecular weight carboxylic acids and din in solution after reaching 35 40 doc removal compared to the run at ph0 6 no ic the results clearly reveal the high accumulation of oxal in solution when the initial ph was set at 8 4 and 30 mg l 1 of ic were added 3 1 2 oxalic acid the role of holes in view of the previous results a series of oxal photocatalytic oxidation experiments was completed oxal pka1 1 25 and pka2 4 27 mendive et al 2007 presents relatively low reactivity towards ho see table s1 and high tendency to be adsorbed onto tio2 forming mono and bidentate surface complexes hug and sulzberger 1994 weisz et al 2002 park et al 2006 mendive et al 2007 the reaction of oxal with h is accepted to be the principal photocatalytic pathway under uv radiation krýsa et al 2006 schneider et al 2020 leading to co2 and co2 the latter evolving to co2 and o2 ho2 in the presence of dissolved o2 krýsa et al 2006 as a consequence oxal is directly converted to co2 and or bicarbonate carbonate depending on ph so kobs oxal and kobs doc values are the same given the high oxal capability of adsorption and reaction with h the specialized bibliography includes numerous works in which oxal is used as a h scavenger kominami et al 2001 rodríguez et al 2015 schneider et al 2020 tests were carried out in ultrapure water with initial ph fixed at 3 5 6 and 8 4 in the latter case the influence of ic addition was also investigated to determine the possible participation of free ho in the degradation of oxal experiments were also performed in the presence of tbuoh 0 1 m alcohol concentration high enough to scavenge ho ktbuohho 6 2 108 m 1 s 1 alam et al 2003 due to tbuoh low adsorption and capacity to act as electron donor h generation should not be affected kim et al 2014 burek et al 2019 fig 3 a shows the evolution of the normalized concentration of oxal with time solid lines are fitting to eq 1 and fig 3b the ph variation in all cases the amount of oxal adsorbed onto tio2 after an initial period of 30 min in the dark was undetectable in line with the adsorption isotherm determined by ivanova et al 2016 at ph 3 7 and 25 c predicted oxal adsorbed 6 μm under the conditions tested the concentration of h2o2 in solution was below 5 10 6 m not shown at ph0 3 5 and as reported in the literature kosanić 1998 orge et al 2015 oxal elimination rate was significantly high kobs oxal 0 07 min 1 being fully converted in less than 30 min fig 3a at this ph the surface of the catalyst is positively charged and oxal mainly on its monoprotonated form see speciation in fig s5 so the adsorption of oxal and its h oxidation is favored since the presence of 0 1 m tbuoh at ph0 3 5 had no effect on oxal elimination the participation of free ho can be ruled out at ph0 6 kobs oxal 0 0071 min 1 r2 0 98 the attraction between oxal and the tio2 surface is still favored however as the reaction progresses the accumulation of hco3 co3 leads to a ph increase fig 3b called causticization by wang and adesina 1997 and the net positive charge of the catalyst decreases therefore the electrostatic attraction between oxal tio2 p25 diminishes resulting in lower adsorption a further rise of initial ph to 8 4 oxal present as c2o4 kobs oxal 0 0026 min 1 r2 0 98 results in a low initial degradation followed by a slight increase due to the ph drop to 7 5 at ph 8 4 the addition of 30 mg l 1 of ic implied no oxal conversion after 2 h absence of mineralization is attributable to the occupation of active adsorption centers by hco3 co3 together with the role of ic as ho scavenger in summary from fig 3 it is deduced that both ph and ic content have a strong negative impact on oxal degradation by tio2 uva surprisingly at ph0 phpzc presence of 0 1 m tbuoh favored the elimination of oxal effect that was significantly reduced in the presence of 30 mg l 1 of ic since the presence of tbuoh did not practically affect the evolution of ph fig 3b these results indicate that 0 1 m tbuoh enhanced somehow oxal degradation it is hypothesized that as the ph increases and the adsorption of oxal decreases given the high concentration of the alcohol a small amount of tbuoh can be adsorbed and oxidized at the catalyst surface oxidation by free hydroxyl radicals is not discarded leading to radical species capable of degrading oxal the mechanism should be similar to that proposed by cederbaum et al 1983 based on the formation of the hydroxyalkyl or alkoxyl radicals the spontaneous fission of the latter would lead to the methyl radical which can attack a suitable electron donor or combine with oxygen to generate the methyl peroxy radical any of these species could react with oxal in the presence of ic adsorption of tbuoh would be reduced unlike oxal prm mineralization requires previous oxidation steps however if kobs doc values of prm fig 1b and oxal fig 3a are compared for experiments at ph0 8 4 prm is more efficiently mineralized than oxal in absence presence of ic this means that the oxidation mineralization of low molecular weight intermediates other than oxal formed during prm photocatalytic degradation depends to a lesser extent on h due to their higher reactivity with free ho or even with the co3 generated from reactions 5 and 6 this is for example the case of for pka 3 74 kho hco2 3 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 kfor co3 1 1 105 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 that is oxidized to co2 and o2 ho2 yapsakli and can 2004 attending to the results obtained working with prm and oxal at ph phpzc the efficiency of the tio2 uva system in doc removal will be low especially in the presence of alkalinity due to the low contribution of h having in mind the importance of the adsorption process in the photocatalytic mechanism a secondary effluent from a mwwtp was next considered a priori given the characteristics of these effluents free ho is expected to be the main species involved in the oxidation and mineralization of the efom by this system 3 1 3 secondary effluent from a mwwtp influence of the water matrix tio2 uva system was applied to treat the se from a mwwtp see table s1 doped with 100 µg l 1 of prm and caf as representative of micropollutants like prm caf photocatalytic degradation is mainly caused by reaction with free ho dalmázio et al 2005 chuang et al 2011 kcaf ho being 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 shi et al 1991 another experiment was conducted under similar conditions previously eliminating the ic content by successive changes in ph a first acidification stage led to ic removal and partial solubilization of suspended organic carbon increase of doc0 from 10 to 12 mg l 1 whereas the subsequent rise of ph led to an increase of 6 mg l 1 of residual ic due to co2 absorption regardless of the ic content the ph of the effluent remained virtually constant along the treatment fig 4 compares the values of kobs doc for se see variation of normalized doc over time and fittings to eq 3 in fig s6 with those corresponding to prm and oxal in ultrapure water under similar conditions the evolution of the normalized concentration of spiked prm and caf throughout se photocatalytic treatment without with ic removal is shown in fig 4b as observed in fig 4a after 2 h se mineralization was negligible in fact a slight increase in doc over time could be likely due to the solubilization of suspended matter fig s6 the reduction of ic0 content in se had a slight positive effect on doc removal 12 after 2 h and carboxylic acid generation see fig s7a due to the ph and ic content of the se the contribution of surface reactions to the oxidation of organics would be minimal besides the agglomeration aggregation of the catalyst in se would be much higher than in ultrapure water lowering the amount of ho that diffuses into the bulk regarding the evolution of the normalized concentration of prm and caf fig 4b their profiles were similar regardless of the specific compound and ic content reaching 50 conversion after 2 h this means that ic did not alter the production of ho nor competes with the micropollutants for ho or this was balanced by the formation of co3 wojnárovits et al 2020 fitting of experimental data to eq 1 lead to an average value of 0 008 min 1 for kobs c a sixth fold decrease if compared to the value of 0 05 min 1 obtained for prm in ultrapure water at similar conditions hence organics and inorganics other than hco3 co3 present in se are responsible for the low ho ss by acting as ho sink and or lowering ho diffusion due to the agglomeration aggregation of the catalyst the latter phenomena have been reported in the presence ca2 zhang et al 2009 cl so4 and no3 farner budarz et al 2017 at concentration levels similar to those commonly found in mwwtp se from the above results the optimal catalyst dose in se is probably higher than in ultrapure water thus when 100 and 500 mg l 1 of tio2 were used although in both cases there was no doc removal after 2 h a clear increase in the formation rate of carboxylic acids in solution was observed for the highest catalyst dose fig s7b in any case it could be deduced by the results that the application of tio2 uva system in ultrapure water using probe compounds cannot be extrapolated at all to actual secondary effluents 3 2 photocatalytic ozonation using tio2 p25 and uva leds to determine the influence of water matrix characteristics on the effectiveness of pcoz technology and the potential existence of synergism between systems a similar study was carried out by applying o3 o3 uva and o3 tio2 uva 3 2 1 primidone ozone based systems were applied to degrade prm in ultrapure water ph0 6 pcoz was carried out also at ph0 8 4 in the absence presence of ic during pcoz at ph0 8 4 and no ic the quick formation of acidic compounds and the lack of buffering capacity led to a fast ph decrease so the results obtained were practically identical to those registered at ph0 6 not shown this reflects the importance of this parameter when trying to determine the existence of real synergies between systems fig 5 shows kobs prm fig 5a and kobs doc fig 5b values obtained after fitting the data to simplistic pseudo first order kinetics see fig s8 for comparison purposes data corresponding to the tio2 uva system are also included in fig 5a and fig 5b dotted lines correspond to the sum of kobs values corresponding to o3 uva and tio2 uva fig 5c compares the evolution of prm doc and dissolved ozone concentrations in the ozonation tank during pcoz tests performed at ph0 6 no ic and 8 4 30 mg l 1 of ic the evolution of ph during all these runs is shown in fig s9 although the reactivity of prm with ozone is relatively low kprm o3 3 m 1 s 1 figueredo et al 2019 the degradation of prm by o3 occurs through reaction with ho generated from ozone decomposition promoted by prm itself figueredo et al 2019 therefore as seen in fig 5a under slightly acidic conditions the efficiency of o3 and o3 uva systems was high and similar with 90 prm converted in less than 20 min values of kobs prm from pcoz coincided with the sum of contributions from o3 uva and tio2 uva systems regardless of tio2 dose so no synergy or antagonism is envisaged as for tio2 uva the influence of ph and alkalinity on kobs prm by pcoz was low fig 5a in terms of mineralization fig 5b at ph0 6 the effectiveness of simple ozonation was very low 10 doc removal after 2 h the ozone recalcitrance of carboxylic acids ketones and aldehydes of low molecular weight von sonntag and von gunten 2012 makes necessary the participation of species with higher oxidizing potential such as ho since at ph0 6 the decomposition of o3 into ho was mainly favored by prm and in addition ph decreased with time fig s9 once prm was eliminated the generation of ho diminished in the case of the o3 uva system despite the low absorbance of o3 h2o complexes at 365 nm axson et al 2011 the use of high intensity leds favors the generation of ho by photolysis of o3 figueredo et al 2020 and this is clearly reflected in mineralization 32 doc removal after 2 h as discussed later section 3 2 2 at these conditions oxal formed during prm oxidation by o3 uva can improve the decomposition of o3 into ho also enhanced by other intermediates as it is the case of for yapsakli and can 2004 at ph0 6 kobs doc values of tio2 uva and pcoz were similar at any tio2 dose small differences correspond to the contribution to kobs doc of o3 uva fig 5b again it is demonstrated no synergy between systems h being the main responsible of prm mineralization by pcoz at ph phpzc the effect of ph and alkalinity on doc reduction by pcoz was significant thus at ph 8 4 and 30 mg l 1 ic after an initial evolution up to 15 min close to that experienced at ph0 6 fig 5c the elimination rate of doc slowed down to kobs doc 0 003 min 1 value similar to the tio2 uva system fig 1b and ten times lower than pcoz at ph0 6 fig 5b during the first 15 min regardless of the ph as observed in fig 5c the concentration of ozone in the tank that fed the photoreactor was virtually zero this means that during this period oxidant species are mainly generated by the decomposition of o3 in the dark favored by ph and the presence of prm and the photoexcitation of tio2 in the photoreactor with no o3 uva or o3 tio2 uva interactions after this period the concentration of dissolved ozone in the tank and therefore entering the photoreactor increased evolving similarly at ph0 6 and 8 4 30 mg l 1 ic however since at ph0 8 4 almost no mineralization was attained under these conditions it is suggested that in addition to the null contribution of h and the ho scavenging effect of ic the contribution of o2 generated from the reaction between electrons and dissolved o2 at the catalyst surface to the decomposition of o3 into ho basis of the synergism between these systems does not seem relevant fig 6 shows the concentration of carboxylic acids after 2 h at ph0 6 simple ozonation resulted in low carboxylic acids formation consequence of the low reactivity of o3 towards prm intermediates and low o3 decomposition into ho once prm was degraded due to the ability of uva to decompose o3 into ho the o3 uva system led to a higher formation of carboxylic acids identifying oxal as the predominant when tio2 was present regardless of the presence of ozone tio2 uva and pcoz systems at ph0 6 participation of h allowed almost complete mineralization and the accumulation of carboxylic acids was significantly reduced on the contrary during pcoz at ph0 8 4 30 mg l 1 of ic oxal accumulated in the reaction media due to the inhibition of reactions at the catalyst surface and because its low reactivity towards o3 and ho again surface reactions are less decisive in the case of other carboxylic acids due to their much higher reactivity with ho or even co3 however at ph0 8 4 30 mg l 1 of ic after 2 h only 35 of doc in solution was in the form of carboxylic acids 25 of doc as oxal which means that there must be other intermediates final products whose degradation by pcoz is also adversely affected by increased ph and or alkalinity 3 2 2 oxalic acid additional experiments were carried out by applying the different systems in the degradation of oxal in ultrapure water two ph were tested 3 5 and 8 4 in the latter case with without 30 mg l 1 of ic the evolution of the normalized remaining concentration of oxal with time is shown in fig 7 and the evolution of ph in fig s10 as seen in fig 7a o3 and o3 uva systems at ph0 3 5 the elimination of oxal by simple ozonation was low 20 after 2 h due to the low value of koxal o3 0 04 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 and low decomposition of o3 into ho at these conditions combination of ozone with uva o3 uva had a significant positive effect on oxal elimination 95 after 2 h as moreira et al 2016 also reported on one hand the high radiation intensity of 365 nm given by the leds favors the decomposition of o3 into ho as inferred from fig s11 that shows the evolution of dissolved ozone in the ozonation tank throughout the experiments thus allowing the oxidation of a fraction of oxal with concomitant formation of co2 that evolves to co2 and o2 on the other hand the superoxide radical propagates o3 decomposition to finally yield ho garoma and gurol 2005 vecitis et al 2010 concentration of h2o2 in solution was negligible 5 10 6 m not shown in any case under acidic conditions the higher efficiency of o3 uva compared to o3 cannot be associated to the o3 h2o2 reaction merenyi et al 2010 at ph0 8 4 regardless of the presence of ic the benefit of combining o3 and uva in the elimination of oxal disappeared its oxidation rate being only slightly higher than for simple ozonation at ph0 3 5 since the increase on ph favors the decomposition of o3 into ho tomiyasu et al 1985 these results can be explained based on the influence of ph on carbonate equilibria eq 4 and the reactivity of the different species present hco3 co3 and oxal towards ho thus as the ph increases given the relative low reactivity of oxal see table s1 ho would mainly be consumed by hco3 co3 present or generated in the medium through reactions 5 and 6 garoma and gurol 2005 regarding systems that used tio2 fig 7b at ph0 3 5 in agreement with the results obtained by orge et al 2015 the efficacy of tio2 uva and pcoz was high and comparable almost complete disappearance of oxal in less than 30 min in this situation reactions occurring on the surface of the catalyst were mainly responsible for oxal oxidation at ph0 8 4 and no ic addition the efficiency of pcoz significantly decreased however the system still showed an important efficacy 55 oxal removal after 2 h likely due once again to the fast initial decrease of ph to neutral conditions fig s10 at ph0 8 4 and 30 mg l 1 ic ph remained constant in all cases fig s10 the conversion of oxal by pcoz was very low and coincided with that of o3 uva fig 7a according to all these results the pcoz system does not provide benefits in the degradation of oxal compared to tio2 uva at acidic conditions or o3 uva higher ph and alkalinity without observing any synergy between both systems 3 2 3 secondary effluent from a mwwtp the matrix effect on pcoz efficacy was assessed treating the se by the different systems the pcoz system was also applied to the alkalinity reduced se at ph0 7 5 and to the se at ph0 4 no ic fig 8 shows the evolution of the normalized doc concentration with time fig 8a and the concentration of carboxylic acids and removal of doc and absorbance at 254 nm a254nm after 2 h fig 8b the evolution of dissolved ozone and h2o2 concentrations in the ozonation tank during these runs is shown in fig s12 as seen in fig 8a in the unaltered se the effectiveness of o3 and o3 uva systems in doc reduction was similar uva exerting a slight improvement from 60 min 20 and 25 after 2 h at the ph of the se the decomposition of ozone into ho is expected to be relatively high in agreement with the low dissolved ozone concentration observed and favored by the presence of uva see fig s12a compared to ozone alone the much lower concentration of dissolved ozone in the tank during o3 uva would indicate that intermediates or species generated from the photolysis of se under uva contribute to ozone decomposition in the dark thus leading to a greater transformation of the efom however this effect was not sufficient to cause a significant effect on mineralization for the systems that used tio2 while in the unaltered se tio2 uva was totally ineffective in doc removal 40 of mineralization was achieved by pcoz after 2 h thus revealing a synergy between systems see later however according to fig s12a during o3 uva and pcoz the concentration of dissolved ozone in the ozonation tank and hence entering the photoreactor kept lower than 0 5 mg l 1 and evolved similarly tio2 barely causing any effect in o3 decomposition by pcoz decreasing the initial ph and alkalinity of se had a positive effect on doc removal by pcoz at ph0 8 2 25 mg l 1 ic ph0 7 5 6 mg l 1 of ic and ph0 4 no ic after 2 h the doc content was reduced by 40 48 and 80 respectively the fact that at ph0 7 5 ph phpzc and low ic the improvement was not significant slight positive effect from 60 min suggests that under these conditions the contribution of surface reactions to doc mineralization is still low and only the ho scavenging effect of hco3 co3 is reduced at ph0 4 that is ph phpzc and no ic the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of reaction intermediates by h is favored with a clear positive effect on doc removal from the beginning the higher efficiency of the process under acidic conditions results in lower ozone consumption per mg of doc mineralized hence after 2 h in the unaltered se 40 mineralization 13 mg o3 were consumed per mg doc eliminated 3 2 mol o3 mol doc removed whereas at ph0 4 80 mineralization ozone consumption was reduced to 4 mg o3 mg doc 1 mol o3 mol doc removed at ph0 7 5 the concentration of h2o2 in solution was 10 5 m much lower than at ph0 4 see fig s12b h2o2 being mainly formed from direct ozone reactions with the organic compounds present in se however considering the pka 11 6 of h2o2 in acidic conditions decomposition of o3 into ho caused by ho2 would be minimal merenyi et al 2010 as well as the contribution of h2o2 to ho from tio2 uva nosaka and nosaka 2016 as observed in fig 8b given the high reactivity of o3 towards aromatic rings with electron donor substituents von sonntag and von gunten 2012 all systems involving o3 were very effective in reducing aromaticity measured as a254nm for din content not shown regardless of the treatment and conditions applied no variation was observed in nnh4 nno3 content due to the negligible reactivity of nh4 towards ho and o3 hoigné and bader 1978 for the unaltered se after 2 h oxal was the most recalcitrant carboxylic acid in all the treatments applied contributing to 20 25 of residual doc in the case of ozone based processes a decrease in ph and alkalinity favored the oxidation of this acid by pcoz as expected at ph0 4 its contribution to final doc being less than 5 according to the results obtained and discussed in this study a clear synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva systems on doc removal has only been observed when treating the se which points to the composition of the matrix as responsible for this synergy to shed light on this matter fig 9 compares the evolution of doc and dissolved ozone in the tank that feeds the photoreactor during pcoz experiments performed with prm doc0 9 mg l 1 ph 8 4 30 mg l 1 ic in ultrapure water oxal doc0 7 mg l 1 ph0 8 4 30 mg l 1 ic in ultrapure water and se doc0 10 12 mg l 1 ph 8 2 25 mg l 1 ic working at same experimental conditions in all cases the concentration of h2o2 in the tank was very low 10 5 m not shown as seen in fig 9 for prm and se during the first 15 min the concentration of dissolved ozone in the tank was practically zero that is there is no ozone entering the photoreactor and no o3 uva or o3 tio2 uva interactions after this period the concentration of ozone increased but remained lower for se up to 0 5 mg l 1 after 2 h so o3 uva and o3 tio2 uva interactions would also be lower despite de above doc removal rate for se resulted higher than for prm and oxal these results could indicate that uva photolysis of efom leads to the generation of reactive entities that promote the decomposition of ozone into ho allowing a faster transformation of the se at the same time as this transformation progresses uva absorbance of se will decrease thus increasing the amount of radiation reaching the catalyst surface it is worth mentioning that some authors have reported an increase of tio2 activity when treated with gaseous o3 in the dark attributed to the generation of oh groups at the catalyst surface zhang et al 2019 in any case no evidence has been found of direct interactions between o3 uva and tio2 uva as responsible for the synergy observed in se finally to establish the efficacy of pcoz in the elimination of microcontaminants o3 and pcoz experiments were replicated in unaltered se spiked with caf prm and p cba 100 µg l 1 each all of them with low medium reactivity towards o3 and high and similar towards ho see table s1 evolution of pollutants concentration with time fig s13a reveals that for both systems the conversion rates followed the order of their reactivity with o3 considering the evolution of ozone in the inlet o3g in and outlet gas o3g out streams fig s13b the highest ozone consumption took place in the first 25 min of reaction a period in which the removal of contaminants by o3 or pcoz was practically complete during this period dissolved ozone entering the photoreactor was null up to 15 min or low 5 10 6 m see fig s12a which means once again that there are hardly any o3 uva or o3 tio2 uva interactions fig 10 shows the evolution of the normalized concentration of contaminants by o3 and pcoz versus tod doc0 during simple ozonation there is an initial period of negligible target compounds degradation attributed to the fast initial consumption of o3 by the matrix absence of dissolved ozone see fig s12a together with the lower generation of ho compared to pcoz the higher efficiency of pcoz is reflected in the amount of ozone that needs to be transferred to remove a given percentage of pollutants thus to reduce the concentration of the most refractory compounds by 90 1 75 mg o3 mg doc0 1 were required by pcoz while simple ozonation needed 2 5 mg o3 mg doc0 1 these values are in agreement although a bit lower with those reported by bertagna silva et al 2019 when applying o3 and pcoz 3 blb lamps 8 w each λmax 365 nm fluence rate 5 47 mw cm 2 to remove the pesticide acetamiprid acmp 100 µg l 1 from secondary effluents of similar characteristics ph 7 2 7 5 doc0 13 mg l 1 alkalinity 208 275 mg l 1 as caco3 however some differences can be highlighted thus until 50 of acmp removal the evolution of acmp vs tod doc0 for both o3 and pcoz was similar whereas in this work fig 10 clear differences were observed practically from the beginning the reason might rely on the effectiveness of high intensity uva leds in promoting se photolysis and ho and other reactive species generation much higher than for blb lamps 4 conclusions working with different matrices and ozone transferred doses in the range of those commonly applied in wwtp only when treating a real secondary effluent a synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva systems was observed no evidence of direct interactions between systems has been found which points to the composition of the matrix and its transformation along the treatment as responsible for this synergy in a real secondary effluent considering the ozone requirements pcoz using uva leds of high intensity could be an interesting strategy for the removal of micropollutants refractory to o3 but not for doc mineralization in addition the effective separation of catalyst particles after the treatment is the main issue to overcome hence new studies on pcoz should focus on the use of supported materials besides the following specific conclusions can be addressed at ph phpzc for compounds that do not adsorb onto the catalyst both o3 uva and tio2 uva individually contribute to their degradation in terms of doc mineralization the efficiency of tio2 uva is not affected by o3 being h the main species involved at these conditions no synergy or antagonism between systems is observed at ph phpzc the adsorption of organics with pka phpzc is not favored especially in presence of alkalinity doc mineralization by tio2 uva being low or null when combined with ozone pcoz both o3 uva and tio2 uva contribute to some extent to the formation of ho however only when a secondary effluent was treated a clear synergy between systems was deduced this synergy seems to depend on the composition of the water matrix rather than on a direct interaction between systems at the conditions applied

16539,numerous studies report on the synergy between ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation tio2 uva which could open the way to the application of photocatalytic ozonation pcoz in water treatment with the aim of establishing the existence of this synergy and its origin in this work using tio2 p25 365 nm uva leds and ozone transferred doses up to 5 mg mg doc0 1 doc0 7 10 mg l 1 a systematic study has been carried out featuring the effect of ph alkalinity and water matrix in each of the systems involved in pcoz with special attention to the role of organics adsorption onto tio2 in ultrapure water an increase in ph and carbonates content exerted a slight negative effect on the photocatalytic degradation of primidone low adsorption onto tio2 and mainly abated by free ho this effect being higher on its mineralization the negative effect of ph and alkalinity was much stronger for oxalic acid high tendency to adsorb and mainly oxidized by positive holes accordingly the results obtained at ph phpzc point of zero charge of the catalyst in ultrapure water cannot at all be extrapolated to secondary effluents since their composition negatively affects the photocatalytic performance at the experimental conditions applied only for the secondary effluent a synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva systems was observed this synergy would be related on the one hand to the generation from the matrix itself of reactive entities or intermediates that promote the decomposition of ozone into ho and on the other hand to an increase in catalyst activity as the matrix uva absorption decreases rather than from direct interactions between both systems despite de above ozone requirement to achieve a significant reduction of doc is high and would only be an interesting strategy for the elimination of ozone refractory micropollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalytic ozonation synergy high intensity uva leds water matrix micropollutants and doc removal 1 introduction 1 1 tio2 photoexcitation background photoexcitation of tio2 in water generates positive holes h and ho at the catalyst surface as well as o2 and h2o2 nosaka and nosaka 2016 2017 since the redox potential of positive holes and surface ho is practically the same nosaka and nosaka 2016 both will be referred as h in the present work surface ho can diffuse to the bulk hereafter denoted as free ho and when rutile phase is present as it is the case of tio2 p25 anatase rutile ratio 5 3 0 28 ohtani et al 2010 h2o2 could also improve the release of ho through the formation of a peroxo titanium complex and further cleavage of the oo bond by h contrary to the classical mechanism accepted the formation of ho from the reaction between h2o2 and e does not seem to be possible and must be disregarded nosaka and nosaka 2016 accordingly the amount of h generated at the surface is higher than that of ho in the liquid bulk 1 2 the role of the adsorption process on tio2 photocatalysis although any compound could react with free ho only those capable of being adsorbed on tio2 can interact with h implying that h is much more selective than free ho the adsorption of a given compound will depend on its structure and ionization state pka at the ph of the medium together with the phpzc of the catalyst point of zero charge the latter being 6 3 6 9 for tio2 p25 kosmulski 2009 rosal et al 2009 perez holmberg et al 2013 literature includes numerous studies supporting the efficiency of the tio2 uva system under acidic slightly acidic conditions that is ph phpzc for the degradation of model contaminants and their mineralization in ultrapure water beltrán et al 2008 rodríguez et al 2010 tong et al 2012 moreira et al 2015 rimoldi et al 2017 jallouli et al 2018 in many cases identifying ho and h as the main species responsible for the transformation of compounds with low or high tendency to be adsorbed on the catalyst respectively in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc mineralization if the conversion of final products carboxylic acids ketones and aldehydes of low molecular weight to co2 and h2o relies at least in part in their adsorption and further oxidation by h for final products with pka phpzc the mineralization efficiency will decrease at ph phpzc due to electrostatic repulsion the presence of carbonates bicarbonates alkalinity negatively affect doc removal due to their adsorption and occupation of active centers and possible decrease of phpzc farner budarz et al 2017 hence having in mind the typical composition and characteristics of secondary effluents se from municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp that is ph phpzc p25 and medium high alkalinity content in se the direct contribution of h to doc mineralization is expected to be minimal 1 3 agglomeration aggregation of catalyst particles during tio2 photocatalysis se composition could favor the agglomeration aggregation reversible irreversible of catalyst particles negatively affecting the diffusion of ho ivanova et al 2016 although the role of salts commonly present in se on the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency is controversial farner budarz et al 2017 reported that at ph 7 9 cl so4 and no3 present in se at relatively high concentrations have low or no tendency to be adsorbed on tio2 but even at concentrations as low as 0 5 mm these anions can cause the significant aggregation of tio2 particles decreasing the diffusion of ho to the liquid divalent cations as ca2 also favor the agglomeration aggregation of tio2 particles whereas organic matter seems to contribute to their stabilization zhang et al 2009 1 4 other effects of water matrix on tio2 photocatalysis although under 365 nm uva radiation the photolysis of common ions in se is not relevant the organic matter of the effluent efom can absorb radiation and generate reactive species lee et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 however the attenuation of uva radiation by the matrix can negatively affect the photoexcitation of the catalyst and hence the generation of h and free ho moreover depending on their concentration and reactivity all the organics inorganics present in se may act as ho sink brame et al 2015 farner budarz et al 2017 maghsoodi et al 2019 or compete for catalyst active sites diminishing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process 1 5 photocatalytic ozonation pcoz background compared to tio2 uva several studies report the higher efficiency of the o3 tio2 uva system photocatalytic ozonation pcoz both in the elimination of microcontaminants and reduction of doc during pcoz application micropollutants are degraded through different mechanisms such as molecular ozone attack direct indirect photolysis and reaction with h and or free ho free ho generated through ozone decomposition tio2 photoexcitation and even by efom photolysis is usually considered the main responsible for the degradation of ozone refractory compounds and doc elimination mehrjouei et al 2015 beltrán and rey 2017 mecha and chollom 2020 as for tio2 uva the nature of the contaminants and the characteristics of the water matrix are key parameters in pcoz efficiency thus working with model compounds in ultrapure water or without ph control usually ph sharply decreases due to carboxylic acids formation results in a process efficiency much higher than at higher ph especially in terms of doc mineralization beltrán et al 2008 márquez et al 2014 moreira et al 2016 jallouli et al 2018 lado ribeiro et al 2019 this influence of ph in pcoz could be related at least in part to an increase in the participation of h as the ph decreases and be misinterpreted as a synergy between systems the potential synergy should be validated respect to tio2 uva and o3 uva from experiments performed at the same conditions with special attention to ph 1 6 synergy in pcoz the synergy between simpler systems observed by different authors has been mainly attributed i to the role of ozone as scavenger of e at the catalyst surface allowing the generation of o3 and diminishing e h recombination mehrjouei et al 2015 fathinia et al 2016 beltrán and rey 2017 suligoj et al 2021 however although the reactivity of o3 towards e is twice that of o2 3 6 1010 m 1s 1 vs 1 9 1010 m 1s 1 bahnemann and hart 1982 buxton et al 1988 considering the much higher concentration of o2 in the feeding gas and the higher solubility of o2 e would be mainly captured by o2 to form o2 and ii to the reaction between o2 and o3 leading to o3 which seems more probable suligoj et al 2021 from experiments performed at ph 3 using p25 concluded that the lower the adsorption of the compound onto the catalyst the higher the synergy between systems and this synergy also increased with the o3 dose 1 7 objectives of the present work in wastewater treatment implementation of a tertiary advanced oxidation step may be needed for a safe discharge of the treated water and or its reuse in periods of drought or water shortage pcoz can be considered as one of these advanced processes provided the existence of a synergy between ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation in a previous work figueredo et al 2020 the application of pcoz on the degradation and mineralization of primidone prm as probe compound in ultrapure water was studied from the results obtained a mechanism was proposed and applied at specific conditions without considering the effect of matrix properties ph alkalinity etc the present work aims at identifying the existence of synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva on the elimination of pollutants and doc although doc reduction represents the importance of a full oxidation step which is not the objective in a real mwwtp this parameter can bring important information to clarify the existence of any synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva primidone was selected as probe compound as it has no tendency to adsorb onto tio2 or photolyze under uva oxalic acid oxal a carboxylic acid usually detected in the final stages of organic matter oxidation was also selected due to its high tendency to adsorb onto tio2 no uva absorption very low reactivity towards o3 and relatively low reactivity with ho aqueous solutions of both compounds and the secondary effluent from a mwwtp spiked in some cases with different micropollutants with low medium reactivity towards o3 prm caffeine caf and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba were treated by tio2 uva o3 o3 uva and o3 tio2 uva working at different ph and alkalinity content in an attempt to substantiate the effect of the operating parameters it was tried to correlate different phenomena occurring including adsorption agglomeration aggregation role of holes and free radicals etc to the potential synergy of the pcoz system specific objectives were to assess i the effect of experimental conditions and water matrix on the removal of target compounds and doc ii the species and mechanisms involved and iii the existence of synergies between systems and parameters governing the synergy extent 2 experimental 2 1 reagents all the reagents and eluents used in this work analytical grade and hplc gradient

milli q academic system darmstadt germany and pressurized oxygen purity 99 5 supplied by linde chemical structures pka values and apparent second order rate constant of the reaction of the selected compounds with ho and o3 are shown in table s1 supplementary information the secondary effluent se came from the secondary decanter of the mwwtp rincón de caya badajoz spain where a biological

experimental setup the experimental set up see fig s1 has been previously described figueredo et al 2020 briefly it consisted of an agitated tank borosilicate glass 1 3 l capacity magnetic stirring with inlets outlets for gasses and sampling the tank was initially filled with 1 l of the water to be treated and then pumped peristaltic pump ql 7 7 l h 1 to a tubular photoreactor borosilicate glass 50 cm long 2 8 cm internal diameter total volume 0 36 l in recirculation mode the tube was permanently covered by a stainless steel reflector as radiation source 6 leds lz4 04uv00 led engin 3 w radiant power each λmax 365 nm located under the glass tube were used using nitrite as actinometer a photon flux of 3 92 10 5 einstein l s 1 reaching the liquid was determined figueredo et al 2020 in a typical experiment using tio2 the whole installation was draped by aluminum foil the tank filled a sample taken and the catalyst added 10 500 mg l 1 then the stirring and pumping systems were turned on and the o2 stream qg 15 l h 1 fed to the tank through a glass diffuser after 30 min adsorption period in the dark a new sample was taken t 0 min the aluminum foil removed and the leds switched on then taking samples at different times a similar procedure was followed when ozone was used starting the o2 o3 bubbling in the ozonation tank qg 15 l h 1 and o3g in 10 mg l 1 once the photoreactor was filled single ozonation the leds were switched on photolytic ozonation o3 uva or after the adsorption period in the dark photocatalytic ozonation considering the gas flow rate the concentration of o3 in the gas inlet and outlet the reaction volume and the initial doc content the evolution of transferred ozone dose tod per unit of doc0 tod doc0 mg o3 mg doc0 1 was determined in all cases ozone transferred doses up to 5 mg o3 mg doc0 1 in 2 h were applied according to the installation design the concentration of ozone entering the photoreactor at a given time corresponds to the dissolved ozone present in the tank as will be seen later this configuration will be useful to determine the interactions between systems all the experiments were carried out at room temperature after 2 h total reaction time the increase in temperature was less than 2 c in experiments using prm caf and or pcba as probe compounds concentrated solutions were prepared in ultrapure water then adding the volume

reaction medium when needed some drops of concentrated naoh or hclo4 were added to correct the initial ph hclo4 was also used to remove inorganic carbon ic from se in experiments in ultrapure water in the presence of ic 30 mg l 1 ph was first corrected to 7 5 with naoh the required amount of nahco3 added and the ph corrected to ph 8 4 if needed 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of ozone in

4 kinetic data processing when the photocatalytic oxidation of an aqueous contaminant c mainly develops through its reaction with ho and additionally no direct photolysis occurs degradation kinetics can be modelled by a simple pseudo first order kinetics krýsa et al 2006 pseudo first order kinetics is far away from considering the actual mechanism but it is a useful tool for comparison purposes accordingly the following equation applies 1 ln c c 0 k obs c t where 2 k obs c k c ho h o ss in eq 1 kobs c stands for the observed pseudo first order rate constant s 1 kc ho is the second order rate constant of the reaction between the compound c and ho m 1 s 1 and ho ss represents the average molar concentration of hydroxyl radicals under steady state conditions if concentration data of c versus time and kc ho are known eqs 1 and 2 allow kobs c and ho ss to be determined these two parameters give a measure of the efficiency in ho generation as a function of the operating conditions applied similarly regardless of the species involved in the process h and or ho the mineralization of contaminants can also be assumed to follow pseudo first order kinetics this hypothesis is applicable when the adsorption stage in case it takes place follows the langmuir hinshelwood model and the doc content is sufficiently low krýsa et al 2006 3 ln doc doc 0 k obs doc t where doc is the concentration of doc and kobs doc the observed pseudo first order rate constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic oxidation using tio2 p25 and uva leds 3 1 1 primidone the role of free ho radicals in a first experimental series prm was used as a model compound in ultrapure water using different p25 doses under continuous bubbling of pure oxygen alkalinity and ph effects were also studied to understand the main features governing the process according to a previous work figueredo et al 2019 the initial photocatalytic transformation of prm in the presence of tio2 p25 is mainly caused by its reaction with free ho in addition as experimentally proven the photolysis of prm under 365 nm radiation provided by leds and its adsorption on tio2 are negligible fig 1 a shows kobs prm values obtained after fitting the experimental results to eq 1 and the stationary hydroxyl radical concentration ho ss eq 2 fig 1b displays the values of kobs doc eq 3 the fitting process is shown in figs s2 and s3 and ph evolution in fig s4 at ph0 6 ph gradually decreased to 4 7 after 2 h fig s4 as inferred from fig 1a an increase in tio2 load from 10 to 250 mg l 1 led to an exponential increase in free ho production with estimated ho ss and kobs prm values ranging from 5 10 14 m to 2 5 10 13 m and from 0 017 min 1 to 0 100 min 1 respectively no further improvement at higher tio2 doses was experienced at the experimental conditions applied from prm initial removal rates that is assuming there is no ho consumption by intermediates a maximum apparent efficiency of 0 002 mol ho einstein 1 was estimated the optimal catalyst dose in ultrapure water being in the proximity of 100 mg l 1 see text s2 regarding mineralization fig 1b at ph0 6 catalyst doses from 10 to 250 mg l 1 led to kobs doc from 0 0017 min 1 to 0 025 min 1 doc reduction ranging from 20 to 95 after 2 h fig s3 again there was no further improvement in kobs doc at higher titania doses according to the values shown in fig 1a and b at ph0 6 the ratio kobs doc kobs prm increased with the catalyst dose from 0 1 10 mg l 1 to 0 23 250 500 mg l 1 hence the positive effect of the amount of catalyst is higher in prm mineralization than in its initial transformation which suggests the development of different oxidation mechanisms compared to measurements conducted at ph0 6 with 100 mg l 1 of tio2 an increase of initial ph to 8 4 led to a decrease in kobs prm of roughly 15 in the absence of ic and 35 when 30 mg l 1 of ic were added since the effect of prm speciation can be disregarded prm pka 11 5 the slight negative effect of ph and alkalinity in ho ss would be related to the influence of both parameters in the agglomeration aggregation of p25 particles autin et al 2013 jefferson et al 2016 li et al 2016 wang 2017 and or occupation of active sites by carbonates bicarbonates additionally alkalinity may act as ho scavenger consequence of the following equilibria and reactions buxton and elliot 1986 real et al 2009 4 h 2 c o 3 pka 6 34 h hco 3 pka 10 37 2 h co 3 5 hco 3 h o k 8 5 x 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 co 3 h 2 o 6 co 3 h o k 4 2 x 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 co 3 o h 7 prm h o k 6 7 x 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 intermediate according to equilibria 4 at ph0 8 4 ic is mainly present as hco3 considering the initial concentrations of prm and hco3 together with the values of the second order rate constant of their reaction with ho approximately 95 of ho should be captured by prm so the scavenging effect of hco3 on kobs prm would be negligible the increase of the initial ph from 6 to 8 4 also caused a reduction of 22 in kobs doc similar to the 15 decrease in kobs prm the negative effect of ph was significantly amplified in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ic with a kobs doc reduction of 75 twice that of kobs prm 35 the fact that the effect of alkalinity is more pronounced in prm mineralization than in its initial transformation suggests either the refractory character of some of the intermediates towards ho not being able to compete with hco3 and or again that the species involved in both processes differ thus given the high tendency of carbonates bicarbonates to adsorb onto tio2 dolamic and bürgi 2007 farner budarz et al 2017 they could inhibit decrease the development of oxidation reactions involving h and their contribution to mineralization fig 2 a shows the generation evolution of some low molecular weight carboxylic acids and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in solution i e nnh4 and nno3 nno2 remained below the lod for runs at ph0 6 after reaching different doc conversions as observed formic for oxalic oxal and acetic ace acids were the main carboxylic acids detected after an initial increase acids concentration gradually decreased with doc conversion while din increased mainly in the form of nnh4 see also text s3 the low conversion of nnh4 to nno3 would be the result of its low adsorption onto tio2 absence of oxidation by h and low reactivity towards free ho buxton et al 1988 bonsen et al 1997 zhu et al 2005 huang et al 2008 fig 2b shows the influence of ph and alkalinity on the concentration of low molecular weight carboxylic acids and din in solution after reaching 35 40 doc removal compared to the run at ph0 6 no ic the results clearly reveal the high accumulation of oxal in solution when the initial ph was set at 8 4 and 30 mg l 1 of ic were added 3 1 2 oxalic acid the role of holes in view of the previous results a series of oxal photocatalytic oxidation experiments was completed oxal pka1 1 25 and pka2 4 27 mendive et al 2007 presents relatively low reactivity towards ho see table s1 and high tendency to be adsorbed onto tio2 forming mono and bidentate surface complexes hug and sulzberger 1994 weisz et al 2002 park et al 2006 mendive et al 2007 the reaction of oxal with h is accepted to be the principal photocatalytic pathway under uv radiation krýsa et al 2006 schneider et al 2020 leading to co2 and co2 the latter evolving to co2 and o2 ho2 in the presence of dissolved o2 krýsa et al 2006 as a consequence oxal is directly converted to co2 and or bicarbonate carbonate depending on ph so kobs oxal and kobs doc values are the same given the high oxal capability of adsorption and reaction with h the specialized bibliography includes numerous works in which oxal is used as a h scavenger kominami et al 2001 rodríguez et al 2015 schneider et al 2020 tests were carried out in ultrapure water with initial ph fixed at 3 5 6 and 8 4 in the latter case the influence of ic addition was also investigated to determine the possible participation of free ho in the degradation of oxal experiments were also performed in the presence of tbuoh 0 1 m alcohol concentration high enough to scavenge ho ktbuohho 6 2 108 m 1 s 1 alam et al 2003 due to tbuoh low adsorption and capacity to act as electron donor h generation should not be affected kim et al 2014 burek et al 2019 fig 3 a shows the evolution of the normalized concentration of oxal with time solid lines are fitting to eq 1 and fig 3b the ph variation in all cases the amount of oxal adsorbed onto tio2 after an initial period of 30 min in the dark was undetectable in line with the adsorption isotherm determined by ivanova et al 2016 at ph 3 7 and 25 c predicted oxal adsorbed 6 μm under the conditions tested the concentration of h2o2 in solution was below 5 10 6 m not shown at ph0 3 5 and as reported in the literature kosanić 1998 orge et al 2015 oxal elimination rate was significantly high kobs oxal 0 07 min 1 being fully converted in less than 30 min fig 3a at this ph the surface of the catalyst is positively charged and oxal mainly on its monoprotonated form see speciation in fig s5 so the adsorption of oxal and its h oxidation is favored since the presence of 0 1 m tbuoh at ph0 3 5 had no effect on oxal elimination the participation of free ho can be ruled out at ph0 6 kobs oxal 0 0071 min 1 r2 0 98 the attraction between oxal and the tio2 surface is still favored however as the reaction progresses the accumulation of hco3 co3 leads to a ph increase fig 3b called causticization by wang and adesina 1997 and the net positive charge of the catalyst decreases therefore the electrostatic attraction between oxal tio2 p25 diminishes resulting in lower adsorption a further rise of initial ph to 8 4 oxal present as c2o4 kobs oxal 0 0026 min 1 r2 0 98 results in a low initial degradation followed by a slight increase due to the ph drop to 7 5 at ph 8 4 the addition of 30 mg l 1 of ic implied no oxal conversion after 2 h absence of mineralization is attributable to the occupation of active adsorption centers by hco3 co3 together with the role of ic as ho scavenger in summary from fig 3 it is deduced that both ph and ic content have a strong negative impact on oxal degradation by tio2 uva surprisingly at ph0 phpzc presence of 0 1 m tbuoh favored the elimination of oxal effect that was significantly reduced in the presence of 30 mg l 1 of ic since the presence of tbuoh did not practically affect the evolution of ph fig 3b these results indicate that 0 1 m tbuoh enhanced somehow oxal degradation it is hypothesized that as the ph increases and the adsorption of oxal decreases given the high concentration of the alcohol a small amount of tbuoh can be adsorbed and oxidized at the catalyst surface oxidation by free hydroxyl radicals is not discarded leading to radical species capable of degrading oxal the mechanism should be similar to that proposed by cederbaum et al 1983 based on the formation of the hydroxyalkyl or alkoxyl radicals the spontaneous fission of the latter would lead to the methyl radical which can attack a suitable electron donor or combine with oxygen to generate the methyl peroxy radical any of these species could react with oxal in the presence of ic adsorption of tbuoh would be reduced unlike oxal prm mineralization requires previous oxidation steps however if kobs doc values of prm fig 1b and oxal fig 3a are compared for experiments at ph0 8 4 prm is more efficiently mineralized than oxal in absence presence of ic this means that the oxidation mineralization of low molecular weight intermediates other than oxal formed during prm photocatalytic degradation depends to a lesser extent on h due to their higher reactivity with free ho or even with the co3 generated from reactions 5 and 6 this is for example the case of for pka 3 74 kho hco2 3 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 kfor co3 1 1 105 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 that is oxidized to co2 and o2 ho2 yapsakli and can 2004 attending to the results obtained working with prm and oxal at ph phpzc the efficiency of the tio2 uva system in doc removal will be low especially in the presence of alkalinity due to the low contribution of h having in mind the importance of the adsorption process in the photocatalytic mechanism a secondary effluent from a mwwtp was next considered a priori given the characteristics of these effluents free ho is expected to be the main species involved in the oxidation and mineralization of the efom by this system 3 1 3 secondary effluent from a mwwtp influence of the water matrix tio2 uva system was applied to treat the se from a mwwtp see table s1 doped with 100 µg l 1 of prm and caf as representative of micropollutants like prm caf photocatalytic degradation is mainly caused by reaction with free ho dalmázio et al 2005 chuang et al 2011 kcaf ho being 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 shi et al 1991 another experiment was conducted under similar conditions previously eliminating the ic content by successive changes in ph a first acidification stage led to ic removal and partial solubilization of suspended organic carbon increase of doc0 from 10 to 12 mg l 1 whereas the subsequent rise of ph led to an increase of 6 mg l 1 of residual ic due to co2 absorption regardless of the ic content the ph of the effluent remained virtually constant along the treatment fig 4 compares the values of kobs doc for se see variation of normalized doc over time and fittings to eq 3 in fig s6 with those corresponding to prm and oxal in ultrapure water under similar conditions the evolution of the normalized concentration of spiked prm and caf throughout se photocatalytic treatment without with ic removal is shown in fig 4b as observed in fig 4a after 2 h se mineralization was negligible in fact a slight increase in doc over time could be likely due to the solubilization of suspended matter fig s6 the reduction of ic0 content in se had a slight positive effect on doc removal 12 after 2 h and carboxylic acid generation see fig s7a due to the ph and ic content of the se the contribution of surface reactions to the oxidation of organics would be minimal besides the agglomeration aggregation of the catalyst in se would be much higher than in ultrapure water lowering the amount of ho that diffuses into the bulk regarding the evolution of the normalized concentration of prm and caf fig 4b their profiles were similar regardless of the specific compound and ic content reaching 50 conversion after 2 h this means that ic did not alter the production of ho nor competes with the micropollutants for ho or this was balanced by the formation of co3 wojnárovits et al 2020 fitting of experimental data to eq 1 lead to an average value of 0 008 min 1 for kobs c a sixth fold decrease if compared to the value of 0 05 min 1 obtained for prm in ultrapure water at similar conditions hence organics and inorganics other than hco3 co3 present in se are responsible for the low ho ss by acting as ho sink and or lowering ho diffusion due to the agglomeration aggregation of the catalyst the latter phenomena have been reported in the presence ca2 zhang et al 2009 cl so4 and no3 farner budarz et al 2017 at concentration levels similar to those commonly found in mwwtp se from the above results the optimal catalyst dose in se is probably higher than in ultrapure water thus when 100 and 500 mg l 1 of tio2 were used although in both cases there was no doc removal after 2 h a clear increase in the formation rate of carboxylic acids in solution was observed for the highest catalyst dose fig s7b in any case it could be deduced by the results that the application of tio2 uva system in ultrapure water using probe compounds cannot be extrapolated at all to actual secondary effluents 3 2 photocatalytic ozonation using tio2 p25 and uva leds to determine the influence of water matrix characteristics on the effectiveness of pcoz technology and the potential existence of synergism between systems a similar study was carried out by applying o3 o3 uva and o3 tio2 uva 3 2 1 primidone ozone based systems were applied to degrade prm in ultrapure water ph0 6 pcoz was carried out also at ph0 8 4 in the absence presence of ic during pcoz at ph0 8 4 and no ic the quick formation of acidic compounds and the lack of buffering capacity led to a fast ph decrease so the results obtained were practically identical to those registered at ph0 6 not shown this reflects the importance of this parameter when trying to determine the existence of real synergies between systems fig 5 shows kobs prm fig 5a and kobs doc fig 5b values obtained after fitting the data to simplistic pseudo first order kinetics see fig s8 for comparison purposes data corresponding to the tio2 uva system are also included in fig 5a and fig 5b dotted lines correspond to the sum of kobs values corresponding to o3 uva and tio2 uva fig 5c compares the evolution of prm doc and dissolved ozone concentrations in the ozonation tank during pcoz tests performed at ph0 6 no ic and 8 4 30 mg l 1 of ic the evolution of ph during all these runs is shown in fig s9 although the reactivity of prm with ozone is relatively low kprm o3 3 m 1 s 1 figueredo et al 2019 the degradation of prm by o3 occurs through reaction with ho generated from ozone decomposition promoted by prm itself figueredo et al 2019 therefore as seen in fig 5a under slightly acidic conditions the efficiency of o3 and o3 uva systems was high and similar with 90 prm converted in less than 20 min values of kobs prm from pcoz coincided with the sum of contributions from o3 uva and tio2 uva systems regardless of tio2 dose so no synergy or antagonism is envisaged as for tio2 uva the influence of ph and alkalinity on kobs prm by pcoz was low fig 5a in terms of mineralization fig 5b at ph0 6 the effectiveness of simple ozonation was very low 10 doc removal after 2 h the ozone recalcitrance of carboxylic acids ketones and aldehydes of low molecular weight von sonntag and von gunten 2012 makes necessary the participation of species with higher oxidizing potential such as ho since at ph0 6 the decomposition of o3 into ho was mainly favored by prm and in addition ph decreased with time fig s9 once prm was eliminated the generation of ho diminished in the case of the o3 uva system despite the low absorbance of o3 h2o complexes at 365 nm axson et al 2011 the use of high intensity leds favors the generation of ho by photolysis of o3 figueredo et al 2020 and this is clearly reflected in mineralization 32 doc removal after 2 h as discussed later section 3 2 2 at these conditions oxal formed during prm oxidation by o3 uva can improve the decomposition of o3 into ho also enhanced by other intermediates as it is the case of for yapsakli and can 2004 at ph0 6 kobs doc values of tio2 uva and pcoz were similar at any tio2 dose small differences correspond to the contribution to kobs doc of o3 uva fig 5b again it is demonstrated no synergy between systems h being the main responsible of prm mineralization by pcoz at ph phpzc the effect of ph and alkalinity on doc reduction by pcoz was significant thus at ph 8 4 and 30 mg l 1 ic after an initial evolution up to 15 min close to that experienced at ph0 6 fig 5c the elimination rate of doc slowed down to kobs doc 0 003 min 1 value similar to the tio2 uva system fig 1b and ten times lower than pcoz at ph0 6 fig 5b during the first 15 min regardless of the ph as observed in fig 5c the concentration of ozone in the tank that fed the photoreactor was virtually zero this means that during this period oxidant species are mainly generated by the decomposition of o3 in the dark favored by ph and the presence of prm and the photoexcitation of tio2 in the photoreactor with no o3 uva or o3 tio2 uva interactions after this period the concentration of dissolved ozone in the tank and therefore entering the photoreactor increased evolving similarly at ph0 6 and 8 4 30 mg l 1 ic however since at ph0 8 4 almost no mineralization was attained under these conditions it is suggested that in addition to the null contribution of h and the ho scavenging effect of ic the contribution of o2 generated from the reaction between electrons and dissolved o2 at the catalyst surface to the decomposition of o3 into ho basis of the synergism between these systems does not seem relevant fig 6 shows the concentration of carboxylic acids after 2 h at ph0 6 simple ozonation resulted in low carboxylic acids formation consequence of the low reactivity of o3 towards prm intermediates and low o3 decomposition into ho once prm was degraded due to the ability of uva to decompose o3 into ho the o3 uva system led to a higher formation of carboxylic acids identifying oxal as the predominant when tio2 was present regardless of the presence of ozone tio2 uva and pcoz systems at ph0 6 participation of h allowed almost complete mineralization and the accumulation of carboxylic acids was significantly reduced on the contrary during pcoz at ph0 8 4 30 mg l 1 of ic oxal accumulated in the reaction media due to the inhibition of reactions at the catalyst surface and because its low reactivity towards o3 and ho again surface reactions are less decisive in the case of other carboxylic acids due to their much higher reactivity with ho or even co3 however at ph0 8 4 30 mg l 1 of ic after 2 h only 35 of doc in solution was in the form of carboxylic acids 25 of doc as oxal which means that there must be other intermediates final products whose degradation by pcoz is also adversely affected by increased ph and or alkalinity 3 2 2 oxalic acid additional experiments were carried out by applying the different systems in the degradation of oxal in ultrapure water two ph were tested 3 5 and 8 4 in the latter case with without 30 mg l 1 of ic the evolution of the normalized remaining concentration of oxal with time is shown in fig 7 and the evolution of ph in fig s10 as seen in fig 7a o3 and o3 uva systems at ph0 3 5 the elimination of oxal by simple ozonation was low 20 after 2 h due to the low value of koxal o3 0 04 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 and low decomposition of o3 into ho at these conditions combination of ozone with uva o3 uva had a significant positive effect on oxal elimination 95 after 2 h as moreira et al 2016 also reported on one hand the high radiation intensity of 365 nm given by the leds favors the decomposition of o3 into ho as inferred from fig s11 that shows the evolution of dissolved ozone in the ozonation tank throughout the experiments thus allowing the oxidation of a fraction of oxal with concomitant formation of co2 that evolves to co2 and o2 on the other hand the superoxide radical propagates o3 decomposition to finally yield ho garoma and gurol 2005 vecitis et al 2010 concentration of h2o2 in solution was negligible 5 10 6 m not shown in any case under acidic conditions the higher efficiency of o3 uva compared to o3 cannot be associated to the o3 h2o2 reaction merenyi et al 2010 at ph0 8 4 regardless of the presence of ic the benefit of combining o3 and uva in the elimination of oxal disappeared its oxidation rate being only slightly higher than for simple ozonation at ph0 3 5 since the increase on ph favors the decomposition of o3 into ho tomiyasu et al 1985 these results can be explained based on the influence of ph on carbonate equilibria eq 4 and the reactivity of the different species present hco3 co3 and oxal towards ho thus as the ph increases given the relative low reactivity of oxal see table s1 ho would mainly be consumed by hco3 co3 present or generated in the medium through reactions 5 and 6 garoma and gurol 2005 regarding systems that used tio2 fig 7b at ph0 3 5 in agreement with the results obtained by orge et al 2015 the efficacy of tio2 uva and pcoz was high and comparable almost complete disappearance of oxal in less than 30 min in this situation reactions occurring on the surface of the catalyst were mainly responsible for oxal oxidation at ph0 8 4 and no ic addition the efficiency of pcoz significantly decreased however the system still showed an important efficacy 55 oxal removal after 2 h likely due once again to the fast initial decrease of ph to neutral conditions fig s10 at ph0 8 4 and 30 mg l 1 ic ph remained constant in all cases fig s10 the conversion of oxal by pcoz was very low and coincided with that of o3 uva fig 7a according to all these results the pcoz system does not provide benefits in the degradation of oxal compared to tio2 uva at acidic conditions or o3 uva higher ph and alkalinity without observing any synergy between both systems 3 2 3 secondary effluent from a mwwtp the matrix effect on pcoz efficacy was assessed treating the se by the different systems the pcoz system was also applied to the alkalinity reduced se at ph0 7 5 and to the se at ph0 4 no ic fig 8 shows the evolution of the normalized doc concentration with time fig 8a and the concentration of carboxylic acids and removal of doc and absorbance at 254 nm a254nm after 2 h fig 8b the evolution of dissolved ozone and h2o2 concentrations in the ozonation tank during these runs is shown in fig s12 as seen in fig 8a in the unaltered se the effectiveness of o3 and o3 uva systems in doc reduction was similar uva exerting a slight improvement from 60 min 20 and 25 after 2 h at the ph of the se the decomposition of ozone into ho is expected to be relatively high in agreement with the low dissolved ozone concentration observed and favored by the presence of uva see fig s12a compared to ozone alone the much lower concentration of dissolved ozone in the tank during o3 uva would indicate that intermediates or species generated from the photolysis of se under uva contribute to ozone decomposition in the dark thus leading to a greater transformation of the efom however this effect was not sufficient to cause a significant effect on mineralization for the systems that used tio2 while in the unaltered se tio2 uva was totally ineffective in doc removal 40 of mineralization was achieved by pcoz after 2 h thus revealing a synergy between systems see later however according to fig s12a during o3 uva and pcoz the concentration of dissolved ozone in the ozonation tank and hence entering the photoreactor kept lower than 0 5 mg l 1 and evolved similarly tio2 barely causing any effect in o3 decomposition by pcoz decreasing the initial ph and alkalinity of se had a positive effect on doc removal by pcoz at ph0 8 2 25 mg l 1 ic ph0 7 5 6 mg l 1 of ic and ph0 4 no ic after 2 h the doc content was reduced by 40 48 and 80 respectively the fact that at ph0 7 5 ph phpzc and low ic the improvement was not significant slight positive effect from 60 min suggests that under these conditions the contribution of surface reactions to doc mineralization is still low and only the ho scavenging effect of hco3 co3 is reduced at ph0 4 that is ph phpzc and no ic the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of reaction intermediates by h is favored with a clear positive effect on doc removal from the beginning the higher efficiency of the process under acidic conditions results in lower ozone consumption per mg of doc mineralized hence after 2 h in the unaltered se 40 mineralization 13 mg o3 were consumed per mg doc eliminated 3 2 mol o3 mol doc removed whereas at ph0 4 80 mineralization ozone consumption was reduced to 4 mg o3 mg doc 1 mol o3 mol doc removed at ph0 7 5 the concentration of h2o2 in solution was 10 5 m much lower than at ph0 4 see fig s12b h2o2 being mainly formed from direct ozone reactions with the organic compounds present in se however considering the pka 11 6 of h2o2 in acidic conditions decomposition of o3 into ho caused by ho2 would be minimal merenyi et al 2010 as well as the contribution of h2o2 to ho from tio2 uva nosaka and nosaka 2016 as observed in fig 8b given the high reactivity of o3 towards aromatic rings with electron donor substituents von sonntag and von gunten 2012 all systems involving o3 were very effective in reducing aromaticity measured as a254nm for din content not shown regardless of the treatment and conditions applied no variation was observed in nnh4 nno3 content due to the negligible reactivity of nh4 towards ho and o3 hoigné and bader 1978 for the unaltered se after 2 h oxal was the most recalcitrant carboxylic acid in all the treatments applied contributing to 20 25 of residual doc in the case of ozone based processes a decrease in ph and alkalinity favored the oxidation of this acid by pcoz as expected at ph0 4 its contribution to final doc being less than 5 according to the results obtained and discussed in this study a clear synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva systems on doc removal has only been observed when treating the se which points to the composition of the matrix as responsible for this synergy to shed light on this matter fig 9 compares the evolution of doc and dissolved ozone in the tank that feeds the photoreactor during pcoz experiments performed with prm doc0 9 mg l 1 ph 8 4 30 mg l 1 ic in ultrapure water oxal doc0 7 mg l 1 ph0 8 4 30 mg l 1 ic in ultrapure water and se doc0 10 12 mg l 1 ph 8 2 25 mg l 1 ic working at same experimental conditions in all cases the concentration of h2o2 in the tank was very low 10 5 m not shown as seen in fig 9 for prm and se during the first 15 min the concentration of dissolved ozone in the tank was practically zero that is there is no ozone entering the photoreactor and no o3 uva or o3 tio2 uva interactions after this period the concentration of ozone increased but remained lower for se up to 0 5 mg l 1 after 2 h so o3 uva and o3 tio2 uva interactions would also be lower despite de above doc removal rate for se resulted higher than for prm and oxal these results could indicate that uva photolysis of efom leads to the generation of reactive entities that promote the decomposition of ozone into ho allowing a faster transformation of the se at the same time as this transformation progresses uva absorbance of se will decrease thus increasing the amount of radiation reaching the catalyst surface it is worth mentioning that some authors have reported an increase of tio2 activity when treated with gaseous o3 in the dark attributed to the generation of oh groups at the catalyst surface zhang et al 2019 in any case no evidence has been found of direct interactions between o3 uva and tio2 uva as responsible for the synergy observed in se finally to establish the efficacy of pcoz in the elimination of microcontaminants o3 and pcoz experiments were replicated in unaltered se spiked with caf prm and p cba 100 µg l 1 each all of them with low medium reactivity towards o3 and high and similar towards ho see table s1 evolution of pollutants concentration with time fig s13a reveals that for both systems the conversion rates followed the order of their reactivity with o3 considering the evolution of ozone in the inlet o3g in and outlet gas o3g out streams fig s13b the highest ozone consumption took place in the first 25 min of reaction a period in which the removal of contaminants by o3 or pcoz was practically complete during this period dissolved ozone entering the photoreactor was null up to 15 min or low 5 10 6 m see fig s12a which means once again that there are hardly any o3 uva or o3 tio2 uva interactions fig 10 shows the evolution of the normalized concentration of contaminants by o3 and pcoz versus tod doc0 during simple ozonation there is an initial period of negligible target compounds degradation attributed to the fast initial consumption of o3 by the matrix absence of dissolved ozone see fig s12a together with the lower generation of ho compared to pcoz the higher efficiency of pcoz is reflected in the amount of ozone that needs to be transferred to remove a given percentage of pollutants thus to reduce the concentration of the most refractory compounds by 90 1 75 mg o3 mg doc0 1 were required by pcoz while simple ozonation needed 2 5 mg o3 mg doc0 1 these values are in agreement although a bit lower with those reported by bertagna silva et al 2019 when applying o3 and pcoz 3 blb lamps 8 w each λmax 365 nm fluence rate 5 47 mw cm 2 to remove the pesticide acetamiprid acmp 100 µg l 1 from secondary effluents of similar characteristics ph 7 2 7 5 doc0 13 mg l 1 alkalinity 208 275 mg l 1 as caco3 however some differences can be highlighted thus until 50 of acmp removal the evolution of acmp vs tod doc0 for both o3 and pcoz was similar whereas in this work fig 10 clear differences were observed practically from the beginning the reason might rely on the effectiveness of high intensity uva leds in promoting se photolysis and ho and other reactive species generation much higher than for blb lamps 4 conclusions working with different matrices and ozone transferred doses in the range of those commonly applied in wwtp only when treating a real secondary effluent a synergy between o3 uva and tio2 uva systems was observed no evidence of direct interactions between systems has been found which points to the composition of the matrix and its transformation along the treatment as responsible for this synergy in a real secondary effluent considering the ozone requirements pcoz using uva leds of high intensity could be an interesting strategy for the removal of micropollutants refractory to o3 but not for doc mineralization in addition the effective separation of catalyst particles after the treatment is the main issue to overcome hence new studies on pcoz should focus on the use of supported materials besides the following specific conclusions can be addressed at ph phpzc for compounds that do not adsorb onto the catalyst both o3 uva and tio2 uva individually contribute to their degradation in terms of doc mineralization the efficiency of tio2 uva is not affected by o3 being h the main species involved at these conditions no synergy or antagonism between systems is observed at ph phpzc the adsorption of organics with pka phpzc is not favored especially in presence of alkalinity doc mineralization by tio2 uva being low or null when combined with ozone pcoz both o3 uva and tio2 uva contribute to some extent to the formation of ho however only when a secondary effluent was treated a clear synergy between systems was deduced this synergy seems to depend on the composition of the water matrix rather than on a direct interaction between systems at the conditions applied
