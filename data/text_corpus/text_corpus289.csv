1445,laboratory scale column experiments were carried out to assess the influence of water infiltration on pooled light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl redistribution in porous media a simplified image analysis method siam was used to evaluate the saturation distributions of the lnapl and water in the entire domain under dynamic conditions the experiments were conducted for high low lnapl volumes lnapl volumes differentiated as low and high volumes high resolution siam images of the soil column during lnapl migration and water infiltration events were captured and analyzed results indicated that the capillary fringe is about 6 7 cm which was consistent with the capillary height derived from empirical equations moreover siam provided an estimate of the field capacity 30 of the sand once the lnapl infiltration stage was started the lnapl was observed to rapidly migrate through the vadose zone for the case of large lnapl volume the lnapl penetrated further into capillary fringe zone analysis of siam images showed that the lnapl redistribution was observed to vary significantly with the rate of infiltration for higher water infiltration intensity the injected water exerted a larger hydrodynamic force on the entrapped lnapl forcing it move further downward into the capillary zone and the saturated zone overall this study demonstrated that the siam technique is an accurate and cost effective tool for the visualization of the time dependent napl water movement in laboratory scale experiments and dynamic changes in fluid saturation in porous media keywords lnapl simplified image analysis infiltration porous media fluid saturation 1 introduction groundwater and soil contamination due to organic compounds in the form of non aqueous phase liquids napls is a widespread environmental problem abriola 1989 pankow and cherry 1996 costanza robinson and brusseau 2002 agaoglu et al 2015 alazaiza et al 2019 these contaminants have adverse impact on the quality of groundwater making it unsuitable for human use and irrigation purposes huling and weaver 1991 many napls are immiscible with water due to their low aqueous solubility as a result they can persist for many years leading to the contamination of huge parts of groundwater alazaiza et al 2018 it is difficult to predict the behavior of napls in porous media especially in the vadose zone due to the complex nature of the water air napl multiphase system in general napls can be classified as light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls and dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls depending on their density relative to that of water the most common examples of dnapl are chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene while petroleum compounds such as benzene toluene and xylene btex are commonly encountered examples of lnapl ngien et al 2012 jawitz et al 2000 when a napl is released into the subsurface lnapls migrate downward through the unsaturated soil due to gravity leaving small ganglia along their path pankow and cherry 1996 because of the large contrast in the density of lnapls relative to air the vadose zone offers little resistance to the lnapl allowing it to reach and accumulate on top of the water table dnapls on the other hand can enter the saturated zone once the entry pressure is exceeded and continue their downward migration in the saturated zone due to their density which is higher than that of water until some hydraulic or capillary barrier is encountered huling and weaver 1991 it is important to understand the behavior of napls fate and transport in subsurface systems for defining napl source zone geometries as well as in the design and evaluation of remediation schemes sale and newell 2010 engelmann et al 2019 several studies have demonstrated that napl migration in the subsurface is influenced by complex mechanisms that are controlled by numerous factors including the viscosity density saturation immiscibility capillary pressure wettability polar nature of the napl and the permeability porosity pore size distribution and surface properties of the porous medium jawitz et al 2003 lemke et al 2004 akgoze aydin et al 2011 kokkinaki et al 2013 akyol et al 2013 alazaiza et al 2017a karaoglu et al 2019 alazaiza et al 2020a numerous researchers have carried out experimental studies to investigate the behavior of immiscible fluids in soils alazaiza et al 2018 belfort et al 2017 bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 different non invasive techniques such as gamma ray x ray attenuation and electrical conductivity probes have been used for monitoring fluid properties and movement in soil and groundwater kamon et al 2003 tuck et al 1998 tidwell and glass 1994 although these studies have provided valuable data on the fate and transport of napls in porous media thay are assocaited with some limitations most notable they do not allow the observation of fluids migration under dynamic conditions and for the entire domain of interest alazaiza et al 2017b in light of the aformentioned limitations image analysis methods such as light transmission visualization light reflection method spectal image analysis method and simplified image analysis method have gained more attention of researchers alazaiza et al 2020b zheng et al 2015 bob et al 2008 a recent study by alazaiza et al 2015 reviewed the application of the image analysis methods to napl experiments and demonstrated that these methods are viable methods for quantifying napl migration and saturation particularly in laboratory settings as noted above napls released into the subsurface environment can persist for very long periods of time while the napl can remain entrapped in the soil as a result of the capillary forces it can undergo some redistribution that can impact its fate and transport in the vadose zone water percolation into the subsurface can influence the migration of entrapped napl ganglia as well as the napl mass accumulated on the water table alazaiza et al 2019 conducted a 2 d experimental study to observe the influence of rainfall on the migration of lnapl in double porosity soil structure the authors reported that water table fluctuations caused the lnapl that was entrapped in the porous media to be pushed further downward in addition they observed that the capillary fringe thickness was depressed due to the influence of both infiltration and lnapl volume kamaruddin 2012 conducted an experimental study to assess the influence of rainfall on the migration of lnapl in silica sand the author reported that rainfall recharge influenced the lnapl migration and caused it to moved downward in addition the results also showed that the rainfall recharge could significantly reduce the residual lnapl saturation at the upper part of the capillary interface alazaiza et al 2020b applied the simplified image analysis method siam to investigate the saturation distributions of the lnapl and water in the entire domain the influence of water table fluctuations the authors concluded that the siam technique is an accurate and cost effective tool for the visualization of the time dependent napl water movement in laboratory scale experiments and quantifying dynamic changes in fluid saturation in porous media the present study aims to investigate the influence of infiltration on lnapl entrapped in silica sand using siam specifically siam is used to generate detailed time dependent saturation maps for water and lnapl for a range of experimental conditions diesel was used as a representative of lnapl the study examines the impact of lnapl volume and infiltration rate on lnapl spatial distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characteristic a natural sand collected from a river in pulau pinang malaysia was used as the porous media particle size analysis indicated that the pore grain size varied between 0 3 mm and 1 18 mm with an average size of 0 67 mm a commercial diesel fuel was used to represent the lnapl the density of the diesel was 0 83 g cm3 and the viscosity at 20 c was 5 8 mm2 s the thermal expansion coefficient was 88 kg m3 flash point at 62 c and vapor pressure was 10 kpa at 15 c yilmaz et al 2010 for better visualization the lnapl was mixed with red sudan iii dye while water was dyed using a brilliant blue fcf dye with 0 1 of volume no change was observed in the physical properties of diesel fuel after mixing with the dye moreover the dye did not transfer between the water and diesel fuel and was not absorbed by sand particles 2 2 experimental setup a 1 d square acrylic glass column with dimensions of 35 mm width x 35 mm depth x 600 mm height and made of 10 mm thick wall was used for all experiments the acrylic glass was transparent to provide observation of fluids migration inside the sand column the column joints were stacked together using transparent glue two digital cameras nikon d5300 and nikon d90 attached with two different narrow bandpass filters bn 650 and bn 470 were placed at a distance of 1 m in front of the column to capture images during the experiments bn 650 bandpass filter was used to determine the light intensity of the diesel in column test whereas bn 470 bandpass filter was used to detect the light intensity of water in the column test in addition two led floodlights were fixed in the dark room as the sole source of light a gretamacbeth white balance board was installed beside the column as a reference for white colour a nikon camera control pro software was used to capture images automatically in order to avoid displacement and vibration during collecting images the settings of cameras were adjusted manually in order to utilize the best dynamic range of cameras using exposure times of a few seconds for all images the aperture of the lenses used was fixed at f 16 whereas the exposure time was 2 5 s resulting in a resolution of 0 028 by 0 033 cm2 the temporal variation in the light intensity was corrected according to the procedure described by bob et al 2008 specifically a reference image was determined which represented the image captured when the column is fully saturated with water two small squares 2 5 cm 2 5 cm on the reference image were identified referred to as correction zones the correction coefficients were calculated from the ratio of the average light intensity of the correction zones for the reference image to the average light intensity of the correction zones of the image that need to be processed for instance to correct a specific image the correction coefficient of the image to be corrected was multiplied by the light intensities of the image for each image three subsequent images were collected and the average value of the light intensities of these three images was used for calculations all images were analyzed using matlab all experiments were carried out inside a dark room and the temperature of the room was maintained at 23 1 oc the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 2 3 experimental procedure prior to the start of the experiments the sand was washed with distilled water to remove any fine residuals that might be present and then oven dried for 48 h at 45 c to remove any mositure niemet and selker 2001 thereafter the sand was subsequently packed into the column incrementally in 2 cm layers the sand column was placed on a mechanical vibrator to ensure uniform compaction with a vibration rate of 50 hertz to ensure similar void ratios in all column experiments the porosity was estimated to be 0 43 this corresponds to a pore volume of 316 ml the sand was subsequently fully saturated with blue dyed water and left in a vacuum chamber for 24 h to remove any entrapped air and to make sure that the sand is fully saturated with water subsequently the drainage valve was opened to drain out the water into the reservoir such that the watertable is fixed at 18 cm from the bottom of the column the drainage valve was kept opened and the elevation of outflow was fixed throughout the whole experiment the total duration for one test was about 53 h four 4 tests were carried out to compare the behavior of diesel saturation for different lnapl spilled volumes and water infiltration rates each experiment consisted of four stages as described below 2 3 1 initial drainage in this stage the water was allowed to drain out of the column through the drainage line for a total period of 4 h several images were collected to observe the change of water saturation with drainage at the first hour one image was captured every 5 min whereas for the rest of this stage one image was captured every 30 min 2 3 2 lnapl infiltration the duration of this stage was 24 h a pre determined lnapl volume 25 ml or 50 ml was injected from the top of the column using a pipette resulting in a multiphase system consisted of three fluids water air and lnapl relative to the pore volume pv of the entire column the injected low and high lnapl volumes correspond to 0 08 and 0 16 pv respectively the lnapl infiltration took about 4 h and then the column was left for 20 h for stabilization 2 3 3 water infiltration to simulate the infiltration into the column a burette of 50 ml was used to provide water droplets a dripping method was used to simulate the water infiltration due to its ease of installation and economic advantage simulation of infiltration using the dripping method purposely allows the water infiltration to occur as a recharge therefore the influence of kinetic energy on the model surface can be neglected for a typical infiltration simulation the characteristics that should be considered are drop size intensity and kinetic energy dunkerley 2008 the intensities of the infiltration used for the test were 10 mm h of moderate rain and 50 mm h of heavy rain as such the high infiltration condition can be seen as a case of a heavy precipitation event the duration of this stage was 1 h 2 3 4 percolation percolation is the process where precipitation moves through the soil layers and rocks with the aids of capillary and gravity forces following the water infiltration stage a uniform percolation rate of 12 ml h which corresponds to the low infiltration rate of 1 0 mm h was applied to experiments the duration of the percolation stage was 24 h which was started immediately after the water infiltration stage in this stage higher intensity of water infiltrated and pushed the diesel deeper to the groundwater more diesel will move downward into the capillary fringe or groundwater due to the higher intensity even though water was heavier than diesel 2 4 simplified image analysis method the definition of napl zones requires detailed measurements of napl saturation however acquiring precise quantitative data on the saturation is a difficult task even in controlled laboratory setups although the gravimetric sampling method is an accurate method it cannot provide saturation data continuously because soil samples must be removed from a soil sample moreover sampling provides information at only one location or at most few selected locations in this study the siam developed by flores et al 2011 was applied to observe the saturation distributions of lnapl and water in the partially saturated sand column under dynamic conditions the theory behind the siam is the application of the beer lambert law of light transmittance where a linear relationship is assumed to exist between the average optical density and lnapl and water saturation so and sw respectively the average optical density can be calculated as follow 1 d i 1 n j 1 n d ji 1 n j 1 n log 10 i ji r i ji o where d i is the average optical density i is the spectral band i 470 or 650 n is the number of pixels in the area of interest d ji is the optical density of the individual pixels i r ji is the light intensity of the reflected light by individual pixel value and i o ji is the light intensity of the reflected light by an ideal white surface from the calculated d i siam can estimate the saturation distribution matrices s w and s o by performing a comparison between the average optical densities of the matrix element d i and the three calibrated images d i w d i o d i d for sand fully saturated with water s w 100 s o 0 sand fully saturated with lnapl s w 0 s o 100 and dry sand s w 0 s o 0 respectively for the same range the average optical density values for each cell of the studied range can be calculated and compared to the corresponding ones for all three calibration images a matrix of correlation equation sets can also be obtained with each one corresponding to each cell as follow 2 di dj mn d i w d i d s w d i o d i d s o d i d d j w d j d s w d j 0 d j d s o d j d mn where m and n are matrix dimenstions d i mn and d j mn are the average values of the optical density of each mesh element for wavelengths i and j d d i mn and d d j mn are the average optical density of each mesh element for dry sand d w i mn and d w j mn are for water saturated sand and d o i mn and d o j mn are for lnapl saturated sand eq 2 is essentially an averaging of the optical density of the three fluids water lnapl and air each weighted by its saturation 3 results and discussion 3 1 lnapl saturation profiles in total four experiments were conducted corresponding to two lnapl injection volumes and two water infiltration rates as described above images were collected throughout the different stages of the experiments converted into plots of lnapl saturation and water saturation the saturation of lnapl and water are depicted in terms of cluster plots with lighter colour representing low saturation and darker colour representing high saturation the saturation of lnapl and water changed with time corresponding to the different stages of the experiments the resultant lnapl and water saturations for the four experiments are depicted in figs 2 5 respectively fig 2 depicts the lnapl and water saturation for the case of low lnapl volume 0 08 pv and low water infiltration rate 10 mm h the x axis corresponds to time while the vertical axis represents the column height fig 2a shows no lnapl in the first stage as the lnapl injection occurred in stage 2 starting at t 4 h the beginning of stage 2 the images show a gradual increase in lnapl saturation with the lnapl saturation concentrated in the middle of the column above the water table located at 18 cm the water saturation along the entire column as a function of time is shown in fig 2b after 4 h of drainage the water partially drains from the column up to a height of 18 cm where the water table is maintained the saturation in the column above the 18 cm mark was about 0 3 which corresponds to the field capacity of the sand as drainage was gravity induced fig 2 indicates that once the lnapl injection stage was started the uppermost sections of the column and bottom sections below the water table were free of lnapl the lnapl migrated downward due to the gravitational force and accumulated in the capillary fringe zone due to the lower density of lnapl compared to that of water however in the infiltration and percolation stages the saturation of lnapl showed little redistribution with the low water infiltration intensity of 10 mm h experiment 2 corresponded to a large lnapl volume equal to 0 16 pv injected in stage 2 and high infiltration intensity in stage 3 fig 3 shows the corresponding lnapl and water saturations as a function of time it is observed that the water and lnapl profiles did not differ much from those of experiment 1 fig 2 the lnapl was concentrated between the injection hight and about a highet of 24 cm with some lnapl in the capillary fringe height of 18 cm to 24 cm and no lnapl below the 18 cm height experiments 3 and 4 are similar to experiments 1 and 2 except that the water infiltration intensity was increased to 55 mm h in the case of high water infiltration intensity a high increment in lnapl saturation was observed because water exerted a larger hydrodynamic force on the lnapl and pushed it downward to reach the water table and even penetrate below the water table as shown in figs 4 and 5 in the water infiltration stage stage 3 it is observed that some lnapl redistribution occurs the hydrodynamic force due to the higher infiltration rate caused the water to replace the lnapl out of the pores leading to the lnapl migration into capillary fringe it is observed that the lnapl caused the formation of lenses within the capillary fringe in addition to the hydrodynamics and buoyancy forces the increased lnapl relative permeability contributed to the migration of lnapl according to yoon et al 2009 if the permeability of soil increased more lnapl penetrated through the capillary zone during water infiltration with less spreading on capillary fringe overall figs 2 5 clearly show that the saim method can capture lnapl migration in stage 2 and its accumulation at the capillary fringe and the lnapl s inability to penetrate into the saturated zone the height of capillary fringe normally depends on soil grain size where the larger voids have lower capillary height based on terzaghi and peck 1948 the height of capillary fringe can be estimated from the equations below 3 h c max c e d 10 4 e g s γ w γ d 5 γ d w v where c is the grain shape constant of sand which is in the range of 10 to 50 mm2 terzaghi and peck 1948 d 10 is the effective grain diameter obtained from soil classification and e is the void ratio eq 4 is used to calculate the void ratio where g s is specific gravity of soil γ w is the unit weight of water in the soil and γ d is unit weight of dry soil eq 5 is used to calculate the dry unit weight of soil the total dry sand used in the column was 997 g thus the dry unit weight calculated according to eq 5 was 13 3 kn m3 the void ratio obtained using eq 4 was 0 75 taking a c 10 mm2 which is suitable for coarse sand similar to that used in the current experiments we obtain a capillary rise h c max of about 78 mm the calculated was in the range of 18 mm to 90 mm this approximate estimate of the capillary fringe is consistent with the capillary height derived from the images equal to about 60 mm corresponding to the height between the 18 and 24 cm marks with low lnapl 3 2 effect of lnapl spilled volume the volume of lnapl released into the subsurface is one of the factors that affect the penetration depth of lnapl in the saturated zone an increase in volume of lnapl will increase the depth of penetration and saturation above capillary fringe the two lnapl volumes equal to 0 08 and 0 17 pv 25 ml and 50 ml respectively were used to compare the saturation and depth for the both tests with same infiltration intensity as shown in figs 4 and 5 the lnapl mass corresponding to the 50 ml lnapl volume was observed to move faster and deeper towards the water table in the sand column on the other hand the 25 ml of lnapl needed more time to reach the water table specifically the 50 ml of lnapl reaches the water table in less than 8 h while the penetration of the 25 ml of lnapl reaches the water table after 10 h moreover the 50 ml of lnapl migrate further downwards up to a depth of about 7 cm above the water table at the end of the lnapl infiltration stage however the 25 ml of lnapl only reached 12 cm above the water table this observation is most likely because lnapl in the high volume case occupied a larger fraction of the pores which forces the lnapl further downwards during the water infiltration stage this added hydrodynamic forces caused the lnapl entrapped in the soil pore to migrate downwards causing a depression of the capillary fringe results of the image analysis suggest that the highest saturation of lnapl occurred between 48 cm to 18 cm from fig 5a whereas from fig 4a the zone of highest lnapl saturation was about 53 cm to 23 cm the saturation of lnapl in the capillary fringe area corresponding to the higher lnapl volume fig 5a was also higher compared to the case of 25 ml of lnapl at the same conditions in the sand column in other words when the volume of the lnapl high more void within soil pores will be occupied when the water infiltration intensity was 10 mm h the 25 ml of lnapl migrated up to 21 cm mark as shown in fig 2a while for the 50 ml of lnapl it penetrated further reaching the 18 cm height which is the water table as shown in fig 3a for both water infiltration rates no lnapl was seen below the 18 cm height because the added hydrodynamic force from the infiltrating water was not sufficient to overcome the buoyancy and capillary forces kamaruddin 2012 as a result the lnapl remains floating above the water table the lnapl saturation was highest in the middle section of column corresponding to heights of 30 cm and 42 cm whereas the lnapl saturation just above the water table was about 15 3 3 impact of water infiltration intensity it was observed that the low water infiltration intensity did not have a significant influence on lnapl saturation however at the higher water infiltration rate lnapl saturation was observed to vary significantly the change of lnapl saturation however varied along the sand column height tables 1 and 2 show the lnapl saturation observed at 24 cm 34 cm and 48 cm of column height for the case with low lnapl volume at different stages of the experiments lnapl infiltration after water infiltration and after percolation for the high lnapl volume case the lnapl saturations were observed at 18 cm 34 cm and 48 cm of column height plots of the entire lnapl saturation profiles for the case of high infiltration intensities and low high lnapl injection volumes are shown in figs 6 and 7 from fig 6 and table 1 it is observed that during the lnapl infiltration stage the middle part of the sand column had the higher lnapl saturation 60 at 34 cm after one hour of water infiltration the lnapl saturation decreased to 52 because the water infiltration caused the lnapl to migrate downwards however at the end of percolation stage the saturation of the lnapl increased slightly to 54 because the lnapl migrated downward due to gravitational forces at 48 cm height at the end of the infiltration of lnapl the saturation of lnapl was 48 and increased to 56 after water infiltration because of the lnapl downward movement and decreased to 42 at the end of percolation stage because the lnapl migrated deeper due to gravitational forces at the capillary fringe at 24 cm the lnapl saturation was 33 because the lnapl is lighter than water with little amount of lnapl penetrating the saturated zone however after water infiltration the saturation of lnapl slightly increased to 35 because water exerted pressure that forced the lnapl to move deeper reaching 39 at the end of percolation from fig 7 and table 2 the water table at 18 cm was chosen instead of 24 cm as for the case of high volume of lnapl with high water infiltration rate the lnapl migrated further downwards at 48 cm height of column the lnapl saturation at the end of the lnapl infiltration stage was 30 and increased to 35 after water infiltration but decreased to 20 at the end of percolation due to the lnapl downwards migration at 34 cm the lnapl saturation was 50 after lnapl infiltration it decreased after infiltration to 46 increasing slightly to 47 at the end of the experiment at the water table the saturation of the lnapl was 30 after lnapl infiltration and increased to 38 after water infiltration and increased slightly again to 40 at the end of percolation stage overall these results show the downward migration of the lnapl under different experimental conditions during the lnapl infiltration stage the images reveal the rapid downward migration of the lnapl through the vadose zone because the large contrast in lnapl and air in the vadose zone offers little resistance in the face of the lnapl front once the lnapl encountered the water table the capillary forces due to the water wetting soil and the relatively small density contrast prevent the lnapl from penetrating further through the saturated zone during the water infiltration stage the hydrodynamic force from the infiltrating water forces some of the lnapl to migrate further downward in the case of the low lnapl volume which corresponds to low lnapl saturation in the vadose zone the water is capable of percolating through the lnapl with little lnapl redistribution on the other hand when the infiltration volume intensity is large the infiltrating water partially displaces the lnapl entrapped in the vadose zone this causes the lnapl to migrate downward into the capillary fringe and even further below into the saturated zone the unique feature of siam is that not only does it allow us to visualize the downward migration of the lnapl under these various experimental conditions it also provides an accurate method that can quantify this lnapl and water redistribution quantitative data provided from siam such as that obtained from this study can be used to enhance our understanding of dnapl behavior and in calibration of multiphase models that simulate napl migration in porous media 4 conclusion four laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of water infiltration on lnapl migration in 1 d sand column using the simplified image analysis method siam two water infiltration intensities 10 mm h and 50 mm h were applied along with two different lnapl volumes differentiated as low lnapl volume 25 ml and high lnapl volume 50 ml these two volumes corresponded to average lnapl saturation of 0 08 and 0 16 relative ot the total pore volume of the porous medium the water table was maintained at 18 cm from the bottom of the column throughout the experiments the siam results provided quantitative time dependent data on the water and lnapl distribution through the various stages for the experiment it was observed that after 4 h of water drainage prior to any lnapl introduction into the column the water saturation in the vadose zone was about 30 once the lnapl infiltration stage was started siam was able to register the rapid downward migration of the lnapl and its accumulation in the partially saturated soil above the capillary fringe the water wetting nature of the sand and its high water content prevented the further downward migration of the lnapl into the saturated zone empirical equations suggested that the capillary fringe height is about 78 mm which was consistent with the lnapl saturation images interpretation of the siam images revealed that in the case of high lnapl injection volume the lnapl was observed to migrate deeper after infiltration until about 7 cm above the water table while for the case of low lnapl the lnapl reached 12 cm of the top of water table the lnapl saturation was observed to vary under the influence of high water infiltration at a height of 34 cm which is approximately midway along the column the lnapl saturation was 60 at the end of the lnapl infiltration stage and decreased to 52 after water infiltration and then slightly increased to 54 however at the top of the column at height of 48 cm the lnapl saturation was 48 and increased to 56 after water infiltration and then decreased to 42 at the end of percolation stage at the capillary fringe at 24 cm the lnapl saturation was 33 at the end of the lnapl injection stage increasing slightly to 35 after water infiltration and to 39 at the end of percolation overall this study demonstrated that the siam technique is an accurate and cost effective tool for the visualization of the time dependent napl water movement in laboratory scale experiments and dynamic changes in fluid saturation in porous media declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgements the author would like

1445,laboratory scale column experiments were carried out to assess the influence of water infiltration on pooled light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl redistribution in porous media a simplified image analysis method siam was used to evaluate the saturation distributions of the lnapl and water in the entire domain under dynamic conditions the experiments were conducted for high low lnapl volumes lnapl volumes differentiated as low and high volumes high resolution siam images of the soil column during lnapl migration and water infiltration events were captured and analyzed results indicated that the capillary fringe is about 6 7 cm which was consistent with the capillary height derived from empirical equations moreover siam provided an estimate of the field capacity 30 of the sand once the lnapl infiltration stage was started the lnapl was observed to rapidly migrate through the vadose zone for the case of large lnapl volume the lnapl penetrated further into capillary fringe zone analysis of siam images showed that the lnapl redistribution was observed to vary significantly with the rate of infiltration for higher water infiltration intensity the injected water exerted a larger hydrodynamic force on the entrapped lnapl forcing it move further downward into the capillary zone and the saturated zone overall this study demonstrated that the siam technique is an accurate and cost effective tool for the visualization of the time dependent napl water movement in laboratory scale experiments and dynamic changes in fluid saturation in porous media keywords lnapl

widespread environmental problem abriola 1989 pankow and cherry 1996 costanza robinson and brusseau 2002 agaoglu et al 2015 alazaiza et al 2019 these contaminants have adverse impact on the quality of groundwater making it unsuitable for human use and irrigation purposes huling and weaver 1991 many napls are immiscible with water due to their low aqueous solubility as a result they can persist for many years leading to the contamination of huge parts of groundwater alazaiza et al 2018 it is difficult to predict the behavior of napls in porous media especially in the vadose zone due to the complex nature of the water air napl multiphase system in general napls can be classified as light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls and dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls depending on their density relative to that of water the most common examples of dnapl are chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene while petroleum compounds such as benzene toluene and xylene btex are commonly encountered examples of lnapl ngien et al 2012 jawitz et al 2000 when a napl is released into the subsurface lnapls migrate downward through the unsaturated soil due to gravity leaving small ganglia along their path pankow and cherry 1996 because of the large contrast in the density of lnapls relative to air the vadose zone offers little resistance to the lnapl allowing it to reach and accumulate on top of the water table dnapls on the other hand can enter the saturated zone once the entry pressure is exceeded and continue their downward migration in the saturated zone due to their density which is higher than that of water until some hydraulic or capillary barrier is encountered huling and weaver 1991 it is important to understand the behavior of

and for the entire domain of interest alazaiza et al 2017b in light of the aformentioned limitations image analysis methods such as light transmission visualization light reflection method spectal image analysis method and simplified image analysis method have gained more attention of researchers alazaiza et al 2020b zheng et al 2015 bob et al 2008 a recent study by alazaiza et al 2015 reviewed the application of the image analysis methods to napl experiments and demonstrated that these methods are viable methods for quantifying napl migration and saturation particularly in laboratory settings as noted above napls released into the subsurface environment can persist for very long periods of time while the napl can remain entrapped in the soil as a result of the capillary forces it can undergo some redistribution that can impact its fate and transport in the vadose zone water percolation into the subsurface can influence the migration of entrapped napl ganglia as well as the napl mass accumulated on the water table alazaiza et al 2019 conducted a 2 d experimental study to observe the influence of rainfall on the migration of lnapl in double porosity soil structure the authors reported that water table fluctuations caused the lnapl that was entrapped in the porous media to be pushed further downward in addition they observed that the capillary fringe thickness was depressed due to the influence of both infiltration and lnapl volume kamaruddin 2012 conducted an experimental study to assess the influence of rainfall on the migration of lnapl in silica sand the author reported that rainfall recharge influenced the lnapl migration and caused it to moved downward in addition the results also showed that the rainfall recharge could significantly reduce the residual lnapl saturation at the upper part of the capillary interface alazaiza et al 2020b applied the simplified image analysis method siam to investigate the saturation distributions of the lnapl and water in the entire domain the influence of water table fluctuations the authors concluded that the siam technique is an accurate and cost effective tool for the visualization of the time dependent napl water movement in laboratory scale experiments and quantifying dynamic changes in fluid saturation in porous media the present study aims to investigate the influence of infiltration on lnapl entrapped in silica sand using siam specifically siam is used to generate detailed time dependent saturation maps for water and lnapl for a range of experimental conditions diesel was used as a representative of lnapl the study examines the impact of lnapl volume and infiltration rate on lnapl spatial distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characteristic a natural sand collected from a river in pulau pinang malaysia was used as the porous media particle size analysis indicated that the pore grain size varied between 0 3 mm and 1 18 mm with an average size of 0 67 mm a commercial diesel fuel was used to represent the lnapl the density of the diesel was 0 83 g cm3 and the viscosity at 20 c was 5 8 mm2 s the thermal expansion coefficient was 88 kg m3 flash point at 62 c and vapor pressure was 10 kpa at 15 c yilmaz et al 2010 for better visualization the lnapl was mixed with red sudan iii dye while water was dyed using a brilliant blue fcf dye with 0 1 of volume no change was observed in the physical properties of diesel fuel after mixing with the dye moreover the dye did not transfer between the water and diesel fuel and was not absorbed by sand particles 2 2 experimental setup a 1 d square acrylic glass column with dimensions of 35 mm width x 35 mm depth x 600 mm height and made of 10 mm thick wall was used for all experiments the acrylic glass was transparent to provide observation of fluids migration inside the sand column the column joints were stacked together using transparent glue two digital cameras nikon d5300 and nikon d90 attached with two different narrow bandpass filters bn 650 and bn 470 were placed at a distance of 1 m in front of the column to capture images during the experiments bn 650 bandpass filter was used to determine the light intensity of the diesel in column test whereas bn 470 bandpass filter was used to detect the light intensity of water in the column test in addition two led floodlights were fixed in the dark room as the sole source of light a gretamacbeth white balance board was installed beside the column as a reference for white colour a nikon camera control pro software was used to capture images automatically in order to avoid displacement and vibration during collecting images the settings of cameras were adjusted manually in order to utilize the best dynamic range of cameras using exposure times of a few seconds for all images the aperture of the lenses used was fixed at f 16 whereas the exposure time was 2 5 s resulting in a resolution of 0 028 by 0 033 cm2 the temporal variation in the light intensity was corrected according to the procedure described by bob et al 2008 specifically a reference image was determined which represented the image captured when the column is fully saturated with water two small squares 2 5 cm 2 5 cm on the reference image were identified referred to as correction zones the correction coefficients were calculated from the ratio of the average light intensity of the correction zones for the reference image to the average light intensity of the correction zones of the image that need to be processed for instance to correct a specific image the correction coefficient of the image to be corrected was multiplied by the light intensities of the image for each image three subsequent images were collected and the average value of the light intensities of these three images was used for calculations all images were analyzed using matlab all experiments were carried out inside a dark room and the temperature of the room was maintained at 23 1 oc the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 2 3 experimental procedure prior to the start of the experiments the sand was washed with distilled water to remove any fine residuals that might be present and then oven dried for 48 h at 45 c to remove any mositure niemet and selker 2001 thereafter the sand was subsequently packed into the column incrementally in 2 cm layers the sand column was placed on a mechanical vibrator to ensure uniform compaction with a vibration rate of 50 hertz to ensure similar void ratios in all column experiments the porosity was estimated to be 0 43 this corresponds to a pore volume of 316 ml the sand was subsequently fully saturated with blue dyed water and left in a vacuum chamber for 24 h to remove any entrapped air and to make sure that the sand is fully saturated with water subsequently the drainage valve was opened to drain out the water into the reservoir such that the watertable is fixed at 18 cm from the bottom of the column the drainage valve was kept opened and the elevation of outflow was fixed throughout the whole experiment the total duration for one test was about 53 h four 4 tests were carried out to compare the behavior of diesel saturation for different lnapl spilled volumes and water infiltration rates each experiment consisted of four stages as described below 2 3 1 initial drainage in this stage the water was allowed to drain out of the column through the drainage line for a total period of 4 h several images were collected to observe the change of water saturation with drainage at the first hour one image was captured every 5 min whereas for the rest of this stage one image was captured every 30 min 2 3 2 lnapl infiltration the duration of this stage was 24 h a pre determined lnapl volume 25 ml or 50 ml was injected from the top of the column using a pipette resulting in a multiphase system consisted of three fluids water air and lnapl relative to the pore volume pv of the entire column the injected low and high lnapl volumes correspond to 0 08 and 0 16 pv respectively the lnapl infiltration took about 4 h and then the column was left for 20 h for stabilization 2 3 3 water infiltration to simulate the infiltration into the column a burette of 50 ml was used to provide water droplets a dripping method was used to simulate the water infiltration due to its ease of installation and economic advantage simulation of infiltration using the dripping method purposely allows the water infiltration to occur as a recharge therefore the influence of kinetic energy on the model surface can be neglected for a typical infiltration simulation the characteristics that should be considered are drop size intensity and kinetic energy dunkerley 2008 the intensities of the infiltration used for the test were 10 mm h of moderate rain and 50 mm h of heavy rain as such the high infiltration condition can be seen as a case of a heavy precipitation event the duration of this stage was 1 h 2 3 4 percolation percolation is the process where precipitation moves through the soil layers and rocks with the aids of capillary and gravity forces following the water infiltration stage a uniform percolation rate of 12 ml h which corresponds to the low infiltration rate of 1 0 mm h was applied to experiments the duration of the percolation stage was 24 h which was started immediately after the water infiltration stage in this stage higher intensity of water infiltrated and pushed the diesel deeper to the groundwater more diesel will move downward into the capillary fringe or groundwater due to the higher intensity even though water was heavier than diesel 2 4 simplified image analysis method the definition of napl zones requires detailed measurements of napl saturation however acquiring precise quantitative data on the saturation is a difficult task even in controlled laboratory setups although the gravimetric sampling method is an accurate method it cannot provide saturation data continuously because soil samples must be removed from a soil sample moreover sampling provides information at only one location or at most few selected locations in this study the siam developed by flores et al 2011 was applied to observe the saturation distributions of lnapl and water in the partially saturated sand column under dynamic conditions the theory behind the siam is the application of the beer lambert law of light transmittance where a linear relationship is assumed to exist between the average optical density and lnapl and water saturation so and sw respectively the average optical density can be calculated as follow 1 d i 1 n j 1 n d ji 1 n j 1 n log 10 i ji r i ji o where d i is the average optical density i is the spectral band i 470 or 650 n is the number of pixels in the area of interest d ji is the optical density of the individual pixels i r ji is the light intensity of the reflected light by individual pixel value and i o ji is the light intensity of the reflected light by an ideal white surface from the calculated d i siam can estimate the saturation distribution matrices s w and s o by performing a comparison between the average optical densities of the matrix element d i and the three calibrated images d i w d i o d i d for sand fully saturated with water s w 100 s o 0 sand fully saturated with lnapl s w 0 s o 100 and dry sand s w 0 s o 0 respectively for the same range the average optical density values for each cell of the studied range can be calculated and compared to the corresponding ones for all three calibration images a matrix of correlation equation sets can also be obtained with each one corresponding to each cell as follow 2 di dj mn d i w d i d s w d i o d i d s o d i d d j w d j d s w d j 0 d j d s o d j d mn where m and n are matrix dimenstions d i mn and d j mn are the average values of the optical density of each mesh element for wavelengths i and j d d i mn and d d j mn are the average optical density of each mesh element for dry sand d w i mn and d w j mn are for water saturated sand and d o i mn and d o j mn are for lnapl saturated sand eq 2 is essentially an averaging of the optical density of the three fluids water lnapl and air each weighted by its saturation 3 results and discussion 3 1 lnapl saturation profiles in total four experiments were conducted corresponding to two lnapl injection volumes and two water infiltration rates as described above images were collected throughout the different stages of the experiments converted into plots of lnapl saturation and water saturation the saturation of lnapl and water are depicted in terms of cluster plots with lighter colour representing low saturation and darker colour representing high saturation the saturation of lnapl and water changed with time corresponding to the different stages of the experiments the resultant lnapl and water saturations for the four experiments are depicted in figs 2 5 respectively fig 2 depicts the lnapl and water saturation for the case of low lnapl volume 0 08 pv and low water infiltration rate 10 mm h the x axis corresponds to time while the vertical axis represents the column height fig 2a shows no lnapl in the first stage as the lnapl injection occurred in stage 2 starting at t 4 h the beginning of stage 2 the images show a gradual increase in lnapl saturation with the lnapl saturation concentrated in the middle of the column above the water table located at 18 cm the water saturation along the entire column as a function of time is shown in fig 2b after 4 h of drainage the water partially drains from the column up to a height of 18 cm where the water table is maintained the saturation in the column above the 18 cm mark was about 0 3 which corresponds to the field capacity of the sand as drainage was gravity induced fig 2 indicates that once the lnapl injection stage was started the uppermost sections of the column and bottom sections below the water table were free of lnapl the lnapl migrated downward due to the gravitational force and accumulated in the capillary fringe zone due to the lower density of lnapl compared to that of water however in the infiltration and percolation stages the saturation of lnapl showed little redistribution with the low water infiltration intensity of 10 mm h experiment 2 corresponded to a large lnapl volume equal to 0 16 pv injected in stage 2 and high infiltration intensity in stage 3 fig 3 shows the corresponding lnapl and water saturations as a function of time it is observed that the water and lnapl profiles did not differ much from those of experiment 1 fig 2 the lnapl was concentrated between the injection hight and about a highet of 24 cm with some lnapl in the capillary fringe height of 18 cm to 24 cm and no lnapl below the 18 cm height experiments 3 and 4 are similar to experiments 1 and 2 except that the water infiltration intensity was increased to 55 mm h in the case of high water infiltration intensity a high increment in lnapl saturation was observed because water exerted a larger hydrodynamic force on the lnapl and pushed it downward to reach the water table and even penetrate below the water table as shown in figs 4 and 5 in the water infiltration stage stage 3 it is observed that some lnapl redistribution occurs the hydrodynamic force due to the higher infiltration rate caused the water to replace the lnapl out of the pores leading to the lnapl migration into capillary fringe it is observed that the lnapl caused the formation of lenses within the capillary fringe in addition to the hydrodynamics and buoyancy forces the increased lnapl relative permeability contributed to the migration of lnapl according to yoon et al 2009 if the permeability of soil increased more lnapl penetrated through the capillary zone during water infiltration with less spreading on capillary fringe overall figs 2 5 clearly show that the saim method can capture lnapl migration in stage 2 and its accumulation at the capillary fringe and the lnapl s inability to penetrate into the saturated zone the height of capillary fringe normally depends on soil grain size where the larger voids have lower capillary height based on terzaghi and peck 1948 the height of capillary fringe can be estimated from the equations below 3 h c max c e d 10 4 e g s γ w γ d 5 γ d w v where c is the grain shape constant of sand which is in the range of 10 to 50 mm2 terzaghi and peck 1948 d 10 is the effective grain diameter obtained from soil classification and e is the void ratio eq 4 is used to calculate the void ratio where g s is specific gravity of soil γ w is the unit weight of water in the soil and γ d is unit weight of dry soil eq 5 is used to calculate the dry unit weight of soil the total dry sand used in the column was 997 g thus the dry unit weight calculated according to eq 5 was 13 3 kn m3 the void ratio obtained using eq 4 was 0 75 taking a c 10 mm2 which is suitable for coarse sand similar to that used in the current experiments we obtain a capillary rise h c max of about 78 mm the calculated was in the range of 18 mm to 90 mm this approximate estimate of the capillary fringe is consistent with the capillary height derived from the images equal to about 60 mm corresponding to the height between the 18 and 24 cm marks with low lnapl 3 2 effect of lnapl spilled volume the volume of lnapl released into the subsurface is one of the factors that affect the penetration depth of lnapl in the saturated zone an increase in volume of lnapl will increase the depth of penetration and saturation above capillary fringe the two lnapl volumes equal to 0 08 and 0 17 pv 25 ml and 50 ml respectively were used to compare the saturation and depth for the both tests with same infiltration intensity as shown in figs 4 and 5 the lnapl mass corresponding to the 50 ml lnapl volume was observed to move faster and deeper towards the water table in the sand column on the other hand the 25 ml of lnapl needed more time to reach the water table specifically the 50 ml of lnapl reaches the water table in less than 8 h while the penetration of the 25 ml of lnapl reaches the water table after 10 h moreover the 50 ml of lnapl migrate further downwards up to a depth of about 7 cm above the water table at the end of the lnapl infiltration stage however the 25 ml of lnapl only reached 12 cm above the water table this observation is most likely because lnapl in the high volume case occupied a larger fraction of the pores which forces the lnapl further downwards during the water infiltration stage this added hydrodynamic forces caused the lnapl entrapped in the soil pore to migrate downwards causing a depression of the capillary fringe results of the image analysis suggest that the highest saturation of lnapl occurred between 48 cm to 18 cm from fig 5a whereas from fig 4a the zone of highest lnapl saturation was about 53 cm to 23 cm the saturation of lnapl in the capillary fringe area corresponding to the higher lnapl volume fig 5a was also higher compared to the case of 25 ml of lnapl at the same conditions in the sand column in other words when the volume of the lnapl high more void within soil pores will be occupied when the water infiltration intensity was 10 mm h the 25 ml of lnapl migrated up to 21 cm mark as shown in fig 2a while for the 50 ml of lnapl it penetrated further reaching the 18 cm height which is the water table as shown in fig 3a for both water infiltration rates no lnapl was seen below the 18 cm height because the added hydrodynamic force from the infiltrating water was not sufficient to overcome the buoyancy and capillary forces kamaruddin 2012 as a result the lnapl remains floating above the water table the lnapl saturation was highest in the middle section of column corresponding to heights of 30 cm and 42 cm whereas the lnapl saturation just above the water table was about 15 3 3 impact of water infiltration intensity it was observed that the low water infiltration intensity did not have a significant influence on lnapl saturation however at the higher water infiltration rate lnapl saturation was observed to vary significantly the change of lnapl saturation however varied along the sand column height tables 1 and 2 show the lnapl saturation observed at 24 cm 34 cm and 48 cm of column height for the case with low lnapl volume at different stages of the experiments lnapl infiltration after water infiltration and after percolation for the high lnapl volume case the lnapl saturations were observed at 18 cm 34 cm and 48 cm of column height plots of the entire lnapl saturation profiles for the case of high infiltration intensities and low high lnapl injection volumes are shown in figs 6 and 7 from fig 6 and table 1 it is observed that during the lnapl infiltration stage the middle part of the sand column had the higher lnapl saturation 60 at 34 cm after one hour of water infiltration the lnapl saturation decreased to 52 because the water infiltration caused the lnapl to migrate downwards however at the end of percolation stage the saturation of the lnapl increased slightly to 54 because the lnapl migrated downward due to gravitational forces at 48 cm height at the end of the infiltration of lnapl the saturation of lnapl was 48 and increased to 56 after water infiltration because of the lnapl downward movement and decreased to 42 at the end of percolation stage because the lnapl migrated deeper due to gravitational forces at the capillary fringe at 24 cm the lnapl saturation was 33 because the lnapl is lighter than water with little amount of lnapl penetrating the saturated zone however after water infiltration the saturation of lnapl slightly increased to 35 because water exerted pressure that forced the lnapl to move deeper reaching 39 at the end of percolation from fig 7 and table 2 the water table at 18 cm was chosen instead of 24 cm as for the case of high volume of lnapl with high water infiltration rate the lnapl migrated further downwards at 48 cm height of column the lnapl saturation at the end of the lnapl infiltration stage was 30 and increased to 35 after water infiltration but decreased to 20 at the end of percolation due to the lnapl downwards migration at 34 cm the lnapl saturation was 50 after lnapl infiltration it decreased after infiltration to 46 increasing slightly to 47 at the end of the experiment at the water table the saturation of the lnapl was 30 after lnapl infiltration and increased to 38 after water infiltration and increased slightly again to 40 at the end of percolation stage overall these results show the downward migration of the lnapl under different experimental conditions during the lnapl infiltration stage the images reveal the rapid downward migration of the lnapl through the vadose zone because the large contrast in lnapl and air in the vadose zone offers little resistance in the face of the lnapl front once the lnapl encountered the water table the capillary forces due to the water wetting soil and the relatively small density contrast prevent the lnapl from penetrating further through the saturated zone during the water infiltration stage the hydrodynamic force from the infiltrating water forces some of the lnapl to migrate further downward in the case of the low lnapl volume which corresponds to low lnapl saturation in the vadose zone the water is capable of percolating through the lnapl with little lnapl redistribution on the other hand when the infiltration volume intensity is large the infiltrating water partially displaces the lnapl entrapped in the vadose zone this causes the lnapl to migrate downward into the capillary fringe and even further below into the saturated zone the unique feature of siam is that not only does it allow us to visualize the downward migration of the lnapl under these various experimental conditions it also provides an accurate method that can quantify this lnapl and water redistribution quantitative data provided from siam such as that obtained from this study can be used to enhance our understanding of dnapl behavior and in calibration of multiphase models that simulate napl migration in porous media 4 conclusion four laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of water infiltration on lnapl migration in 1 d sand column using the simplified image analysis method siam two water infiltration intensities 10 mm h and 50 mm h were applied along with two different lnapl volumes differentiated as low lnapl volume 25 ml and high lnapl volume 50 ml these two volumes corresponded to average lnapl saturation of 0 08 and 0 16 relative ot the total pore volume of the porous medium the water table was maintained at 18 cm from the bottom of the column throughout the experiments the siam results provided quantitative time dependent data on the water and lnapl distribution through the various stages for the experiment it was observed that after 4 h of water drainage prior to any lnapl introduction into the column the water saturation in the vadose zone was about 30 once the lnapl infiltration stage was started siam was able to register the rapid downward migration of the lnapl and its accumulation in the partially saturated soil above the capillary fringe the water wetting nature of the sand and its high water content prevented the further downward migration of the lnapl into the saturated zone empirical equations suggested that the capillary fringe height is about 78 mm which was consistent with the lnapl saturation images interpretation of the siam images revealed that in the case of high lnapl injection volume the lnapl was observed to migrate deeper after infiltration until about 7 cm above the water table while for the case of low lnapl the lnapl reached 12 cm of the top of water table the lnapl saturation was observed to vary under the influence of high water infiltration at a height of 34 cm which is approximately midway along the column the lnapl saturation was 60 at the end of the lnapl infiltration stage and decreased to 52 after water infiltration and then slightly increased to 54 however at the top of the column at height of 48 cm the lnapl saturation was 48 and increased to 56 after water infiltration and then decreased to 42 at the end of percolation stage at the capillary fringe at 24 cm the lnapl saturation was 33 at the end of the lnapl injection stage increasing slightly to 35 after water infiltration and to 39 at the end of percolation overall this study demonstrated that the siam technique is an accurate and cost effective tool for the visualization of the time dependent napl water movement in laboratory scale experiments and dynamic changes in fluid saturation in porous media declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgements the author would like

1446,foam can be used to achieve environmental remediation in case of contamination caused by light non aqueous phase spills however when it comes in contact with oily pollutants foam becomes weaker and its life time is greatly reduced such weakening can be dampened by using silica particles together with saponin surfactant which were shown to reinforce foam in bulk and 1d sandpack experiments here is addressed both foam propagation in a 2d porous media when buoyancy and gravity interfere and foam behaviour when in contact with floating oil therefore macroscopic foam displacement and specific liquid and gas phases behaviours were studied in a 2d tank a piston like displacement was observed during foam propagation in the absence of oil while foam liquid phase was influenced by gravity and did not propagate homogeneously on entire tank height in the presence of oil foam was partly destroyed which increased the local permeability of gas and created new preferential paths for gas flow this effect was partially avoided via a surfactant concentration increase but solid colloidal particles turned out to be a more efficient stabilizing agent by significantly increasing foam strength and its oil tolerance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foam porous medium colloidal particle light non aqueous phase liquid 2d tank 1 introduction remediation of light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl contaminated soils is crucial for public health and environmental issues it can be achieved using different techniques varying with pollution type and contamination depth soil permeability and soil geophysical properties depending on the chosen treatment remediation strategies can be ex situ the pollution is treated outside the site and excavation is necessary however due to the cost of excavation the use of in situ remediation techniques is indicated among these techniques surfactant flushing allows reduction of the surface tension between water and the pollutant easing pollutant removal and solubilisation of the hydrocarbon molecules in surfactant micelles nevertheless the needed amount of surfactant may be too high and the sweeping efficiency is sometimes low especially in heterogeneous porous media to avoid these drawbacks the use of aqueous foam is recommended hirasaki et al 1997 liquid foam is made of a gaseous phase dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase the thin films separating gas bubbles are called lamellae and are stabilized by surfactants these amphiphilic molecules adsorb at the gas water interface decrease the interfacial tension limiting bubble coalescence and film rupture such a dispersion of gas in a liquid phase results in a high viscosity fluid where gravity segregation channelling and fingering are avoided apaydin kovscek 2001 and consequently gas mobility is severely reduced bertin et al 1999 because of its high viscosity foam can be used to block high permeability zones of a heterogeneous porous medium thus allowing other injected fluids to access low permeability zones that are then more easily swept kovscek bertin 2003 foam can also serve as a tool in remediation strategy to recover floating pollutant with a good sweeping efficiency by pushing it to a pumping well bertin et al 2017 or to bring oxidative chemicals to the contaminant source where they will react with the pollutant to form non toxic compounds shen et al 2011 it can also serve to confine a polluted area waiting for the appropriate treatment portois et al 2018a for the method that aims to recover a floating pollutant the objective is to inject foam underneath a lnapl layer so as to decrease the water flow towards the pumping well in order to increase the pumping rate of the lnapl this may be achieved with a foam of high sweeping efficiency and high viscosity however to be of optimum quality and be efficient foam has to fulfil two requirements the first requirement is to be of low sensitivity to buoyancy and such a sensitivity is related to foam structure its quality and its viscosity the second requirement is foam formulation which should be robust enough to resist oil induced de foaming effect indeed foam is destabilized by oil both in bulk and in porous medium almajid kovscek 2016 this process has been extensively studied and is mainly governed by the destabilization of the foam oil interface called pseudo emulsion film farajzadeh et al 2012 therefore additional foam reinforcement is necessary in that respect it was concluded from previous experiments performed in 1d sandpack columns that the addition of native silica colloidal particles does effectively increase foam resistance against oil induced coalescence forey et al 2020 by irreversibly adsorbing at the gas water interface silica particles increase the interfacial elasticity karakashev et al 2011 and steric repulsion thus decreasing the film drainage rate sun et al 2014 such a solid barrier in turn increases the strength of the pseudo emulsion film and reinforces foam resistance against oil to get a maximum foam stability depending on the system considered silica particles are sometimes surface treated to adjust their degree of hydrophobicity to an optimum value binks horozov 2005 silica particles also have the benefit of being natural products commonly used in food or medical applications dickinson 2010 to study buoyancy effects and because they were negligible in 1d sandpack experiments the focus is here placed on foam displacement in a 2d vertical porous medium to mimic the application conditions the objectives of the experiments are to characterize foam behaviour in a vertical porous medium and to investigate how the liquid and gas phases of foam typically flow our work relies on the work of a few authors who have investigated foam propagation in 2d tanks for soil remediation bertin et al 2017 longpré girard et al 2016 bouzid et al 2018 although some authors studied foam reinforced with solid colloidal particles in 2d tanks the performance of such pickering like foams was evaluated for enhanced oil recovery eor applications singh mohanty 2017 tsai et al 2009 and they used quite different operating conditions and surfactants injecting foam only in small containers where buoyancy was of less relevance singh mohanty 2017 moreover given the environmental application foam formulation should in fact be as friendly as possible so saponin a biodegradable surfactant was chosen for foam generation in the present study it is a plant based surfactant with interesting foaming properties pradhan bhattacharyya 2017 and has been successfully used for the removal of heavy metals and mixed contaminants via desorption and solubilisation of contaminants mulligan 2009 it has also been used in synergy with solid colloidal particles for food grade foam stabilization so the main goal of this study is to explore the impact of foam formulation on individual phase displacement in a 2d vertical porous medium in the absence and in the presence of oil this was first achieved through the analysis of several macroscopic parameters sequential imaging pressure field and water saturation s w in these first experiments no oil was present since the objective was to determine how buoyancy modifies foam behaviour when surfactant and colloidal particles concentrations vary later foam behaviour was studied in the presence of a top layer at residual oil saturation s or to mimic a real operating situation and to study how solid particles affect foam resistance against oil 2

absolute pressure the upper two taps situated at the tank sides were connected via a differential pressure transducer rosemount 2051 coplanar emerson france and a camera panasonic lumix dmc tz70 was used to take pictures of the tank during foam propagation finally the effluents were weighed over time and a mass balance calculated 2 4 experimental procedure experimental tests were designed to investigate different situations that are summarized in table 1 to understand how foam behaves in a 2d porous medium and how such behaviour is modified in the presence of an oil layer two sets of experiments were performed a first group of experiments was performed in the absence of oil the effect of surfactant concentration injection strategy gas liquid co injection versus surfactant alternating gas sag and solid particles addition were investigated the last experiment was performed with a dye added to the foaming solution during the co injection process the second group of experiments was performed in the presence of oil in the upper part of the 2d porous medium the influence of surfactant concentration and solid particles on foam flow was investigated those experiments are here interpreted and discussed through the pressure measurements and direct visualization of the foam front in the 2d porous media 2 4 1 experiments in the absence of oil the container was filled with sand by gradually introducing sand and water so that a water saturated porous medium is obtained with a known porosity and a known pore volume pv a layer of clay of approximately 15 mm was then added at the top to ensure no flux boundary conditions the top of the tank was then closed with a pmma plug to mechanically tighten it to satisfy surfactant adsorption prior to any foam propagation 3 3 pore volumes of surfactant solution at a concentration cs 10 cmc were injected into the water saturated porous medium this procedure is similar to that early used in 1d column experiments forey et al 2020 gas and foaming solution were then co injected at a total flow rate q tot 24 8 ml min 1 with a specified quality of 87 5 volume fraction of gas these conditions were previously determined from column experiments to be the ones giving the strongest saponin foam forey et al 2020 gas and foaming solution were separately injected through the two taps located at the bottom of the tank b and c while opening the two opposite taps to atmospheric pressure once injection began pictures were taken every minute to record the foam front displacement moreover when performing experiments the mass measurement of the outcoming liquid phase and pressure values at all taps locations led to the determination of the average water saturation s w of the porous medium 1 s w v w pv where v w is the volume of remaining water and pv is the total pore volume and a local resistance factor called rf p defined as 2 rf p p f p w qtot where p f and p w are respectively the absolute pressure measured for foam and water at the same flow rate and the same location for each pressure measurement tap rf p represents the increase in pressure due to the flow of foam in the porous medium and the higher the rf p the stronger the foam is values were calculated after flow reached steady state for each tap and a mean rf p was calculated based on rf p values throughout the tank because the mean rf p does not take into account the local pressure charge absolute pressure values were used to draw 2d pressure maps throughout the tank the pressure taps used to create those maps are contoured in yellow in fig 1 2 4 1 1 influence of surfactant concentration in order to study the influence of the surfactant concentration cs two cs values were chosen as for previous column experiments forey et al 2020 one of the experiments was performed with cs 3 2 cmc a formulation that has proven to give foam of intermediate strength and another one was conducted at cs 10 cmc which showed a higher foam strength with a higher rf p 2 4 1 2 surfactant and colloidal particles an experiment was carried out using a 10 cmc saponin foaming solution containing 0 5 wt sio2 to see if colloidal particles strengthened foam similarly to what was observed in 1d column experiments forey et al 2020 2 4 1 3 surfactant alternating gas experiment a surfactant alternating gas sag experiment was carried out to observe the gas phase displacement when injected alone the aim was to observe whether the liquid phase displacement influenced by any means the gas phase displacement to perform the sag experiment the porous medium was first saturated with a 10 cmc surfactant solution gas alone was then injected at the same total flow rate of q tot 24 8 ml min 1 than for other experiments and pictures taken every minute to record the gas displacement 2 4 1 4 experiments with dyed water during foam displacement in porous medium foam can be subject to buoyancy segregation with part of the gas phase being trapped in pores while the rest stays mobile this impacts the liquid phase displacement during co injection once the porous medium is filled with foam in order to dissociate the liquid phase flow from the foam flow fluorescein was added at 0 05 wt as a dye to the surfactant solution prior to co injection the path taken by the liquid phase could hence be clearly dissociated from the foam flow pictures were taken every minute to record the liquid phase displacement 2 4 2 experiments in the presence of oil experiments of foam propagation in the presence of oil were carried out with a top layer at s or residual oil saturation to mimic the sublayer of an oil spread that exists at the interface with an aquifer by injecting foam via the two lower injection taps b and c a strong foam could be generated before it comes in contact with oil these tests were done with 2 3 of the tank filled by gradually adding sand and water in the upper third only oil was used instead of water water was then injected at the top entry keeping open the opposite exit when no oil was produced anymore indicating that s or was reached in that layer water injection was stopped after that 3 3 pv of surfactant solution were injected to saturate the medium before starting co injection based on visual observation the instantaneous positions of the foam front were picked up water saturation and mean rf p were calculated for each experiment and measured absolute pressures were used to draw 2d pressure maps 3 results and discussion 3 1 foam propagation in the absence of oil 3 1 1 influence of surfactant concentration pictures taken at a total injected pore volume of 0 28 are displayed in fig 2 and a plot that represents the time evolution of the foam front propagation is shown in fig 3 pictures taken during foam displacement with cs 3 2 cmc and 10 cmc fig 2 show a piston like front during foam displacement with negligible buoyancy impact this observation is confirmed in fig 3 where it can be seen after the inlet effects the propagation of a regular and vertical front displacement the fact that the front is almost vertical proves that foam is generated wherever gas is present and that lamellae distribution is even on the full height in fact if foam was not formed only gas propagation would be observed with quick path through the top of the porous medium similarly a weak foam formation would generate a gradually decreasing density of lamellae on the full height of the container that may lead to an oblique propagation front mean rf p values representative of foam strength are displayed in table 2 on this table are also reported the ultimate water saturation as deduced from mass balance at equilibrium state the mean rf p is equal to 7 9 for 3 2 cmc significantly below that corresponding to 10 cmc 9 7 meaning that foam strength does increase with cs in the meantime s w remains stable at 0 36 those observations indicate that the foam is so strong that it propagates with a piston like movement and that the surfactant concentration has a minor impact on both s w and the shape of the displacement front while foam strength is noticeably improved 3 1 2 influence of presence of colloidal particles in the foaming solution fig 4 represents the picture taken at a total injected pore volume of 0 28 fig 4a and a time evolution of the foam front fig 4b the front shape and propagation observed in fig 4a and b are very similar to the ones observed when foam is generated with surfactant alone this result confirms that foam is generated wherever gas is present in the porous medium and that the presence of solid particles does not undermine foam generation and propagation considering rf p its mean value is equal to 9 9 very close to 9 7 obtained in the absence of particles on the contrary the ultimate water saturation s w decreases from 0 35 to 0 30 table 2 when solid colloidal particles are added to the saponin based formulation indicating a better sweeping efficiency of the initially water saturated porous medium in the meantime a steady piston like foam front is observed poorly affected by buoyancy this decrease of s w is presumably due to the formation of more rigid lamellae as solid colloid adsorption at the liquid gas interface generates lamellae that are more resistant to drainage thus a slightly higher rf p is observed 3 1 3 comparison between liquid gas co injection and sag fig 5 presents a picture of the foam front displacement taken at total pore volume injected of 0 27pv when gas is injected in a porous medium that was beforehand saturated by the foaming solution at cs 10 cmc a comparison with the previous figures shows that the front propagation is almost vertical and is very similar to that previously obtained during co injection this proves that foam is generated wherever gas and foaming solution are present in the porous medium and does not depend on the injection process 3 1 4 injection of dyed foaming solution to characterize the specific path taken by water and gas an experiment was performed with dyed water similarly to the other experiments the porous medium was first saturated with aqueous solution to satisfy surfactant adsorption a foaming solution was then dyed by adding fluorescein and co injection was performed under the same conditions as before the path of the newly injected solution could then be followed as it appears in yellow in figs 2b and 6 after injection of respectively 0 28 and 2 4 pv in fig 6 two zones with different colours are observed gas and aqueous dyed solution are co injected at a given value of foam quality and after 2 4 pv of total fluid injected the entire tank is saturated with foam however a colour difference can be observed from top to bottom which establishes the presence of a vertical foam quality stratification the aqueous foaming solution in yellow is moving down slowly while gas is moving up without preventing foam formation and propagation in the porous medium this behaviour can be explained in the following way literature results shows khatib et al 1988 that as gas fraction increases the apparent viscosity and capillary pressure p c increase until they reach a maximum value at f g at that critical gas fraction the apparent viscosity is maximum and p c reaches its ultimate value p c below f g foam is in the low quality regime gas is discontinuous and trapped in a lamellae network the pressure drop is independent of the gas velocity and depends on the liquid velocity in contrast for f g f g foam is in the high quality regime where the pressure drop is dependent of the gas velocity and independent of the liquid velocity for gas fraction well above f g the occurrence of bubbles coalescence increases drastically leading to an increase in gas mobility and a decrease in the apparent viscosity consequently in the vicinity of f g a given apparent viscosity may correspond to two f g values one of them f g and the other f g in those experiments nitrogen and the foaming solution were co injected at f g 87 5 which was previously determined as being close to f g forey et al 2020 however in 2d experiments due to the impact of buoyancy the local gas fraction should span from lower quality in the bottom of the container to higher quality at the top moreover the change of pressure with height is low fig 7 and results are consistent foam quality is higher at the top and the pressure drop is almost independent of the liquid phase velocity in other words based on the water mobility map fig 6 a small spatial variation of s w can largely impact the relative permeability to water k rw portois et al 2018b leading to an easier water flow in the lower part in the meantime the s w gradient has little impact on the relative permeability to gas k rg thus explaining why the front displacement is almost vertical and why the f g gradient has a limited impact on the velocity height dependency this specific study indeed corroborates the spatial variation observed of both velocity front displacement and resistance factor 3 1 5 pressure drop analysis the behaviour of foam generation and propagation in 2d porous media can be analyzed considering the absolute pressure measurements p f and p w at each pressure tap during co injection however and for convenience the study was restricted to pressure taps located at d e and f measurement points see fig 1 to follow foam displacement at three different heights 5 15 and 25 cm thereby the resistance factor rf p is plotted versus the injected pore volume corresponding to time in fig 7 for such a bottom middle and top positions foaming conditions are the same as in fig 2 once co injection begins at t t 1 a sudden increase is observed as aqueous solution flows at that location between t 1 and t 2 the plateau value equals unity as only water is flowing at t t 2 the pressure suddenly increases once foam reaches the pressure taps then between t 2 and t 3 foam steadily propagates within the porous medium and pressure linearly increases as a function of the injected volume in a similar way to what was observed in 1d column experiments forey et al 2020 at t t 3 foam breakthrough bt is observed while pressure keeps increasing this behaviour is in apparent contrast with what is usually observed in column experiments where pressure quickly stabilized after the breakthrough in a previously published work portois et al portois et al 2018b have noted that when a pre generated foam is injected in a porous medium initially containing a surfactant free water 8 pv beyond the bt were necessary to reach a steady state they attributed this delay to surfactant adsorption however such an explanation cannot hold here because the porous medium was saturated with surfactant prior to nitrogen foaming solution co injection a possible explanation is that when foam locally breaks through pressure at the corresponding exit point suddenly increases from water pressure to foam pressure as a consequence and to maintain the flow regime in the container the pressure at taps d e and f increases keeping constant the pressure drop this process continues until both exiting sides of the container are filled with foam which is when the injected volume is around 1 2 pv in the last step the pressure level is nearly stabilized showing a new plateau that reflects the equilibrium between the lamella creation rate and its destruction probably due to strong capillary pressure high drainage and coalescence experimental data fig 7 also show that the local pressure slowly increases from the bottom to the top of the tank this indicates a slight foam weakening with height as suggested by the small change in the velocity front fig 4b although one must keep in mind that when gas fraction fluctuates around f g the local viscosity is only moderately changed 3 2 foam propagation in the presence of oil in the previous section foam formation and propagation were investigated in a 2d porous media for different formulations by focusing on the resistance factor and propagation front however and for application purposes the aim of the present study was to investigate how foam behaves when it comes in contact with oil to this end the previous experiments have been repeated with an upper layer of the porous medium now containing oil at residual saturation s or it is worth noting that similarly to the previous experiments the upper exit point was closed first the influence of saponin concentration on the foam front displacement and resistance factor were investigated before considering the effect of the addition of sio2 solid colloids in the first experiment a 3 2 cmc based foam was injected in a porous medium saturated with surfactant with a top layer at s or foam quality and total flow rate were the same as used for experiments in the absence of oil such experiment was then repeated for concentrations of 10 cmc of saponin and 10 cmc saponin 0 5 wt sio2 pictures taken after co injection of 0 27 pv are displayed on fig 8 for each formulation and call for some preliminary remarks below the oily layer the foam displacement front is almost vertical whatever the formulation with small fluctuations in the transverse direction for 3 2 cmc of saponin fig 8a a fast foam destruction is observed when it comes in contact with oil then a 3d connected gaseous phase forms and gas breakthrough happens shortly after with an apparent fingering effect and a mean velocity much higher than in the rest of the container for 10 cmc of saponin fig 8b the displacement front in the oily zone is more stable than for low saponin concentration even if oil induced destruction through bubble coalescence can still be observed as a consequence a partial phase segregation occurs arising in a local oblique displacement front with a mean velocity in the top layer more than twice the mean velocity in the bottom layer for 10 cmc of saponin 0 5 wt sio2 fig 8c the oily layer is more efficiently swept and the displacement front is straightened this brings out that sio2 particles effectively act as a damping agent against oil induced bubble coalescence as recalled in the absence of oil sio2 addition moderately contributes to foam strengthening and mainly contributes to foam stabilization in the presence of oil these foams usually termed as pickering like foams are then less brittle and have a higher resistance to oil induced destruction it should be noted that for all these experiments no noticeable oil was produced during co injection and that s or was nearly constant over time besides these visual observations water saturation s w as well as the local resistance factor rf p were continuously determined during co injection in the present situation some of the pressure sensors were located in the oil free layer and others in the oily layer to illustrate the general features observed fig 9 shows the rf p variations as a function of the total injected volume for a foaming solution that contains 10 cmc saponin the rf p data correspond to the oil free zone through the pressure measurements at locations e f and in the oily layer through the pressure measurement at location d see fig 1 regardless of the absolute values of rf p the rf p vs pv curves in the oil free part of the container are quite similar to those already obtained in the absence of oil however in the oily domain the curve significantly changes especially before gas breakthrough as the co injection process begins the pressure increases after a very short plateau regime while such a plateau holds in the oil free zone until t t 2 in fact in the oily part of the container when foam comes in contact with oil some coalescence events occur and foam partially loses its structure and becomes weaker consequently the lamellae density decreases and continuous gaseous channels are formed where gas quickly propagates after gas breakthrough bt all pressure signals change in a similar way but because the upper exit tap j is turned off it is difficult to quantitatively compare visual observations with the rf p versus pv curves however to get an overall idea on how these formulations behave in the presence of oil the average of ultimate rf p values from the entire container can be compared these data are given on table 3 where both water saturation and the initial s or in the top layer are also given firstly whatever the formulation the average rf p values are lower in the presence of oil table 3 a consequence of the loss of foam structure due to the defoaming contribution of oil such a loss is more remarkable in the case of 3 2 cmc saponin and is significantly less pronounced for other formulations secondly a velocity ratio vr can be calculated by time averaging the front velocity in the top layer v tot divided by that corresponding to oil free zone before gas breakthrough v bottom 3 vr v tot v bottom these data are also given in table 3 the velocity ratio is well above unity whatever the formulation due to the oil defoaming nature and this is more pronounced for 3 2 cmc for which foam is largely weakened in presence of oil for higher saponin content vr ratio noticeably decreases and such a decrease is even more pronounced when sio2 particles are added to the foaming solution besides by considering s w the remaining water saturations are indeed higher than those previously obtained in the absence of oil otherwise it is more telling by considering pressure maps drawn by using pressures measured at steady state to that end such pressure maps are displayed in fig 10 for the three formulations and for the two kinds of experiments it may be seen therefore that the increase in saponin and sio2 concentrations makes foam stronger and that in the presence of oil foam becomes weaker however the use of solid colloids such as silica particles appears to be a way to stem foam destruction by oil as pressures are higher than in the case of silica free formulations and present as vertical fronts it appears that the presence of foam in the system not only allows a full sweeping of the porous medium but also has a blocking effect on the full height of the tank even in the presence of residual oil thus the suggested mechanism for foam propagation is the following as gas and foaming solution starts invading the lower part of the porous medium foam is created and starts propagating then as foam reaches the upper layer containing oil it is partly destroyed and locally generates a higher relative permeability to gas it thus facilitates flow with a preferential path visualized by a high front velocity the increase in velocity in the top of the tank leads to an increased pressure as gas and surfactant solution are injected into the porous medium foam strengthens in the top layer and given the right formulation a vertical front can be observed meanwhile in the bottom layer foam propagates with a lower velocity it is slightly affected by the presence of oil in the top layer because some gas is deviated to the top layer implying that foam quality may drop below 87 5 in the bottom layer as foam keeps propagating pressure gradually reaches equilibrium and after a few pv stabilization is reached foam entirely fills the porous medium with homogeneous pressures on the full height showing the foam ability to entirely block the porous medium even in areas initially at s or 4 conclusion first it is worth remembering that the goal of the present study was to investigate how the presence of oil impacts foam formation during a liquid gas co injection process literature and previous experiments have shown that organic phases such as lnapl usually act as defoaming agents that thwart the use of foam in remediation treatments so the focus was here put on obtaining a strong foam that undergoes minimum buoyancy effects and is significantly resistant to oil to meet these requirements the synergy between a biological surfactant saponin and silica colloidal particles was explored to obtain a strong and stable foam in the investigations gas liquid co injection experiments were carried out in a large size 2d porous medium in the absence and in the presence of oil when no oil is present even under circumstances of high foam quality and optimum total flow rate foam displacement is not trivial albeit foam visually sweeps the porous medium in a piston like way buoyancy segregation still acts and a gas liquid saturation gradient takes place across the flow direction the corresponding local resistance factor instantaneous velocity and water saturation values are consistent with each other this observed behaviour was coherent with the variation of foam quality across the container and with the impact of such a variation on foam viscosity taking into account that the injected gas fraction was close to its critical value f g as the surfactant concentration increases foam strengthens due to a higher lamellae stability that prevents bubbles to coalesce if sio2 colloidal particles are incorporated in the formulation the resistance factor is slightly enhanced and s w is substantially decreased this may be summarized by saying that sio2 addition probably arises in thicker lamellae without significantly affecting the foam structure and bubbles are in a shield consisting of solid sio2 colloidal particles by repeating the experiment in the presence of a layer initially at residual oil saturation formed foams are destroyed when they come in contact with oil thus increasing the local gas mobility while it seems unaffected in the rest of the container however foam resistance to oil induced destruction is less damaging when the surfactant concentration increases and is damped when sio2 particles are added to the formulation finally it should be reminded that the co injection process is restricted to medium permeability porous media and that foam pre generation is indicated in case of highly permeable porous media maire et al 2018 aranda et al 2020 moreover after bubble generation solid colloids can adsorb at the gas liquid interface due to their slow diffusion besides the significant energy intake needed for particles adsorption so the process efficiency is multifactorial and depends among other things on the characteristics of the porous medium the oil composition the nature of the foaming solution and the gas and aqueous solution injection rates those characteristics should hence be studied and taken into account before using the technique on the field declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was founded by innovasol consortium we thank marian momtbrun for assistance in

1446,foam can be used to achieve environmental remediation in case of contamination caused by light non aqueous phase spills however when it comes in contact with oily pollutants foam becomes weaker and its life time is greatly reduced such weakening can be dampened by using silica particles together with saponin surfactant which were shown to reinforce foam in bulk and 1d sandpack experiments here is addressed both foam propagation in a 2d porous media when buoyancy and gravity interfere and foam behaviour when in contact with floating oil therefore macroscopic foam displacement and specific liquid and gas phases behaviours were studied in a 2d tank a piston like displacement was observed during foam propagation in the absence of oil while foam liquid phase was influenced by gravity and did not propagate homogeneously on entire tank height in the presence of oil foam was partly destroyed which increased the local permeability of gas and created new preferential paths for gas flow this effect was partially avoided via a surfactant concentration increase but solid colloidal particles turned out to be a more efficient stabilizing agent by significantly increasing foam strength and its oil tolerance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foam porous medium colloidal particle light non aqueous phase liquid 2d tank 1 introduction remediation of light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl contaminated soils is crucial for public health and environmental issues it can be achieved using different techniques varying with pollution type and contamination depth soil permeability and soil geophysical properties depending on the chosen treatment remediation strategies can be ex situ the pollution is treated outside the site and excavation is necessary however due to the cost of excavation the use of in situ remediation techniques is indicated among these techniques surfactant flushing allows reduction of the surface tension between water and the pollutant easing pollutant removal and solubilisation of the hydrocarbon molecules in surfactant micelles nevertheless the needed amount of surfactant may be too high and the sweeping efficiency is sometimes low especially in heterogeneous porous media to avoid these drawbacks the use of aqueous foam is recommended hirasaki et al 1997 liquid foam is made of a gaseous phase dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase the thin films separating gas bubbles are called lamellae and are stabilized by surfactants these amphiphilic molecules adsorb at the gas water interface decrease the interfacial tension limiting bubble coalescence and film rupture such a dispersion of gas in a liquid phase results in a high viscosity fluid where gravity segregation channelling and fingering are avoided apaydin kovscek 2001 and consequently gas mobility is severely reduced bertin et al 1999 because of its high viscosity foam can be used to block high permeability zones of a heterogeneous porous medium thus allowing other injected fluids to access low permeability zones that are then more easily swept kovscek bertin 2003 foam can also serve as a tool in remediation strategy to recover floating pollutant with a good sweeping efficiency by pushing it to a pumping well bertin et al 2017 or to bring oxidative chemicals to the contaminant source where they will react with the pollutant to form non toxic compounds shen et al 2011 it can also serve to confine a polluted area waiting for the appropriate treatment portois et al 2018a for the method that aims to recover a floating pollutant the objective is to inject foam underneath a lnapl layer so as to decrease the water flow towards the pumping well in order to increase the pumping rate of the lnapl this may be achieved with a foam of high sweeping efficiency and high viscosity however to be of optimum quality and be efficient foam has to fulfil two requirements the first requirement is to be of low sensitivity to buoyancy and such a sensitivity is related to foam structure its quality and its viscosity the second requirement is foam formulation which should be robust enough to resist oil induced de foaming effect indeed foam is destabilized by oil both in bulk and in porous medium almajid kovscek 2016 this process has been extensively studied and is mainly governed by the destabilization of the foam oil interface called pseudo emulsion film farajzadeh et al 2012 therefore additional foam reinforcement is necessary in that respect it was concluded from previous experiments performed in 1d sandpack columns that the addition of native silica colloidal particles does effectively increase foam resistance against oil induced coalescence forey et al 2020 by irreversibly adsorbing at the gas water interface silica particles increase the interfacial elasticity karakashev et al 2011 and steric repulsion thus decreasing the film drainage rate sun et al 2014 such a solid barrier in turn increases the strength of the pseudo emulsion film and reinforces foam resistance against oil to get a maximum foam stability depending on the system considered silica particles are sometimes surface treated to adjust their degree of hydrophobicity to an optimum value binks horozov 2005 silica particles also have the benefit of being natural products commonly used in food or medical applications dickinson 2010 to study buoyancy effects and because they were negligible in 1d sandpack experiments the focus is here placed on foam displacement in a 2d vertical porous medium to mimic the application conditions the objectives of the experiments are to characterize foam behaviour in a vertical porous medium and to investigate how the liquid and gas phases of foam typically flow our work relies on the work of a few authors who have investigated foam propagation in 2d tanks for soil remediation bertin et al 2017 longpré girard et al 2016 bouzid et al 2018 although some authors studied foam reinforced with solid colloidal particles in 2d tanks the performance of such pickering like foams was evaluated for enhanced oil recovery eor applications singh mohanty 2017 tsai et al 2009 and they used quite different operating conditions and surfactants injecting foam only in small containers where buoyancy was of less relevance singh mohanty 2017 moreover given the environmental application foam formulation should in fact be as friendly as possible so saponin a biodegradable surfactant was chosen for foam generation in the present study it is a plant based surfactant with interesting foaming properties pradhan bhattacharyya 2017 and has been successfully used for the removal of heavy metals and mixed contaminants via desorption and solubilisation of contaminants mulligan 2009 it has also been used in synergy with solid colloidal particles for food grade foam stabilization so the main goal of this study is to explore the impact of foam formulation on individual phase displacement in a 2d vertical porous medium in the absence and in the presence of oil this was first achieved through the analysis of several macroscopic parameters sequential imaging pressure field and water saturation s w in these first experiments no oil was present since the objective was to determine how buoyancy modifies foam behaviour when surfactant and colloidal particles concentrations vary later foam behaviour was studied in the presence of a top layer at residual oil saturation s or to mimic a real operating situation and to study how solid particles affect foam resistance against oil 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals the surfactant used was saponin non ionic sigma aldrich france with a critical micelle concentration cmc of 0 062 wt native silica particles ludox tm 50 sigma aldrich france have a nominal size of 30 nm as measured by orts gils et al orts gil et al 2011 and were used as received as native solid particles suspensions were in aggregated state they were systematically sonicated 10 min by means of an ultrasonic bath equipment fisherbrandtm elmasonic fisher scientific france nitrogen of high purity purity 99 999 was supplied by air liquide france it was used to control the level of purity of the gas and to avoid potential oxidation of the chemicals by o2 the pollutant oil used was macron 1821 f 4 houghton us a refined cutting oil with a density of 0 818 at t 20 c when needed fluorescein sodium salt sigma aldrich france was used as an inert dying agent 2 2 preparation of foaming solutions and porous medium all foaming solutions were prepared using tap water which ionic strength was less than 10 2 m the surfactant saponin was dissolved in water at the desired concentration expressed as a multiple of critical micelle concentration cmc and steered at 400 rpm for at least twenty minutes to prepare aqueous solutions containing solid particles silica particles were first mechanically dispersed in a given amount of water and vigorously sonicated for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath in parallel the surfactant was dissolved in the same amount of water before blending the two solutions in convenient volume proportions a 40 cm long 3 cm wide and 30 cm high tank built with 3 cm thick transparent pmma sides was used as a container it was then packed with clean sand purchased from cantillana cantillana france with a d50 grain size of 279 μm 2 3 experimental set up the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 to generate foam aqueous foaming solution and nitrogen were simultaneously co injected into the 2 d porous medium to inject aqueous foaming solutions two piston pumps phd ultra harvard apparatus us were used with two syringes to inject nitrogen two mass flow meters el flow bronkhorst france were used in nominal conditions both gas and the foaming solution were injected at controlled flow rates ten digital pressure sensors idroscan from aep transducers italy regularly distributed across the porous medium were used to measure the absolute pressure the upper two taps situated at the tank sides were connected via a differential pressure transducer rosemount 2051 coplanar emerson france and a camera panasonic lumix dmc tz70 was used to take pictures of the tank during foam propagation finally the effluents were weighed over time and a mass balance calculated 2 4 experimental procedure experimental tests were designed to investigate different situations that are summarized in table 1 to understand how foam behaves in a 2d porous medium and how such behaviour is modified in the presence of an oil layer two sets of experiments were performed a first group of experiments was performed in the absence of oil the effect of surfactant concentration injection strategy gas liquid co injection versus surfactant alternating gas sag and solid particles addition were investigated the last experiment was performed with a dye added to the foaming solution during the co injection process the second group of experiments was performed in the presence of oil in the upper part of the 2d porous medium the influence of surfactant concentration and solid particles on foam flow was investigated those experiments are here interpreted and discussed through the pressure measurements and direct visualization of the foam front in the 2d porous media 2 4 1 experiments in the absence of oil the container was filled with sand by gradually introducing sand and water so that a water saturated porous medium is obtained with a known porosity and a known pore volume pv a layer of clay of approximately 15 mm was then added at the top to ensure no flux boundary conditions the top of the tank was then closed with a pmma plug to mechanically tighten it to satisfy surfactant adsorption prior to any foam propagation 3 3 pore volumes of surfactant solution at a concentration cs 10 cmc were injected into the water saturated porous medium this procedure is similar to that early used in 1d column experiments forey et al 2020 gas and foaming solution were then co injected at a total flow rate q tot 24 8 ml min 1 with a specified quality of 87 5 volume fraction of gas these conditions were previously determined from column experiments to be the ones giving the strongest saponin foam forey et al 2020 gas and foaming solution were separately injected through the two taps located at the bottom of the tank b and c while opening the two opposite taps to atmospheric pressure once injection began pictures were taken every minute to record the foam front displacement moreover when performing experiments the mass measurement of the outcoming liquid phase and pressure values at all taps locations led to the determination of the average water saturation s w of the porous medium 1 s w v w pv where v w is the volume of remaining water and pv is the total pore volume and a local resistance factor called rf p defined as 2 rf p p f p w qtot where p f and p w are respectively the absolute pressure measured for foam and water at the same flow rate and the same location for each pressure measurement tap rf p represents the increase in pressure due to the flow of foam in the porous medium and the higher the rf p the stronger the foam is values were calculated after flow reached steady state for each tap and a mean rf p was calculated based on rf p values throughout the tank because the mean rf p does not take into account the local pressure charge absolute pressure values were used to draw 2d pressure maps throughout the tank the pressure taps used to create those maps are contoured in yellow in fig 1 2 4 1 1 influence of surfactant concentration in order to study the influence of the surfactant concentration cs two cs values were chosen as for previous column experiments forey et al 2020 one of the experiments was performed with cs 3 2 cmc a formulation that has proven to give foam of intermediate strength and another one was conducted at cs 10 cmc which showed a higher foam strength with a higher rf p 2 4 1 2 surfactant and colloidal particles an experiment was carried out using a 10 cmc saponin foaming solution containing 0 5 wt sio2 to see if colloidal particles strengthened foam similarly to what was observed in 1d column experiments forey et al 2020 2 4 1 3 surfactant alternating gas experiment a surfactant alternating gas sag experiment was carried out to observe the gas phase displacement when injected alone the aim was to observe whether the liquid phase displacement influenced by any means the gas phase displacement to perform the sag experiment the porous medium was first saturated with a 10 cmc surfactant solution gas alone was then injected at the same total flow rate of q tot 24 8 ml min 1 than for other experiments and pictures taken every minute to record the gas displacement 2 4 1 4 experiments with dyed water during foam displacement in porous medium foam can be subject to buoyancy segregation with part of the gas phase being trapped in pores while the rest stays mobile this impacts the liquid phase displacement during co injection once the porous medium is filled with foam in order to dissociate the liquid phase flow from the foam flow fluorescein was added at 0 05 wt as a dye to the surfactant solution prior to co injection the path taken by the liquid phase could hence be clearly dissociated from the foam flow pictures were taken every minute to record the liquid phase displacement 2 4 2 experiments in the presence of oil experiments of foam propagation in the presence of oil were carried out with a top layer at s or residual oil saturation to mimic the sublayer of an oil spread that exists at the interface with an aquifer by injecting foam via the two lower injection taps b and c a strong foam could be generated before it comes in contact with oil these tests were done with 2 3 of the tank filled by gradually adding sand and water in the upper third only oil was used instead of water water was then injected at the top entry keeping open the opposite exit when no oil was produced anymore indicating that s or was reached in that layer water injection was stopped after that 3 3 pv of surfactant solution were injected to saturate the medium before starting co injection based on visual observation the instantaneous positions of the foam front were picked up water saturation and mean rf p were calculated for each experiment and measured absolute pressures were used to draw 2d pressure maps 3 results and discussion 3 1 foam propagation in the absence of oil 3 1 1 influence of surfactant concentration pictures taken at a total injected pore volume of 0 28 are displayed in fig 2 and a plot that represents the time evolution of the foam front propagation is shown in fig 3 pictures taken during foam displacement with cs 3 2 cmc and 10 cmc fig 2 show a piston like front during foam displacement with negligible buoyancy impact this observation is confirmed in fig 3 where it can be seen after the inlet effects the propagation of a regular and vertical front displacement the fact that the front is almost vertical proves that foam is generated wherever gas is present and that lamellae distribution is even on the full height in fact if foam was not formed only gas propagation would be observed with quick path through the top of the porous medium similarly a weak foam formation would generate a gradually decreasing density of lamellae on the full height of the container that may lead to an oblique propagation front mean rf p values representative of foam strength are displayed in table 2 on this table are also reported the ultimate water saturation as deduced from mass balance at equilibrium state the mean rf p is equal to 7 9 for 3 2 cmc significantly below that corresponding to 10 cmc 9 7 meaning that foam strength does increase with cs in the meantime s w remains stable at 0 36 those observations indicate that the foam is so strong that it propagates with a piston like movement and that the surfactant concentration has a minor impact on both s w and the shape of the displacement front while foam strength is noticeably improved 3 1 2 influence of presence of colloidal particles in the foaming solution fig 4 represents the picture taken at a total injected pore volume of 0 28 fig 4a and a time evolution of the foam front fig 4b the front shape and propagation observed in fig 4a and b are very similar to the ones observed when foam is generated with surfactant alone this result confirms that foam is generated wherever gas is present in the porous medium and that the presence of solid particles does not undermine foam generation and propagation considering rf p its mean value is equal to 9 9 very close to 9 7 obtained in the absence of particles on the contrary the ultimate water saturation s w decreases from 0 35 to 0 30 table 2 when solid colloidal particles are added to the saponin based formulation indicating a better sweeping efficiency of the initially water saturated porous medium in the meantime a steady piston like foam front is observed poorly affected by buoyancy this decrease of s w is presumably due to the formation of more rigid lamellae as solid colloid adsorption at the liquid gas interface generates lamellae that are more resistant to drainage thus a slightly higher rf p is observed 3 1 3 comparison between liquid gas co injection and sag fig 5 presents a picture of the foam front displacement taken at total pore volume injected of 0 27pv when gas is injected in a porous medium that was beforehand saturated by the foaming solution at cs 10 cmc a comparison with the previous figures shows that the front propagation is almost vertical and is very similar to that previously obtained during co injection this proves that foam is generated wherever gas and foaming solution are present in the porous medium and does not depend on the injection process 3 1 4 injection of dyed foaming solution to characterize the specific path taken by water and gas an experiment was performed with dyed water similarly to the other experiments the porous medium was first saturated with aqueous solution to satisfy surfactant adsorption a foaming solution was then dyed by adding fluorescein and co injection was performed under the same conditions as before the path of the newly injected solution could then be followed as it appears in yellow in figs 2b and 6 after injection of respectively 0 28 and 2 4 pv in fig 6 two zones with different colours are observed gas and aqueous dyed solution are co injected at a given value of foam quality and after 2 4 pv of total fluid injected the entire tank is saturated with foam however a colour difference can be observed from top to bottom which establishes the presence of a vertical foam quality stratification the aqueous foaming solution in yellow is moving down slowly while gas is moving up without preventing foam formation and propagation in the porous medium this behaviour can be explained in the following way literature results shows khatib et al 1988 that as gas fraction increases the apparent viscosity and capillary pressure p c increase until they reach a maximum value at f g at that critical gas fraction the apparent viscosity is maximum and p c reaches its ultimate value p c below f g foam is in the low quality regime gas is discontinuous and trapped in a lamellae network the pressure drop is independent of the gas velocity and depends on the liquid velocity in contrast for f g f g foam is in the high quality regime where the pressure drop is dependent of the gas velocity and independent of the liquid velocity for gas fraction well above f g the occurrence of bubbles coalescence increases drastically leading to an increase in gas mobility and a decrease in the apparent viscosity consequently in the vicinity of f g a given apparent viscosity may correspond to two f g values one of them f g and the other f g in those experiments nitrogen and the foaming solution were co injected at f g 87 5 which was previously determined as being close to f g forey et al 2020 however in 2d experiments due to the impact of buoyancy the local gas fraction should span from lower quality in the bottom of the container to higher quality at the top moreover the change of pressure with height is low fig 7 and results are consistent foam quality is higher at the top and the pressure drop is almost independent of the liquid phase velocity in other words based on the water mobility map fig 6 a small spatial variation of s w can largely impact the relative permeability to water k rw portois et al 2018b leading to an easier water flow in the lower part in the meantime the s w gradient has little impact on the relative permeability to gas k rg thus explaining why the front displacement is almost vertical and why the f g gradient has a limited impact on the velocity height dependency this specific study indeed corroborates the spatial variation observed of both velocity front displacement and resistance factor 3 1 5 pressure drop analysis the behaviour of foam generation and propagation in 2d porous media can be analyzed considering the absolute pressure measurements p f and p w at each pressure tap during co injection however and for convenience the study was restricted to pressure taps located at d e and f measurement points see fig 1 to follow foam displacement at three different heights 5 15 and 25 cm thereby the resistance factor rf p is plotted versus the injected pore volume corresponding to time in fig 7 for such a bottom middle and top positions foaming conditions are the same as in fig 2 once co injection begins at t t 1 a sudden increase is observed as aqueous solution flows at that location between t 1 and t 2 the plateau value equals unity as only water is flowing at t t 2 the pressure suddenly increases once foam reaches the pressure taps then between t 2 and t 3 foam steadily propagates within the porous medium and pressure linearly increases as a function of the injected volume in a similar way to what was observed in 1d column experiments forey et al 2020 at t t 3 foam breakthrough bt is observed while pressure keeps increasing this behaviour is in apparent contrast with what is usually observed in column experiments where pressure quickly stabilized after the breakthrough in a previously published work portois et al portois et al 2018b have noted that when a pre generated foam is injected in a porous medium initially containing a surfactant free water 8 pv beyond the bt were necessary to reach a steady state they attributed this delay to surfactant adsorption however such an explanation cannot hold here because the porous medium was saturated with surfactant prior to nitrogen foaming solution co injection a possible explanation is that when foam locally breaks through pressure at the corresponding exit point suddenly increases from water pressure to foam pressure as a consequence and to maintain the flow regime in the container the pressure at taps d e and f increases keeping constant the pressure drop this process continues until both exiting sides of the container are filled with foam which is when the injected volume is around 1 2 pv in the last step the pressure level is nearly stabilized showing a new plateau that reflects the equilibrium between the lamella creation rate and its destruction probably due to strong capillary pressure high drainage and coalescence experimental data fig 7 also show that the local pressure slowly increases from the bottom to the top of the tank this indicates a slight foam weakening with height as suggested by the small change in the velocity front fig 4b although one must keep in mind that when gas fraction fluctuates around f g the local viscosity is only moderately changed 3 2 foam propagation in the presence of oil in the previous section foam formation and propagation were investigated in a 2d porous media for different formulations by focusing on the resistance factor and propagation front however and for application purposes the aim of the present study was to investigate how foam behaves when it comes in contact with oil to this end the previous experiments have been repeated with an upper layer of the porous medium now containing oil at residual saturation s or it is worth noting that similarly to the previous experiments the upper exit point was closed first the influence of saponin concentration on the foam front displacement and resistance factor were investigated before considering the effect of the addition of sio2 solid colloids in the first experiment a 3 2 cmc based foam was injected in a porous medium saturated with surfactant with a top layer at s or foam quality and total flow rate were the same as used for experiments in the absence of oil such experiment was then repeated for concentrations of 10 cmc of saponin and 10 cmc saponin 0 5 wt sio2 pictures taken after co injection of 0 27 pv are displayed on fig 8 for each formulation and call for some preliminary remarks below the oily layer the foam displacement front is almost vertical whatever the formulation with small fluctuations in the transverse direction for 3 2 cmc of saponin fig 8a a fast foam destruction is observed when it comes in contact with oil then a 3d connected gaseous phase forms and gas breakthrough happens shortly after with an apparent fingering effect and a mean velocity much higher than in the rest of the container for 10 cmc of saponin fig 8b the displacement front in the oily zone is more stable than for low saponin concentration even if oil induced destruction through bubble coalescence can still be observed as a consequence a partial phase segregation occurs arising in a local oblique displacement front with a mean velocity in the top layer more than twice the mean velocity in the bottom layer for 10 cmc of saponin 0 5 wt sio2 fig 8c the oily layer is more efficiently swept and the displacement front is straightened this brings out that sio2 particles effectively act as a damping agent against oil induced bubble coalescence as recalled in the absence of oil sio2 addition moderately contributes to foam strengthening and mainly contributes to foam stabilization in the presence of oil these foams usually termed as pickering like foams are then less brittle and have a higher resistance to oil induced destruction it should be noted that for all these experiments no noticeable oil was produced during co injection and that s or was nearly constant over time besides these visual observations water saturation s w as well as the local resistance factor rf p were continuously determined during co injection in the present situation some of the pressure sensors were located in the oil free layer and others in the oily layer to illustrate the general features observed fig 9 shows the rf p variations as a function of the total injected volume for a foaming solution that contains 10 cmc saponin the rf p data correspond to the oil free zone through the pressure measurements at locations e f and in the oily layer through the pressure measurement at location d see fig 1 regardless of the absolute values of rf p the rf p vs pv curves in the oil free part of the container are quite similar to those already obtained in the absence of oil however in the oily domain the curve significantly changes especially before gas breakthrough as the co injection process begins the pressure increases after a very short plateau regime while such a plateau holds in the oil free zone until t t 2 in fact in the oily part of the container when foam comes in contact with oil some coalescence events occur and foam partially loses its structure and becomes weaker consequently the lamellae density decreases and continuous gaseous channels are formed where gas quickly propagates after gas breakthrough bt all pressure signals change in a similar way but because the upper exit tap j is turned off it is difficult to quantitatively compare visual observations with the rf p versus pv curves however to get an overall idea on how these formulations behave in the presence of oil the average of ultimate rf p values from the entire container can be compared these data are given on table 3 where both water saturation and the initial s or in the top layer are also given firstly whatever the formulation the average rf p values are lower in the presence of oil table 3 a consequence of the loss of foam structure due to the defoaming contribution of oil such a loss is more remarkable in the case of 3 2 cmc saponin and is significantly less pronounced for other formulations secondly a velocity ratio vr can be calculated by time averaging the front velocity in the top layer v tot divided by that corresponding to oil free zone before gas breakthrough v bottom 3 vr v tot v bottom these data are also given in table 3 the velocity ratio is well above unity whatever the formulation due to the oil defoaming nature and this is more pronounced for 3 2 cmc for which foam is largely weakened in presence of oil for higher saponin content vr ratio noticeably decreases and such a decrease is even more pronounced when sio2 particles are added to the foaming solution besides by considering s w the remaining water saturations are indeed higher than those previously obtained in the absence of oil otherwise it is more telling by considering pressure maps drawn by using pressures measured at steady state to that end such pressure maps are displayed in fig 10 for the three formulations and for the two kinds of experiments it may be seen therefore that the increase in saponin and sio2 concentrations makes foam stronger and that in the presence of oil foam becomes weaker however the use of solid colloids such as silica particles appears to be a way to stem foam destruction by oil as pressures are higher than in the case of silica free formulations and present as vertical fronts it appears that the presence of foam in the system not only allows a full sweeping of the porous medium but also has a blocking effect on the full height of the tank even in the presence of residual oil thus the suggested mechanism for foam propagation is the following as gas and foaming solution starts invading the lower part of the porous medium foam is created and starts propagating then as foam reaches the upper layer containing oil it is partly destroyed and locally generates a higher relative permeability to gas it thus facilitates flow with a preferential path visualized by a high front velocity the increase in velocity in the top of the tank leads to an increased pressure as gas and surfactant solution are injected into the porous medium foam strengthens in the top layer and given the right formulation a vertical front can be observed meanwhile in the bottom layer foam propagates with a lower velocity it is slightly affected by the presence of oil in the top layer because some gas is deviated to the top layer implying that foam quality may drop below 87 5 in the bottom layer as foam keeps propagating pressure gradually reaches equilibrium and after a few pv stabilization is reached foam entirely fills the porous medium with homogeneous pressures on the full height showing the foam ability to entirely block the porous medium even in areas initially at s or 4 conclusion first it is worth remembering that the goal of the present study was to investigate how the presence of oil impacts foam formation during a liquid gas co injection process literature and previous experiments have shown that organic phases such as lnapl usually act as defoaming agents that thwart the use of foam in remediation treatments so the focus was here put on obtaining a strong foam that undergoes minimum buoyancy effects and is significantly resistant to oil to meet these requirements the synergy between a biological surfactant saponin and silica colloidal particles was explored to obtain a strong and stable foam in the investigations gas liquid co injection experiments were carried out in a large size 2d porous medium in the absence and in the presence of oil when no oil is present even under circumstances of high foam quality and optimum total flow rate foam displacement is not trivial albeit foam visually sweeps the porous medium in a piston like way buoyancy segregation still acts and a gas liquid saturation gradient takes place across the flow direction the corresponding local resistance factor instantaneous velocity and water saturation values are consistent with each other this observed behaviour was coherent with the variation of foam quality across the container and with the impact of such a variation on foam viscosity taking into account that the injected gas fraction was close to its critical value f g as the surfactant concentration increases foam strengthens due to a higher lamellae stability that prevents bubbles to coalesce if sio2 colloidal particles are incorporated in the formulation the resistance factor is slightly enhanced and s w is substantially decreased this may be summarized by saying that sio2 addition probably arises in thicker lamellae without significantly affecting the foam structure and bubbles are in a shield consisting of solid sio2 colloidal particles by repeating the experiment in the presence of a layer initially at residual oil saturation formed foams are destroyed when they come in contact with oil thus increasing the local gas mobility while it seems unaffected in the rest of the container however foam resistance to oil induced destruction is less damaging when the surfactant concentration increases and is damped when sio2 particles are added to the formulation finally it should be reminded that the co injection process is restricted to medium permeability porous media and that foam pre generation is indicated in case of highly permeable porous media maire et al 2018 aranda et al 2020 moreover after bubble generation solid colloids can adsorb at the gas liquid interface due to their slow diffusion besides the significant energy intake needed for particles adsorption so the process efficiency is multifactorial and depends among other things on the characteristics of the porous medium the oil composition the nature of the foaming solution and the gas and aqueous solution injection rates those characteristics should hence be studied and taken into account before using the technique on the field declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was founded by innovasol consortium we thank marian momtbrun for assistance in

1447,the objective of this study is to estimate hydraulic conductivities and biodegradation rate constants in a coal tar contaminated aquifer by compound specific isotope analysis csia and tracer based 3h 3he groundwater dating tgd in two observation wells downgradient from the contaminant source in situ biodegradation of o xylene toluene and naphthalene under sulfate reducing redox conditions could be demonstrated using csia median biodegradation rate constants for o xylene ranging between 0 08 and 0 22 a 1 were estimated by using tracer based groundwater dating in these two wells hydraulic conductivities could be also estimated which are in a similar range as k values derived from sieve analysis a pumping test and a calibrated groundwater flow model these results clearly demonstrate the applicability of tracer based groundwater dating for the determination of in situ hydraulic conductivities in aquifers without pumping contaminated groundwater finally a sensitivity analysis is performed using a monte carlo simulation these results indicate high sensitivities of the assumed effective porosity for the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity and the selected isotope enrichment factor for the biodegradation rate constant respectively conversely the outcome also evidently demonstrates the main limitations of the novel combined isotope approach for a successful implementation of monitored natural attenuation mna at such field sites keywords coal tar compound specific isotope analysis csia 3h 3he dating hydraulic conductivity biodegradation 1 introduction the contamination of the subsurface due to leaking point sources from industrial plants is a widespread issue and often requires extensive long term monitoring and remediation schwarzenbach et al 2010 a common example for such incidences is the release of coal tar and creosote constituents into the subsurface most of the latter occur as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl once they enter the subsurface these liquids typically seep through unsaturated and saturated zones of the aquifer until reaching a natural barrier such as impermeable or low permeable soils or geological layers where they tend to accumulate and migrate in groundwater flow direction e g d affonseca et al 2008a when it comes to monitoring and remediation biodegradation is often considered as an appropriate remediation strategy in the form of monitored natural attenuation mna at such sites e g blum et al 2007 2011 martus and schaal 2010 the qualitative and quantitative proof of biodegradation is crucial for a successful implementation of mna e g rügner et al 2006 during the last decades stable compound specific isotope analysis csia has been established as the major method for assessing the occurrence of biodegradation in contaminated aquifers e g sturchio et al 1998 hunkeler et al 1999a sherwood lollar and slater 2001 richnow et al 2003a 2003b griebler et al 2004 it uses the fact that bio chemical reactions degrading organic contaminants are accompanied by isotope fractionation according to the kinetic isotope effect elsner 2010 a large number of studies exist showing the potential of csia thus one can assess the fate of organic pollutants meckenstock et al 2004 braeckevelt et al 2012 differentiate between multiple source zones hunkeler et al 2004 or reveal transformation mechanisms and pathways via multi isotope analysis elsner et al 2005 however the concept of csia also have some challenges and limitations it struggles when concentrations of organic contaminants are low and therefore only tap the full potential at highly polluted field sites schmidt et al 2004 furthermore field applicability suffers from factors that potentially influence observable isotope shifts namely limited bioavailability braeckevelt et al 2012 and physical processes such as sorption and diffusion even though their impact is considered to be minor kuntze et al 2020 nevertheless csia has been used for successful assessment of biodegradation in field studies for various pollutants such as mono btex and polyaromatic hydrocarbons e g richnow et al 2003a blum et al 2009 dorer et al 2016 chlorinated compounds hunkeler et al 1999b mundle et al 2012 damgaard et al 2013 wanner et al 2016 and most recently for micropollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals schürner et al 2016 and herbicides milosevic et al 2013 the time scale of bio degradative processes can be evaluated using tracer based groundwater dating methods which are particularly advantageous in more complex geological settings amaral et al 2009 and aeppli et al 2010 first combined csia with 3h 3he groundwater dating while amaral et al 2009 2011 were unable to quantify biodegradation rates of the studied poly nitroaromatic compounds p nacs and chlorinated ethenes ces aeppli et al 2010 who also studied the transformation of chlorinated ethenes could determine pseudo first order biodegradation rates in the present study we therefore intend to determine hydraulic conductivities and biodegradation rate constants of monoaromatic compounds btex 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene and naphthalene by applying this combined isotope approach at a coal tar contaminated aquifer in germany hence a monitoring campaign at nine monitoring wells downstream of the source zone was performed the sampled groundwater was analyzed amongst others for the following stable isotopes δ13c deuterium 2h and tritium 3h in addition a sensitivity analysis using a monte carlo simulation was implemented to assess uncertainties and the impact of aquifer characteristics and other parameters on the determination of hydraulic conductivities and biodegradation rate constants 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the studied field site is located about 40 km southwest of hamburg germany fig 1a a former wood impregnation plant triggered the seepage of coal tar and creosote constituents resulting in a significant subsurface impact down to the regional upper aquifer at a depth of about 50 m below surface fig 1b glacial sand deposits of 130 m thickness form two aquifers separated by an aquitard the unconfined upper aquifer is divided into three sand layers with distinct grain sizes fig 1b layer one comprises medium to coarse sands starting from the surface down to 20 m layer two consists of medium sands from 20 m to 40 m below surface and the third layer is composed of coarse to medium sands down to 49 m the aquitard however mainly remains pristine and is not affected by the contamination due to a low permeable very silty fine sand layer acting as a natural barrier for vertical contaminant migration the water table varies between 18 and 19 m below surface and the groundwater flow direction is southeast blum et al 2009 the dnapls are enriched within the coarse to medium sand layer where they migrated in groundwater flow direction and formed an extensive contaminant plume of more than 450 m length blum et al 2009 in this layer the average hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity were previously determined to be 4 2 10 4 m s and 21 respectively blum et al 2007 the mean hydraulic gradient at the site is 1 5 10 3 blum et al 2007 the source zone is located about 50 m northwest from well g10m fig 1a and is well described in a previous study by d affonseca et al 2008a b the contaminants at the field site include mono polyaromatic hydrocarbons and also nso heterocycles representing the main constituents of the coal tar blum et al 2011 since remediation started in 1986 numerous monitoring wells have been installed around the source zone and downgradient forming a large monitoring network of more than 40 observation wells e g d affonseca et al 2008a blum et al 2009 most of the wells are installed in the lower aquifer layer with screen lengths of 4 to 5 m fig 1b the upper aquifer has also been well investigated and characterized by reactive transport models of the source and also the contaminant plume d affonseca et al 2008a 2008b 2011 furthermore in situ biodegradation could be qualitatively assessed by redox sensitive tapes and signature metabolite analysis blum et al 2006 quantitative approaches for biodegradation were later performed using michaelis menten kinetics and csia blum et al 2009 with the latter only biodegradation rate constants of o xylene and naphthalene could be explicitly derived under sulfate reducing conditions indicating the limitations of the csia further information on the main electron acceptors of the aquifer and the stable carbon isotope concentrations of the other sampled compounds are provided by blum et al 2009 and in table 2 for the second sampling campaign 2 2 compound specific stable isotope analysis groundwater samples were taken from nine monitoring wells downgradient of the source zone fig 1 stable carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of btex benzene toluene m p xylene o xylene 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene and naphthalene were determined using gas chromatography on line combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc c irms the contaminants were extracted in n pentane and introduced into the gc via splitless injection on a capillary column organic compounds were separated in the gc and converted to co2 h2 within a combustion reactor the latter were transferred to the irms for gauging corresponding ratios of 13co2 12co2 and 2h 1h a detailed description of the laboratory procedure is given by blum et al 2009 the csia results were expressed in the δ notation as shown below for carbon as example 1 δ 13 c r s a m p l e r s t d 1 1000 with r sample being the isotope ratio of the sample and r std representing the isotope ratio of a standard derived δ notations of 13c are summarized in fig 1b of all investigated compounds only carbon isotope ratios of o xylene showed noticeable shifts downgradient indicating active degradation according to the minimum shift of 2 relative to a reference well upgradient of the source hunkeler et al 2009 thus carbon isotope shifts of the sections formed by wells g10m g28u δδ13c 2 1 and wells g10m g30u δδ13c 4 3 were considered in the following calculations fig 1b similar findings were also found in a previous study by blum et al 2009 fig 2 illustrates that for o xylene 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene data not shown and naphthalene data not shown based on triple determinations only in 5 out 9 sampled groundwater wells hydrogen isotope ratios could be detected surprisingly the hydrogen isotope ratios did not show any variation related to potential biodegradation i e no positive isotope shift downgradient of the contaminant source one explanation why no hydrogen isotope shift could be observed might be the difficulties to analyse hydrogen isotopes at low concentrations i e 15 μg l o xylene fig 1 table 2 thus in the wells in which a hydrogen isotope fractionation could occur g28u and g30u no hydrogen isotope ratios could be determined due to the detection limit hence with the available data no isotope shift was observed and therefore are not further considered here 2 3 tracer based groundwater dating 3h 3he knowing the age of groundwater can help reconstructing groundwater flow paths and estimating horizontal or vertical flow velocity furthermore the past release of contaminants migrating into the aquifer can be reconstructed in this study groundwater ages i e infiltration times were determined with the 3h 3he method which uses the radioactive decay of tritium as a tracer the decay starts with the infiltration in the subsurface as part of precipitation 2 τ t 1 2 ln 2 ln 1 he 3 h 3 where t1 2 represents the half life of tritium 12 32 0 02 years and 3he and 3h are the concentrations of the tritiogenic 3he and tritium respectively the decay product of 3h is 3he which is an inert gas accumulates in the saturated zone thus the ratio of 3he 3h of a groundwater sample enables to calculate a piston flow age e g schlosser et al 1988 an advanced mass spectrometric system was used to analyse he isotopes and neon and tritium by the ingrowth of 3he sültenfuß et al 2009 fig 1b summarizes the resulting groundwater ages at all monitoring wells representing infiltration times from 19 years g10m up to 35 years g33u 2 4 determination of hydraulic conductivities hydraulic conductivities k f were derived by combining the simple expression v s t v velocity s distance t time with eq 3 resulting in eq 4 3 v a v f n e k f i n e 4 k f s n e t i v a is the seepage velocity v f is the apparent velocity of the groundwater flow n e is the effective porosity and i represents the hydraulic gradient furthermore t is the time needed for the groundwater to pass a certain distance s this period of time is determined using the previously described tracer based groundwater dating furthermore eq 4 was evaluated by performing a monte carlo analysis table 1 shows the corresponding input parameters and setup for the monte carlo simulation the parameter values for n e and i were taken from the previous study by blum et al 2007 for the distance s between the reference well g10m and g28u g30u a uniform distribution u was set with s min representing the direct horizontal pathway while s max additionally includes the maximum vertical variation in distance a normal distribution n was defined for groundwater residence times obtained from the 3h 3he groundwater dating including standard deviations from sültenfuß et al 2009 the number of iterations for the monte carlo simulation was set to 100 000 2 5 determination of biodegradation rate constants biodegradation λ was quantified using eq 5 by blum et al 2009 which combines the general first order expression with a simplified rayleigh approach and eq 4 the latter was solved for t and inserted in eq 5 which then result in eq 6 5 λ δ δ 13 c ε t 6 λ δ 13 c k f i ε s n e in line with chapter 2 4 eq 6 is also evaluated using monte carlo analysis hence a normal distribution n was defined for isotope shifts δδ13c accounting for measurement errors for well g30u however no errors could be quantified instead the largest error of all wells g40 was used for the analysis parameters s i and n e remained equal and an unmodified set of parameter values resulting from the prior simulation was used for hydraulic conductivities k f due to the lack of data for isotope enrichment factors ε under sulfate reducing conditions meckenstock et al 2004 a uniform distribution u was defined 3 results and discussion the results of the combined isotope approach csia and tgd are exemplarily shown for o xylene in fig 2 which is beside toluene with δδ13c 3 8 between the wells g10m and g33u and naphthalene with δδ13c 0 4 the only compound that actually indicates a noticeable change in carbon isotope signature these isotope shifts for o xylene toluene and naphthalene were already observed in the previous study by blum et al 2009 the minor isotope shift for naphthalene was also confirmed with the second sampling campaign december 2012 resulting in exactly the same isotope shift of 0 4 g10m and g33u in this previous study in situ first order biodegradation rate constants could therefore be estimated for o xylene and also naphthalene under sulfate reducing conditions the latter could be demonstrated by the significant change in sulfate concentrations in the centre of the contaminant plume blum et al 2009 which was also confirmed for the second sampling campaign in december 2012 table 2 the measured electron acceptors clearly show that sulfate reducing conditions are combined with stable carbon isotope shifts of o xylene in wells g28 and g30u in contrast in wells with high methane concentrations 1500 μg l g12u g26u g44 g33u and g41u where methanogenesis occur simultaneously with iron reduction no stable carbon isotope shifts are detected this co occurrence of iron reduction and methanogenesis pathways were recently also observed in a studied btex plume by teramoto et al 2020 hence the data suggest that if any significant isotope shifts occur it only takes place for biodegradation of o xylene toluene and naphthalene under sulfate reducing conditions table 3 summarizes the derived hydraulic conductivities in situ first order biodegradation rate constants and half lives for o xylene the derived half lives for o xylene range between 3 0 and 7 9 years and therefore are in good agreement with the previously determined half lives based on sieve analysis and pumping test data blum et al 2009 and a calibrated numerical flow model at the site d affonseca et al 2011 due to the low detection limit the groundwater dating using the he ingrowth method was very effective for the determination of a mean effective groundwater velocity v a of the studied aquifer the main advantage of the combined isotope approach using csia and tgd however is that no hydraulic tests are necessary and therefore no contaminated groundwater has to be extracted and treated before reinjection as the combined isotope approach only requires a single sampling and analysis campaign it is also more cost efficient yet in the present study this approach was only feasible for o xylene 3 1 monte carlo simulation to further investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the presented approach a monte carlo simulation was performed using the values and distributions provided in table 1 the outcome of the simulation is shown in fig 3 along with results from previous studies table 3 the simulated hydraulic conductivities for the two studied profiles wells g10m g28u and g10m g30u vary between 8 2 2 0 10 5 m s and 1 9 0 5 10 4 m s respectively the latter in particular is in good agreement with the hydraulic conductivity derived from the calibrated numerical groundwater flow model d affonseca et al 2011 whereas sieve analysis and pumping test data are out of range fig 2a this general overestimation of hydraulic conductivities derived from grain sieve analysis was already observed in various previous studies e g storz et al 2017 the lower and higher hydraulic conductivities are caused by different evaluated infiltration times this can be explained by local heterogeneities which were also observed in the previous study by d affonseca et al 2008a furthermore both distributions are bell curved indicating a normal distribution in contrast both determined distributions for the biodegradation rate constants are right skewed indicating a triangular distribution fig 3b this skewness might be related to the chosen weibull distribution for the hydraulic gradient which favors low hydraulic gradient values and or the truncated normal distribution of the isotope shift values which puts more emphasis on higher isotope shift values the relative contribution of the individual input parameters to the obtained results is further investigated by performing a sensitivity analysis in the following chapter 3 2 sensitivity analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficients srcc were determined and are illustrated in fig 4 the evaluated hydraulic conductivity is highly sensitive to the effective porosity with a correlation coefficient γ of 0 95 whereas other parameters show a negligible range of values for γ between 0 25 and 0 05 fig 3a the results clearly demonstrate the importance of the chosen value of effective porosity for a realistic estimate of hydraulic conductivity for biodegradation rate constants the isotope enrichment factor shows a dominating correlation coefficient of 0 98 hence high uncertainties for derived biodegradation rates mainly depend on this unknown quantity uncertainties associated with the enrichment factor are due to the applied large range of reported laboratory derived enrichment factors ranging in case of o xylene for sulfate reducing conditions between 3 2 and 1 1 e g meckenstock et al 2004 morasch et al 2004 herrmann et al 2009 vogt et al 2016 2018 the latter can be reduced by determining field derived isotope enrichment factor which for the studied site is 1 4 blum et al 2009 using the site specific isotope enrichment factor of 1 4 while keeping the remaining parameter uncertainties yields biodegradation rate constant values of 0 31 0 02 a 1 g10m g30u and 0 12 0 01 a 1 g10m g28u respectively indicating a slight shift into higher median values and a significant reduction in the variance of the results nevertheless the combined isotope approach of csia and 3h 3he groundwater dating helped addressing these uncertainties and clearly showed that accurate flow velocity estimates are crucial for evaluating appropriate degradation rate constants owing to aquifer heterogeneity höyng et al 2015 already stated the importance of implementing tracer based methods in heterogeneous aquifers when it comes to the evaluation of biodegradation rate constants the possible overestimation of degradation rates when dealing with heterogeneous flow velocities presented in this work was also observed in previous studies bauer et al 2006 beyer et al 2007 they concluded that this would result in imprecise estimates for the overall cleanup time and therefore also influence the risk assessment at contaminant sites 4 conclusion the combination of csia and 3h 3he groundwater dating tgd was used to determine hydraulic conductivities and biodegradation rates of o xylene at a coal tar contaminated aquifer hence isotope data from a monitoring campaign was also evaluated using a monte carlo simulation the following major findings could be drawn from our results the multi element csia approach of carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes has limited applicability at the studied site of all studied compounds only carbon isotopes of o xylene toluene and naphthalene showed noticeable shifts at two monitoring wells downgradient of the source zone whereas hydrogen isotope analysis could not be linked to in situ biodegradation using the tracer based groundwater dating effective hydraulic conductivities and groundwater velocities could be appropriately determined which are in good agreement with results from a calibrated groundwater flow model the combined isotope approach of csia and tgd enabled the quantification of bio degradation rate constants of o xylene under sulfate reducing conditions the chosen isotope enrichment factor has a major influence on the computed biodegradation rate constants as enrichment factors can be variable due to different biochemical activation reactions leading to different enrichment factors and the possible masking of isotope fractionation due to mass transfer related effects finally we can conclude that tracer based groundwater dating itself can be used to estimate effective in situ hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivities and groundwater velocities furthermore the combined csia and tgd approach enables the estimation of realistic in situ biodegradation rate constants presently the main disadvantage of this novel approach is its limitation to only few compounds hence future studies have to prove its reliability for other compounds and contaminated aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

1447,the objective of this study is to estimate hydraulic conductivities and biodegradation rate constants in a coal tar contaminated aquifer by compound specific isotope analysis csia and tracer based 3h 3he groundwater dating tgd in two observation wells downgradient from the contaminant source in situ biodegradation of o xylene toluene and naphthalene under sulfate reducing redox conditions could be demonstrated using csia median biodegradation rate constants for o xylene ranging between 0 08 and 0 22 a 1 were estimated by using tracer based groundwater dating in these two wells hydraulic conductivities could be also estimated which are in a similar range as k values derived from sieve analysis a pumping test and a calibrated groundwater flow model these results clearly demonstrate the applicability of tracer based groundwater dating for the determination of in situ hydraulic conductivities in aquifers without pumping contaminated groundwater finally a sensitivity analysis is performed using a monte carlo simulation these results indicate high sensitivities of the assumed effective porosity for the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity and the selected isotope enrichment factor for the biodegradation rate constant respectively conversely the outcome also evidently demonstrates the main limitations of the novel combined isotope approach for a successful implementation of monitored natural attenuation mna at such field sites keywords coal tar compound specific isotope analysis csia 3h 3he dating hydraulic conductivity biodegradation 1 introduction the contamination of the subsurface due to leaking point sources from industrial plants is a widespread issue and often requires extensive long term monitoring and remediation schwarzenbach et al 2010 a common example for such incidences is the release of coal tar and creosote constituents into the subsurface most of the latter occur as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl once they enter the subsurface these liquids typically seep through unsaturated and saturated zones of the aquifer until reaching a natural barrier such as impermeable or low permeable soils or geological layers where they tend to accumulate and migrate in groundwater flow direction e g d affonseca et al 2008a when it comes to monitoring and remediation biodegradation is often considered as an appropriate remediation strategy in the form of monitored natural attenuation mna at such sites e g blum et al 2007 2011 martus and schaal 2010 the qualitative and quantitative proof of biodegradation is crucial for a successful implementation of mna e g rügner et al 2006 during the last decades stable compound specific isotope analysis csia has been established as the major method for assessing the occurrence of biodegradation in contaminated aquifers e g sturchio et al 1998 hunkeler et al 1999a sherwood lollar and slater 2001 richnow et al 2003a 2003b griebler et al 2004 it uses the fact that bio chemical reactions degrading organic contaminants are accompanied by isotope fractionation according to the kinetic isotope effect elsner 2010 a large number of studies exist showing the potential of csia thus one can assess the fate of organic pollutants meckenstock et al 2004 braeckevelt et al 2012 differentiate between multiple source zones hunkeler et al 2004 or reveal transformation mechanisms and pathways via multi isotope analysis elsner et al 2005 however the concept of csia also have some challenges and limitations it struggles when concentrations of organic contaminants are low and therefore only tap the full potential at highly polluted field sites schmidt et al 2004 furthermore field applicability suffers from factors that potentially influence observable isotope shifts namely limited bioavailability braeckevelt et al 2012 and physical processes such as sorption and diffusion even though their impact is considered to be minor kuntze et al 2020 nevertheless csia has been used for successful assessment of biodegradation in field studies for various pollutants such as mono btex and polyaromatic hydrocarbons e g richnow et al 2003a blum et al 2009 dorer et al 2016 chlorinated compounds hunkeler et al 1999b mundle et al 2012 damgaard et al 2013 wanner et al 2016 and most recently for micropollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals schürner et al 2016 and herbicides milosevic et al 2013 the time scale of bio degradative processes can be evaluated using tracer based groundwater dating methods which are particularly advantageous in more complex geological settings amaral et al 2009 and aeppli et al 2010 first combined csia with 3h 3he groundwater dating while amaral et al 2009 2011 were unable to quantify biodegradation rates of the studied poly nitroaromatic compounds p nacs and chlorinated ethenes ces aeppli et al 2010 who also studied the transformation of chlorinated ethenes could determine pseudo first order biodegradation rates in the present study we therefore intend to determine hydraulic conductivities and biodegradation rate constants of monoaromatic compounds btex 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene and naphthalene by applying this combined isotope approach at a coal tar contaminated aquifer in germany hence a monitoring campaign at nine monitoring wells downstream of the source zone was performed the sampled groundwater was analyzed amongst others for the following stable isotopes δ13c deuterium 2h and tritium 3h in addition a sensitivity analysis using a monte carlo simulation was implemented to assess uncertainties and the impact of aquifer characteristics and other parameters on the determination of hydraulic conductivities and biodegradation rate constants 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the studied field site is located about 40 km southwest of hamburg germany fig 1a a former wood impregnation plant triggered the seepage of coal tar and creosote constituents resulting in a significant subsurface impact down to the regional upper aquifer at a depth of about 50 m below surface fig 1b glacial sand deposits of 130 m thickness form two aquifers separated by an aquitard the unconfined upper aquifer is divided into three sand layers with distinct grain sizes fig 1b layer one comprises medium to coarse sands starting from the surface down to 20 m layer two consists of medium sands from 20 m to 40 m below surface and the third layer is composed of coarse to medium sands down to 49 m the aquitard however mainly remains pristine and is not affected by the contamination due to a low permeable very silty fine sand layer acting as a natural barrier for vertical contaminant migration the water table varies between 18 and 19 m below surface and the groundwater flow direction is southeast blum et al 2009 the dnapls are enriched within the coarse to medium sand layer where they migrated in groundwater flow direction and formed an extensive contaminant plume of more than 450 m length blum et al 2009 in this layer the average hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity were previously determined to be 4 2 10 4 m s and 21 respectively blum et al 2007 the mean hydraulic gradient at the site is 1 5 10 3 blum et al 2007 the source zone is located about 50 m northwest from well g10m fig 1a and is well described in a previous study by d affonseca et al 2008a b the contaminants at the field site include mono polyaromatic hydrocarbons and also nso heterocycles representing the main constituents of the coal tar blum et al 2011 since remediation started in 1986 numerous monitoring wells have been installed around the source zone and downgradient forming a large monitoring network of more than 40 observation wells e g d affonseca et al 2008a blum et al 2009 most of the wells are installed in the lower aquifer layer with screen lengths of 4 to 5 m fig 1b the upper aquifer has also been well investigated and characterized by reactive transport models of the source and also the contaminant plume d affonseca et al 2008a 2008b 2011 furthermore in situ biodegradation could be qualitatively assessed by redox sensitive tapes and signature metabolite analysis blum et al 2006 quantitative approaches for biodegradation were later performed using michaelis menten kinetics and csia blum et al 2009 with the latter only biodegradation rate constants of o xylene and naphthalene could be explicitly derived under sulfate reducing conditions indicating the limitations of the csia further information on the main electron acceptors of the aquifer and the stable carbon isotope concentrations of the other sampled compounds are provided by blum et al 2009 and in table 2 for the second sampling campaign 2 2 compound specific stable isotope analysis groundwater samples were taken from nine monitoring wells downgradient of the source zone fig 1 stable carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of btex benzene toluene m p xylene o xylene 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene and naphthalene were determined using gas chromatography on line combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc c irms the contaminants were extracted in n pentane and introduced into the gc via splitless injection on a capillary column organic compounds were separated in the gc and converted to co2 h2 within a combustion reactor the latter were transferred to the irms for gauging corresponding ratios of 13co2 12co2 and 2h 1h a detailed description of the laboratory procedure is given by blum et al 2009 the csia results were expressed in the δ notation as shown below for carbon as example 1 δ 13 c r s a m p l e r s t d 1 1000 with r sample being the isotope ratio of the sample and r std representing the isotope ratio of a standard derived δ notations of 13c are summarized in fig 1b of all investigated compounds only carbon isotope ratios of o xylene showed noticeable shifts downgradient indicating active degradation according to the minimum shift of 2 relative to a reference well upgradient of the source hunkeler et al 2009 thus carbon isotope shifts of the sections formed by wells g10m g28u δδ13c 2 1 and wells g10m g30u δδ13c 4 3 were considered in the following calculations fig 1b similar findings were also found in a previous study by blum et al 2009 fig 2 illustrates that for o xylene 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene data not shown and naphthalene data not shown based on triple determinations only in 5 out 9 sampled groundwater wells hydrogen isotope ratios could be detected surprisingly the hydrogen isotope ratios did not show any variation related to potential biodegradation i e no positive isotope shift downgradient of the contaminant source one explanation why no hydrogen isotope shift could be observed might be the difficulties to analyse hydrogen isotopes at low concentrations i e 15 μg l o xylene fig 1 table 2 thus in the wells in which a hydrogen isotope fractionation could occur g28u and g30u no hydrogen isotope ratios could be determined due to the detection limit hence with the available data no isotope shift was observed and therefore are not further considered here 2 3 tracer based groundwater dating 3h 3he knowing the age of groundwater can help reconstructing groundwater flow paths and estimating horizontal or vertical flow velocity furthermore the past release of contaminants migrating into the aquifer can be reconstructed in this study groundwater ages i e infiltration times were determined with the 3h 3he method which uses the radioactive decay of tritium as a tracer the decay starts with the infiltration in the subsurface as part of precipitation 2 τ t 1 2 ln 2 ln 1 he 3 h 3 where t1 2 represents the half life of tritium 12 32 0 02 years and 3he and 3h are the concentrations of the tritiogenic 3he and tritium respectively the decay product of 3h is 3he which is an inert gas accumulates in the saturated zone thus the ratio of 3he 3h of a groundwater sample enables to calculate a piston flow age e g schlosser et al 1988 an advanced mass spectrometric system was used to analyse he isotopes and neon and tritium by the ingrowth of 3he sültenfuß et al 2009 fig 1b summarizes the resulting groundwater ages at all monitoring wells representing infiltration times from 19 years g10m up to 35 years g33u 2 4 determination of hydraulic conductivities hydraulic conductivities k f were derived by combining the simple expression v s t v velocity s distance t time with eq 3 resulting in eq 4 3 v a v f n e k f i n e 4 k f s n e t i v a is the seepage velocity v f is the apparent velocity of the groundwater flow n e is the effective porosity and i represents the hydraulic gradient furthermore t is the time needed for the groundwater to pass a certain distance s this period of time is determined using the previously described tracer based groundwater dating furthermore eq 4 was evaluated by performing a monte carlo analysis table 1 shows the corresponding input parameters and setup for the monte carlo simulation the parameter values for n e and i were taken from the previous study by blum et al 2007 for the distance s between the reference well g10m and g28u g30u a uniform distribution u was set with s min representing the direct horizontal pathway while s max additionally includes the maximum vertical variation in distance a normal distribution n was defined for groundwater residence times obtained from the 3h 3he groundwater dating including standard deviations from sültenfuß et al 2009 the number of iterations for the monte carlo simulation was set to 100 000 2 5 determination of biodegradation rate constants biodegradation λ was quantified using eq 5 by blum et al 2009 which combines the general first order expression with a simplified rayleigh approach and eq 4 the latter was solved for t and inserted in eq 5 which then result in eq 6 5 λ δ δ 13 c ε t 6 λ δ 13 c k f i ε s n e in line with chapter 2 4 eq 6 is also evaluated using monte carlo analysis hence a normal distribution n was defined for isotope shifts δδ13c accounting for measurement errors for well g30u however no errors could be quantified instead the largest error of all wells g40 was used for the analysis parameters s i and n e remained equal and an unmodified set of parameter values resulting from the prior simulation was used for hydraulic conductivities k f due to the lack of data for isotope enrichment factors ε under sulfate reducing conditions meckenstock et al 2004 a uniform distribution u was defined 3 results and discussion the results of the combined isotope approach csia and tgd are exemplarily shown for o xylene in fig 2 which is beside toluene with δδ13c 3 8 between the wells g10m and g33u and naphthalene with δδ13c 0 4 the only compound that actually indicates a noticeable change in carbon isotope signature these isotope shifts for o xylene toluene and naphthalene were already observed in the previous study by blum et al 2009 the minor isotope shift for naphthalene was also confirmed with the second sampling campaign december 2012 resulting in exactly the same isotope shift of 0 4 g10m and g33u in this previous study in situ first order biodegradation rate constants could therefore be estimated for o xylene and also naphthalene under sulfate reducing conditions the latter could be demonstrated by the significant change in sulfate concentrations in the centre of the contaminant plume blum et al 2009 which was also confirmed for the second sampling campaign in december 2012 table 2 the measured electron acceptors clearly show that sulfate reducing conditions are combined with stable carbon isotope shifts of o xylene in wells g28 and g30u in contrast in wells with high methane concentrations 1500 μg l g12u g26u g44 g33u and g41u where methanogenesis occur simultaneously with iron reduction no stable carbon isotope shifts are detected this co occurrence of iron reduction and methanogenesis pathways were recently also observed in a studied btex plume by teramoto et al 2020 hence the data suggest that if any significant isotope shifts occur it only takes place for biodegradation of o xylene toluene and naphthalene under sulfate reducing conditions table 3 summarizes the derived hydraulic conductivities in situ first order biodegradation rate constants and half lives for o xylene the derived half lives for o xylene range between 3 0 and 7 9 years and therefore are in good agreement with the previously determined half lives based on sieve analysis and pumping test data blum et al 2009 and a calibrated numerical flow model at the site d affonseca et al 2011 due to the low detection limit the groundwater dating using the he ingrowth method was very effective for the

necessary and therefore no contaminated groundwater has to be extracted and treated before reinjection as the combined isotope approach only requires a single sampling and analysis campaign it is also more cost efficient yet in the present study this approach was only feasible for o xylene 3 1 monte carlo simulation to further investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the presented approach a

simulated hydraulic conductivities for the two studied profiles wells g10m g28u and g10m g30u vary between 8 2 2 0 10 5 m s and 1 9 0 5 10 4 m s respectively the latter in particular is in good agreement with the hydraulic conductivity derived from the calibrated numerical groundwater flow model d affonseca et al 2011 whereas sieve analysis and pumping test data are out of range fig 2a this

are caused by different evaluated infiltration times this can be explained by local heterogeneities which were also observed in the previous study by d affonseca et al 2008a furthermore both distributions are bell curved indicating a normal distribution in contrast both determined distributions for the biodegradation rate constants are right skewed indicating a triangular distribution fig 3b this skewness might be related to the chosen weibull distribution for the hydraulic gradient which favors low hydraulic gradient values and or the truncated normal distribution of the isotope shift values which puts more emphasis on higher isotope shift values the relative contribution of the individual input parameters to the obtained results is further investigated by performing a sensitivity

isotope enrichment factor of 1 4 while keeping the remaining parameter uncertainties yields biodegradation rate constant values of 0 31 0 02 a 1 g10m g30u and 0 12 0 01 a 1 g10m g28u respectively

1448,a viable means of quantifying the rate of natural source zone depletion nszd at hydrocarbon contaminated sites is by the measurement of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 effluxes at the surface this methodology assumes that gas effluxes are reflective of actual contaminant degradation rates in the subsurface which is only accurate for quasi steady state conditions however in reality subsurface systems are highly dynamic often resulting in fluctuations of the water table to quantify the effects of water table fluctuations on nszd rates a simulated biodiesel spill in a 400 cm long 100 cm wide and 150 cm tall sandtank was subjected to lowering and raising the water table while soil gas chemistry and surface co2 and ch4 effluxes were measured results show that water table fluctuations have both short term perceived and long term actual effects on nszd rates interpreted using surface efflux measurements when the water table was lowered surface effluxes immediately increased up to 3 and 344 times higher than baseline for co2 and ch4 effluxes respectively due to the liberation of anaerobically produced gas accumulated below the water table after this immediate release the system then reached quasi steady state conditions 1 4 to 1 6 times higher for co2 than baseline conditions attributed to increased aerobic degradation in the broadened and exposed smear zone when the water table was raised quasi steady state co2 and ch4 effluxes declined to values of 0 9 and 0 4 times baseline effluxes respectively implying that contaminant degradation rates were reduced due to submergence of the smear zone the findings of this study show that the dynamic effects of water table fluctuations and redistribution of the contaminants affect surface effluxes as well as short term perceived and long term actual contaminant degradation rates therefore water table fluctuations need to be considered when quantifying nszd at contaminated sites using sparse temporal rate measurements to estimate nszd rates for extended periods of time e g annual rates keywords nszd efflux methane carbon dioxide biodiesel water table 1 introduction and background characterization efforts for hydrocarbon contaminated unconfined aquifer systems are continuously being refined and improved these efforts often focus on developing an understanding of the extent of contamination at sites and quantifying contaminant natural attenuation rates with an emphasis on biodegradation in the presence of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl natural source zone depletion nszd commonly plays a significant role in mass removal and its progress determines requirements for further remedial action kao et al 2010 soga et al 2004 however both the spatial extent and rates of nszd at sites are impacted by subsurface geological and microbial heterogeneity contaminant morphology and type and hydrogeologic characteristics of a site making quantification difficult bekins et al 2005 christ et al 2006 garg et al 2017 kechavarzi et al 2005 sale and mcwhorter 2001 soga et al 2004 sookhak lari et al 2019 because of these challenges approaches are needed for reliable characterization such that informed site management decisions can be made regarding the need for future remedial action khaitan et al 2006 during the degradation of hydrocarbons above and below the water table in unconfined aquifers common degradation by products include co2 and ch4 lundegard and johnson 2006 sihota and mayer 2012 these by products are the result of aerobic degradation of contaminants in the presence of oxygen o2 originating from the atmosphere and anaerobic oxidation by other terminal electron acceptors and methanogenesis amos et al 2005 lahvis et al 1999 lahvis and baehr 1996 molins et al 2010 revesz et al 1995 the abundance of co2 and ch4 is dependent on the conditions which exist in each system for example when oxygen ingress into the unsaturated zone is significant ch4 generation is either inhibited or oxidation of ch4 generated at greater depths occurs both cases leading to higher abundance of co2 than ch4 in soil gas baehr and corapcioglu 1987 molins et al 2010 sihota et al 2011 due to the limited solubility of co2 and especially ch4 in the pore water these gases will migrate toward the surface through diffusion baehr and corapcioglu 1987 or advection gaganis et al 2004 as a result of the formation of these gaseous by products a proposed methodology to both delineate the extent of contamination and to quantify the magnitude of nszd is to measure surface effluxes of co2 and ch4 sihota et al 2011 by using surface effluxes instrumentation is placed at the surface of a contaminated site presenting a non invasive means for quantification of nszd rates in recent years the measurement of co2 effluxes at the ground surface has been used and adopted to quantify source zone attenuation rates at hydrocarbon contaminated sites e g sihota et al 2016 2013 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 verginelli et al 2018 warren et al 2014 generally the underlying assumption behind this approach is that co2 effluxes measured at the ground surface corrected for natural soil respiration are representative of depth integrated subsurface nszd rates sihota et al 2011 typically these calculations are performed by assuming steady state conditions subject to constant recharge soil temperature and groundwater flow conditions the use of surface efflux measurements to estimate nszd rates is however complicated because subsurface systems are in fact dynamic for a variety of reasons garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019 including subsurface temperature e g sihota et al 2016 zeman et al 2014 soil moisture e g karimi askarani et al 2018 episodic ebullition events e g ramirez et al 2015 barometric pumping e g auer et al 1996 forde et al 2019 sale et al 2020 xu et al 2014 and fluctuations of the water table these dynamic forces can cause the actual e g rate of contaminant degradation by microbes and perceived e g release of stored gas or enhanced oxidation of methane rates of nszd estimated by effluxes to differ karimi askarani et al 2018 sihota et al 2016 it is therefore important to be able to distinguish between actual and perceived rates of degradation when estimating long term contaminant biodegradation in a study measuring the long term dynamic changes in nszd sihota et al 2016 reported that rates varied seasonally indicated by variations of co2 concentrations in the unsaturated zone and co2 surface efflux measurements at a crude oil spill site near bemidji mn peak surficial co2 effluxes occurred during the late spring and summer when soil temperatures were rising while the water table was dropping sihota et al 2016 these results suggest that biodegradation rates increased as a result of intensified microbial metabolism in response to increased soil temperatures however based on these findings it can also be hypothesized that the spreading and exposure of contaminants due to a decline in water table elevation during the summer months in combination with aeration and entry of atmospheric o2 into the contaminated region further enhanced aerobic microbial metabolism williams and oostrom 2000 xia et al 2020 in addition it is possible that the release of biogenic gas accumulated below the water table formed by methanogenesis may also contribute co2 and ch4 into the vadose zone especially when the water table lowers amos and mayer 2006 this accumulated gas can exist in both dissolved form present in the pore water which will occur immediately as biodegradation progresses or as gas bubbles which will form as dissolved gas concentrations exceed solubility causing exsolution amos et al 2005 release of accumulated gas by water gas partitioning of the volatile dissolved anaerobically produced co2 and ch4 e g barber et al 1990 and by the release of entrapped gas bubbles especially ch4 due to its low solubility e g amos and mayer 2006 could greatly affect vadose zone gas concentrations and surficial gas effluxes providing misleading results regarding actual natural attenuation rates contributions of ch4 and co2 from accumulated gas into the vadose zone would subsequently result in a temporary increase of surficial gas release and an overestimation of biodegradation rates occurring at the time of measurement however it is currently not clear how actual degradation rates are affected by a declining water table isolated from the influence of temperature and what the contribution of released accumulated biogenic gas is to perceived degradation rates both processes i e enhanced gas production and the release of stored gas will affect surficial gas effluxes likely leading to a mixed signal the deconvolution of the measured effluxes in this context warrants further investigation to assess how accurately this method can quantify real time actual attenuation rates to accurately assess nszd rates by surface efflux measurement of gaseous by products it is critical to understand whether efflux measurements made at the surface are in fact representative of real time subsurface contaminant degradation rates under dynamic conditions the specific objectives of this study were to i quantify the impact of both lowering and raising the water table on soil gas chemistry and surficial effluxes ii assess representativeness of surface efflux measurements for real time nszd rates under dynamic conditions and iii evaluate the impact of water table fluctuations on actual degradation rates a controlled sandtank experiment was conducted to better understand the effects of water table fluctuations on hydrocarbon degradation rates and the measured co2 and ch4 surface effluxes from a simulated biodiesel spill over the duration of the experiment high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of gas effluxes soil gas composition and stable isotopic signature were collected 2 materials and methods 2 1 sandtank construction and packing the sandtank measured 400 cm long x 100 cm wide y and 150 cm tall z fig 1 the front face was constructed of glass allowing observation of contaminant spreading within the tank a wide reservoir on each side of the tank allowed for establishing constant head boundary conditions as free water in the reservoirs was connected to the sand pack through a fine mesh the back and bottom panels were constructed of fiberglass reinforced plastic frp ensuring that contaminants within the sand would not react with the material the sandtank was equipped with sampling ports spaced vertically every 10 cm from 30 to 120 cm in the vertical direction and every 40 cm from 20 to 380 cm in the horizontal direction fig 1 these ports are accessed from the back of the tank allowing for both gaseous above the water table and aqueous below the water table sampling to be performed within the sand pack the ports were fitted with ptfe tubing which extended into the sandtank 50 cm allowing samples to be collected from the center of the sand pack a representative subset of these ports was used to measure compositional and isotopic changes of gases in the unsaturated zone these ports will be detailed in proceeding sections the top of the tank was left open to the atmosphere emulating an unconfined system the sandtank was filled with natural sediments collected from the unsaturated zone of a former refinery facility located in burnaby british columbia the unwashed sediments were clean and devoid of any organic contaminants grain size analysis showed that the sediments were silty sand with an average grain size of 0 45 mm the sandtank was filled in 5 to 10 cm lifts to reduce the possibility of macroscopic vertical heterogeneity over the height of the pack after each lift the sand was compacted mechanically until no further compaction could be achieved the top layer of the compacted lift was then removed to eliminate differences in permeability and to allow for hydraulic connection between lifts this process was repeated until the tank was fully packed with sand once fully packed precipitation of tap water amended with nutrafin to remove chlorine was applied across the surface of the tank using a sprinkler system ensuring that all sediments were wetted water was added until the water table reached 30 cm above the bottom of the sandtank creating a 30 cm saturated zone and 120 cm unsaturated zone for study fig 1 2 2 biodiesel release and water table fluctuations a simulated release was performed march 17 2015 into the sandtank where 80 l of biodiesel b100 were applied to a 0 5 1 m2 rectangular area on the surface of the sand directly in the center of the sandtank fig 1 the biodiesel was dyed red using sudan iv 0 1 mg l allowing lnapl to be observed in the sand pack from the front glass face of the sandtank percolation of the biodiesel occurred until a steady state free phase source developed spreading across the water table and leaving biodiesel at residual saturation behind in theunsaturated zone below the area of infiltration fig 1 it is estimated that 16 to 31 l of biodiesel existed as residual in the unsaturated zone and 49 to 64 l of biodiesel formed the mobile lnapl layer above the water table immediately after the release see supplementary material for more detail after the release of the biodiesel the evolution of biodegradation reactions was studied over a time period of 580 days looking at the transient changes in surface effluxes soil gas and water chemistry and overall nszd this experiment is described in more detail in the supplementary material and scully 2017 the system was then left idle to ensure quasi steady conditions were reached prior to the commencement of this study starting 758 days after the initial release for the sake of simplicity this time is set to t0 0 days for the purpose of this study at the commencement of the water table fluctuation experiment a carbon mass balance from the 580 day initial experiment indicated that most of the biodiesel remained in the tank at the start of the current study it was estimated that only 6 of the biodiesel had been degraded see supplementary material the sandtank was then used to systematically study the impacts of water table fluctuations on soil gas chemistry and surface gas effluxes by raising and lowering the water table for prescribed periods of time the experiment consisted offour phases table 1 fig s1 in the supplementary material phase 1 occurred from day 0 to 21 and allowed for the collection of steady state baseline conditions within the system serving as the basis for comparison after changes in the water table height phase 2 occurred from day 21 to 51 on day 21 the water table was lowered using two peristaltic pumps which removed a total of 400 l of water simultaneously from both reservoirs at the end of the tank to ensure that water was drained as consistently as possible along the length of the sandtank after removal of this volume of water the height of the water table was measured to be 15 cm from the bottom of the sandtank during phase 3 400 l of water treated with nutrafin was added to the reservoirs simultaneously over a total time of four days to ensure that the water table would not rise too quickly and too high potentially damaging the installed sensors described below after completion of the addition of water the water table rested at a height of 38 cm from the bottom of the sandtank finally in phase 4 530 l of water were removed similar to phase 2 over two days the final water table height was measured to be 6 cm from the bottom of the sandtank the duration of each phase ensured that quasi steady state condition for that water table height was achieved 2 3 surface soil gas efflux measurement the efflux of biogenically generated gases co2 and ch4 at the surface of the tank was measured over the duration of the experiment using three long term flux chambers li cor li 8100 104 the chambers ltc1 ltc2 and ltc3 were placed 50 125 and 200 cm from the left most edge of the sandtank fig 1 respectively this approach captured the spatial distribution of the effluxes across the surface because of the symmetry of the system chambers were only placed on one half of the sandtank automated chambers were placed on top of the sand pack on partially buried pvc collars placed in the sand the chambers were sampled in a round robin fashion such that an efflux was measured every 20 min from each chamber the chambers were connected to a li cor li 8100 analyzer through a multiplexer li cor li 8150 to quantify co2 and water vapor concentrations to also measure ch4 the sample line was spliced and directed to an extended range greenhouse gas analyzer los gatos research gga ep for measurement of co2 ch4 and water vapor a bypass line was added to the configuration to account for the difference in pumping rate of each of the analyzers sihota et al 2013 effluxes were calculated using standard methods based on the rate of change of co2 and ch4 concentration water vapor atmospheric pressure temperature and system volume li cor 2007 sihota et al 2013 each chamber remained in open position until its turn in the sampling queue the chamber was then purged closed and measurement followed based on the accuracy of the instruments used maximum of 1 error for measured concentrations background concentrations of ch4 and co2 and chamber characteristics the lower detection limit for effluxes were 9 10 4 μmol m 2 s 1 for ch4 and 9 10 2 μmol m 2 s 1 for co2 2 4 vadose zone gas sampling and sensors measurement of both the composition of soil gas and isotopic signatures was conducted in the unsaturated zone composition of the gas was determined using two different methodologies gas chromatography and in situ sensors gas sampling was performed using a subset of 16 sampling ports that extended 50 cm into the sand pack the ports sampled formed a grid pattern with vertical transects at x positions of 60 100 140 and 180 cm from the leftmost extent of the sand pack at z positions of 70 80 100 and 120 cm from the bottom of the sandtank fig 1 the grid was selected on the left half of the sandtank to provide complementary information to the flux chamber measurements using a gas tight syringe 10 ml gas samples were collected from each port three to five times per week during the experiment prior to sample collection each port was purged of all gas by removing 5 ml of gas ensuring that gas sampled was representative of in situ conditions the samples were then immediately quantified for co2 and ch4 using a gas chromatograph gc varian cp 4900 equipped with a poraplot u column detection was by means of a thermal conductivity detector tcd the gc was periodically at least weekly calibrated using three standard gas mixtures containing varied compositions of each analyte in addition to discrete soil gas samples in situ sensors to measure co2 and o2 located in the unsaturated zone were used to provide high resolution real time detection five co2 sensors dynament range of 0 5 v v located along a horizontal transect at 55 cm above the bottom of the tank at x positions of 150 200 and 250 cm from the leftmost edge and along a horizontal transect at 105 cm at x positions of 200 and 250 cm yellow squares fig 2 were used in this study also continuous data from o2 sensors apogee so 100 0 100 error 1 installed at 80 cm above the bottom of the tank x position of 250 cm from the leftmost edge along a horizontal transect at 105 cm at x positions of 200 and 250 cm and at 130 cm above the bottom of the tank at an x position of 150 cm green squares fig 2 were collected for this study the sensors were emplaced in custom built ptfe housings to protect them from soil moisture and were installed at mid width y 50 cm of the sandtank prior to sand packing scully 2017 a labjack u3 data logger 1 hz was used to collect the partial pressure readings from the sensors calibration of the sensors was conducted by placing them in sealed glass vessels prior to installation and purging the air with gas streams of known concentrations of co2 and o2 scully 2017 once installed calibration was verified by pumping known concentrations of co2 and o2 into the unsaturated sand prior to imbibing water to the system scully 2017 compound specific isotope analysis csia of δ13c for both co2 and ch4 was performed on soil gas samples from eight ports similar to those described for gas composition ports were located on the left half of the sandtank along vertical transects at x positions of 100 140 and 180 cm from the leftmost extent of the sand pack at z positions of 70 90 110 cm for the 100 and 180 cm vertical transect and 70 and 110 cm for the 140 cm transect these ports were purged of 5 ml of gas then 20 ml samples were collected using a gas tight syringe the samples were then transferred into 12 ml pre evacuated labco vials and over pressured to at least 1 5 atm gas samples were analyzed by using a purge and trap system tekmar coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc irms following the operational procedures described by hunkeler and aravena 2000 at the university of california at davis stable isotope facility the average sample error was reported to be 0 3 additionally the isotopic signature of the biodiesel spilled was analyzed to provide the stable carbon isotope composition of the source material 29 9 considering stable conditions during the latter half of the initial experiment from day 0 to 580 see supplementary material it is expected that the δ13c in the unsaturated zone stayed constant for the 188 days between the end of the initial experiment and the beginning of the water table fluctuation experiment therefore the baseline δ13c for both co2 and ch4 are assumed to be 28 0 and 40 0 respectively 3 results 3 1 surface soil gas efflux the measurement of co2 and ch4 effluxes started on day 0 of the water table fluctuation experiment allowing for quantification of baseline effluxes the efflux at each chamber was stable over this duration figs 3 and 4 effluxes varied spatially with higher effluxes observed toward the center of the sandtank ltc3 versus toward the edge ltc1 and ltc2 based on the source architecture of biodiesel in the sandtank it is expected that effluxes would be higher nearer to the center of the tank because of the presence of biodiesel at residual saturation in the unsaturated zone versus solely the higher liquid saturation mobile lnapl layer on the water table toward the edges of the sandtank therefore because of increased interfacial area for degradation and availability of o2 in the residual biodiesel higher effluxes resulted in the center of the tank baseline co2 effluxes ranged from 1 1 to 1 8 μmol m 2 s 1 and ch4 effluxes ranged from 0 004 to 0 015 μmol m 2 s 1 these baseline effluxes are consistent with the effluxes measured during the preceding experiment scully 2017 see also supplementary material indicating that during the idle time between the end of the initial experiment scully 2017 and the start of this study biodegradation remained active and no substantial changes had occurred water table fluctuations had a direct and immediate impact on the measured surface effluxes during all phases of the experiment for phase 2 significant increases in co2 and ch4 effluxes were observed in all long term chambers figs 3 and 4 resulting from lowering the water table 15 cm initially a large spike in co2 and ch4 effluxes occurred which ranged from 2 0 to 3 0 times and 69 to 344 times greater than baseline effluxes respectively with the largest increases occurring the further the chamber was positioned from the center of the tank these peak effluxes were short in duration beginning to decrease after 1 and 0 5 days for co2 and ch4 respectively effluxes then decreased and reached new quasi steady state rates however for co2 the quasi steady state effluxes were 1 4 to 1 5 times higher than baseline effluxes with the greatest increase seen furthest from the center of the spill for ch4 the quasi steady state effluxes returned to baseline conditions quasi steady state conditions were reached within 14 days of the lowering of the water table after which only minor variations of the effluxes occurred following the lowering of the water table in phase 2 and once effluxes had reached a quasi steady state the water table was raised in phase 3 on day 51 surface effluxes decreased immediately after raising the water table 23 cm co2 effluxes decreased to a minimum relative efflux of 0 9 to 1 0 times the baseline reaching a quasi steady state by day 59 ch4 effluxes decreased immediately to values below the detection limit of the instrument by day 52 the efflux stabilized by day 59 then gradually increased to values above the methane efflux detection limit to new quasi steady state effluxes 0 41 to 0 76 times the baseline efflux by day 69 on day 75 the water table was lowered 32 cm similar immediate large efflux increases occurred for phase 4 as during phase 2 co2 effluxes peaked at 2 0 to 2 5 times the baseline efflux greatest observed farthest from the center of the tank and then approached stable conditions 1 4 to 1 6 times baseline significantly higher than before the event i e under baseline conditions and minimally higher than quasi steady state effluxes toward the end of phase 2 ch4 also increased 25 to 49 times greater than baseline then recovered to values similar to conditions prior to lowering the water table co2 and ch4 reached peak release rates later than in phase 2 requiring between 4 and 5 days from the initiation of the event likely due to the slower lowering of the water table compared to phase 2 3 2 unsaturated zone gas composition sensors emplaced in the unsaturated zone of the sandtank showed confirmatory results to the surface gas efflux data fig 5 similar to the gas effluxes co2 and o2 concentrations prior to initiating water table fluctuations were stable ranging from 0 7 to 1 8 v v and 18 to 20 v v respectively co2 concentrations varied with depth as expected with higher concentrations measured nearer to the water table at an elevation of 55 cm co2 concentrations in the unsaturated zone behaved in a similar manner to the gas efflux response during water table lowering in phases 2 and 4 in phase 2 a substantial spike of co2 reaching between 1 6 and 4 0 v v occurred immediately followed by a gradual decline to stable concentrations higher than baseline 1 0 to 2 3 v v over the same time period described above for the surface effluxes the same observation was made for phase 4 when co2 spiked to values between 1 7 and 3 8 v v at the various monitoring locations then decreased to quasi steady state concentrations ranging between 1 0 and 2 5 v v concurrent with raising of the water table phase 3 co2 decreased to stable values between 0 7 and 1 5 v v marginally lower than baseline conditions the sensor results show that surface efflux data is reflective of concentration variations of co2 in the unsaturated zone the o2 data shows similar but opposite trends with the exception of sensor 150 30 which remains relatively stable over the duration of the experiment because of its shallow position away from the bulk residual lnapl when the water table was lowered in phase 2 o2 concentrations of the responsive sensors decreased to concentrations ranging from 15 6 to 16 9 v v then gradually increased to stable concentrations between 17 1 and 18 6 v v lower than baseline concentrations phase 4 saw similar but less marked decreases falling to concentrations between 16 5 and 17 3 v v then increasing to stable concentrations lower than the baseline composition between 17 4 and 19 0 v v when the water table was raised in phase 3 o2 spiked to concentrations ranging between 18 3 and 20 8 v v dependent on the monitoring point therefore the response to water table fluctuations are opposite for co2 and o2 when the water table is lowered co2 increases and o2 decreases and the opposite is true when the water table is raised unsaturated zone gas samples collected and analyzed for ch4 and co2 support the observations of the surface effluxes and unsaturated zone co2 sensors vertical profiles at x 60 cm and x 180 cm immediately after a water table change early time and after the system reached a quasi steady state late time show the gas composition within the sandtank and allow for interpretation of the effect of water table fluctuations on vertical concentration gradients through the system figs 6 and 7 these data clearly show that as the water table is lowered phase 4 presented in figs 6 and 7 ch4 and co2 immediately increased following the drop of the water table ch4 was seen to immediately increase from non detect values to 1 25 v v fig 6a and 0 30 v v fig 7a at the water table toward the edge and center of the tank respectively the increase was less substantial nearer to the surface of the tank after quasi steady state was reached no change from baseline ch4 concentration could be observed consistent with the surface efflux measurements minimal changes in ch4 concentrations occurred after raising the water table co2 concentration profiles showed distinct trends fig 6b and 7b consistent with and complementary to surface efflux measurements immediately after the water table was lowered co2 increased from baseline concentrations closer to the water table 0 35 and 0 50 v v for the transect nearer to the edge and center of the tank respectively and lesser toward the surface 0 20 and 0 10 v v respectively this profile suggests that co2 was released immediately following the lowering of the water table after reaching a quasi steady state a greater co2 concentration gradient was retained from the water table to the surface compared to baseline conditions this suggests increased co2 production and upward diffusion following the lowering of the water table supporting the observation of higher co2 effluxes at the surface during the raising of the water table the opposite observation was made co2 concentrations generally decreased 0 10 to 0 20 v v over the vertical transect at x 60 and 180 cm immediately after raising at quasi steady state co2 along the profile at both transects were more variable but generally lower than baseline values 3 3 csia generally the δ13c isotopic signature of co2 fig 8 varied with depth more negative closer to the water table and distance from the center of the sandtank more negative closer to the center of the tank immediately after lowering the water table in phase 2 the δ13c of co2 was temporarily less negative than baseline conditions 26 3 to 23 3 three days later the vadose zone co2 became again enriched in the lighter carbon isotope at δ13c values similar to baseline conditions 28 0 slightly less negative than the initial value of the biodiesel 29 9 the isotopic composition of co2 stayed fairly constant over the next 22 days after the water table was raised on day 51 phase 3 gaseous co2 became enriched in the heavier carbon isotope over the next 14 days the δ13c of co2 became increasingly less negative larger shifts in isotopic composition occurred at the ports closer to the surface nearer to the center of the sandtank on day 68 there was minimal variation 0 5 in isotopic composition between vertical transects during phase 4 the δ13c of co2 values became again more negative most clearly seen in the port furthest from the center of the sandtank nearer to the water table at which δ13c of co2 values responded quickly the following day day 76 δ13c values approached values similar or slightly below baseline conditions and remained close to these levels until the end of the experiment after lowering the water table in phase 2 the δ13c of ch4 fig 9 became quickly enriched in the heavier carbon isotope five days after the event the isotopic signature of gaseous ch4 re approached δ13c values similar to baseline conditions 40 0 the isotopic composition of gaseous ch4 remained fairly stable for the next 22 days only becoming minimally more positive at ports of closer proximity to the water table immediately following raising the water table in phase 3 gaseous ch4 again became enriched in the heavier carbon isotope with the exception of the ports closest to the surface of the sandtank z 90 and 110 by day 54 three days after the water table was raised the δ13c of ch4 returned to values similar to and slightly more positive than prior to the event over the next 14 days isotopic composition of ch4 became more uniform throughout the sandtank with δ13c values around 36 this excludes the ports closest to the water table where δ13c values of ch4 were slightly more positive on the final lowering of the water table in phase 4 ch4 became enriched in the lighter carbon isotope apart from the port closest to the water table and closest to the edge of the sandtank δ13c of ch4 values reached values significantly more negative than the baseline however the following day ch4 became temporarily enriched in the heavier carbon isotope followed by a return to baseline values the isotopic composition of ch4 varied with depth and distance from the center of the sandtank for the duration of the experiment the ports closest to the surface of the sandtank showed the least variation 5 0 in δ13c of ch4 between vertical transects 4 discussion the water table fluctuations induced during this experiment had both short term and long term effects on actual and perceived biodiesel degradation the observed effects are the result of the release of accumulated gas and changes to the biodiesel smear zone and mobile lnapl thickness as drainage and imbibition occur within the system fig 10 during lowering of the water table drainage causes downward spreading of the biodiesel and desaturation of part of the previously liquid saturated zone leading to increased exposure of the lnapl smear zone to soil gas fig 10b and c this creates greater opportunity for immediate dissolved gas release from the water phase connected pathways for release of accumulated gas bubbles and also greater opportunity for aerobic biodegradation due to the increased gas water interfacial area in the longer term lowering of the water table causes the mobile lnapl to move downward leaving residual lnapl behind in the pore space ultimately decreasing the saturation of the lnapl above the water table and reducing the thickness of the mobile lnapl fraction but increasing the overall lnapl thickness inclusive of mobile residual and entrapped lnapl lenhard et al 2017 this reduction of saturation therefore increases the pore space soil gas volume within the source zone in contrast when the water table is raised water imbibes and submerges the smear zone fig 10d the mobile lnapl will also rise into zones of previous residual lnapl or previously uncontaminated sediment above the water table and creating enhanced zones of entrapped lnapl below the water table the described redistribution of lnapl induced during water table fluctuations leads to immediate responses of soil gas chemistry and gas effluxes as well as long term effects unsaturated zone co2 and ch4 gas concentrations and surficial gas effluxes immediately increased following both water table lowering events this phenomenon is explained by the release of biogenic gas accumulated in the saturated zone as a result of anaerobic biodiesel degradation prior to lowering the water table during baseline conditions movement of produced gases from the saturated to unsaturated zone was limited to diffusion through the region containing mobile lnapl along the water table fig 10a on the lowering of the water table downward percolation of the liquid phases water and lnapl leads to the development of continuous gas pathways into the residual lnapl and the mobile lnapl promoting the release of accumulated gas into the unsaturated zone by water gas partitioning and possibly the release of entrapped gas bubbles this release of accumulated gas from the previously liquid saturated smear zone leads to high early time on the order of days co2 and ch4 concentration increases in the unsaturated zone and the observed spikes in surface gas effluxes affecting perceived rates of contaminant degradation if determined based on gas effluxes and or soil gas concentrations this release of gas from the saturated zone was affected by both the rate of water table lowering and the amount of time since a previous change in the water table in phase 2 the water table was lowered faster 1 day than phase 4 2 days as a result the release of anaerobically produced gas to the surface was more immediate during phase 2 shown by faster increase in surface efflux rates and unsaturated zone gas concentrations compared to phase 4 in addition to the rate at which the water table lowered it was observed that the time of stable conditions prior to the fluctuation also affected the early time release of ch4 for phase 2 the water table was at a stable elevation for more than a year providing suitable circumstances for significant gas accumulation below the water table when the water table was lowered large immediate increases in ch4 effluxes were measured 69 to 344 time greater than baseline fluxes mass balance calculations see supplementary material reveal that the partitioning of dissolved anaerobic ch4 accumulated in the saturated zone and the release of entrapped gas bubbles exsolved below the water table both contributed to the ch4 release observed at the surface in response to lowering the water table during phase 2 in contrast phase 4 saw much lower yet still significant immediate ch4 efflux increases 25 to 49 times as a result of less time for accumulation of gas produced below the water table during phase 3 in phase 4 mass balance calculations suggest that ch4 release observed at the surface can be explained solely by water gas partitioning of dissolved gases however assumptions made for these calculations were highly conservative and the contribution of the release of entrapped gas bubbles from the lower portion of the tank cannot be ruled out with certainty it is clear that the immediate perceived surface ch4 efflux measurements are affected by both the duration over which the water table fluctuates and also the conditions prior to the change in water table impacting the mechanism of accumulated gas release as well as allowing the upward movement of gases the lowering of the water table increased access of atmospheric o2 into the smear zone by the development of enhanced gas migration pathways into the contaminated region and simultaneously expanding the thickness of the smear zone promoting improved conditions of aerobic degradation reactions o2 concentrations within the unsaturated zone immediately decreased following the lowering of the water table and a greater concentration gradient between the surface and water table developed these results indicate that o2 was readily utilized by aerobic microbes oxidizing the ch4 which was released from the saturated zone in the short term and aerobic biodiesel degradation in the longer term increasing actual biodegradation rates the decrease in o2 observed in phase 4 was less than that of phase 2 as a result of less accumulated ch4 being released from below the water table causing lower rates of o2 consumption in the active aerobic zone during phase 4 the effects of the lowering of the water table were relatively greater toward the edges of the sandtank the edges of the tank had a larger percentage efflux increase than that of areas closer to the center of the tank as a result of residual lnapl being present below the spill zone in the center of the tank the presence of the fuel within the unsaturated zone led to the relatively high initial degradation rates seen toward the center of the tank and more limited impact of lowering the water table relative to the edges of the tank this finding highlights the relationship between the lnapl source architecture and the expected efflux residual product in the unsaturated zone where o2 is more readily available for degradation leads to significant production of co2 and can explain some of the spatial variability in co2 effluxes observed at hydrocarbon impacted sites in contrast to lowering the water table when the water table was raised an immediate drop in unsaturated zone co2 and ch4 gas production and surficial gas effluxes was observed because during this imbibition more of the mobile lnapl becomes surrounded in water biodegradation is reduced following the immediate decrease in co2 and ch4 effluxes co2 reached a steady state below baseline values and ch4 returned to baseline conditions implying that o2 access to the contaminated region was more limited leading to lower long term aerobic degradation rates although the response of the isotopic signature of the released gas during phase 2 and phase 4 of the experiment are seemingly different this behavior can be explained by the timing of sample collection relative to the timing of lowering the water table during phase 2 samples were collected after lowering of the water table was complete and the isotopic signature indicates an oxidized signature of ch4 with less negative δ13c values this result suggests that ch4 is rapidly oxidized after its release into the vadose zone once in contact with o2 during phase 4 the water table was lowered more slowly and samples for stable isotope analysis were collected during the process of lowering the water table as a result the isotopic signature of δ13c in ch4 was substantially more negative than baseline conditions during the water table decline while the δ13c in co2 was more positive indicative of gases produced during the anaerobic degradation of biodiesel however isotope data from the following day collected after completion of lowering the water table again shows a more oxidized signature in ch4 confirming the results from phase 2 and providing additional evidence for rapid ch4 oxidation in the vadose zone upon completion of the accumulated gas release in terms of long term effects of water table fluctuations it can be seen that δ13c of co2 during low water table conditions is more negative than for high water table conditions while δ13c of ch4 is relatively insensitive this isotopic signature points toward enhanced aerobic biodiesel degradation during low water table conditions while contaminant degradation is inhibited for the raised water table the redistribution of biodiesel and ingress of o2 into deeper regions promote more extensive aerobic degradation these results are also consistent with unsaturated zone o2 concentrations gradually steadying at a concentration lower than that of the baseline for low water table conditions indicating that o2 was utilized at an increased rate combined with increased co2 concentrations and effluxes this observation supports the hypothesis that lowering the water table enhances actual biodiesel degradation by providing access of o2 into the smear zone while a rise of the water table reduces contaminant degradation 5 conclusions hydrocarbon fuel spills in unconfined aquifer systems are an ongoing environmental issue due to the potential risks of groundwater contamination to receptors understanding how water table fluctuations influence the transient and long term evolution of hydrocarbon biodegradation in source zones is necessary for the accurate interpretation of nszd rates and remediation efforts water table fluctuations were simulated in a biodiesel contaminated sandtank to gain understanding of how the natural attenuation rate of hydrocarbons is affected the findings of this study have implications for the monitoring of nszd using measurement of surface effluxes it was found that soil gas chemistry above the water table is significantly affected by the immediate release of accumulated gas from the saturated zone during drainage when the water table is lowered the water and lnapl redistribute reducing the overall liquid saturation in the shallower zones of the depth profile and allowing the release of gases from residual water now above the water table and possibly also the release of accumulated gas bubbles subsequently leading to their upward diffusion to the surface of the sand box based on csia results for initial stages of phase 4 this gas is produced by methanogenesis due to limited o2 availability below the water table this immediate release leads to increase in concentrations in the unsaturated zone and effluxes with co2 and ch4 effluxes up to 3 and 344 times higher than baseline conditions respectively drainage can also lead to the enhancement of microbial degradation in the longer term after lowering the water table the production of co2 within the unsaturated zone increased to steady state rates higher 1 4 to 1 6 times than before the event this is the result of spreading of the smear zone thus providing microbes with increased hydrocarbon availability and increased o2 ingress from the unconfined surface of the system in contrast raising the water table covers the smear zone in water decreasing the soil gas content and decreasing the surface area of the contaminant exposed to available o2 for degradation ultimately this leads to a reduction in the aerobic degradation of the biodiesel subsequently this slows or inhibits gas exchange between the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone up to 0 9 times lower co2 effluxes relative to baseline conditions our results show that the interpretation of surficial effluxes can be dependent on the time of measurement relative to recent water table changes surficial efflux measurements of co2 and ch4 within two days of lowering the water table were affected by the release of accumulated gas from the saturated zone to the unsaturated zone therefore causing the perceived rate of nszd to be much higher than the actual rate of degradation within the system if the immediate release of ch4 was measured this may be alarming suggesting that biodegradation processes at a site may be causing the release of elevated and possibly dangerous levels of combustible gas to the surface this is however a short term effect that subsides after the water table stabilizes in the longer term if surficial effluxes are measured following the lowering or raising of the water table e g due to seasonal fluctuations the average yearly rate of nszd might be overestimated or underestimated respectively the cause of the fluctuation may also impact the perceived rate of nszd for example if a rise in water table is over a long time scale e g seasonal changes to the surface efflux might be less variable for short time scales e g related to changes in lake level or reservoir levels near a site changes may be more immediate and greater in magnitude therefore it is important that the dynamic effects of water table fluctuations be considered when measuring degradation rates using surface effluxes the results of this study suggest that monitoring should be conducted over longer time periods taking multiple temporally distributed samples short term or discrete sampling of surface effluxes to characterize nszd at a site may cause the perceived degradation rates to be significantly different than the actual representative degradation occurring these data also suggest that surface efflux measurements and gas sampling within the unsaturated zone to estimate nszd rates should be avoided during periods of significant water table fluctuations additionally isotopic analysis of δ13c can help to identify the sources of gas measured in soil gas and at the surface therefore it is recommended that this analysis is coupled with surface efflux measurements so that actual versus perceived degradation rates can be further deconvoluted the presented conceptual model for the impact of water table fluctuations on surface efflux for determination of degradation can be used for better decision making with respect to

1448,a viable means of quantifying the rate of natural source zone depletion nszd at hydrocarbon contaminated sites is by the measurement of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 effluxes at the surface this methodology assumes that gas effluxes are reflective of actual contaminant degradation rates in the subsurface which is only accurate for quasi steady state conditions however in reality subsurface systems are highly dynamic often resulting in fluctuations of the water table to quantify the effects of water table fluctuations on nszd rates a simulated biodiesel spill in a 400 cm long 100 cm wide and 150 cm tall sandtank was subjected to lowering and raising the water table while soil gas chemistry and surface co2 and ch4 effluxes were measured results show that water table fluctuations have both short term perceived and long term actual effects on nszd rates interpreted using surface efflux measurements when the water table was lowered surface effluxes immediately increased up to 3 and 344 times higher than baseline for co2 and ch4 effluxes respectively due to the liberation of anaerobically produced gas accumulated below the water table after this immediate release the system then reached quasi steady state conditions 1 4 to 1 6 times higher for co2 than baseline conditions attributed to increased aerobic degradation in the broadened and exposed smear zone when the water table was raised quasi steady state co2 and ch4 effluxes declined to values of 0 9 and 0 4 times baseline effluxes respectively implying that contaminant degradation rates were reduced due to submergence of the smear zone the findings of this study show that the dynamic effects of water table fluctuations and redistribution of the contaminants affect surface effluxes as well as short term perceived and long term actual contaminant degradation rates therefore water table fluctuations need to be considered when quantifying nszd at contaminated sites using sparse temporal rate measurements to estimate nszd rates for extended periods of time e g annual rates keywords nszd efflux methane carbon dioxide biodiesel water table 1 introduction and background characterization efforts for hydrocarbon contaminated unconfined aquifer systems are continuously being refined and improved these efforts often focus on developing an understanding of the extent of contamination at sites and quantifying contaminant natural attenuation rates with an emphasis on biodegradation in the presence of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl natural source zone depletion nszd commonly plays a significant role in mass removal and its progress determines requirements for further remedial action kao et al 2010 soga et al 2004 however both the spatial extent and rates of nszd at sites are impacted by subsurface geological and microbial heterogeneity contaminant morphology and type and hydrogeologic characteristics of a site making quantification difficult bekins et al 2005 christ et al 2006 garg et al 2017 kechavarzi et al 2005 sale and mcwhorter 2001 soga et al 2004 sookhak lari et al 2019 because of these challenges approaches are needed for reliable characterization such that informed site management decisions can be made regarding the need for future remedial action khaitan et al 2006 during the degradation of hydrocarbons above and below the water table in unconfined aquifers common degradation by products include co2 and ch4 lundegard and johnson 2006 sihota and mayer 2012 these by products are the result of aerobic degradation of contaminants in the presence of oxygen o2 originating from the atmosphere and anaerobic oxidation by other terminal electron acceptors and methanogenesis amos et al 2005 lahvis et al 1999 lahvis and baehr 1996 molins et al 2010 revesz et al 1995 the abundance of co2 and ch4 is dependent on the conditions which exist in each system for example when oxygen ingress into the unsaturated zone is significant ch4 generation is either inhibited or oxidation of ch4 generated at greater depths occurs both cases leading to higher abundance of co2 than ch4 in soil gas baehr and corapcioglu 1987 molins et al 2010 sihota et al 2011 due to the limited solubility of co2 and especially ch4 in the pore water these gases will migrate toward the surface through diffusion baehr and corapcioglu 1987 or advection gaganis et al 2004 as a result of the formation of these gaseous by products a proposed methodology to both delineate the extent of contamination and to quantify the magnitude of nszd is to measure surface effluxes of co2 and ch4 sihota et al 2011 by using surface effluxes instrumentation is placed at the surface of a contaminated site presenting a non invasive means for quantification of nszd rates in recent years the measurement of co2 effluxes at the ground surface has been used and adopted to quantify source zone attenuation rates at hydrocarbon contaminated sites e g sihota et al 2016 2013 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 verginelli et al 2018 warren et al 2014 generally the underlying assumption behind this approach is that co2 effluxes measured at the ground surface corrected for natural soil respiration are representative of depth integrated subsurface nszd rates sihota et al 2011 typically these calculations are performed by assuming steady state conditions subject to constant recharge soil temperature and groundwater flow conditions the use of surface efflux measurements to estimate nszd rates is however complicated because subsurface systems are in fact dynamic for a variety of reasons garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019 including subsurface temperature e g sihota et al 2016 zeman et al 2014 soil moisture e g karimi askarani et al 2018 episodic ebullition events e g ramirez et al 2015 barometric pumping e g auer et al 1996 forde et al 2019 sale et al 2020 xu et al 2014 and fluctuations of the water table these dynamic forces can cause the actual e g rate of contaminant degradation by microbes and perceived e g release of stored gas or enhanced oxidation of methane rates of nszd estimated by effluxes to differ karimi askarani et al 2018 sihota et al 2016 it is therefore important to be able to distinguish between actual and perceived rates of degradation when estimating long term contaminant biodegradation in a study measuring the long term dynamic changes in nszd sihota et al 2016 reported that rates varied seasonally indicated by variations of co2 concentrations in the unsaturated zone and co2 surface efflux measurements at a crude oil spill site near bemidji mn peak surficial co2 effluxes occurred during the late spring and summer when soil temperatures were rising while the water table was dropping sihota et al 2016 these results suggest that biodegradation rates increased as a result of intensified microbial metabolism in response to increased soil temperatures however based on these findings it can also be hypothesized that the spreading and exposure of contaminants due to a decline in water table elevation during the summer months in combination with aeration and entry of atmospheric o2 into the contaminated region further enhanced aerobic microbial metabolism williams and oostrom 2000 xia et al 2020 in addition it is possible that the release of biogenic gas accumulated below the water table formed by methanogenesis may also contribute co2 and ch4 into the vadose zone especially when the water table lowers amos and mayer 2006 this accumulated gas can exist in both dissolved form present in the pore water which will occur immediately as biodegradation progresses or as gas bubbles which will form as dissolved gas concentrations exceed solubility causing exsolution amos et al 2005 release of accumulated gas by water gas partitioning of the volatile dissolved anaerobically produced co2 and ch4 e g barber et al 1990 and by the release of entrapped gas bubbles especially ch4 due to its low solubility e g amos and mayer 2006 could greatly affect vadose zone gas concentrations and surficial gas effluxes providing misleading results regarding actual natural attenuation rates contributions of ch4 and co2 from accumulated gas into the vadose zone would subsequently result in a temporary increase of surficial gas release and an overestimation of biodegradation rates occurring at the time of measurement however it is currently not clear how actual degradation rates are affected by a declining water table isolated from the influence of temperature and what the contribution of released accumulated biogenic gas is to perceived degradation rates both processes i e enhanced gas production and the release of stored gas will affect surficial gas effluxes likely leading to a mixed signal the deconvolution of the measured effluxes in this context warrants further investigation to assess how accurately this method can quantify real time actual attenuation rates to accurately assess nszd rates by surface efflux measurement of gaseous by products it is critical to understand whether efflux measurements made at the surface are in fact representative of real time subsurface contaminant degradation rates under dynamic conditions the specific objectives of this study were to i quantify the impact of both lowering and raising the water table on soil gas chemistry and surficial effluxes ii assess representativeness of surface efflux measurements for real time nszd rates under dynamic conditions and iii evaluate the impact of water table fluctuations on actual degradation rates a controlled sandtank experiment was conducted to better understand the effects of water table fluctuations on hydrocarbon degradation rates and the measured co2 and ch4 surface effluxes from a simulated biodiesel spill over the duration of the experiment high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of gas effluxes soil gas composition and stable isotopic signature were collected 2 materials and methods 2 1 sandtank construction and packing the sandtank measured 400 cm long x 100 cm wide y and 150 cm tall z fig 1 the front face was constructed of glass allowing observation of contaminant spreading within the tank a wide reservoir on each side of the tank allowed for establishing constant head boundary conditions as free water in the reservoirs was connected to the sand pack through a fine mesh the back and bottom panels were constructed of fiberglass reinforced plastic frp ensuring that contaminants within the sand would not react with the material the sandtank was equipped with sampling ports spaced vertically every 10 cm from 30 to 120 cm in the vertical direction and every 40 cm from 20 to 380 cm in the horizontal direction fig 1 these ports are accessed from the back of the tank allowing for both gaseous above the water table and aqueous below the water table sampling to be performed within the sand pack the ports were fitted with ptfe tubing which extended into the sandtank 50 cm allowing samples to be collected from the center of the sand pack a representative subset of these ports was used to measure compositional and isotopic changes of gases in the unsaturated zone these ports will be detailed in proceeding sections the top of the tank was left open to the atmosphere emulating an unconfined system the sandtank was filled with natural sediments collected from the unsaturated zone of a former refinery facility located in burnaby british columbia the unwashed sediments were clean and devoid of any organic contaminants grain size analysis showed that the sediments were silty sand with an average grain size of 0 45 mm the sandtank was filled in 5 to 10 cm lifts to reduce the possibility of macroscopic vertical heterogeneity over the height of the pack after each lift the sand was compacted mechanically until no further compaction could be achieved the top layer of the compacted lift was then removed to eliminate differences in permeability and to allow for hydraulic connection between lifts this process was repeated until the tank was fully packed with sand once fully packed precipitation of tap water amended with nutrafin to remove chlorine was applied across the surface of the tank using a sprinkler system ensuring that all sediments were wetted water was added until the water table reached 30 cm above the bottom of the sandtank creating a 30 cm saturated zone and 120 cm unsaturated zone for study fig 1 2 2 biodiesel release and water table fluctuations a simulated release was performed march 17 2015 into the sandtank where 80 l of biodiesel b100 were applied to a 0 5 1 m2 rectangular area on the surface of the sand directly in the center of the sandtank fig 1 the biodiesel was dyed red using sudan iv 0 1 mg l allowing lnapl to be observed in the sand pack from the front glass face of the sandtank percolation of the biodiesel occurred until a steady state free phase source developed spreading across the water table and leaving biodiesel at residual saturation behind in theunsaturated zone below the area of infiltration fig 1 it is estimated that 16 to 31 l of biodiesel existed as residual in the unsaturated zone and 49 to 64 l of biodiesel formed the mobile lnapl layer above the water table immediately after the release see supplementary material for more detail after the release of the biodiesel the evolution of biodegradation reactions was studied over a time period of 580 days looking at the transient changes in surface effluxes soil gas and water chemistry and overall nszd this experiment is described in more detail in the supplementary material and scully 2017 the system was then left idle to ensure quasi steady conditions were reached prior to the commencement of this study starting 758 days after the initial release for the sake of simplicity this time is set to t0 0 days for the purpose of this study at the commencement of the water table fluctuation experiment a carbon mass balance from the 580 day initial experiment indicated that most of the biodiesel remained in the tank at the start of the current study it was estimated that only 6 of the biodiesel had been degraded see supplementary material the sandtank was then used to systematically study the impacts of water table fluctuations on soil gas chemistry and surface gas effluxes by raising and lowering the water table for prescribed periods of time the experiment consisted offour phases table 1 fig s1 in the supplementary material phase 1 occurred from day 0 to 21 and allowed for the collection of steady state baseline conditions within the system serving as the basis for comparison after changes in the water table height phase 2 occurred from day 21 to 51 on day 21 the water table was lowered using two peristaltic pumps which removed a total of 400 l of water simultaneously from both reservoirs at the end of the tank to ensure that water was drained as consistently as possible along the length of the sandtank after removal of this volume of water the height of the water table was measured to be 15 cm from the bottom of the sandtank during phase 3 400 l of water treated with nutrafin was added to the reservoirs simultaneously over a total time of four days to ensure that the water table would not rise too quickly and too high potentially damaging the installed sensors described below after completion of the addition of water the water table rested at a height of 38 cm from the bottom of the sandtank finally in phase 4 530 l of water were removed similar to phase 2 over two days the final water table height was measured to be 6 cm from the bottom of the sandtank the duration of each phase ensured that quasi steady state condition for that water table height was achieved 2 3 surface soil gas efflux measurement the efflux of biogenically generated gases co2 and ch4 at the surface of the tank was measured over the duration of the experiment using three long term flux chambers li cor li 8100 104 the chambers ltc1 ltc2 and ltc3 were placed 50 125 and 200 cm from the left most edge of the sandtank fig 1 respectively this approach captured the spatial distribution of the effluxes across the surface because of the symmetry of the system chambers were only placed on one half of the sandtank automated chambers were placed on top of the sand pack on partially buried pvc collars placed in the sand the chambers were sampled in a round robin fashion such that an efflux was measured every 20 min from each chamber the chambers were connected to a li cor li 8100 analyzer through a multiplexer li cor li 8150 to quantify co2 and water vapor concentrations to also measure ch4 the sample line was spliced and directed to an extended range greenhouse gas analyzer los gatos research gga ep for measurement of co2 ch4 and water vapor a bypass line was added to the configuration to account for the difference in pumping rate of each of the analyzers sihota et al 2013 effluxes were calculated using standard methods based on the rate of change of co2 and ch4 concentration water vapor atmospheric pressure temperature and system volume li cor 2007 sihota et al 2013 each chamber remained in open position until its turn in the sampling queue the chamber was then purged closed and measurement followed based on the accuracy of the instruments used maximum of 1 error for measured concentrations background concentrations of ch4 and co2 and chamber characteristics the lower detection limit for effluxes were 9 10 4 μmol m 2 s 1 for ch4 and 9 10 2 μmol m 2 s 1 for co2 2 4 vadose zone gas sampling and sensors measurement of both the composition of soil gas and isotopic signatures was conducted in the unsaturated zone composition of the gas was determined using two different methodologies gas chromatography and in situ sensors gas sampling was performed using a subset of 16 sampling ports that extended 50 cm into the sand pack the ports sampled formed a grid pattern with vertical transects at x positions of 60 100 140 and 180 cm from the leftmost extent of the sand pack at z positions of 70 80 100 and 120 cm from the bottom of the sandtank fig 1 the grid was selected on the left half of the sandtank to provide complementary information to the flux chamber measurements using a gas tight syringe 10 ml gas samples were collected from each port three to five times per week during the experiment prior to sample collection each port was purged of all gas by removing 5 ml of gas ensuring that gas sampled was representative of in situ conditions the samples were then immediately quantified for co2 and ch4 using a gas chromatograph gc varian cp 4900 equipped with a poraplot u column detection was by means of a thermal conductivity detector tcd the gc was periodically at least weekly calibrated using three standard gas mixtures containing varied compositions of each analyte in addition to discrete soil gas samples in situ sensors to measure co2 and o2 located in the unsaturated zone were used to provide high resolution real time detection five co2 sensors dynament range of 0 5 v v located along a horizontal transect at 55 cm above the bottom of the tank at x positions of 150 200 and 250 cm from the leftmost edge and along a horizontal transect at 105 cm at x positions of 200 and 250 cm yellow squares fig 2 were used in this study also continuous data from o2 sensors apogee so 100 0 100 error 1 installed at 80 cm above the bottom of the tank x position of 250 cm from the leftmost edge along a horizontal transect at 105 cm at x positions of 200 and 250 cm and at 130 cm above the bottom of the tank at an x position of 150 cm green squares fig 2 were collected for this study the sensors were emplaced in custom built ptfe housings to protect them from soil moisture and were installed at mid width y 50 cm of the sandtank prior to sand packing scully 2017 a labjack u3 data logger 1 hz was used to collect the partial pressure readings from the sensors calibration of the sensors was conducted by placing them in sealed glass vessels prior to installation and purging the air with gas streams of known concentrations of co2 and o2 scully 2017 once installed calibration was verified by pumping known concentrations of co2 and o2 into the unsaturated sand prior to imbibing water to the system scully 2017 compound specific isotope analysis csia of δ13c for both co2 and ch4 was performed on soil gas samples from eight ports similar to those described for gas composition ports were located on the left half of the sandtank along vertical transects at x positions of 100 140 and 180 cm from the leftmost extent of the sand pack at z positions of 70 90 110 cm for the 100 and 180 cm vertical transect and 70 and 110 cm for the 140 cm transect these ports were purged of 5 ml of gas then 20 ml samples were collected using a gas tight syringe the samples were then transferred into 12 ml pre evacuated labco vials and over pressured to at least 1 5 atm gas samples were analyzed by using a purge and trap system tekmar coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc irms following the operational procedures described by hunkeler and aravena 2000 at the university of california at davis stable isotope facility the average sample error was reported to be 0 3 additionally the isotopic signature of the biodiesel spilled was analyzed to provide the stable carbon isotope composition of the source material 29 9 considering stable conditions during the latter half of the initial experiment from day 0 to 580 see supplementary material it is expected that the δ13c in the unsaturated zone stayed constant for the 188 days between the end of the initial experiment and the beginning of the water table fluctuation experiment therefore the baseline δ13c for both co2 and ch4 are assumed to be 28 0 and 40 0 respectively 3 results 3 1 surface soil gas efflux the measurement of co2 and ch4 effluxes started on day 0 of the water table fluctuation experiment allowing for quantification of baseline effluxes the efflux at each chamber was stable over this duration figs 3 and 4 effluxes varied spatially with higher effluxes observed toward the center of the sandtank ltc3 versus toward the edge ltc1 and ltc2 based on the source architecture of biodiesel in the sandtank it is expected that effluxes would be higher nearer to the center of the tank because of the presence of biodiesel at residual saturation in the unsaturated zone versus solely the higher liquid saturation mobile lnapl layer on the water table toward the edges of the sandtank therefore because of increased interfacial area for degradation and availability of o2 in the residual biodiesel higher effluxes resulted in the center of the tank baseline co2 effluxes ranged from 1 1 to 1 8 μmol m 2 s 1 and ch4 effluxes ranged from 0 004 to 0 015 μmol m 2 s 1 these baseline effluxes are consistent with the effluxes measured during the preceding experiment scully 2017 see also supplementary material indicating that during the idle time between the end of the initial experiment scully 2017 and the start of this study biodegradation remained active and no substantial changes had occurred water table fluctuations had a direct and immediate impact on the measured surface effluxes during all phases of the experiment for phase 2 significant increases in co2 and ch4 effluxes were observed in all long term chambers figs 3 and 4 resulting from lowering the water table 15 cm initially a large spike in co2 and ch4 effluxes occurred which ranged from 2 0 to 3 0 times and 69 to 344 times greater than baseline effluxes respectively with the largest increases occurring the further the chamber was positioned from the center of the tank these peak effluxes were short in duration beginning to decrease after 1 and 0 5 days for co2 and ch4 respectively effluxes then decreased and reached new quasi steady state rates however for co2 the quasi steady state effluxes were 1 4 to 1 5 times higher than baseline effluxes with the greatest increase seen furthest from the center of the spill for ch4 the quasi steady state effluxes returned to baseline conditions quasi steady state conditions were reached within 14 days of the lowering of the water table after which only minor variations of the effluxes occurred following the lowering of the water table in phase 2 and once effluxes had reached a quasi steady state the water table was raised in phase 3 on day 51 surface effluxes decreased immediately after raising the water table 23 cm co2 effluxes decreased to a minimum relative efflux of 0 9 to 1 0 times the baseline reaching a quasi steady state by day 59 ch4 effluxes decreased immediately to values below the detection limit of the instrument by day 52 the efflux stabilized by day 59 then gradually increased to values above the methane efflux detection limit to new quasi steady state effluxes 0 41 to 0 76 times the baseline efflux by day 69 on day 75 the water table was lowered 32 cm similar immediate large efflux increases occurred for phase 4 as during phase 2 co2 effluxes peaked at 2 0 to 2 5 times the baseline efflux greatest observed farthest from the center of the tank and then approached stable conditions 1 4 to 1 6 times baseline significantly higher than before the event i e under baseline conditions and minimally higher than quasi steady state effluxes toward the end of phase 2 ch4 also increased 25 to 49 times greater than baseline then recovered to values similar to conditions prior to lowering the water table co2 and ch4 reached peak release rates later than in phase 2 requiring between 4 and 5 days from the initiation of the event likely due to the slower lowering of the water table compared to phase 2 3 2 unsaturated zone gas composition sensors emplaced in the unsaturated zone of the sandtank showed confirmatory results to the surface gas efflux data fig 5 similar to the gas effluxes co2 and o2 concentrations prior to initiating water table fluctuations were stable ranging from 0 7 to 1 8 v v and 18 to 20 v v respectively co2 concentrations varied with depth as expected with higher concentrations measured nearer to the water table at an elevation of 55 cm co2 concentrations in the unsaturated zone behaved in a similar manner to the gas efflux response during water table lowering in phases 2 and 4 in phase 2 a substantial spike of co2 reaching between 1 6 and 4 0 v v occurred immediately followed by a gradual decline to stable concentrations higher than baseline 1 0 to 2 3 v v over the same time period described above for the surface effluxes the same observation was made for phase 4 when co2 spiked to values between 1 7 and 3 8 v v at the various monitoring locations then decreased to quasi steady state concentrations ranging between 1 0 and 2 5 v v concurrent with raising of the water table phase 3 co2 decreased to stable values between 0 7 and 1 5 v v marginally lower than baseline conditions the sensor results show that surface efflux data is reflective of concentration variations of co2 in the unsaturated zone the o2 data shows similar but opposite trends with the exception of sensor 150 30 which remains relatively stable over the duration of the experiment because of its shallow position away from the bulk residual lnapl when the water table was lowered in phase 2 o2 concentrations of the responsive sensors decreased to concentrations ranging from 15 6 to 16 9 v v then gradually increased to stable concentrations between 17 1 and 18 6 v v lower than baseline concentrations phase 4 saw similar but less marked decreases falling to concentrations between 16 5 and 17 3 v v then increasing to stable concentrations lower than the baseline composition between 17 4 and 19 0 v v when the water table was raised in phase 3 o2 spiked to concentrations ranging between 18 3 and 20 8 v v dependent on the monitoring point therefore the response to water table fluctuations are opposite for co2 and o2 when the water table is lowered co2 increases and o2 decreases and the opposite is true when the water table is raised unsaturated zone gas samples collected and analyzed for ch4 and co2 support the observations of the surface effluxes and unsaturated zone co2 sensors vertical profiles at x 60 cm and x 180 cm immediately after a water table change early time and after the system reached a quasi steady state late time show the gas composition within the sandtank and allow for interpretation of the effect of water table fluctuations on vertical concentration gradients through the system figs 6 and 7 these data clearly show that as the water table is lowered phase 4 presented in figs 6 and 7 ch4 and co2 immediately increased following the drop of the water table ch4 was seen to immediately increase from non detect values to 1 25 v v fig 6a and 0 30 v v fig 7a at the water table toward the edge and center of the tank respectively the increase was less substantial nearer to the surface of the tank after quasi steady state was reached no change from baseline ch4 concentration could be observed consistent with the surface efflux measurements minimal changes in ch4 concentrations occurred after raising the water table co2 concentration profiles showed distinct trends fig 6b and 7b consistent with and complementary to surface efflux measurements immediately after the water table was lowered co2 increased from baseline concentrations closer to the water table 0 35 and 0 50 v v for the transect nearer to the edge and center of the tank respectively and lesser toward the surface 0 20 and 0 10 v v respectively this profile suggests that co2 was released immediately following the lowering of the water table after reaching a quasi steady state a greater co2 concentration gradient was retained from the water table to the surface compared to baseline conditions this suggests increased co2 production and upward diffusion following the lowering of the water table supporting the observation of higher co2 effluxes at the surface during the raising of the water table the opposite observation was made co2 concentrations generally decreased 0 10 to 0 20 v v over the vertical transect at x 60 and 180 cm immediately after raising at quasi steady state co2 along the profile at both transects were more variable but generally lower than baseline values 3 3 csia generally the δ13c isotopic signature of co2 fig 8 varied with depth more negative closer to the water table and distance from the center of the sandtank more negative closer to the center of the tank immediately after lowering the water table in phase 2 the δ13c of co2 was temporarily less negative than baseline conditions 26 3 to 23 3 three days later the vadose zone co2 became again enriched in the lighter carbon isotope at δ13c values similar to baseline conditions 28 0 slightly less negative than the initial value of the biodiesel 29 9 the isotopic composition of co2 stayed fairly constant over the next 22 days after the water table was raised on day 51 phase 3 gaseous co2 became enriched in the heavier carbon isotope over the next 14 days the δ13c of co2 became increasingly less negative larger shifts in isotopic composition occurred at the ports closer to the surface nearer to the center of the sandtank on day 68 there was minimal variation 0 5 in isotopic composition between vertical transects during phase 4 the δ13c of co2 values became again more negative most clearly seen in the port furthest from the center of the sandtank nearer to the water table at which δ13c of co2 values responded quickly the following day day 76 δ13c values approached values similar or slightly below baseline conditions and remained close to these levels until the end of the experiment after lowering the water table in phase 2 the δ13c of ch4 fig 9 became quickly enriched in the heavier carbon isotope five days after the event the isotopic signature of gaseous ch4 re approached δ13c values similar to baseline conditions 40 0 the isotopic composition of gaseous ch4 remained fairly stable for the next 22 days only becoming minimally more positive at ports of closer proximity to the water table immediately following raising the water table in phase 3 gaseous ch4 again became enriched in the heavier carbon isotope with the exception of the ports closest to the surface of the sandtank z 90 and 110 by day 54 three days after the water table was raised the δ13c of ch4 returned to values similar to and slightly more positive than prior to the event over the next 14 days isotopic composition of ch4 became more uniform throughout the sandtank with δ13c values around 36 this excludes the ports closest to the water table where δ13c values of ch4 were slightly more positive on the final lowering of the water table in phase 4 ch4 became enriched in the lighter carbon isotope apart from the port closest to the water table and closest to the edge of the sandtank δ13c of ch4 values reached values significantly more negative than the baseline however the following day ch4 became temporarily enriched in the heavier carbon isotope followed by a return to baseline values the isotopic composition of ch4 varied with depth and distance from the center of the sandtank for the duration of the experiment the ports closest to the surface of the sandtank showed the least variation 5 0 in δ13c of ch4 between vertical transects 4 discussion the water table fluctuations induced during this experiment had both short term and long term effects on actual and perceived biodiesel degradation the observed effects are the result of the release of accumulated gas and changes to the biodiesel smear zone and mobile lnapl thickness as drainage and imbibition occur within the system fig 10 during lowering of the water table drainage causes downward spreading of the biodiesel and desaturation of part of the previously liquid saturated zone leading to increased exposure of the lnapl smear zone to soil gas fig 10b and c this creates greater opportunity for immediate dissolved gas release from the water phase connected pathways for release of accumulated gas bubbles and also greater opportunity for aerobic biodegradation due to the increased gas water interfacial area in the longer term lowering of the water table causes the mobile lnapl to move downward leaving residual lnapl behind in the pore space ultimately decreasing the saturation of the lnapl above the water table and reducing the thickness of the mobile lnapl fraction but increasing the overall lnapl thickness inclusive of mobile residual and entrapped lnapl lenhard et al 2017 this reduction of saturation therefore increases the pore space soil gas volume within the source zone in contrast when the water table is raised water imbibes and submerges the smear zone fig 10d the mobile lnapl will also rise into zones of previous residual lnapl or previously uncontaminated sediment above the water table and creating enhanced zones of entrapped lnapl below the water table the described redistribution of lnapl induced during water table fluctuations leads to immediate responses of soil gas chemistry and gas effluxes as well as long term effects unsaturated zone co2 and ch4 gas concentrations and surficial gas effluxes immediately increased following both water table lowering events this phenomenon is explained by the release of biogenic gas accumulated in the saturated zone as a result of anaerobic biodiesel degradation prior to lowering the water table during baseline conditions movement of produced gases from the saturated to unsaturated zone was limited to diffusion through the region containing mobile lnapl along the water table fig 10a on the lowering of the water table downward percolation of the liquid phases water and lnapl leads to the development of continuous gas pathways into the residual lnapl and the mobile lnapl promoting the release of accumulated gas into the unsaturated zone by water gas partitioning and possibly the release of entrapped gas bubbles this release of accumulated gas from the previously liquid saturated smear zone leads to high early time on the order of days co2 and ch4 concentration increases in the unsaturated zone and the observed spikes in surface gas effluxes affecting perceived rates of contaminant degradation if determined based on gas effluxes and or soil gas concentrations this release of gas from the saturated zone was affected by both the rate of water table lowering and the amount of time since a previous change in the water table in phase 2 the water table was lowered faster 1 day than phase 4 2 days as a result the release of anaerobically produced gas to the surface was more immediate during phase 2 shown by faster increase in surface efflux rates and unsaturated zone gas concentrations compared to phase 4 in addition to the rate at which the water table lowered it was observed that the time of stable conditions prior to the fluctuation also affected the early time release of ch4 for phase 2 the water table was at a stable elevation for more than a year providing suitable circumstances for significant gas accumulation below the water table when the water table was lowered large immediate increases in ch4 effluxes were measured 69 to 344 time greater than baseline fluxes mass balance calculations see supplementary material reveal that the partitioning of dissolved anaerobic ch4 accumulated in the saturated zone and the release of entrapped gas bubbles exsolved below the water table both contributed to the ch4 release observed at the surface in response to lowering the water table during phase 2 in contrast phase 4 saw much lower yet still significant immediate ch4 efflux increases 25 to 49 times as a result of less time for accumulation of gas produced below the water table during phase 3 in phase 4 mass balance calculations suggest that ch4 release observed at the surface can be explained solely by water gas partitioning of dissolved gases however assumptions made for these calculations were highly conservative and the contribution of the release of entrapped gas bubbles from the lower portion of the tank cannot be ruled out with certainty it is clear that the immediate perceived surface ch4 efflux measurements are affected by both the duration over which the water table fluctuates and also the conditions prior to the change in water table impacting the mechanism of accumulated gas release as well as allowing the upward movement of gases the lowering of the water table increased access of atmospheric o2 into the smear zone by the development of enhanced gas migration pathways into the contaminated region and simultaneously expanding the thickness of the smear zone promoting improved conditions of aerobic degradation reactions o2 concentrations within the unsaturated zone immediately decreased following the lowering of the water table and a greater concentration gradient between the surface and water table developed these results indicate that o2 was readily utilized by aerobic microbes oxidizing the ch4 which was released from the saturated zone in the short term and aerobic biodiesel degradation in the longer term increasing actual biodegradation rates the decrease in o2 observed in phase 4 was less than that of phase 2 as a result of less accumulated ch4 being released from below the water table causing lower rates of o2 consumption in the active aerobic zone during phase 4 the effects of the lowering of the water table were relatively greater toward the edges of the sandtank the edges of the tank had a larger percentage efflux increase than that of areas closer to the center of the tank as a result of residual lnapl being present below the spill zone in the center of the tank the presence of the fuel within the unsaturated zone led to the relatively high initial degradation rates seen toward the center of the tank and more limited impact of lowering the water table relative to the edges of the tank this finding highlights the relationship between the lnapl source architecture and the expected efflux residual product in the unsaturated zone where o2 is more readily available for degradation leads to significant production of co2 and can explain some of the spatial variability in co2 effluxes observed at hydrocarbon impacted sites in contrast to lowering the water table when the water table was raised an immediate drop in unsaturated zone co2 and ch4 gas production and surficial gas effluxes was observed because during this imbibition more of the mobile lnapl becomes surrounded in water biodegradation is reduced following the immediate decrease in co2 and ch4 effluxes co2 reached a steady state below baseline values and ch4 returned to baseline conditions implying that o2 access to the contaminated region was more limited leading to lower long term aerobic degradation rates although the response of the isotopic signature of the released gas during phase 2 and phase 4 of the experiment are seemingly different this behavior can be explained by the timing of sample collection relative to the timing of lowering the water table during phase 2 samples were collected after lowering of the water table was complete and the isotopic signature indicates an oxidized signature of ch4 with less negative δ13c values this result suggests that ch4 is rapidly oxidized after its release into the vadose zone once in contact with o2 during phase 4 the water table was lowered more slowly and samples for stable isotope analysis were collected during the process of lowering the water table as a result the isotopic signature of δ13c in ch4 was substantially more negative than baseline conditions during the water table decline while the δ13c in co2 was more positive indicative of gases produced during the anaerobic degradation of biodiesel however isotope data from the following day collected after completion of lowering the water table again shows a more oxidized signature in ch4 confirming the results from phase 2 and providing additional evidence for rapid ch4 oxidation in the vadose zone upon completion of the accumulated gas release in terms of long term effects of water table fluctuations it can be seen that δ13c of co2 during low water table conditions is more negative than for high water table conditions while δ13c of ch4 is relatively insensitive this isotopic signature points toward enhanced aerobic biodiesel degradation during low water table conditions while contaminant degradation is inhibited for the raised water table the redistribution of biodiesel and ingress of o2 into deeper regions promote more extensive aerobic degradation these results are also consistent with unsaturated zone o2 concentrations gradually steadying at a concentration lower than that of the baseline for low water table conditions indicating that o2 was utilized at an increased rate combined with increased co2 concentrations and effluxes this observation supports the hypothesis that lowering the water table enhances actual biodiesel degradation by providing access of o2 into the smear zone while a rise of the water table reduces contaminant degradation 5 conclusions hydrocarbon fuel spills in unconfined aquifer systems are an ongoing environmental issue due to the potential risks of groundwater contamination to receptors understanding how water table fluctuations influence the transient and long term evolution of hydrocarbon biodegradation in source zones is necessary for the accurate interpretation of nszd rates and remediation efforts water table fluctuations were simulated in a biodiesel contaminated sandtank to gain understanding of how the natural attenuation rate of hydrocarbons is affected the findings of this study have implications for the monitoring of nszd using measurement of surface effluxes it was found that soil gas chemistry above the water table is significantly affected by the immediate release of accumulated gas from the saturated zone during drainage when the water table is lowered the water and lnapl redistribute reducing the overall liquid saturation in the shallower zones of the depth profile and allowing the release of gases from residual water now above the water table and possibly also the release of accumulated gas bubbles subsequently leading to their upward diffusion to the surface of the sand box based on csia results for initial stages of phase 4 this gas is produced by methanogenesis due to limited o2 availability below the water table this immediate release leads to increase in concentrations in the unsaturated zone and effluxes with co2 and ch4 effluxes up to 3 and 344 times higher than baseline conditions respectively drainage can also lead to the enhancement of microbial degradation in the longer term after lowering the water table the production of co2 within the unsaturated zone increased to steady state rates higher 1 4 to 1 6 times than before the event this is the result of spreading of the smear zone thus providing microbes with increased hydrocarbon availability and increased o2 ingress from the unconfined surface of the system in contrast raising the water table covers the smear zone in water decreasing the soil gas content and decreasing the surface area of the contaminant exposed to available o2 for degradation ultimately this leads to a reduction in the aerobic degradation of the biodiesel subsequently this slows or inhibits gas exchange between the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone up to 0 9 times lower co2 effluxes relative to baseline conditions our results show that the interpretation of surficial effluxes can be dependent on the time of measurement relative to recent water table changes surficial efflux measurements of co2 and ch4 within two days of lowering the water table were affected by the release of accumulated gas from the saturated zone to the unsaturated zone therefore causing the perceived rate of nszd to be much higher than the actual rate of degradation within the system if the immediate release of ch4 was measured this may be alarming suggesting that biodegradation processes at a site may be causing the release of elevated and possibly dangerous levels of combustible gas to the surface this is however a short term effect that subsides after the water table stabilizes in the longer term if surficial effluxes are measured following the lowering or raising of the water table e g due to seasonal fluctuations the average yearly rate of nszd might be overestimated or underestimated respectively the cause of the fluctuation may also impact the perceived rate of nszd for example if a rise in water table is over a long time scale e g seasonal changes to the surface efflux might be less variable for short time scales e g related to changes in lake level or reservoir levels near a site changes may be more immediate and greater in magnitude therefore it is important that the dynamic effects of water table fluctuations be considered when measuring degradation rates using surface effluxes the results of this study suggest that monitoring should be conducted over longer time periods taking multiple temporally distributed samples short term or discrete sampling of surface effluxes to characterize nszd at a site may cause the perceived degradation rates to be significantly different than the actual representative degradation occurring these data also suggest that surface efflux measurements and gas sampling within the unsaturated zone to estimate nszd rates should be avoided during periods of significant water table fluctuations additionally isotopic analysis of δ13c can help to identify the sources of gas measured in soil gas and at the surface therefore it is recommended that this analysis is coupled with surface efflux measurements so that actual versus perceived degradation rates can be further deconvoluted the presented conceptual model for the impact of water table fluctuations on surface efflux for determination of degradation can be used for better decision making with respect to

1449,urban groundwater management requires a thorough and robust scientific understanding of flow and transport processes 3h 3he apparent ages have been shown to efficiently help provide important groundwater related information however this type of analysis is expensive as well as labor and time intensive and hence limits the number of potential sampling locations to overcome this limitation we established an inter relationship between 3h 3he apparent groundwater ages and 4he concentrations analyzed in the field with a newly developed portable gas equilibrium membrane inlet mass spectrometer ge mims system and demonstrated that the results of the simpler ge mims system are an accurate and reliable alternative to sophisticated laboratory based analyses the combined use of 3h 3he lab based ages and predicted ages from the 3h 3he 4he age relationship opens new opportunities for site characterization and reveals insights into the conceptual understanding of groundwater systems for our study site we combined groundwater ages with hydrochemical data water isotopes 18o and 2h and perchloroethylene pce concentrations 1 to identify spatial inter aquifer mixing between artificially infiltrated groundwater and water originating from regional flow paths and 2 to explain the spatial differences in pce contamination within the observed groundwater system overall low pce concentrations and young ages occur when the fraction of artificially infiltrated water is high the results obtained from the age distribution analysis are strongly supported by the information gained from the isotopic and hydrochemical data moreover for some wells fault induced aquifer connectivity is identified as a preferential flow path for the transport of older groundwater leading to elevated pce concentrations keywords groundwater transport managed aquifer recharge mar 3h 3he apparent age environmental gases perchloroethylene aquifer connectivity 1 introduction increasing population and

different spatial and temporal scales schirmer et al 2013 vázquez suñé et al 2005 contaminated sites are often the foremost concern for groundwater quality it is problematic if these sites are located in the vicinity of drinking water production areas potentially leading to decreased water quality and posing a potential risk to both human health and the environment baillieux et al 2015 karges et al

both the spatial distribution of contaminants within an aquifer and the time needed for water quality changes to propagate through the system are not completely understood szabo et al 1996 strategies

schilling et al 2019 since the majority of groundwater contamination in urban areas has occurred in recent times 100 years tritium 3h is a suitable tracer for younger groundwater up to 60 years in age e g kipfer et al 2002 tritium was released between the late 1950s and early 1960s in high amounts mainly into the stratosphere by thermonuclear bomb tests cook and herczeg 2012 massmann et al 2009 in combination with its decay product helium 3he tritium provides an age measure independent of the tritium input cook and solomon 1997 this makes it advantageous as a tracer as it eliminates the necessity to establish the exact time dependent tritium delivery to the aquifer helium produced by 3h decay accumulates in groundwater and does not undergo any chemical reactions making it an ideal tracer there exist different sources of 3he that define the total 3he 3hetot these are the concentration in solubility equilibrium with the atmosphere 3heeq the component originating from excess air 3heex terrigenic components derived from the crust and mantle 3heter and the source that comes from the decay of tritium 3hetri see kipfer et al 2002 for a review the different components can be estimated and fractions can be subsequently subtracted from 3hetot thanks to the complementary measurements of other noble gases more details can be found in kipfer et al 2002 among others because groundwater cannot be dated directly only an apparent age can be obtained by using 3h as a tracer the so called apparent 3h 3he age e g kipfer et al 2002 sanford 2011 apparent groundwater age is the measure of time since the water entered the saturated zone and was isolated from the atmosphere thus the apparent age corresponds to the time since recharge has occurred cook and solomon 1995 suckow 2014 if dispersive and mixing effects are small the apparent age can be compared directly with advective travel times in the groundwater system however long filter screens dispersion and flow path convergence will always lead to an age spectrum rather than an exact value as a result the method is typically biased toward the age of the water component with the higher tritium concentration kipfer et al 2002 moreover the analysis is expensive as well as labor and time intensive and only a few specialized laboratories can carry out such analyses on a routine basis nevertheless this method

aquifer mixing between artificially infiltrated and regional groundwater by means of a relationship between field measured 4he concentrations analyzed with the ge mims system and lab based 3h 3he apparent ages the insights gained by this analysis allowed us to developed a consistent conceptual process understanding for flow and transport processes for an urban study area in switzerland more specifically the following tasks are addressed we aimed to determine the relationship between field measured 4he concentrations analyzed with a ge mims system and lab based apparent 3h 3he ages the combined apparent ages from the laboratory and field measurements predicted from the aforementioned relationship will be used to evaluate the influence of artificial groundwater recharge inter aquifer mixing and possible fault induced aquifer connectivity along the flow paths the results are validated with independently measured concentration patterns of water isotopes 18o and 2h and hydrochemical data cations and anions we related apparent water ages hydrochemistry and isotope results to pollutants such as perchloroethylene pce one of the most commonly found contaminants at the study site subsequently we determined the origin of the groundwater at the observation site and drinking water pumping wells in order to aid the development of water management strategies 2 study area and hydrogeology the study site is located in northern switzerland close to the city of basel and covers an area of approximately 10 km2 of mainly urban and industrial zones the drinking water abstraction wells themselves are located in the hardwald forest at the center of the study area fig 1 the climatic conditions are represented by an average annual precipitation of 730mm and a mean temperature of 11 5 c the surface elevation ranges from approximately 290m above sea level masl in the south to 250 masl near the rhine river in the northeast geological units present in the study area from the bottom to the top include the lower muschelkalk middle muschelkalk upper muschelkalk keuper jurassic strata tertiary sediments and unconsolidated quaternary cover fig 2 the lower muschelkalk consists of marly sediments the middle muschelkalk consists mainly of dolomites marls clays and evaporates sulphate zone and the upper muschelkalk is characterized by a regionally important fractured and karstified limestone aquifer spottke et al 2005 the keuper jurassic strata and tertiary sediments represent a local aquiclude due to their low hydraulic conductivity the bedrock units are covered by unconsolidated quaternary sediments which form an unconfined fluvio glacial sand gravel aquifer spottke et al 2005 the region s most prominent tectonic feature is a portion of the upper rhine graben main border fault which is represented by a flexure zone and a large number of faults moeck et al 2016 spottke et al 2005 the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured flexure zone is unknown and is likely spatially variable moeck et al 2020 this fracture zone may represent a separate flow path due to its higher permeability and could therefore support the vertical exchange of groundwater or it may be filled with fine sediments that form a hydraulic barrier moeck et al 2020 the two most hydrogeologically relevant units are the aforementioned quaternary sediments and the upper muschelkalk representing two locally important aquifers moeck et al 2016 2018b a possible additional water component as indicated in popp et al 2019 is located at the western edge of the study area in the vicinity of the flexure zone predominant groundwater flows from southeast to northwest in the direction of the rhine river fig 1 due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the middle muschelkalk sulphate zone together with the decreasing thickness of the upper muschelkalk upwelling of regional groundwater from the upper muschelkalk into the quaternary aquifer can occur moeck et al 2016 2018a popp et al 2019 at the study site drinking water production is in close proximity to multiple historic landfills as well as active industrial areas to avoid drinking water contamination the gravel aquifer is artificially recharged with surface water to create a hydraulic barrier between contaminated sites and drinking water pumping wells nevertheless a range of pollutants which are typically absent in the artificially infiltrated surface water can be measured at the study site thus besides being influenced by the geological structure groundwater flow is also affected by surface water infiltration and groundwater abstraction for drinking water as well as industrial usage and artificial recharge moeck et al 2017b the artificial groundwater recharge system with infiltration channels and ponds was designed to maintain a hydraulic gradient toward areas of potential risk mostly in the southern direction in which contaminated groundwater is presented moeck et al 2017a overall artificial recharge rates are twice as high as the pumping rates from the 33 drinking water wells pumping well gallery located in the sand gravel aquifer fig 1 due to the high volume of infiltrated water 95 000 m3 d a local groundwater mound has developed in the sand gravel aquifer below the channels serving as a kind of barrier to the natural inflow of contaminated water from adjacent areas fig 1 auckenthaler et al 2010 along the channels excavated to approximately 1 5 m in depth water from the rhine river is diverted to recharge the aquifer and to maintain the hydraulic barrier water is injected at the eastern end of the channels and flows along the natural topographical gradient of the site east to west all water diverted into the channels infiltrates into the aquifer with no other outflow a mass balance approach indicated that a large proportion of the infiltration occurs close to the eastern injection point with only about 25 of the injected water reaching the west end of the channels moeck et al 2017a moreover large volumes of groundwater are pumped for industrial purposes mainly east of the study site moeck et al 2020 in the study area various patterns of contaminants have been observed in previous studies moeck et al 2016 e g close to landfill sites the most commonly found contaminants are perchloroethylene pce trichloroethene tce hexachlorobutadiene hcbd and 1 1 4 4 tetrachlorbutadiene tecbd there is a strong spatial correlation between the different contaminants within the study area with a correlation of 0 84 between pce and tce and 0 88 between hecbd and tecbd moeck et al 2016 all of these compounds have a higher density than water therefore percolation into the subsurface can occur a common hypothesis is that the presently observed concentrations of pce and tce are released from adjacent former landfills south of the pumping water gallery auckenthaler et al 2010 moeck et al 2016 the bedrock underlying these former landfills consists mainly of limestone from the fractured muschelkalk formation fractured bedrock aquifers with minimal or no overburden cover are highly vulnerable to contamination levison et al 2012 palau et al 2014 aquifer contamination to a depth of 100 m can be found in groundwater samples at the study site auckenthaler et al 2010 overall the highest concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons were detected in the south and southwestern part of the study area moeck et al 2016 regional groundwater with higher concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons is therefore most likely to originate from the south moeck et al 2016 consequently it is important to understand the subsurface processes to develop groundwater protection plans and secure safe drinking water production 3 data and methods we analyzed a set of environmental tracers collected mostly between 2015 and 2017 sampling locations consist of 16 groundwater observation wells which includes six multilevel wells and 11 pumping wells fig 1 for the sampling of the wells we either used preinstalled pumps at the pumping wells or a submersible pump mp1 grundfos in case of observation wells we started sampling after purging all wells three times their volume and after field parameters o2 electrical conductivity ec temperature and ph had reached a stable level i e at least three consecutive measurements with the same concentrations within analytical uncertainty were obtained after analysis with a calibrated hach hq40d portable multimeter the different well screen depths for the multilevel wells were sealed with an inflatable double packer system and thus we assume that wellbore flow is negligible all sampled well locations of the drinking water site and well depths are provided in table 1 out of the 27 observation wells 15 wells are screened in the quaternary aquifer whereas 12 screens are located in the muschelkalk aquifer during our sampling campaigns the managed aquifer recharge system was operated under standard conditions i e average water infiltration and abstraction rates which govern the hydraulic head distribution thus hydraulic conditions representative of the standard operation of the managed aquifer recharge site were guaranteed 3 1 hydrochemical data water isotopes and pce concentration all cations and anions as well as stable water isotopes 18o and 2h from samples acquired during the field campaigns were analyzed at eawag labs triplicate measurements and blanks were used but the results were very stable and no data drift was observed the chemical analysis of the 27 samples was performed using standard methods and devices for the major cations and anions metrohm 761 compact ic only datasets with a charge balance error under 5 were used for the hydrochemistry analysis and interpretation güler et al 2002 stated that a calculated charge balance under 5 is an acceptable error the hydrochemistry data were used to assess the hydrogeological origin of the groundwater e g limestone or sand gravel aquifer in addition 26 samples were analyzed for stable isotopes 18o and 2h with a picarro l1102 i furthermore 27 sampling locations were analyzed in the accredited cantonal laboratory to provide pce data 3 2 laboratory based noble gas analysis and 3h 3he dating for the laboratory based noble gas analysis we collected 18 water samples fig 1 in copper tubes following standard sampling procedures beyerle et al 1999 2000 the tube volume was exchanged several times before the actual sampling was conducted the samples were analyzed for noble gases at the eth noble gas lab in zurich switzerland as described by beyerle et al 1999 we determined tritium concentrations using the 3he in growth method tolstikhin and kamenskiy 1969 the copper tubes were stored for several months after the gas 3he extraction to allow for the accumulation of 3he from tritium decay beyerle et al 1999 2000 we used the closed system equilibrium model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 implemented in the numerical code noble90 peeters et al 2003 to obtain 3hetrit for a detailed description on the analysis of dissolved noble gases and tritium in water see beyerle et al 2000 3 3 on site noble gas analysis in the field we use the newly developed ge mims brennwald et al 2016 gasometrix gmbh switzerland to obtain dissolved 4he concentrations the sampling and measurement procedure is explained in detail in popp et al 2019 and will thus be only briefly summarized the abstracted water is pumped through a membrane module 3 m liqui cel 2017 where the dissolved gases are extracted into a head space until a gas equilibrium between the dissolved and the free gas phase is established brennwald et al 2016 the module is connected via a small capillary to a quadrupole mass spectrometer for final gas analysis air water equilibrium within the membrane module is reached after 10 15 min we sampled the ambient air which we used as the standard we conducted four measurement cycles for both the air standard and dissolved gas measurements which resulted in an overall sampling time of less than 60 min at each sampling location water temperature was continuously recorded before the membrane module ds18b20 maxim temperature probe this allows the conversion of the determined gas partial pressures into dissolved gas concentrations according to the solubility constants of henry s law at the respective water temperatures assuming zero salinity kipfer et al 2002 for a more comprehensive description of gas analysis using the ge mims system see brennwald et al 2016 3 4 combining 3h 3he dating and on site noble gas analysis 4he accumulation rates are often obtained from 3h 3he ages and it has been shown that 4he concentrations measured using laboratory and field based ge mims methods closely agree battle aguilar et al 2017 popp et al 2019 therefore it can be postulated that a relationship between field measured 4he and 3h 3he apparent ages can also be derived in this manner hence a relationship between 4he concentrations measured in the field with the portable ge mims system and laboratory measured 3h 3he apparent age would deliver certain advantages even though laboratory data are still required to establish this relationship the advantages are that 4he ge mims field measurements are less expensive and easier to obtain and thus more groundwater observation points can be sampled in a relatively short period of time in this study apparent ages can be derived based on a linear regression between laboratory 3h 3he apparent age data and field measured 4he concentration data 4 results 4 1 relationship between 3h 3he apparent ages and ge mims measurements and spatial distribution a linear relationship between the field based 4he concentrations collected with the ge mims system and the estimated laboratory 3h 3he apparent ages is shown in fig 3 the 4he from the field measurements correlates well with the laboratory 3h 3he apparent ages resulting in a pearson correlation of 0 93 the residuals have a mean standard deviation of 0 16 3 0 years the residuals are randomly distributed and no distinct trend in the distribution of points is observed indicating the suitability of the linear regression in explaining the data most data fall within the 95 confidence interval only pumping wells a 4 and a 33 as well as observation well c 36 all located in the northwestern region of the study area are not within the intervals results from analyzing the regression shows that outliers are well a 4 and a 33 wells with high leverage and influential observations are c 206 and j 89 the results from this analysis and the link to the hydrogeological system are discussed in section 5 using the linear regression equation apparent ages can be predicted for sampling locations where only 4he concentration from the ge mims measurements are available the predicted ages are all less than 10 years except for the deep sampling location of the multilevel well j 100 in which an age of 18 7 years was predicted in this data range the confidence interval width the range of plausible values for the unknown age is smaller than for the upper part where larger 4he concentrations are measured and only a few observations with both 3h 3he apparent ages and 4he concentrations exist e g j 89 and c 206 factors affecting the confidence interval width include the size of the sample the confidence level and the variability in the samples a larger sample set with small variability for a specific value range will tend to produce a better estimate of the predicted apparent age and lower uncertainty this is indicated in fig 3 where predicted age red rectangles are located where most observations with both 3h 3he apparent age and 4he concentrations exist thus uncertainty in the predicted age would be higher for higher 4he values due to the relationship between 3h 3he apparent age and 4he the question of why both measurements correlate so well arises one possible explanation is that radiogenic helium is accumulated in the aquifer by radioactive decay of u and th within the aquifer matrix therefore the 4he concentration is controlled by the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer another explanation is that high 4he is controlled by excess air entrapment and dissolution of air bubbles in response to water table fluctuations or groundwater recharge leads to the formation of excess air i e a surplus of atmospheric gases relative to atmospheric solubility equilibrium kipfer et al 2002 naturally occurring groundwater typically has higher excess air where low excess air should be present in the young artificial infiltrated surface water where a large amount of water is infiltrated daily 95 000 m3 d a mixing between the older naturally occurring groundwater and young infiltrated water could also explain the correlation to understand the reason for this inter relationship we compare measured argon ar with total he concentrations fig 4 ar concentration is not affected by 4he accumulation in the aquifer but only by excess air processes in the case of a correlation between ar and 4he it is assumed that excess air is controlling the relationship between 3h 3he apparent age and 4he whereas if ar does not vary with the 4he concentration then the 4he accumulation in the aquifer leads to the 3h 3he 4he relation fig 4 shows that ar varies in a relatively narrow range and does not show a correlation with he thus the accumulation of 4he in the aquifer by the radioactive decay of u and th leads to a strong correlation between 3h 3he apparent age and 4he observation wells c 206 c 36 and j 100 deep which have higher 4he concentrations are all located at the western edge of the study area in the vicinity of the flexure zone these wells will be discussed in detail in the following sections moreover a stratification can be observed where deeper sampling locations show a slightly higher he concentration e g j 101 deep and shallow sampling depth moreover wells e g a 7 a 33 indicating higher 4he concentrations compared to most other wells used for drinking water supply the spatial distribution of both laboratory measured 3h 3he apparent ages and field based predicted ages hereafter called apparent age for measured and predicted is provided in fig 5 the spatial distribution shows a distinct trend where relatively young water is mostly located close to the artificial infiltration system and the oldest water 58 years observation well j 89 is found in the south close to a landfill where muschelkalk is present at the western edge of the study site for instance groundwater that most likely represents the regional flow path mixed with younger infiltrated water can be found and thus a mixed water age is obtained older than the artificial infiltrated water but younger than the assumed regional groundwater at the western e g j 100 and eastern e g j 98 edges of the study area the decreases in artificial infiltration result in older water ages interestingly observation well c 206 also shows a relatively old groundwater age 36 6 years at most multilevel wells an increasing trend in apparent ages with increasing depth can be observed for example for observation well j 101 an apparent age of 4 1 years was estimated for the upper sampling screen with an increase to 8 0 years of age for the lower sampling screen the observation wells in the direct vicinity of the artificial infiltration system show an age 2 3 years whereas at the pumping wells the age is younger at the pumping wells older ages can be observed for wells a 33 a 4 and a 7 all of which are located at the western edge of the pumping well gallery although pumping well a 17 which is centrally located in the well gallery shows an older age of 2 5 years all other pumping wells show younger apparent ages 4 2 hydrochemistry and water isotopes to better constrain the age distribution hydrochemistry data namely cations and anions were additionally used to provide an indication about the origin of the sampled groundwater the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer shows the same hydrochemistry than the artificial infiltrated surface water moeck et al 2016 in contrast the muschelkalk water has a considerably different hydrochemistry than the artificial infiltrated surface water including an increase in ca2 na cl so4 2 and hco3 at the study site moeck et al 2016 2018b such that a relationship between hydrochemistry and apparent age is expected fig 6 shows a strong relationship between the cations na and ca2 as well as the anions cl and hco3 with apparent age note that a correlation between ec and so4 2 respectively with apparent age results in a correlation of 0 79 in both cases but is not graphically presented here a distinct trend between the hydrochemical data and the apparent age can be observed where older groundwater shows a higher concentration of the aforementioned cations and anions e g j 89 again a trend between sampling locations in the south j 89 following the regional flow path along the western edge c 206 toward the north c 36 can be observed at pumping wells where the impact of artificial infiltration is low e g a 7 a higher concentration of cations and anions can be observed furthermore stratification at the multilevel wells is also present where greater age and deeper sampling intervals correlate to higher concentrations j 101 although the differences are not large stable water isotopes 18o and 2h ranged from 11 32 to 8 76 and 82 54 to 65 63 respectively fig 7 the isotope compositions follow the local meteoric water line sampling locations in the south and at the western edge j 89 and c 206 show different isotope values than most of the other locations which presents an isotopic signature from the artificially infiltrated rhine surface water the groundwater multilevel well j 98 as well as the sampling locations in the north west c 43 and c 36 have an enriched isotope composition indicating different water sources the measured values cannot be explained by the variability in rhine water used to recharged the gravel aquifer range of rhine water isotopes time series of 5 years is between 11 4 and 10 3 for δ18o and 81 8 and 74 1 for δ2h this interpretation is further underpinned by combining the apparent age with 18o again sampling locations j 89 and c 206 show a distinctly different age and isotope composition also locations c 43 c 36 and j 98 are clearly differentiated from most other samples which are plotted in a very narrow range of ages and isotope values 4 3 linking apparent age water origin and pce concentration the pce contamination used as a proxy for many other contaminants found at the study site is related to information about the apparent age distribution and groundwater origin fig 8 shows the linkage between the apparent ages and pce concentrations the highest concentration of pce 3 6 μg l occurs where the oldest groundwater was estimated 58 years j 89 located in the south and in close vicinity of a landfill in addition observation wells c 206 and c 36 underpin the relationship between age and pce concentration where the pce concentration decreases with decreasing age moreover most multilevel wells with deeper sampling depths indicate higher concentrations of pce this might highlight the higher density of pce than water with percolation into the deeper subsurface occurring additionally groundwater stratification can be found where younger surface water has likely infiltrated the upper part of the aquifer and older water with a higher fraction of regional muschelkalk groundwater can be found in the lower part in addition the pumping wells in the western part of the pumping well gallery e g a 4 and a 7 show higher concentrations of pce although the concentrations are relatively low overall at the pumping wells in general for sampling locations where water ages are lower the pce concentrations are also typically lower to better constrain the relationship between pce apparent age and water origin we used results from a previous bayesian groundwater mixing model developed for the study area popp et al 2019 this approach explicitly considers the possibility of unknown end members referred to as residual end member the bayesian model defined two end members that represent the infiltrated rhine surface water and regional groundwater sampled from observation well j 100 deep sampling screen observation well j 100 is to be found in the southwestern edge of the study area a location where the muschelkalk strata is present moeck et al 2016 in addition groundwater level observations indicate that this well is hardly affected by the artificial infiltration the isotopic composition is indicative of muschelkalk water moeck et al 2016 and therefore can be assumed to be representative for the regional groundwater popp et al 2019 the bayesian model was run with a tracer set which includes 4he analyzed on site to determine mixing ratios in the groundwater fig 9 shows the apparent age versus the fraction of the corresponding end member from the mixing calculations the size of the points represent the pce concentration at the sampling locations if the proportion of infiltrated water is high then both pce concentrations and apparent ages tend to be low in the rhine surface water pce is typically absent and artificial infiltrated water is thus free of such contaminants for pumping wells with a slightly smaller fraction of surface water e g a 17 a 4 and a 7 the apparent age and pce concentrations increase for high and deep wells e g j 101 the fraction of surface water is low and pce concentrations are around 1 0 μg l for these wells it seems that a proportion of the residual end member is contributing to the water chemistry age and pce concentration beyond that we see that observation well c 206 has a high proportion of both muschelkalk and residual groundwater leading to a pce concentration of 0 75 μg l and an age of 36 6 years the presence of a high ratio of a previously unknown water source flexure zone with fractures suggests that faults can play a role as preferential flow paths for the transport of old groundwater contributing to pce contamination the typically unknown fracture network and distribution however makes a tracking of the pce origin extremely challenging e g palau et al 2014 perrin et al 2011 therrien and sudicky 1996 slough et al 1999 however the highest pce concentration was measured at observation well j 89 3 6 μg l having the oldest age 58 years and is located in the direct vicinity to a former landfill 5 discussion using 3h 3he apparent ages provides important information for site characterization and helps to develop conceptual models for groundwater flow and transport processes however the analysis is expensive and time and labor intensive only a few specialized laboratories can carry out such analyses on a routine basis potentially limiting the amount of sampling locations popp et al 2019 in contrast the new developments in field based portable mass spectrometry provide a unique opportunity to measure dissolved gas concentrations such as 4he or other noble gases relatively quickly battle aguilar et al 2017 brennwald et al 2016 2020 due to the quasi real time measurements in the field adaptive and more efficient sampling campaigns can be carried out the two methods laboratory based 3h 3he apparent age estimation and 4he concentrations based on in situ ge mims measurements however differ regarding sampling volume and technique analytical procedure calibration and data processing thus the assumption that both methods yield comparable results is not straightforward however as demonstrated in this study and elsewhere battle aguilar et al 2017 popp et al 2019 a statistical correlation between data sets can be derived demonstrating that the results of the simpler ge mims system are as satisfactory as those of the highly sophisticated lab based method thus the combined use of laboratory and predicted groundwater apparent ages based on the ge mims relationship opens new opportunities in determining groundwater sources and apparent ages this allows increased insight into the flow and transport behavior of contaminants and helps to determine groundwater residence times moreover the ge mims is able to measure various gases and might provide further opportunities to investigate a study site from additional perspectives knapp et al 2019 popp et al 2020 roques et al 2020 tomonaga et al 2019 moreover we can demonstrate that the relationship between 3h 3he apparent ages and 4he concentrations is controlled by radiogenic he which accumulates in the aquifer by radioactive decay of u and th and thus 4he concentration is mainly controlled by the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer at the study site the combined use of measured and predicted apparent ages linked to hydrochemical data water isotopes and pce concentrations were a valuable toolset to identify spatial inter aquifer mixing in the subsurface the results obtained from the age distribution analysis are strongly supported by the information gained from the isotopic and hydrochemical data based on the combined results it can be concluded that in the vicinity of the pumping wells a higher amount of artificially infiltrated surface water is mixed with water originating from the regional flow pathway the mixing signal can also be found in a few specific pumping wells in the western part of the study area which seems to be linked to fault induced aquifer connectivity the flexure zone with its large number of faults represents a separate flow path as indicated by popp et al 2019 moreover it is indicated that close to the infiltration system upwelling of regional groundwater through fractures occurs this upwelling causes mixing between the young artificial infiltrated water and older regional groundwater leading to higher ages in the vicinity of the infiltration system fig 5 this is in line with results obtained from the spatial concentration pattern of the persistent artificial sweetener acesulfame moeck et al 2017b which shows a significant decrease in concentration in the wells compared to the infiltrated water especially in an area close to the infiltration channels in this area upwelling through the fractures might have been localized and a contribution from the limestone aquifer which has smaller concentrations of acesulfame may dilute the groundwater in the upper aquifer moeck et al 2017b this upwelling can occur locally which is demonstrated by popp et al 2019 it was shown that further away from the artificial recharge system e g a 16 the fraction of rhine filtrate is still large and the apparent age is small 1 year for the pumping well a 17 which is in 130 m distance we showed that a comparatively lower fraction of recently infiltrated water exists and that the apparent age increases 2 5 years moreover three dimensional modeling for the study area suggests further that within the well field the central pumping wells e g pumping well a 17 could be extracting more regional groundwater moeck et al 2020 on the other hand moeck et al 2017b showed that with constant pumping rates more artificially infiltrated surface water is extracted which led to a higher dilution of the regional groundwater we postulate that the combined effect of upwelling of regional groundwater and constant pumping explain that the youngest groundwater is in part associated to pumping wells and not to observation wells near the infiltration facilities thus water mixing through the flexure zone and fractures might be of greater importance for water management at the study site than previously assumed wells located at the western edge of the study area i e 21 c 36 21 a 7 21 c 206 21 j 101 shallow and deep show elevated 4he concentrations and higher ages from 4 1 to 36 6 years although wells a 4 and a 33 are identified as outliers in the regression analysis we observed that the northwestern part of the study area is less impacted by the artificial recharge and the fraction of rhine filtrate decreases all wells with a considerable fraction of the residual end member see also fig 9 are being located at the western border of the study area and therefore it might indicate a different hydrogeological flow dynamic here another regression model might be useful but building a linear regression only on a few observations points would not lead to a robust model moreover groundwater age was found to increase with depth e g multilevel well j 101 exhibited an age of 4 1 years and 8 0 years for the upper and lower sampling screens respectively and distance to the artificial infiltration system e g j 98 and j 89 furthermore a large proportion of the infiltration occurs close to the eastern injection point with only about 25 of the injected water reaching the west end of the channels moeck et al 2017a 2020 thus the local groundwater mound in the sand gravel aquifer which serves as a barrier to natural inflow of potentially contaminated water from adjacent areas is spatially imbalanced and more regional groundwater is expected at the western edge of the sample site this can also be observed by considering the pce concentration and groundwater age which is higher at the western edge generally the highest pce concentrations can be found in the south in the vicinity of the landfill observation well j 89 and west e g observation well c 206 where the impact of artificial infiltration is low well c 206 was identified in moeck et al 2016 as an exception based on a multicomponent statistical analysis this sampling location situated in the vicinity of the rhine valley flexure zone differs compared to other wells in terms of high concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl moeck et al 2016 2017a 2017b popp et al 2019 showed that c 206 has an exceptionally low fraction of the surface water end member but simultaneously also has a relatively high fraction of an unknown end member it was speculated that this might be an indication of vertical exchange and upwelling of waters originating from the salt and gypsum layer moeck et al 2016 the wells j 89 located in the south of the study area has the oldest water and highest concentration of pce this well shows a strong impact of regional limestone water these afromentioned two wells j 89 and c 206 are important because they not only have a high pce concentrations and highest apparent ages but they also have a disproportionate impact on the regression for instance if we would drop one of these observations it would affect our model thus it is important to have these values included and if possible to acquire more data with large apparent ages and 4he concentrations this is however difficult for most studies because typically it is not known where these locations are thus a sound initial conceptual process understanding for flow and transport must be developed before sampling in the field is carried out small concentrations of pce can be found at all pumping wells but are slightly higher for wells at the western edge however pumping well a 17 located more centrally in the pumping gallery was found to exhibit different hydrochemistry age and pce concentrations compared to most other wells in the same vicinity this well seems to be hydraulically connected to the underlying aquifer as already indicated in previous studies moeck et al 2016 2017b popp et al 2019 according to popp et al 2019 differences at this well might originate from a higher fraction of regional groundwater 6 and residual most likely fracture end member 6 relative to the surrounding wells the use of chemical tracers temperature groundwater ages this study and numerical modeling provide evidence for cross fault flow moeck et al 2016 2017a 2018a 2020 popp et al 2019 furthermore observation well c 206 has a distinct geochemical signature and age which could not be classed with any other investigated well this is in line with the results from a multicomponent statistical analysis where well c 206 was identified with a distinctly different ca2 co2 pressure relationship compared to all other wells and was therefore treated as an exception moeck et al 2016 based on the bayesian mixing model popp et al 2019 paired with apparent age estimates we can now explain these different characteristics by the presence of a high ratio 36 of a previously unknown water source flexure zone with fractures associated with an older groundwater age 36 6 years and a higher pce concentration this sampling point situated in the vicinity of the rhine valley flexure zone suggests that faults can play a role as preferential flow paths for the transport of old groundwater which is richer in helium and has an elevated pce concentration 6 summary and conclusions in urban areas groundwater management is often challenged by contamination management therefore requires a thorough and robust scientific understanding of flow and transport processes as well as groundwater residence time environmental tracers such as tritium and the decay product helium have been shown to efficiently determine the source of groundwater in order to gain insight into flow and transport processes and to determine groundwater residence times however the analysis is expensive and labor and time intensive therefore potentially limiting the amount of possible sampling locations in contrast new developments in a portable field operated ge mims system provides a unique opportunity to measure dissolved gas concentrations such as 4he relatively quickly and inexpensively due to technical and analytical differences between the two methods laboratory 3h 3he age and field based ge mims 4he analysis yielding comparable results is not straightforward we establish an inter relationship between 3h 3he apparent groundwater age and 4he measured with the ge mims and demonstrate that the results of the simpler ge mims system are as satisfactory as those of the highly sophisticated lab based method thus the combined use of laboratory and predicted groundwater ages based on the ge mims relationship opens up new opportunities in site characterization even though laboratory data are still required to establish this relationship for each study site the applicability of the method is assured when radiogenic helium is accumulated in the aquifer by radioactive decay of u and th within the aquifer matrix therefore the 4he concentration is controlled by the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer the demonstrated analysis reveals valuable insights into the conceptual understanding of groundwater systems the analysis has the potential to provide crucial information regarding the dynamics of groundwater systems residence time mixing flow regime etc and can be useful for a large range of hydrogeological projects aquifer vulnerability contaminated sites groundwater resource assessments sustainability studies geothermal assessments quantification of groundwater mixing calibration verification of numerical models etc additionally the ge mims is able to measure various gases and might provide further opportunities to investigate a study site from further perspectives for our study site we combined the laboratory based and predicted apparent ages with hydrochemical data water isotopes and pce concentrations to identify spatial inter aquifer mixing in the subsurface this approach allowed us to identify the spatial pattern of mixing between recent artificially infiltrated groundwater and water originating from the regional flow path we found a strong correlation between groundwater ages and pce concentrations overall low pce concentrations and young groundwater ages occur when the fraction of artificially infiltrated water is high moreover for some wells fault induced aquifer connectivity is recognized suggesting that the faults play a major role as preferential flow paths for the transport of old groundwater richer in helium and elevated pce concentrations declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support from the canton

1449,urban groundwater management requires a thorough and robust scientific understanding of flow and transport processes 3h 3he apparent ages have been shown to efficiently help provide important groundwater related information however this type of analysis is expensive as well as labor and time intensive and hence limits the number of potential sampling locations to overcome this limitation we established an inter relationship between 3h 3he apparent groundwater ages and 4he concentrations analyzed in the field with a newly developed portable gas equilibrium membrane inlet mass spectrometer ge mims system and demonstrated that the results of the simpler ge mims system are an accurate and reliable alternative to sophisticated laboratory based analyses the combined use of 3h 3he lab based ages and predicted ages from the 3h 3he 4he age relationship opens new opportunities for site characterization and reveals insights into the conceptual understanding of groundwater systems for our study site we combined groundwater ages with hydrochemical data water isotopes 18o and 2h and perchloroethylene pce concentrations 1 to identify spatial inter aquifer mixing between artificially infiltrated groundwater and water originating from regional flow paths and 2 to explain the spatial differences in pce contamination within the observed groundwater system overall low pce concentrations and young ages occur when the fraction of artificially infiltrated water is high the results obtained from the age distribution analysis are strongly supported by the information gained from the isotopic and hydrochemical data moreover for some wells fault induced aquifer connectivity is identified as a preferential flow path for the transport of older groundwater leading to elevated

water demands for industrial agricultural and household uses combined with climate change is leading to an imbalance of water supply and demand in many regions and challenging water resource management e g burri et al 2019 de graaf et al 2014 gleeson et al 2012 minnig et al 2018 especially in urban areas with industrial zones the supply of drinking water from groundwater sources is further complicated due to potential groundwater contamination bertrand et al 2016 navarro and carbonell 2007 water management in such areas is recognized as a very complex task both in terms of different spatial and temporal scales schirmer et al 2013 vázquez suñé et al 2005 contaminated sites are often the foremost concern for groundwater quality it is problematic if these sites are located in the vicinity of drinking water production areas potentially leading to decreased water quality and posing a potential risk to both human health and the environment baillieux et al 2015 karges et al 2018 thus sustainable and efficient water management practices within these environments require a thorough scientific understanding of flow and transport processes as well as groundwater residence time e g chambers et al 2019 gooddy et al 2006 manning and caine 2007 mccallum et al 2014 assessing groundwater flow paths and residence times is critical for the exploitation of aquifers and developing adequate groundwater protection plans in particular however adequate quantification of these processes is often challenged by complex geological settings and subsurface heterogeneity e g cirpka and kitanidis 2000 koltermann and gorelick 1996 moeck et al 2020 poeter and gaylord 1990 regli et al 2003 which cannot be fully explored fienen et al 2009 kitanidis 2015 renard 2007 as a result both the spatial distribution of contaminants within an aquifer and the time needed for water quality changes to propagate through the system are not completely understood szabo et al 1996 strategies to protect drinking water production sites are often based on limited data and thus limited system knowledge mackay et al 1985 moeck et al 2016 environmental tracers have been shown to efficiently determine the sources and residence times of groundwater offering insight into the flow and transport behavior of contaminants battle aguilar et al 2017 cook and böhlke 2000 mccallum et al 2014 schilling et al 2019 since the majority of groundwater contamination in urban areas has occurred in recent times 100 years tritium 3h is a suitable tracer for younger groundwater up to 60 years in age e g kipfer et al 2002 tritium was released between the late 1950s and early 1960s in high amounts mainly into the stratosphere by thermonuclear bomb tests cook and herczeg 2012 massmann et al 2009 in combination with its decay product helium 3he tritium provides an age measure independent of the tritium input cook and solomon 1997 this makes it advantageous as a tracer as it eliminates the necessity to establish the exact time dependent tritium delivery to the aquifer helium produced by 3h decay accumulates in groundwater and does not undergo any chemical reactions making it an ideal tracer there exist different sources of 3he that define the total 3he 3hetot these are the concentration in solubility equilibrium with the atmosphere 3heeq the component originating from excess air 3heex terrigenic components derived from the crust and mantle 3heter and the source that comes from the decay of tritium 3hetri see kipfer et al 2002 for a review the different components can be estimated and fractions can be subsequently subtracted from 3hetot thanks to the complementary measurements of other noble gases more details can be found in kipfer et al 2002 among others because groundwater cannot be dated directly only an apparent age can be obtained by using 3h as a tracer the so called apparent 3h 3he age e g kipfer et al 2002 sanford 2011 apparent groundwater age is the measure of time since the water entered the saturated zone and was isolated from the atmosphere thus the apparent age corresponds to the time since recharge has occurred cook and solomon 1995 suckow 2014 if dispersive and mixing effects are small the apparent age can be compared directly with advective travel times in the groundwater system however long filter screens dispersion and flow path convergence will always lead to an age spectrum rather than an exact value as a result the method is typically biased toward the age of the water component with the higher tritium concentration kipfer et al 2002 moreover the analysis is expensive as well as labor and time intensive and only a few specialized laboratories can carry out such analyses on a routine basis nevertheless this method provides important information and has been successfully used in many groundwater studies e g aeschbach hertig et al 1998 corcho alvarado et al 2005 2007 ekwurzel et al 1994 jasechko 2016 labolle et

additional indicator for older groundwater lehmann et al 2003 solomon 2000 4he accumulates over time due to subsurface production by radioactive decay of uranium u and thorium th within the aquifer matrix solomon 2000 and by external fluxes from the deeper strata torgersen and clarke 1985 groundwater age determination with 4he depends upon knowledge of the 4he accumulation rate which is usually obtained by comparison with 14c torgersen and clarke 1985 wei et al 2015 3h 3he ages beyerle et al 1999 or from measurements of production rates obtained from aquifer material lehmann et al 2003 a newly developed portable field operated ge mims system brennwald et al 2016 provides a unique opportunity to measure dissolved gas concentrations such as 4he in groundwater systems although it is not capable of providing an apparent age the ge mims system is able to measure dissolved gases in a stream of water quasi continuously 10 15 min with relatively low detection limits below 3 10 9 cmstp3 g

aquifer mixing between artificially infiltrated and regional groundwater by means of a relationship between field measured 4he concentrations analyzed with the ge mims system and lab based 3h 3he apparent ages the insights gained by this analysis allowed us to developed a consistent conceptual process understanding for flow and transport processes for an urban study area in switzerland more specifically the following tasks are addressed we aimed to determine the relationship between field measured 4he concentrations analyzed with a ge mims system and lab based apparent 3h 3he ages the combined apparent ages from the laboratory and field measurements predicted from the aforementioned relationship will be used to evaluate the influence of artificial groundwater recharge inter aquifer mixing and possible fault induced aquifer connectivity along the flow paths the results are validated with independently measured concentration patterns of water isotopes 18o and 2h and hydrochemical data cations and anions we related apparent water ages hydrochemistry and isotope results to pollutants such as perchloroethylene pce one of the most commonly found contaminants at the study site subsequently we determined the origin of the groundwater at the observation site and drinking water pumping wells in order to aid the development of water management strategies 2 study area and

bottom to the top include the lower muschelkalk middle muschelkalk upper muschelkalk keuper jurassic strata tertiary sediments and unconsolidated quaternary cover fig 2 the lower muschelkalk consists of marly sediments the middle muschelkalk consists mainly of dolomites marls clays and evaporates sulphate zone and the upper muschelkalk is characterized by a regionally important fractured and karstified limestone aquifer spottke et al 2005 the keuper jurassic strata and tertiary sediments represent a local aquiclude due to their low hydraulic conductivity the bedrock units are covered by unconsolidated quaternary sediments which form an unconfined fluvio glacial sand gravel aquifer spottke et al 2005 the region s most prominent tectonic feature is a portion of the upper rhine graben main border fault which is represented by a flexure zone and a large number of faults moeck et al 2016 spottke et al 2005 the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured flexure zone is unknown and is likely spatially variable moeck et al 2020 this fracture zone may represent a separate flow path due to its higher permeability and could therefore support the vertical exchange of groundwater or it may be filled with fine sediments that form a hydraulic barrier moeck et al 2020 the two most hydrogeologically relevant units are the aforementioned quaternary sediments and the upper muschelkalk representing two locally important aquifers moeck et al 2016 2018b a possible additional water component as indicated in popp et al 2019 is located at the western edge of the study area in the vicinity of the flexure zone predominant groundwater flows from southeast to northwest in the direction of the rhine river fig 1 due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the middle muschelkalk sulphate zone together with the decreasing thickness of the upper muschelkalk upwelling of regional groundwater from the upper muschelkalk into the quaternary aquifer can occur moeck et al 2016 2018a popp et al 2019 at the study site drinking water production is in close proximity to multiple historic landfills as well as active industrial areas to avoid drinking water contamination the gravel aquifer is artificially recharged with surface water to create a hydraulic barrier between contaminated sites and drinking water pumping wells nevertheless a range of pollutants which are typically absent in the artificially infiltrated surface water can be measured at the study site thus besides being influenced by the geological structure groundwater flow is also affected by surface water infiltration and groundwater abstraction for drinking water as well as industrial usage and artificial recharge moeck et al 2017b the artificial groundwater recharge system with infiltration channels and ponds was designed to maintain a hydraulic gradient toward areas of potential risk mostly in the southern direction in which contaminated groundwater is presented moeck et al 2017a overall artificial recharge rates are twice as high as the pumping rates from the 33 drinking water wells pumping well gallery located in the sand gravel aquifer fig 1 due to the high volume of infiltrated water 95 000 m3 d a local groundwater mound has developed in the sand gravel aquifer below the channels serving as a kind of barrier to the natural inflow of contaminated water from adjacent areas fig 1 auckenthaler et al 2010 along the channels excavated to approximately 1 5 m in depth water from the rhine river is diverted to recharge the aquifer and to maintain the hydraulic barrier water is injected at the eastern end of the channels and flows along the natural topographical gradient of the site east to west all water diverted into the channels infiltrates into the aquifer with no other outflow a mass balance approach indicated that a large proportion of the infiltration occurs close to the eastern injection point with only about 25 of the injected water reaching the west end of the channels moeck et al 2017a moreover large volumes of groundwater are pumped for industrial purposes mainly east of the study site moeck et al 2020 in the study area various patterns of contaminants have been observed in previous studies moeck et al 2016 e g close to landfill sites the most commonly found contaminants are perchloroethylene pce trichloroethene tce hexachlorobutadiene hcbd and 1 1 4 4 tetrachlorbutadiene tecbd there is a strong spatial correlation between the different contaminants within the study area with a correlation of 0 84 between pce and tce and 0 88 between hecbd and tecbd moeck et al 2016 all of these compounds have a higher density than water therefore percolation into the subsurface can occur a common hypothesis is that the presently observed concentrations of pce and tce are released from adjacent former landfills south of the pumping water gallery auckenthaler et al 2010 moeck et al 2016 the bedrock underlying these former landfills consists mainly of limestone from the fractured muschelkalk formation fractured bedrock aquifers with minimal or no overburden cover are highly vulnerable to contamination levison et al 2012 palau et al 2014 aquifer contamination to a depth of 100 m can be found in groundwater samples at the study site auckenthaler et al 2010 overall the highest concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons were detected in the south and southwestern part of the study area moeck et al 2016 regional groundwater with higher concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons is therefore most likely to originate from the south moeck et al 2016 consequently it is important to understand the subsurface processes to develop groundwater protection plans and secure safe drinking water production 3 data and methods we analyzed a set of environmental tracers collected mostly between 2015 and 2017 sampling locations consist of 16 groundwater observation wells which includes six multilevel wells and 11 pumping wells fig 1 for the sampling of the wells we either used preinstalled pumps at the pumping wells or a submersible pump mp1 grundfos in case of observation wells we started sampling after purging all wells three times their volume and after field parameters o2 electrical conductivity ec temperature and ph had reached a stable level i e at least three consecutive measurements with the same concentrations within analytical uncertainty were obtained after analysis with a calibrated hach hq40d portable multimeter the different well screen depths for the multilevel wells were sealed with an inflatable double packer system and thus we assume that wellbore flow is negligible all sampled well locations of the drinking water site and well depths are provided in table 1 out of the 27 observation wells 15 wells are screened in the quaternary aquifer whereas 12 screens are located in the muschelkalk aquifer during our sampling campaigns the managed aquifer recharge system was operated under standard conditions i e average water infiltration and abstraction rates which govern the hydraulic head distribution thus hydraulic conditions representative of the standard operation of the managed aquifer recharge site were guaranteed 3 1 hydrochemical data water isotopes and pce concentration all cations and anions as well as stable water isotopes 18o and 2h from samples acquired during the field campaigns were analyzed at eawag labs triplicate measurements and blanks were used but the results were very stable and no data drift was observed the chemical analysis of the 27 samples was performed using standard methods and devices for the major cations and anions metrohm 761 compact ic only datasets with a charge balance error under 5 were used for the hydrochemistry analysis and interpretation güler et al 2002 stated that a calculated charge balance under 5 is an acceptable error the hydrochemistry data were used to assess the hydrogeological origin of the groundwater e g limestone or sand gravel aquifer in addition 26 samples were analyzed for stable isotopes 18o and 2h with a picarro l1102 i furthermore 27 sampling locations were analyzed in the accredited cantonal laboratory to provide pce data 3 2 laboratory based noble gas analysis and 3h 3he dating for the laboratory based noble gas analysis we collected 18 water samples fig 1 in copper tubes following standard sampling procedures beyerle et al 1999 2000 the tube volume was exchanged several times before the actual sampling was conducted the samples were analyzed for noble gases at the eth noble gas lab in zurich switzerland as described by beyerle et al 1999 we determined tritium concentrations using the 3he in growth method tolstikhin and kamenskiy 1969 the copper tubes were stored for several months after the gas 3he extraction to allow for the accumulation of 3he from tritium decay beyerle et al 1999 2000 we used the closed system equilibrium model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 implemented in the numerical code noble90 peeters et al 2003 to obtain 3hetrit for a detailed description on the analysis of dissolved noble gases and tritium in water see beyerle et al 2000 3 3 on site noble gas analysis in the field we use the newly developed ge mims brennwald et al 2016 gasometrix gmbh switzerland to obtain dissolved 4he concentrations the sampling and measurement procedure is explained in detail in popp et al 2019 and will thus be only briefly summarized the abstracted water is pumped through a membrane module 3 m liqui cel 2017 where the dissolved gases are extracted into a head space until a gas equilibrium between the dissolved and the free gas phase is established brennwald et al 2016 the module is connected via a small capillary to a quadrupole mass spectrometer for final gas analysis air water equilibrium within the membrane module is reached after 10 15 min we sampled the ambient air which we used as the standard we conducted four measurement cycles for both the air standard and dissolved gas measurements which resulted in an overall sampling time of less than 60 min at each sampling location water temperature was continuously recorded before the membrane module ds18b20 maxim temperature probe this allows the conversion of the determined gas partial pressures into dissolved gas concentrations according to the solubility constants of henry s law at the respective water temperatures assuming zero salinity kipfer et al 2002 for a more comprehensive description of gas analysis using the ge mims system see brennwald et al 2016 3 4 combining 3h 3he dating and on site noble gas analysis 4he accumulation rates are often obtained from 3h 3he ages and it has been shown that 4he concentrations measured using laboratory and field based ge mims methods closely agree battle aguilar et al 2017 popp et al 2019 therefore it can be postulated that a relationship between field measured 4he and 3h 3he apparent ages can also be derived in this manner hence a relationship between 4he concentrations measured in the field with the portable ge mims system and laboratory measured 3h 3he apparent age would deliver certain advantages even though laboratory data are still required to establish this relationship the advantages are that 4he ge mims field measurements are less expensive and easier to obtain and thus more groundwater observation points can be sampled in a relatively short period of time in this study apparent ages can be derived based on a linear regression between laboratory 3h 3he apparent age data and field measured 4he concentration data 4 results 4 1 relationship between 3h 3he apparent ages and ge mims measurements and spatial distribution a linear relationship between the field based 4he concentrations collected with the ge mims system and the estimated laboratory 3h 3he apparent ages is shown in fig 3 the 4he from the field measurements correlates well with the laboratory 3h 3he apparent ages resulting in a pearson correlation of 0 93 the residuals have a mean standard deviation of 0 16 3 0 years the residuals are randomly distributed and no distinct trend in the distribution of points is observed indicating the suitability of the linear regression in explaining the data most data fall within the 95 confidence interval only pumping wells a 4 and a 33 as well as observation well c 36 all located in the northwestern region of the study area are not within the intervals results from analyzing the regression shows that outliers are well a 4 and a 33 wells with high leverage and influential observations are c 206 and j 89 the results from this analysis and the link to the hydrogeological system are discussed in section 5 using the linear regression equation apparent ages can be predicted for sampling locations where only 4he concentration from the ge mims measurements are available the predicted ages are all less than 10 years except for the deep sampling location of the multilevel well j 100 in which an age of 18 7 years was predicted in this data range the confidence interval width the range of plausible values for the unknown age is smaller than for the upper part where larger 4he concentrations are measured and only a few observations with both 3h 3he apparent ages and 4he concentrations exist e g j 89 and c 206 factors affecting the confidence interval width include the size of the sample the confidence level and the variability in the samples a larger sample set with small variability for a specific value range will tend to produce a better estimate of the predicted apparent age and lower uncertainty this is indicated in fig 3 where predicted age red rectangles are located where most observations with both 3h 3he apparent age and 4he concentrations exist thus uncertainty in the predicted age would be higher for higher 4he values due to the relationship between 3h 3he apparent age and 4he the question of why both measurements correlate so well arises one possible explanation is that radiogenic helium is accumulated in the aquifer by radioactive decay of u and th within the aquifer matrix therefore the 4he concentration is controlled by the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer another explanation is that high 4he is controlled by excess air entrapment and dissolution of air bubbles in response to water table fluctuations or groundwater recharge leads to the formation of excess air i e a surplus of atmospheric gases relative to atmospheric solubility equilibrium kipfer et al 2002 naturally occurring groundwater typically has higher excess air where low excess air should be present in the young artificial infiltrated surface water where a large amount of water is infiltrated daily 95 000 m3 d a mixing between the older naturally occurring groundwater and young infiltrated water could also explain the correlation to understand the reason for this inter relationship we compare measured argon ar with total he concentrations fig 4 ar concentration is not affected by 4he accumulation in the aquifer but only by excess air processes in the case of a correlation between ar and 4he it is assumed that excess air is controlling the relationship between 3h 3he apparent age and 4he whereas if ar does not vary with the 4he concentration then the 4he accumulation in the aquifer leads to the 3h 3he 4he relation fig 4 shows that ar varies in a relatively narrow range and does not show a correlation with he thus the accumulation of 4he in the aquifer by the radioactive decay of u and th leads to a strong correlation between 3h 3he apparent age and 4he observation wells c 206 c 36 and j 100 deep which have higher 4he concentrations are all located at the western edge of the study area in the vicinity of the flexure zone these wells will be discussed in detail in the following sections moreover a stratification can be observed where deeper sampling locations show a slightly higher he concentration e g j 101 deep and shallow sampling depth moreover wells e g a 7 a 33 indicating higher 4he concentrations compared to most other wells used for drinking water supply the spatial distribution of both laboratory measured 3h 3he apparent ages and field based predicted ages hereafter called apparent age for measured and predicted is provided in fig 5 the spatial distribution shows a distinct trend where relatively young water is mostly located close to the artificial infiltration system and the oldest water 58 years observation well j 89 is found in the south close to a landfill where muschelkalk is present at the western edge of the study site for instance groundwater that most likely represents the regional flow path mixed with younger infiltrated water can be found and thus a mixed water age is obtained older than the artificial infiltrated water but younger than the assumed regional groundwater at the western e g j 100 and eastern e g j 98 edges of the study area the decreases in artificial infiltration result in older water ages interestingly observation well c 206 also shows a relatively old groundwater age 36 6 years at most multilevel wells an increasing trend in apparent ages with increasing depth can be observed for example for observation well j 101 an apparent age of 4 1 years was estimated for the upper sampling screen with an increase to 8 0 years of age for the lower sampling screen the observation wells in the direct vicinity of the artificial infiltration system show an age 2 3 years whereas at the pumping wells the age is younger at the pumping wells older ages can be observed for wells a 33 a 4 and a 7 all of which are located at the western edge of the pumping well gallery although pumping well a 17 which is centrally located in the well gallery shows an older age of 2 5 years all other pumping wells show younger apparent ages 4 2 hydrochemistry and water isotopes to better constrain the age distribution hydrochemistry data namely cations and anions were additionally used to provide an indication about the origin of the sampled groundwater the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer shows the same hydrochemistry than the artificial infiltrated surface water moeck et al 2016 in contrast the muschelkalk water has a considerably different hydrochemistry than the artificial infiltrated surface water including an increase in ca2 na cl so4 2 and hco3 at the study site moeck et al 2016 2018b such that a relationship between hydrochemistry and apparent age is expected fig 6 shows a strong relationship between the cations na and ca2 as well as the anions cl and hco3 with apparent age note that a correlation between ec and so4 2 respectively with apparent age results in a correlation of 0 79 in both cases but is not graphically presented here a distinct trend between the hydrochemical data and the apparent age can be observed where older groundwater shows a higher concentration of the aforementioned cations and anions e g j 89 again a trend between sampling locations in the south j 89 following the regional flow path along the western edge c 206 toward the north c 36 can be observed at pumping wells where the impact of artificial infiltration is low e g a 7 a higher concentration of cations and anions can be observed furthermore stratification at the multilevel wells is also present where greater age and deeper sampling intervals correlate to higher concentrations j 101 although the differences are not large stable water isotopes 18o and 2h ranged from 11 32 to 8 76 and 82 54 to 65 63 respectively fig 7 the isotope compositions follow the local meteoric water line sampling locations in the south and at the western edge j 89 and c 206 show different isotope values than most of the other locations which presents an isotopic signature from the artificially infiltrated rhine surface water the groundwater multilevel well j 98 as well as the sampling locations in the north west c 43 and c 36 have an enriched isotope composition indicating different water sources the measured values cannot be explained by the variability in rhine water used to recharged the gravel aquifer range of rhine water isotopes time series of 5 years is between 11 4 and 10 3 for δ18o and 81 8 and 74 1 for δ2h this interpretation is further underpinned by combining the apparent age with 18o again sampling locations j 89 and c 206 show a distinctly different age and isotope composition also locations c 43 c 36 and j 98 are clearly differentiated from most other samples which are plotted in a very narrow range of ages and isotope values 4 3 linking apparent age water origin and pce concentration the pce contamination used as a proxy for many other contaminants found at the study site is related to information about the apparent age distribution and groundwater origin fig 8 shows the linkage between the apparent ages and pce concentrations the highest concentration of pce 3 6 μg l occurs where the oldest groundwater was estimated 58 years j 89 located in the south and in close vicinity of a landfill in addition observation wells c 206 and c 36 underpin the relationship between age and pce concentration where the pce concentration decreases with decreasing age moreover most multilevel wells with deeper sampling depths indicate higher concentrations of pce this might highlight the higher density of pce than water with percolation into the deeper subsurface occurring additionally groundwater stratification can be found where younger surface water has likely infiltrated the upper part of the aquifer and older water with a higher fraction of regional muschelkalk groundwater can be found in the lower part in addition the pumping wells in the western part of the pumping well gallery e g a 4 and a 7 show higher concentrations of pce although the concentrations are relatively low overall at the pumping wells in general for sampling locations where water ages are lower the pce concentrations are also typically lower to better constrain the relationship between pce apparent age and water origin we used results from a previous bayesian groundwater mixing model developed for the study area popp et al 2019 this approach explicitly considers the possibility of unknown end members referred to as residual end member the bayesian model defined two end members that represent the infiltrated rhine surface water and regional groundwater sampled from observation well j 100 deep sampling screen observation well j 100 is to be found in the southwestern edge of the study area a location where the muschelkalk strata is present moeck et al 2016 in addition groundwater level observations indicate that this well is hardly affected by the artificial infiltration the isotopic composition is indicative of muschelkalk water moeck et al 2016 and therefore can be assumed to be representative for the regional groundwater popp et al 2019 the bayesian model was run with a tracer set which includes 4he analyzed on site to determine mixing ratios in the groundwater fig 9 shows the apparent age versus the fraction of the corresponding end member from the mixing calculations the size of the points represent the pce concentration at the sampling locations if the proportion of infiltrated water is high then both pce concentrations and apparent ages tend to be low in the rhine surface water pce is typically absent and artificial infiltrated water is thus free of such contaminants for pumping wells with a slightly smaller fraction of surface water e g a 17 a 4 and a 7 the apparent age and pce concentrations increase for high and deep wells e g j 101 the fraction of surface water is low and pce concentrations are around 1 0 μg l for these wells it seems that a proportion of the residual end member is contributing to the water chemistry age and pce concentration beyond that we see that observation well c 206 has a high proportion of both muschelkalk and residual groundwater leading to a pce concentration of 0 75 μg l and an age of 36 6 years the presence of a high ratio of a previously unknown water source flexure zone with fractures suggests that faults can play a role as preferential flow paths for the transport of old groundwater contributing to pce contamination the typically unknown fracture network and distribution however makes a tracking of the pce origin extremely challenging e g palau et al 2014 perrin et al 2011 therrien and sudicky 1996 slough et al 1999 however the highest pce concentration was measured at observation well j 89 3 6 μg l having the oldest age 58 years and is located in the direct vicinity to a former landfill 5 discussion using 3h 3he apparent ages provides important information for site characterization and helps to develop conceptual models for groundwater flow and transport processes however the analysis is expensive and time and labor intensive only a few specialized laboratories can carry out such analyses on a routine basis potentially limiting the amount of sampling locations popp et al 2019 in contrast the new developments in field based portable mass spectrometry provide a unique opportunity to measure dissolved gas concentrations such as 4he or other noble gases relatively quickly battle aguilar et al 2017 brennwald et al 2016 2020 due to the quasi real time measurements in the field adaptive and more efficient sampling campaigns can be carried out the two methods laboratory based 3h 3he apparent age estimation and 4he concentrations based on in situ ge mims measurements however differ regarding sampling volume and technique analytical procedure calibration and data processing thus the assumption that both methods yield comparable results is not straightforward however as demonstrated in this study and elsewhere battle aguilar et al 2017 popp et al 2019 a statistical correlation between data sets can be derived demonstrating that the results of the simpler ge mims system are as satisfactory as those of the highly sophisticated lab based method thus the combined use of laboratory and predicted groundwater apparent ages based on the ge mims relationship opens new opportunities in determining groundwater sources and apparent ages this allows increased insight into the flow and transport behavior of contaminants and helps to determine groundwater residence times moreover the ge mims is able to measure various gases and might provide further opportunities to investigate a study site from additional perspectives knapp et al 2019 popp et al 2020 roques et al 2020 tomonaga et al 2019 moreover we can demonstrate that the relationship between 3h 3he apparent ages and 4he concentrations is controlled by radiogenic he which accumulates in the aquifer by radioactive decay of u and th and thus 4he concentration is mainly controlled by the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer at the study site the combined use of measured and predicted apparent ages linked to hydrochemical data water isotopes and pce concentrations were a valuable toolset to identify spatial inter aquifer mixing in the subsurface the results obtained from the age distribution analysis are strongly supported by the information gained from the isotopic and hydrochemical data based on the combined results it can be concluded that in the vicinity of the pumping wells a higher amount of artificially infiltrated surface water is mixed with water originating from the regional flow pathway the mixing signal can also be found in a few specific pumping wells in the western part of the study area which seems to be linked to fault induced aquifer connectivity the flexure zone with its large number of faults represents a separate flow path as indicated by popp et al 2019 moreover it is indicated that close to the infiltration system upwelling of regional groundwater through fractures occurs this upwelling causes mixing between the young artificial infiltrated water and older regional groundwater leading to higher ages in the vicinity of the infiltration system fig 5 this is in line with results obtained from the spatial concentration pattern of the persistent artificial sweetener acesulfame moeck et al 2017b which shows a significant decrease in concentration in the wells compared to the infiltrated water especially in an area close to the infiltration channels in this area upwelling through the fractures might have been localized and a contribution from the limestone aquifer which has smaller concentrations of acesulfame may dilute the groundwater in the upper aquifer moeck et al 2017b this upwelling can occur locally which is demonstrated by popp et al 2019 it was shown that further away from the artificial recharge system e g a 16 the fraction of rhine filtrate is still large and the apparent age is small 1 year for the pumping well a 17 which is in 130 m distance we showed that a comparatively lower fraction of recently infiltrated water exists and that the apparent age increases 2 5 years moreover three dimensional modeling for the study area suggests further that within the well field the central pumping wells e g pumping well a 17 could be extracting more regional groundwater moeck et al 2020 on the other hand moeck et al 2017b showed that with constant pumping rates more artificially infiltrated surface water is extracted which led to a higher dilution of the regional groundwater we postulate that the combined effect of upwelling of regional groundwater and constant pumping explain that the youngest groundwater is in part associated to pumping wells and not to observation wells near the infiltration facilities thus water mixing through the flexure zone and fractures might be of greater importance for water management at the study site than previously assumed wells located at the western edge of the study area i e 21 c 36 21 a 7 21 c 206 21 j 101 shallow and deep show elevated 4he concentrations and higher ages from 4 1 to 36 6 years although wells a 4 and a 33 are identified as outliers in the regression analysis we observed that the northwestern part of the study area is less impacted by the artificial recharge and the fraction of rhine filtrate decreases all wells with a considerable fraction of the residual end member see also fig 9 are being located at the western border of the study area and therefore it might indicate a different hydrogeological flow dynamic here another regression model might be useful but building a linear regression only on a few observations points would not lead to a robust model moreover groundwater age was found to increase with depth e g multilevel well j 101 exhibited an age of 4 1 years and 8 0 years for the upper and lower sampling screens respectively and distance to the artificial infiltration system e g j 98 and j 89 furthermore a large proportion of the infiltration occurs close to the eastern injection point with only about 25 of the injected water reaching the west end of the channels moeck et al 2017a 2020 thus the local groundwater mound in the sand gravel aquifer which serves as a barrier to natural inflow of potentially contaminated water from adjacent areas is spatially imbalanced and more regional groundwater is expected at the western edge of the sample site this can also be observed by considering the pce concentration and groundwater age which is higher at the western edge generally the highest pce concentrations can be found in the south in the vicinity of the landfill observation well j 89 and west e g observation well c 206 where the impact of artificial infiltration is low well c 206 was identified in moeck et al 2016 as an exception based on a multicomponent statistical analysis this sampling location situated in the vicinity of the rhine valley flexure zone differs compared to other wells in terms of high concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl moeck et al 2016 2017a 2017b popp et al 2019 showed that c 206 has an exceptionally low fraction of the surface water end member but simultaneously also has a relatively high fraction of an unknown end member it was speculated that this might be an indication of vertical exchange and upwelling of waters originating from the salt and gypsum layer moeck et al 2016 the wells j 89 located in the south of the study area has the oldest water and highest concentration of pce this well shows a strong impact of regional limestone water these afromentioned two wells j 89 and c 206 are important because they not only have a high pce concentrations and highest apparent ages but they also have a disproportionate impact on the regression for instance if we would drop one of these observations it would affect our model thus it is important to have these values included and if possible to acquire more data with large apparent ages and 4he concentrations this is however difficult for most studies because typically it is not known where these locations are thus a sound initial conceptual process understanding for flow and transport must be developed before sampling in the field is carried out small concentrations of pce can be found at all pumping wells but are slightly higher for wells at the western edge however pumping well a 17 located more centrally in the pumping gallery was found to exhibit different hydrochemistry age and pce concentrations compared to most other wells in the same vicinity this well seems to be hydraulically connected to the underlying aquifer as already indicated in previous studies moeck et al 2016 2017b popp et al 2019 according to popp et al 2019 differences at this well might originate from a higher fraction of regional groundwater 6 and residual most likely fracture end member 6 relative to the surrounding wells the use of chemical tracers temperature groundwater ages this study and numerical modeling provide evidence for cross fault flow moeck et al 2016 2017a 2018a 2020 popp et al 2019 furthermore observation well c 206 has a distinct geochemical signature and age which could not be classed with any other investigated well this is in line with the results from a multicomponent statistical analysis where well c 206 was identified with a distinctly different ca2 co2 pressure relationship compared to all other wells and was therefore treated as an exception moeck et al 2016 based on the bayesian mixing model popp et al 2019 paired with apparent age estimates we can now explain these different characteristics by the presence of a high ratio 36 of a previously unknown water source flexure zone with fractures associated with an older groundwater age 36 6 years and a higher pce concentration this sampling point situated in the vicinity of the rhine valley flexure zone suggests that faults can play a role as preferential flow paths for the transport of old groundwater which is richer in helium and has an elevated pce concentration 6 summary and conclusions in urban areas groundwater management is often challenged by contamination management therefore requires a thorough and robust scientific understanding of flow and transport processes as well as groundwater residence time environmental tracers such as tritium and the decay product helium have been shown to efficiently determine the source of groundwater in order to gain insight into flow and transport processes and to determine groundwater residence times however the analysis is expensive and labor and time intensive therefore potentially limiting the amount of possible sampling locations in contrast new developments in a portable field operated ge mims system provides a unique opportunity to measure dissolved gas concentrations such as 4he relatively quickly and inexpensively due to technical and analytical differences between the two methods laboratory 3h 3he age and field based ge mims 4he analysis yielding comparable results is not straightforward we establish an inter relationship between 3h 3he apparent groundwater age and 4he measured with the ge mims and demonstrate that the results of the simpler ge mims system are as satisfactory as those of the highly sophisticated lab based method thus the combined use of laboratory and predicted groundwater ages based on the ge mims relationship opens up new opportunities in site characterization even though laboratory data are still required to establish this relationship for each study site the applicability of the method is assured when radiogenic helium is accumulated in the aquifer by radioactive decay of u and th within the aquifer matrix therefore the 4he concentration is controlled by the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer the demonstrated analysis reveals valuable insights into the conceptual understanding of groundwater systems the analysis has the potential to provide crucial information regarding the dynamics of groundwater systems residence time mixing flow regime etc and can be useful for a large range of hydrogeological projects aquifer vulnerability contaminated sites groundwater resource assessments sustainability studies geothermal assessments quantification of groundwater mixing calibration verification of numerical models etc additionally the ge mims is able to measure various gases and might provide further opportunities to investigate a study site from further perspectives for our study site we combined the laboratory based and predicted apparent ages with hydrochemical data water isotopes and pce concentrations to identify spatial inter aquifer mixing in the subsurface this approach allowed us to identify the spatial pattern of mixing between recent artificially infiltrated groundwater and water originating from the regional flow path we found a strong correlation between groundwater ages and pce concentrations overall low pce concentrations and young groundwater ages occur when the fraction of artificially infiltrated water is high moreover for some wells fault induced aquifer connectivity is recognized suggesting that the faults play a major role as preferential flow paths for the transport of old groundwater richer in helium and elevated pce concentrations declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support from the canton
