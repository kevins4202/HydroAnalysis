9260,the accessibility to water is a crucial factor for grapevine performance in vineyards a sufficient supply of water favors vegetative growth yield formation and fruit ripening under a changing climate especially steep slope wine growing regions may face severe problems in soil moisture conservation due to oftentimes lower soil water holding capacity and a larger radiation intake on the usually south facing hill slopes which causes a higher evaporative demand compared to vineyards in the flat the impact of two steep slope vineyard management systems on water retention and drought stress response of grapevines was assessed soil water dynamics in the inter vine space of steep slope sites planted downslope control c and of terraces t were compared terraced vineyards were capable to retain up to a 40 higher relative percentage of winter precipitation compared to the control vines in the early years of their adaption phase planted on terraced vineyards generally displayed a higher drought stress response showed lower vigour lower yield and lower sugar yield the older the terrace system the better the performance compared to c became this suggests a high competition of young grapevines to the cover cropped embankments of terraced vineyards therefore means to improve root development and to reduce water and nutrient competition in the early years of terrace construction are crucial for successful grapevine adaptation for the increase of resilience to abiotic stress factors and finally for the maintenance of valuable steep slope vineyard sites for grapevine cultivation keywords soil moisture terraced vineyard water balance water budget abiotic stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevine vitis

subsidies e g the european agricultural fund for rural development eafrd of the european union oftentimes legal rights of an appellation of protected geographical origin or vineyard infrastructure do not allow the irrigation of sites in need i e steep slope vineyards additionally with a shortening of global fresh water resources or the withdrawal of irrigation water from communal bodies e g groundwater wells or surface waters the legitimacy of irrigation of grapes produced for wine making purpose has to be questioned alternatively the usage of winery waste water treatment found to be economical and environmental sustainable canaj et al 2021 but may not be feasible for small wineries especially at steep slope vineyard sites the access to water plays an important role since potential evaporation may be 0 5 0 8 mm day 1 higher during the vegetation period compared to common vineyards in the flat hofmann et al 2014 the water consumption of the grapevine is dynamic throughout the growing season and mainly depends on the grapevine development stage the weather conditions as well as on vineyard geometry parameters hofmann et al 2022 the evaporative demand of the grapevine under cool climate conditions ranges from 350 mm to 500 mm during the vegetation period williams 2014 but varies further depending on planting material training and management decisions medrano et al 2015 picón toro et al 2012 on that account vineyard management alternatives are required to meet the need of sustainable grape production at steep slope sites some actions to conserve precipitation water and to reduce evaporation on vineyard sites are ground cover e g mulch or straw shallow soil cultivation cover crop and the increase of soil organic matter buesa et al 2021 gatti et al 2022 however steep slope viticulture is already labour intensive since mechanization is limited strub et al 2021 concepts of keeping steep slope viticulture economically viable include the formation of terraces strub and müller loose 2021 today a modern kind of vineyard terraces is being constructed via a cut and fill procedure a caterpillar levels the first platform along the contour of the hill and compacts the soil in this process an excavator forms the embankment with the tilting bucket the caterpillar then uses the excavated soil to build the next terrace the embankments are stabilized immediately by sowing a grass mixture afterwards a single row of vines is planted at 0 3 m distance from the edge of the platform historically terraces were built for agricultural purpose inter alia to reduce physical strains and increase water retention tarolli et al 2014 yet evaporation of the terrace embankments account for about one third of the water loss of the terrace lü et al 2009 resulting from a high sun exposed surface which further requires cover crop for stabilization especially young vines prior to full adaptation may suffer from the competition to cover crops therefore the benefits of vineyard terracing on soil moisture conservation and availability have to be tested thus the aim of this study was to investigate soil moisture dynamics in two steep slope vineyard systems i e terraced and downslope planted vineyards to evaluate the effect of vineyard transformation and its impact on grapevine drought stress response 2 materials and methods data sampling was conducted in the rheingau wine growing region germany four vineyard pairs each consisting of a vineyard according to the standard cultivation method of vines planted in downslope control c and a terraced vineyard system t were selected fig 1 fig 2 an overview of the vineyard characteristics including the v vinifera l cultivars is presented in table 1 the experimental sites comprised vineyards of commercial wineries which maintained their own vineyard management schemes however applied means were in accordance to the code of good agricultural practice differences in management are partly owed to the cultivation system itself all data acquired derived from subplots of the respective vineyards to ensure the temporal feasibility of measurements and to reduce measurement errors by spatial inhomogeneity the main period of data collection was from spring 2019 to winter 2020 additional vintages 2018 and 2021 were used to complement the data set 2 1 weather conditions during the experimental period the annual temperatures of 2018 2020 were extraordinary in comparison to the long term average of 1981 2010 lta table s1 data was recorded by a weather station located at and maintained by hochschule geisenheim university the year 2018 was considered one of the hottest years with an annual temperature of 12 3 c lta 10 5 c and a vegetation period temperature of 17 8 c lta of 15 2 c with 1741 sunshine hours lta of 1300 sunshine hours in 2019 growing season started with hot and dry weather conditions the mean temperature of the vegetation period from april to october was 2 6 c higher compared to the lta each month showed higher mean temperatures compared to the lta except the month of may both in 2019 and 2020 for 2019 and 2020 there was an annual temperature increase of 1 3 c and 1 7 c respectively temperatures in june and july were higher in 2019 compared to 2020 2 7 c and 0 9 c respectively but spring and autumn months showed higher average temperatures in 2020 april 1 6 c may 1 4 c september 1 4 c little amount of rain fell since july 2018 rainfall deficit of 13 5 sunshine hour surplus of 28 in 2019 rainfall was 13 3 less compared to the lta and had an increase of 19 in sunshine hours when compared to the lta precipitation was 23 less in 2020 while the number of sunshine hours increased by 21 fig s1 table s1 on the contrary 2021 was different compared to the previous years winter months and autumn showed a slight temperature increase of 0 6 c and 0 2 c compared to the lta of 1991 2020 1 2 c and 0 5 c compared to the three decade average of 1981 2010 respectively whereas the temperature during spring 2021 was 2 c lower compared to the lta of 1991 2020 the summer temperature of 2021 showed a slight increase of 0 5 c when compared to the lta of 1981 2010 precipitation was 36 3 mm lower in 2021 compared to the lta of 1981 2020 rainfall was highest in the winter and summer of 2021 sunshine hours were increased in 2021 by 4 4 and 7 8 compared to the lta of 1981 2010 fig s1 table s1 additional information about the weather conditions in the lower rheingau valley are provided in the supplementary material table s1 fig s1 additional details about the microclimatic characteristics of the experimental sites are provided in strack et al 2021 for the research conducted under practical conditions selection criteria were i that on all sites the two treatments were in the next possible proximity to each other to grant similar environmental conditions and ii that the treatments consisted of similar planting material i e variety and rootstock to allow comparability in regard to physiological parameters a difference in the vineyard age or the soil characteristics e g field capacity was accepted due to the research aim of the evaluation of grapevine performance by a change in the management systems due to terracing planting density changes dramatically since additionally to the alley width the width of the embankment as well as the turning plates and cross paths have to be considered in regards to vineyard area loss table 1 2 2 soil water monitoring to monitor the consumption and the replenishment of soil water in the two management systems volumetric soil moisture content was measured by a capacitance measurement technique diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd stepney sa australia in april 2019 at each site and treatment three access tubes were installed in the inter vine space of two vines at the upper the middle and the lower slope part of the vineyard fig 2 for this purpose a metal pipe was driven into the soil to avoid heavy soil disturbance access tubes were inserted and the removed soil core from the metal pipe was mixed with water and added around the access tube as filling material to ensure proper contact between tubes and soil at terraces access tubes were installed orthogonal to the soil surface approximately 0 3 m distanced from the edge of the platform in the inter vine space at downslope planted vineyards tubes were installed vertically i e not perpendicular to the hill slope soil moisture measurements were conducted weekly during vegetation period april to october and biweekly post harvest during dormancy november to march from april 2019 to november 2021 data was assessed to a depth of 1 m in 0 1 m measuring intervals data of weather stations in the next possible proximity to the experimental sites was obtained from the hochschule geisenheim university weather station network sensor type 3032 for air temperature recording rain gauge type 7052 for precipitation measurement and the combilog 1022 for data logging theodor friedrichs schenefeld germany at the sites lorch 50 0328 n 7 8229 e rüdesheim 49 9816 n 7 9142 e and geisenheim 49 9840 n 7 9544 e to properly compare changes in soil moisture without an effect of differing soil properties the relative temporal change in soil water from one measurement day to the following was calculated for every single access tube the mean of the three measurement points per treatment and site of the consecutive measurement date was divided by the mean of the three measurement points per treatment and site of the previous one respectively subsequently the calculated values of the terraced vineyards were subtracted from the respective control i e controldate1 controldate0 terraceddate1 terraceddate0 additionally the water consumption of the two steep slope vineyard systems was evaluated the absolute change in soil water was calculated by subtracting the mean absolute value measured at the three access tubes previous to a dry period from the mean absolute value measured at the three access tubes after a dry period from 19 03 2020 29 04 2020 before grapevine was capable of transpiration and from 20 05 2020 03 06 2020 when differences in vineyard water consumption competing to cover crops were assumed to be high between the treatments 2 3 plant stress indicators to evaluate plant stress carbon isotope discrimination was conducted on grape berry juice from vintages of 2018 2021 in 2019 and 2020 pre dawn leaf water potential was measured post anthesis spontaneously at days of the year doy when grapevines were assumed to be affected by drought i e after a period of dry conditions to ensure highest possible stress response of the grapevine 2 3 1 pre dawn leaf water potential measurements ψpd on each of the three measurement dates during a vegetation period pre dawn leaf water potential was assessed on eight leaves per site and treatment using a pressure chamber soilmoisture corp santa barbara ca usa according to the technique described by scholander et al 1965 sound non senescent leaves were wrapped in a plastic bag detached from the shoot via a single cut and measured directly by slowly increasing chamber pressure until the endpoint when xylem sap became visible on the cut surface turner 1988 measurements were conducted pre dawn ѱpd in close proximity to the soil moisture monitoring tubes 2 3 2 berry sugar carbon isotope discrimination δ13c juice samples derived from a sample of one hundred to two hundred ripe berries randomly picked at harvest date from each side of the grapevine canopy within the whole subplots respectively berries were pressed twice at 0 6 mpa for approximately two minutes longarone 85 eis system gmbh norderstedt germany interrupted by a manual crumbling the obtained juice was centrifuged for five minutes at 7830 rpm and 20 c eppendorf 5430 r hamburg germany and filtered coarsely 16 μ munktell 33 n 90 g m 2 folded filter ahlstrom helsinki finland no further juice preparation was conducted as suggested by gaudillère et al 2002 two aliquots of 12 µl juice sample were pipetted in a 5 9 mm tin capsule iva analysetechnik gmbh co kg meerbusch germany and oven dried for 24 h at 60 c the capsule was folded pressed tightly and encased in a second tin capsule which was also folded and pressed after combustion at 920 c carbon isotopes were measured with the vario pyro cube analyser elementar langenselbold germany coupled to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer elementar uk stockport uk the results are expressed in vpdb standard farquhar et al 1989 with reference values based on iaea ch3 sucrose coplen et al 2006 2 4 vegetative and generative response parameters grapevine vegetative and generative performance is a viable indicator of plant s drought stress gambetta et al 2020 pellegrino et al 2005 all grapevines selected for recordings of crop and growth parameters were chosen by their appearance i e healthy in regard to fungal diseases and for the experimental site representative regarding their vigour 2 4 1 grapevine lateral leaf area estimation in 2019 and 2020 leaf area of lateral shoots was estimated according to the non destructive method of lopes and pinto 2005 six vines per vineyard were labelled in 2019 and used for repeated measurements in close proximity to the soil moisture monitoring tubes on each vine one representative shoot i e healthy fruit baring and average sized was selected visually the leaf area per shoot was estimated considering the leaf area of the largest leaf i e the sum of the two lateral veins of the largest leaf and the calculated mean lateral leaf area i e the average leaf area of the largest and the leaf area of the smallest leaf multiplied by the number of leaves of the shoot in this regard a tape measure was used to obtain the lengths of the leaf veins 2 4 2 pruning wood pruning wood fresh weights were assessed during dormancy in the winters from 2018 to 2020 a total of thirty vines per site and treatment were labelled in 2018 and used for repeated measurements the fresh weight of the pruning wood was assessed by weighing the pruned cane and annual shoots 2 4 3 yield and sugar yield yield per vine was calculated by counting and weighing the grape bunches of the six vines per site and treatment labelled for leaf area estimation to assess further grapevine performance sugar yield was calculated by multiplying the berry juice sugar content g l 1 measured by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir via a ft2 winescan spectrometer foss hillerød denmark using an in house grape must calibration with the juice yield per vine l the calculation was based on a theoretical juice yield of 75 after pressing 2 4 4 statistical analyses the data was processed and visualised within the rstudio environment v1 4 1717 using the stats and tidyverse packages the plant stress indicators ψpd and δ13c and vegetative response parameters leaf area estimation and pruning fresh weights were evaluated by the non parametric mann whitney u test to assess statistical differences between the two treatments at each site 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics in different steep slope management systems 3 1 1 temporal development of soil moisture changes in fig 3 the differences in the percentage change of soil water content swc to a depth of 1 m between treatments of every two consecutive measurement days are displayed the highest differences in the percentage change between the two treatments could be observed in late winter early spring close to the beginning of the vegetation period at the beginning of march 2020 and the mid of february 2021 a 30 40 higher water storage could be observed in the terraced treatments compared to the control at the two experimental sites le and ls fig 3c d all other measuring dates during winter showed only a small difference in percentage change i e 5 between the two treatments at site gm there was only one date which showed a difference in percentage change between the treatments higher than 10 at the end of the winter at the beginning of february 2021 after 25 mm rain fell the terraced treatment at site gm had a higher increase in percentage change of soil water content from one measurement day to the next compared to the control fig 3a at site rb there was only one late winter date in 2020 when the terraced treatment showed a higher increase in percentage change of soil water content compared to the control the effects of the irrigation at site rb in the two years of 2019 and 2020 are clearly visible in fig 3b dates of irrigation are displayed by down pointing arrows irrigation led to high differences in percentage change of soil water content i e a higher percentage increase for the treatment which was artificially watered and a decrease in percentage change in the other treatment led to amplitudes up to 40 difference fig 3b table s2 during dry periods predominantly in summer when soil water content was generally low only small differences in percentage change between the treatments were visible after precipitation events water retention was higher in the terraced treatments the water depletion was similar between the treatments in the days post precipitation suggesting an actual accumulation of precipitation water in the soil of the terraced treatment fig 3 3 1 2 soil moisture depletion under dry conditions exemplarily the percentage change in consumption of soil water content swc in a 10 cm interval up to 1 m soil depth during dry periods of mid march to end of april 41 days and mid of may to beginning of june 14 days at the four experimental sites gm rb le and ls is displayed in fig 4a and b during the early spring mid march to the end april of 2020 the differences in soil water dynamics summed for a depth of 1 m were considerably higher compared to the later development stage of the grapevine fig 4 the dynamic of soil water changes per measurement interval varied between the experimental sites at site gm and ls the terraced treatments showed notably higher percentage changes in soil water content for each measurement interval compared to control resulting from a high variability the treatments at site rb did not differ from each other at the site le the change in soil moisture observed between 50 cm and 70 cm suggests a low water holding capacity at this range since the percentage changes of c became less than 10 likewise the terraced treatment at site le showed low water retention capacity in depth lower 80 cm at the end of may 2020 when vines approximately reached the onset of flowering differences in soil water loss became remarkably lower compared to the former measurement period in general single measurement intervals showed low percentage changes approximately 10 for the soil layers lower than the first 20 cm fig 4 3 2 plant stress indicators 3 2 1 pre dawn leaf water potential drought stress identified by pre dawn leaf water potential measures increased during the summer of 2019 and 2020 fig 5 in general control treatments showed a tendency to less negative values where treatments were statistically different vines of the control indicated less drought stress at site gm no significant differences in pre dawn leaf water potential could be detected between the treatments during the entire time of the experiment especially at site rb both treatments showed low pre dawn leaf water potential values despite of various irrigation treatments in 2019 irrigation was applied rather late table s2 so that the vines faced a severe water deficit 0 6 mpa in the terraced treatment close after flowering doy 180 even though irrigation was applied during july both treatments at site rb suffered from severe water deficits but showed no statistical differences until mid of august 2019 doy 229 in 2020 irrigation means were applied at site rb after cap fall was completed the amount of the supplied water per vine provided at the single irrigation dates was rather low c 2 86 l vine 1 to 7 14 l vine 1 and t 3 32 l vine 1 to 6 63 l vine 1 table s2 thus it was not possible to prevent vines from high drought stress levels at the sites le and ls vines planted on terraced vineyards suffered from higher water deficits compared to c except at doy 187 in 2019 where at site ls the control showed lower ψpd values at site ls differences between treatments were not as clear as at site le 3 2 2 carbon isotope discrimination δ13c vines planted on terraces generally showed a higher risk of drought stress during berry maturation compared to the control vines table 2 an exceptional case was found for the site gm during all four years where downslope planted vines control displayed a higher i e more positive carbon isotope ratio in the sugars of mature berries compared to terraced vines no statistical differences were found between treatments at site ls in 2020 due to high variance in data and at site rb in 2018 and in 2020 probably due to the irrigation management of both treatments table s2 3 3 vegetative and generative plant response parameters 3 3 1 grapevine lateral leaf area estimation except the treatments of site rb which were both irrigated in 2020 table s2 terraced vineyards usually showed lower vigour at the onset of ripening véraison and at the development stage of harvest ripe berries fig 6 no statistical differences were found between the treatments at site gm at véraison in both years and at site rb at véraison and harvest in 2020 in 2019 no significant differences were detected between treatments at site ls table s3 in general the number of field replicates was rather low which reduces the significance of the results but the data showed that secondary leaf area tended to be higher in downslope planted vines of all the non irrigated vineyards tested fig 6 3 3 2 pruning wood the fresh weights of winter pruning mass were always significantly different between treatments except in 2018 at site gm where only a trend was visible table 3 each year tested pruning weights per hectare in downsloped vineyards were higher compared to terraced vineyards 3 3 3 yield and sugar yield grapevines of terraced vineyards showed continuously lower yields and sugar yields per vine and hectare compared to control vineyards table 4 only in 2019 at site gm the t treatment had 8 higher grape yield and a 13 higher sugar yield per vine compared to control in 2019 at site ls yield and sugar yield per vine were equal between the treatments table 4 but in the consecutive years terraced vineyards showed approximately 20 33 lower yield per vine at site le the yield per vine of t was about a half to two third lower compared to control vines in 2019 the terraced vineyard of site rb suffered from an intense drought stress at anthesis this led to a reduction of yield per vine of 92 compared to control but also in the following years c showed about twice as much grape yield per vine compared to t 4 discussion the relevance of this work has to be linked to the current but also to the changing growing conditions grapevines will experience in the near future as well as to the special role of viticulture practices at steep slope sites global climate projections show that different regions will experience various changes in the amount of annual precipitation the rainfall distribution and evapotranspiration ipcc 2021 in cool 13 15 c to intermediate 15 17 c wine growing regions hall and jones 2009 like the rheingau wine growing region germany annual mean precipitation patterns but also evapotranspiration are predicted to increase ipcc 2021 schultz and hofmann 2015 especially the latter with a continuous rise in vegetation period temperatures schultz and hofmann 2015 prognosticated that the gap between the amount of precipitation and potential evaporation during the vegetation period is going to increase in future schultz 2017 further highlighted that the risk of developing a water deficit in cool climate wine growing regions like the rheingau is driven by the increase in evapotranspiration rather than by a decrease in precipitation using a high resolution site specific assessment of drought stress risk hofmann et al 2022 showed that drought stress varies substantially between vineyard sites and will increase further in steep slope regions in future compared to rain fed vineyards in the flat this will be further enhanced since the incoming solar radiation is higher on steep hill sites and considerably increases the evapotranspiration on often stony and shallow soils comprising a low water holding capacity hofmann et al 2014 additionally steep slope vineyards are prone to soil and nutrient loss through erosion pijl et al 2020 which increases with slope gradient and length of the hillside emde 1992 rodrigo comino 2018 a recent work by pijl et al 2022 highlighted the benefits of modern terraces regarding the conservation of soil water and the reduction of soil erosion and sediment fluxes in the years of 2018 2020 annual rainfall was lower in the rheingau wine growing region compared to the long term average of 1981 2010 13 13 and 23 respectively table s1 and the experimental sites experienced a dry period over three years in 2021 the annual precipitation was a little higher compared to the previous years but was still dryer than the long term average 4 compared to the long term average 1991 2020 and 7 compared to the long term average 1981 2010 table s1 while the actual grapevine transpiration may vary considerably the potential evapotranspiration of flat vineyards in geisenheim rheingau germany is approximately 500 mm during the vegetation period hoppmann et al 2017 or 800 mm per year increasing with slope hofmann et al 2014 those values exceed the annual amount of precipitation clearly table s1 but this does not necessarily result in grapevine drought stress since transpiration shows plasticity and the water use efficiency of grapevines under drought may improve during the season due to stomatal regulation induced by aba signalling and the incorporation of osmotically active solutes which interacts with the stomatal apparatus gambetta et al 2020 herrera et al 2022 due to priming zamorano et al 2021 or due to long term adaption by assumed epigenetically changes pagay et al 2022 the impact of drought stress on grapevine depends on the severity and the timing of the event the evapotranspirative demand of the atmosphere affects the vine and intensifies concomitantly to the development of foliage furthermore different growth stages are diversely susceptible in general low water availability affects cell division and cell expansion independent of the organ tissue while drought stress is able to inhibit vegetative growth from the time of when leaves are capable to perform photosynthesis throughout the whole vegetation period the generative development is highly vulnerable from pre bloom to fruit set since pollen fertility is particularly sensitive to drought keller 2020 a poor anthesis results in lower yields due to shoots with less fruitful clusters meaning a reduced berry number which can further be reduced in size drought during bloom may also affect yield in the consecutive vintage keller 2020 the rheingau is one of the german wine growing regions which is at highest risk of future potential yield losses due to pre véraison water shortage yang et al 2022 in 2019 at site rb yield loss in the terraced treatment was severe due to a pre anthesis drought event inflorescences were shed which led to a 90 reduction of yield in the terraced vineyard compared to the control treatment table 4 with minor exceptions e g site gm in 2019 terraced vineyards yielded a lower fruit mass per vine during the years table 4 under drought conditions berry growth may be supported by storage reserves from perennial sources woody grapevine parts and roots which may be at the expense of lower frost hardiness and a reduction in shoot development in the next year junquera et al 2012 the pruning weight data displayed in table 3 suggests a lower carbohydrate storage in the woody parts of vines planted on terraces either by an allocation of reserves to support fruit ripening or a general reduction of photosynthetic performance i e carbon assimilation due to stomatal closure as a reaction of drought experience this is supported by the δ13c analyses which showed a higher drought stress response in terms of an altered carbon assimilation in terraced vineyards compared to control during the whole period of fruit development except at site gm table 2 in general the grapevine adaptation to local conditions and the achievement of full economic performance i e yield stability and vine balance is delayed and usually lower at steep slopes comprising shallow and stony soils compared to flat rain fed vineyards certainly at site le and ls years of planting were different between the treatments terraced vineyards were planted 5 and 7 years later compared the control table 1 which may affect results due to possibly less developed or adapted root system in t over time zhang et al 2018 however at site rb vines were planted in the same year and at site gm the three year difference between treatments would not influence the established vines in their physiological behavior since young vines planted in a flat vineyard showed similar yield and pruning weights compared to fully adapted vines in the fifth year after planting bou nader et al 2019 in the present study the vines of the oldest vineyard terrace site gm showed either less stress response table 2 or did not distinguish from control in their pre dawn leaf water potential measurements fig 5 the fifty year old grapevines might have been able to root in deeper soil layers or to exploit higher soil moisture from the platform centre in addition differences between treatments might have also been reduced due to a high water holding capacity of the soils on that site table 1 studies on the impact of grapevine age on the tolerance to water deficit showed that due to a shallower root system young vines were more vulnerable to soil drying conditions compared to older and more adapted vines bou nader et al 2019 grigg et al 2018 furthermore in our study soil moisture dynamics were recorded at the platform edge of the terrace but literature cited in michalsky 1976 indicates that root growth was higher in length on terraces compared to vines planted downslope and that roots of vines planted on terraces tended to grow towards the centre of the platform where a higher soil water content would exists michalsky 1976 hence once the vines start to adapt irrigation water should be applied on the foot of the embankments through subsurface drip lines forcing the roots to grow towards the hill side modern driveable vineyard terraces have to be constructed and maintained properly poorly managed and insufficient stabilized embankments i e by the renunciation of vegetation cover or dry stones may lead to collapses of the terrace and an increase in soil erosion pijl et al 2020 rodrigo comino et al 2019 the positive contribution of weeds and other crops covering bare embankment soil of vineyard terraces are ecosystem services like the prevention of erosion the providing of food and shelter for beneficial insects or the improvement of soil physical and chemical characteristics however while young vines planted on terraces may be competing strongly with embankment vegetation used for soil stability fully adapted grapevines may benefit from higher water availability in the middle of the terrace platform depending on the water consumption of the surrounding vegetation row orientation affects the radiation energy partitioning of the grapevine and the vineyard soil zorer et al 2017 thus influencing the water balance of the vineyard kool et al 2021 depending on intercropping the evapotranspiration of the soil may be little 0 5 mm d 1 to almost as high as the grapevine transpiration 3 mm d 1 itself celette et al 2010 cover cropped embankments in e w but also in nw se aligned terraces are irradiated almost the whole day whereas the tractor alley may be shaded by the grapevine canopy to evaluate the soil water budget in terraced vineyards an already existing model for radiation partitioning and water balance for steep slope vineyards would have to be adapted for the vineyard system planted along the contour line of the hill hofmann et al 2014 lopes et al 2015 quantified the water use of several weeds and cover crops in a rain fed steep slope vineyard in the rheingau wine growing region and showed that depending on their dispersion transpiration values per square meter soil cover per day were on average 2 7 to five times higher compared to grapevine the difference in vineyard soil plant cover between the control and the terraced treatments was highest during the early part of the vegetation period mid of may when mulching is conducted in control vineyards to reduce the risk of late frost damage but embankment vegetation is maintained however only small difference in the percentage change of soil water content could be found between the treatments at all experimental sites close after the period of late frost risk fig 4b the small differences may be due to a rather dry and sunny spring table s1 soils with a fewer amount of soil water content also showed smaller percentage changes in soil water content earlier in the season the management systems displayed considerable differences in soil water loss rates from mid march to the end of april fig 4a which may also lead to a delay in shoot growth in the terraced treatment strack et al 2021 even though vineyard terraces are able to conserve water during precipitation events due to an increased water infiltration fig 3 and a reduction of run off arnáez et al 2015 pijl et al 2022 they show a large potential evaporation resulting from a larger surface exposed to solar irradiation and wind compared to down sloped vineyards lü et al 2009 the solar energy intake of the two systems may be the same during the day but terraced vineyards showed lower daytime temperatures compared to down slope planted vineyards which may indicate a cooling effect of a higher transpiration activity of embankment weeds and cover crop strack et al 2021 additionally a lower planting density resulting from a bigger distance between vineyard rows in the terrace system may increase the wind flux which further increases water consumption by accompanying vineyard plants heilman et al 1994 projections of the near future show that under a dryer climate low density vineyards in the plane i e 2 500 vines ha 1 instead of 5 000 vines ha 1 may benefit from a higher amount of free transpirable soil water ftsw van leeuwen et al 2019 however under less favorable soil conditions ftsw 100 mm as it can be often found at steep slope sites see also table 1 a lower planting density barely improved ftsw van leeuwen et al 2019 the differences in drought stress response were mainly pronounced during fruit development before the beginning of ripening fig 5 after véraison berry development is less sensitive to drought stress and may profit from a reduced vegetative growth due to better solar irradiation and a lower risks of noble rot infection smart and robinson 1991 the small changes in weekly water content measurements post véraison fig 3 implied a low plasticity of water supply from soils with low water holding capacity during summer in years of reduced precipitation on the one hand grapevine water consumption is closely linked to its leaf area more precisely the transpiration surface of the plant ohana levi et al 2020 on the other hand secondary leaf area is strongly affected by water deficit lebon et al 2001 pellegrino et al 2005 grapevine vegetative performance of the terraced vineyards was lower at harvest time at all sites fig 6 table 4 a clear tendency was shown that control vineyards display higher vigour compared to terraced treatments fig 6 table 3 in 2020 when both types of grapevine management i e vines planted on terraces or downslope at site rb were irrigated regularly table s2 treatments showed no statistical differences in lateral leaf area but a slight tendency of higher lateral leaf area in t compared to c fig 6 this suggests that a vine planted on the edge of a terrace platform is able to outperform disadvantages related to water availability if supported by means of irrigation however since the irrigation of luxury goods like wine bears the high risk of social injustice alternatives to an improved water supply or availability have to be found possible solutions may be the relocation of the drip lines to the foot of the embankment or the incorporation of an optimized drainage system during the vineyard transformation process to slowly supply excessive precipitation water from the pathways or turning plates of the terrace to the vineyard soil pijl et al 2020 tarolli et al 2015 special attention should be payed to viticultural management decisions and breeding the selection of a suitable rootstock showing better root architecture and being less vulnerable to drought stress and the scion ollat et al 2017 the trellising as well as the controlling of vine balance ratio of vegetative to generative growth has to be considered further measures are the increase of soil organic matter to improve water storage capacity ground cover management to reduce evapotranspiration a shallow soil cultivation to increase water availability during droughts or the application of soil amendments i e biochar schmidt et al 2021 and or the inoculation of beneficial root symbionts i e rhizosphere engineering dries et al 2021 to improve water storage and water uptake by grapevine roots in conclusion the collected data related to drought stress parameters highlighted a better overall performance of control vines compared to the terraced treatment however the fifty year old vineyards at site gm showed less drought stress during the seasons fig 5 this is of particular importance since the years were the study was performed will most likely become common scenarios in the near future under changing climate conditions all other terraces in this study were constructed and planted not later than ten years ago thus it may be inferred that young vines need longer to adapt to the specific conditions of a high competitive environment like the terraced situation of a larger exposed soil surface area nevertheless the transformation of steep hill sites to terraces may allow the retention of winter precipitation water and the reduction of soil and nutrient loss induced by rainfall events additionally terrace embankments have the potential to diversify the monocultural vineyard landscape and to cross link biotopes if an adequate cover cropping i e regionally adapted flower seed mixture is used for biological stabilization wersebeckmann et al 2022 a fast adaptation of grapevines to the vineyard site is desired by viticulturists for reasons of lowering costs of grapevine nursing and increasing yield in this context site specific solutions have to be developed on how to improve the adaptation and resilience of young vines on terraced vineyard sites the aim is to support a fast development of grapevine roots to overcome competition with highly drought adapted spontaneous or for stabilization reasons inevitable co vegetation to further allow successful grapevine cultivation at drought risk

9260,the accessibility to water is a crucial factor for grapevine performance in vineyards a sufficient supply of water favors vegetative growth yield formation and fruit ripening under a changing climate especially steep slope wine growing regions may face severe problems in soil moisture conservation due to oftentimes lower soil water holding capacity and a larger radiation intake on the usually south facing hill slopes which causes a higher evaporative demand compared to vineyards in the flat the impact of two steep slope vineyard management systems on water retention and drought stress response of grapevines was assessed soil water dynamics in the inter vine space of steep slope sites planted downslope control c and of terraces t were compared terraced vineyards were capable to retain up to a 40 higher relative percentage of winter precipitation compared to the control vines in the early years of their adaption phase planted on terraced vineyards generally displayed a higher drought stress response showed lower vigour lower yield and lower sugar yield the older the terrace system the better the performance compared to c became this suggests a high competition of young grapevines to the cover cropped embankments of terraced vineyards therefore means to improve root development and to reduce water and nutrient competition in the early years of terrace construction are crucial for successful grapevine adaptation for the increase of resilience to abiotic stress factors and finally for the maintenance of valuable steep slope vineyard sites for grapevine cultivation keywords soil moisture terraced vineyard water balance water budget abiotic stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevine vitis

groundwater wells or surface waters the legitimacy of irrigation of grapes produced for wine making purpose has to be questioned alternatively the usage of winery waste water treatment found to be economical and environmental sustainable canaj et al 2021 but may not be feasible for small wineries especially at steep slope vineyard sites the access to water plays an important role since potential evaporation may be 0 5 0 8 mm day 1 higher during the vegetation period compared to common vineyards in the flat hofmann et al 2014 the water consumption of the grapevine is dynamic throughout the growing season and mainly depends on the grapevine development stage the weather conditions as well as on vineyard geometry parameters hofmann et al 2022 the evaporative demand of the grapevine under cool climate conditions ranges from 350 mm to 500 mm during the vegetation period williams 2014 but varies further depending on planting material training and management decisions medrano et al 2015 picón toro et al 2012 on that account vineyard management alternatives are required to meet the need of sustainable grape production at steep slope sites some actions to conserve precipitation water and to reduce evaporation on vineyard sites are ground cover e g mulch or straw shallow soil cultivation cover crop and the increase of soil organic matter buesa et al 2021 gatti et al 2022 however steep slope viticulture is already labour intensive since mechanization is limited strub et al 2021 concepts of keeping steep slope viticulture economically viable include the formation of terraces strub and müller loose 2021 today a modern kind of vineyard terraces is being constructed via a cut and fill procedure a caterpillar levels the first platform along the contour of the hill and compacts the soil in this process an excavator forms the embankment with the tilting bucket the caterpillar then uses the excavated soil to build the next terrace the embankments are stabilized immediately by sowing a grass mixture afterwards a single row of vines is planted at 0 3 m distance from the edge of the platform historically terraces were built for agricultural purpose inter alia to reduce physical strains and increase water retention tarolli et al 2014 yet evaporation of the terrace embankments account for about one third of the water loss of the terrace lü et al 2009 resulting from a high sun exposed surface which further requires cover crop for stabilization especially young vines prior to full adaptation may suffer from the competition to cover crops therefore the benefits of vineyard terracing on soil moisture conservation and availability have to be tested thus the aim of this study was to investigate soil moisture dynamics in two steep slope vineyard systems i e terraced and downslope planted vineyards to evaluate the effect of vineyard transformation and its impact on grapevine drought stress response 2 materials and methods data sampling was conducted in the rheingau wine growing region germany four vineyard pairs each consisting of a vineyard according to the standard cultivation method of vines planted in downslope control c and a terraced vineyard system t were selected fig 1 fig 2 an overview of the vineyard characteristics including the v vinifera l cultivars is presented in table 1 the experimental sites comprised vineyards of commercial wineries which maintained their own vineyard management schemes however applied means were in accordance to the code of good agricultural practice differences in management are partly owed to the cultivation system itself all data acquired derived from subplots of the respective vineyards to ensure the temporal feasibility of measurements and to reduce measurement errors by spatial inhomogeneity the main period of data collection was from spring 2019 to winter 2020 additional vintages 2018 and 2021 were used to complement the data set 2 1 weather conditions during the experimental period the annual temperatures of 2018 2020 were extraordinary in comparison to the long term average of 1981 2010 lta table s1 data was recorded by a weather station located at and maintained by hochschule geisenheim university the year 2018 was considered one of the hottest years with an annual temperature of 12 3 c lta 10 5 c and a vegetation period temperature of 17 8 c lta of 15 2 c with 1741 sunshine hours lta of 1300 sunshine hours in 2019 growing season started with hot and dry weather conditions the mean temperature of the vegetation period from april to october was 2 6 c higher compared to the lta each month showed higher mean temperatures compared to the lta except the month of may both in 2019 and 2020 for 2019 and 2020 there was an annual temperature increase of 1 3 c and 1 7 c respectively temperatures in june and july were higher in 2019 compared to 2020 2 7 c and 0 9 c respectively but spring and autumn months showed higher average temperatures in 2020 april 1 6 c may 1 4 c september 1 4 c little amount of rain fell since july 2018 rainfall deficit of 13 5 sunshine hour surplus of 28 in 2019 rainfall was 13 3 less compared to the lta and had an increase of 19 in sunshine hours when compared to the lta precipitation was 23 less in 2020 while the number of sunshine hours increased by 21 fig s1 table s1 on the contrary 2021 was different compared to the previous years winter months and autumn showed a slight temperature increase of 0 6 c and 0 2 c compared to the lta of 1991 2020 1 2 c and 0 5 c compared to the three decade average of 1981 2010 respectively whereas the temperature during spring 2021 was 2 c lower compared to the lta of 1991 2020 the summer temperature of 2021 showed a slight increase of 0 5 c when compared to the lta of 1981 2010 precipitation was 36 3 mm lower in 2021 compared to the lta of 1981 2020 rainfall was highest in the winter and summer of 2021 sunshine hours were increased in 2021 by 4 4 and 7 8 compared to the lta of 1981 2010 fig s1 table s1 additional information about the weather conditions in the lower rheingau valley are provided in the supplementary material table s1 fig s1 additional details about the microclimatic characteristics of the experimental sites are provided in strack et al 2021 for the research conducted under practical conditions selection criteria were i that on all sites the two treatments were in the next possible proximity to each other to grant similar environmental conditions and ii that the treatments consisted of similar planting material i e variety and rootstock to allow comparability in regard to physiological parameters a difference in the vineyard age or the soil characteristics e g field capacity was accepted due to the research aim of the evaluation of grapevine performance by a change in the management systems due to terracing planting density changes dramatically since additionally to the alley width the width of the embankment as well as the turning plates and cross paths have to be considered in regards to vineyard area loss table 1 2 2 soil water monitoring to monitor the consumption and the replenishment of soil water in the two management systems volumetric soil moisture content was measured by a capacitance measurement technique diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd stepney sa australia in april 2019 at each site and treatment three access tubes were installed in the inter vine space of two vines at the upper the middle and the lower slope part of the vineyard fig 2 for this purpose a metal pipe was driven into the soil to avoid heavy soil disturbance access tubes were inserted and the removed soil core from the metal pipe was mixed with water and added around the access tube as filling material to ensure proper contact between tubes and soil at terraces access tubes were installed orthogonal to the soil surface approximately 0 3 m distanced from the edge of the platform in the inter vine space at downslope planted vineyards tubes were installed vertically i e not perpendicular to the hill slope soil moisture measurements were conducted weekly during vegetation period april to october and biweekly post harvest during dormancy november to march from april 2019 to november 2021 data was assessed to a depth of 1 m in 0 1 m measuring intervals data of weather stations in the next possible proximity to the experimental sites was obtained from the hochschule geisenheim university weather station network sensor type 3032 for air temperature recording rain gauge type 7052 for precipitation measurement and the combilog 1022 for data logging theodor friedrichs schenefeld germany at the sites lorch 50 0328 n 7 8229 e rüdesheim 49 9816 n 7 9142 e and geisenheim 49 9840 n 7 9544 e to properly compare changes in soil moisture without an effect of differing soil properties the relative temporal change in soil water from one measurement day to the following was calculated for every single access tube the mean of the three measurement points per treatment and site of the consecutive measurement date was divided by the mean of the three measurement points per treatment and site of the previous one respectively subsequently the calculated values of the terraced vineyards were subtracted from the respective control i e controldate1 controldate0 terraceddate1 terraceddate0 additionally the water consumption of the two steep slope vineyard systems was evaluated the absolute change in soil water was calculated by subtracting the mean absolute value measured at the three access tubes previous to a dry period from the mean absolute value measured at the three access tubes after a dry period from 19 03 2020 29 04 2020 before grapevine was capable of transpiration and from 20 05 2020 03 06 2020 when differences in vineyard water consumption competing to cover crops were assumed to be high between the treatments 2 3 plant stress indicators to evaluate plant stress carbon isotope discrimination was conducted on grape berry juice from vintages of 2018 2021 in 2019 and 2020 pre dawn leaf water potential was measured post anthesis spontaneously at days of the year doy when grapevines were assumed to be affected by drought i e after a period of dry conditions to ensure highest possible stress response of the grapevine 2 3 1 pre dawn leaf water potential measurements ψpd on each of the three measurement dates during a vegetation period pre dawn leaf water potential was assessed on eight leaves per site and treatment using a pressure chamber soilmoisture corp santa barbara ca usa according to the technique described by scholander et al 1965 sound non senescent leaves were wrapped in a plastic bag detached from the shoot via a single cut and measured directly by slowly increasing chamber pressure until the endpoint when xylem sap became visible on the cut surface turner 1988 measurements were conducted pre dawn ѱpd in close proximity to the soil moisture monitoring tubes 2 3 2 berry sugar carbon isotope discrimination δ13c juice samples derived from a sample of one hundred to two hundred ripe berries randomly picked at harvest date from each side of the grapevine canopy within the whole subplots respectively berries were pressed twice at 0 6 mpa for approximately two minutes longarone 85 eis system gmbh norderstedt germany interrupted by a manual crumbling the obtained juice was centrifuged for five minutes at 7830 rpm and 20 c eppendorf 5430 r hamburg germany and filtered coarsely 16 μ munktell 33 n 90 g m 2 folded filter ahlstrom helsinki finland no further juice preparation was conducted as suggested by gaudillère et al 2002 two aliquots of 12 µl juice sample were pipetted in a 5 9 mm tin capsule iva analysetechnik gmbh co kg meerbusch germany and oven dried for 24 h at 60 c the capsule was folded pressed tightly and encased in a second tin capsule which was also folded and pressed after combustion at 920 c carbon isotopes were measured with the vario pyro cube analyser elementar langenselbold germany coupled to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer elementar uk stockport uk the results are expressed in vpdb standard farquhar et al 1989 with reference values based on iaea ch3 sucrose coplen et al 2006 2 4 vegetative and generative response parameters grapevine vegetative and generative performance is a viable indicator of plant s drought stress gambetta et al 2020 pellegrino et al 2005 all grapevines selected for recordings of crop and growth parameters were chosen by their appearance i e healthy in regard to fungal diseases and for the experimental site representative regarding their vigour 2 4 1 grapevine lateral leaf area estimation in 2019 and 2020 leaf area of lateral shoots was estimated according to the non destructive method of lopes and pinto 2005 six vines per vineyard were labelled in 2019 and used for repeated measurements in close proximity to the soil moisture monitoring tubes on each vine one representative shoot i e healthy fruit baring and average sized was selected visually the leaf area per shoot was estimated considering the leaf area of the largest leaf i e the sum of the two lateral veins of the largest leaf and the calculated mean lateral leaf area i e the average leaf area of the largest and the leaf area of the smallest leaf multiplied by the number of leaves of the shoot in this regard a tape measure was used to obtain the lengths of the leaf veins 2 4 2 pruning wood pruning wood fresh weights were assessed during dormancy in the winters from 2018 to 2020 a total of thirty vines per site and treatment were labelled in 2018 and used for repeated measurements the fresh weight of the pruning wood was assessed by weighing the pruned cane and annual shoots 2 4 3 yield and sugar yield yield per vine was calculated by counting and weighing the grape bunches of the six vines per site and treatment labelled for leaf area estimation to assess further grapevine performance sugar yield was calculated by multiplying the berry juice sugar content g l 1 measured by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir via a ft2 winescan spectrometer foss hillerød denmark using an in house grape must calibration with the juice yield per vine l the calculation was based on a theoretical juice yield of 75 after pressing 2 4 4 statistical analyses the data was processed and visualised within the rstudio environment v1 4 1717 using the stats and tidyverse packages the plant stress indicators ψpd and δ13c and vegetative response parameters leaf area estimation and pruning fresh weights were evaluated by the non parametric mann whitney u test to assess statistical differences between the two treatments at each site 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics in different steep slope management systems 3 1 1 temporal development of soil moisture changes in fig 3 the differences in the percentage change of soil water content swc to a depth of 1 m between treatments of every two consecutive measurement days are displayed the highest differences in the percentage change between the two treatments could be observed in late winter early spring close to the beginning of the vegetation period at the beginning of march 2020 and the mid of february 2021 a 30 40 higher water storage could be observed in the terraced treatments compared to the control at the two experimental sites le and ls fig 3c d all other measuring dates during winter showed only a small difference in percentage change i e 5 between the two treatments at site gm there was only one date which showed a difference in percentage change between the treatments higher than 10 at the end of the winter at the beginning of february 2021 after 25 mm rain fell the terraced treatment at site gm had a higher increase in percentage change of soil water content from one measurement day to the next compared to the control fig 3a at site rb there was only one late winter date in 2020 when the terraced treatment showed a higher increase in percentage change of soil water content compared to the control the effects of the irrigation at site rb in the two years of 2019 and 2020 are clearly visible in fig 3b dates of irrigation are displayed by down pointing arrows irrigation led to high differences in percentage change of soil water content i e a higher percentage increase for the treatment which was artificially watered and a decrease in percentage change in the other treatment led to amplitudes up to 40 difference fig 3b table s2 during dry periods predominantly in summer when soil water content was generally low only small differences in percentage change between the treatments were visible after precipitation events water retention was higher in the terraced treatments the water depletion was similar between the treatments in the days post precipitation suggesting an actual accumulation of precipitation water in the soil of the terraced treatment fig 3 3 1 2 soil moisture depletion under dry conditions exemplarily the percentage change in consumption of soil water content swc in a 10 cm interval up to 1 m soil depth during dry periods of mid march to end of april 41 days and mid of may to beginning of june 14 days at the four experimental sites gm rb le and ls is displayed in fig 4a and b during the early spring mid march to the end april of 2020 the differences in soil water dynamics summed for a depth of 1 m were considerably higher compared to the later development stage of the grapevine fig 4 the dynamic of soil water changes per measurement interval varied between the experimental sites at site gm and ls the terraced treatments showed notably higher percentage changes in soil water content for each measurement interval compared to control resulting from a high variability the treatments at site rb did not differ from each other at the site le the change in soil moisture observed between 50 cm and 70 cm suggests a low water holding capacity at this range since the percentage changes of c became less than 10 likewise the terraced treatment at site le showed low water retention capacity in depth lower 80 cm at the end of may 2020 when vines approximately reached the onset of flowering differences in soil water loss became remarkably lower compared to the former measurement period in general single measurement intervals showed low percentage changes approximately 10 for the soil layers lower than the first 20 cm fig 4 3 2 plant stress indicators 3 2 1 pre dawn leaf water potential drought stress identified by pre dawn leaf water potential measures increased during the summer of 2019 and 2020 fig 5 in general control treatments showed a tendency to less negative values where treatments were statistically different vines of the control indicated less drought stress at site gm no significant differences in pre dawn leaf water potential could be detected between the treatments during the entire time of the experiment especially at site rb both treatments showed low pre dawn leaf water potential values despite of various irrigation treatments in 2019 irrigation was applied rather late table s2 so that the vines faced a severe water deficit 0 6 mpa in the terraced treatment close after flowering doy 180 even though irrigation was applied during july both treatments at site rb suffered from severe water deficits but showed no statistical differences until mid of august 2019 doy 229 in 2020 irrigation means were applied at site rb after cap fall was completed the amount of the supplied water per vine provided at the single irrigation dates was rather low c 2 86 l vine 1 to 7 14 l vine 1 and t 3 32 l vine 1 to 6 63 l vine 1 table s2 thus it was not possible to prevent vines from high drought stress levels at the sites le and ls vines planted on terraced vineyards suffered from higher water deficits compared to c except at doy 187 in 2019 where at site ls the control showed lower ψpd values at site ls differences between treatments were not as clear as at site le 3 2 2 carbon isotope discrimination δ13c vines planted on terraces generally showed a higher risk of drought stress during berry maturation compared to the control vines table 2 an exceptional case was found for the site gm during all four years where downslope planted vines control displayed a higher i e more positive carbon isotope ratio in the sugars of mature berries compared to terraced vines no statistical differences were found between treatments at site ls in 2020 due to high variance in data and at site rb in 2018 and in 2020 probably due to the irrigation management of both treatments table s2 3 3 vegetative and generative plant response parameters 3 3 1 grapevine lateral leaf area estimation except the treatments of site rb which were both irrigated in 2020 table s2 terraced vineyards usually showed lower vigour at the onset of ripening véraison and at the development stage of harvest ripe berries fig 6 no statistical differences were found between the treatments at site gm at véraison in both years and at site rb at véraison and harvest in 2020 in 2019 no significant differences were detected between treatments at site ls table s3 in general the number of field replicates was rather low which reduces the significance of the results but the data showed that secondary leaf area tended to be higher in downslope planted vines of all the non irrigated vineyards tested fig 6 3 3 2 pruning wood the fresh weights of winter pruning mass were always significantly different between treatments except in 2018 at site gm where only a trend was visible table 3 each year tested pruning weights per hectare in downsloped vineyards were higher compared to terraced vineyards 3 3 3 yield and sugar yield grapevines of terraced vineyards showed continuously lower yields and sugar yields per vine and hectare compared to control vineyards table 4 only in 2019 at site gm the t treatment had 8 higher grape yield and a 13 higher sugar yield per vine compared to control in 2019 at site ls yield and sugar yield per vine were equal between the treatments table 4 but in the consecutive years terraced vineyards showed approximately 20 33 lower yield per vine at site le the yield per vine of t was about a half to two third lower compared to control vines in 2019 the terraced vineyard of site rb suffered from an intense drought stress at anthesis this led to a reduction of yield per vine of 92 compared to control but also in the following years c showed about twice as much grape yield per vine compared to t 4 discussion the relevance of this work has to be linked to the current but also to the changing growing conditions grapevines will experience in the near future as well as to the special role of viticulture practices at steep slope sites global climate projections show that different regions will experience various changes in the amount of annual precipitation the rainfall distribution and evapotranspiration ipcc 2021 in cool 13 15 c to intermediate 15 17 c wine growing regions hall and jones 2009 like the rheingau wine growing region germany annual mean precipitation patterns but also evapotranspiration are predicted to increase ipcc 2021 schultz and hofmann 2015 especially the latter with a continuous rise in vegetation period temperatures schultz and hofmann 2015 prognosticated that the gap between the amount of precipitation and potential evaporation during the vegetation period is going to increase in future schultz 2017 further highlighted that the risk of developing a water deficit in cool climate wine growing regions like the rheingau is driven by the increase in evapotranspiration rather than by a decrease in precipitation using a high resolution site specific assessment of drought stress risk hofmann et al 2022 showed that drought stress varies substantially between vineyard sites and will increase further in steep slope regions in future compared to rain fed vineyards in the flat this will be further enhanced since the incoming solar radiation is higher on steep hill sites and considerably increases the evapotranspiration on often stony and shallow soils comprising a low water holding capacity hofmann et al 2014 additionally steep slope vineyards are prone to soil and nutrient loss through erosion pijl et al 2020 which increases with slope gradient and length of the hillside emde 1992 rodrigo comino 2018 a recent work by pijl et al 2022 highlighted the benefits of modern terraces regarding the conservation of soil water and the reduction of soil erosion and sediment fluxes in the years of 2018 2020 annual rainfall was lower in the rheingau wine growing region compared to the long term average of 1981 2010 13 13 and 23 respectively table s1 and the experimental sites experienced a dry period over three years in 2021 the annual precipitation was a little higher compared to the previous years but was still dryer than the long term average 4 compared to the long term average 1991 2020 and 7 compared to the long term average 1981 2010 table s1 while the actual grapevine transpiration may vary considerably the potential evapotranspiration of flat vineyards in geisenheim rheingau germany is approximately 500 mm during the vegetation period hoppmann et al 2017 or 800 mm per year increasing with slope hofmann et al 2014 those values exceed the annual amount of precipitation clearly table s1 but this does not necessarily result in grapevine drought stress since transpiration shows plasticity and the water use efficiency of grapevines under drought may improve during the season due to stomatal regulation induced by aba signalling and the incorporation of osmotically active solutes which interacts with the stomatal apparatus gambetta et al 2020 herrera et al 2022 due to priming zamorano et al 2021 or due to long term adaption by assumed epigenetically changes pagay et al 2022 the impact of drought stress on grapevine depends on the severity and the timing of the event the evapotranspirative demand of the atmosphere affects the vine and intensifies concomitantly to the development of foliage furthermore different growth stages are diversely susceptible in general low water availability affects cell division and cell expansion independent of the organ tissue while drought stress is able to inhibit vegetative growth from the time of when leaves are capable to perform photosynthesis throughout the whole vegetation period the generative development is highly vulnerable from pre bloom to fruit set since pollen fertility is particularly sensitive to drought keller 2020 a poor anthesis results in lower yields due to shoots with less fruitful clusters meaning a reduced berry number which can further be reduced in size drought during bloom may also affect yield in the consecutive vintage keller 2020 the rheingau is one of the german wine growing regions which is at highest risk of future potential yield losses due to pre véraison water shortage yang et al 2022 in 2019 at site rb yield loss in the terraced treatment was severe due to a pre anthesis drought event inflorescences were shed which led to a 90 reduction of yield in the terraced vineyard compared to the control treatment table 4 with minor exceptions e g site gm in 2019 terraced vineyards yielded a lower fruit mass per vine during the years table 4 under drought conditions berry growth may be supported by storage reserves from perennial sources woody grapevine parts and roots which may be at the expense of lower frost hardiness and a reduction in shoot development in the next year junquera et al 2012 the pruning weight data displayed in table 3 suggests a lower carbohydrate storage in the woody parts of vines planted on terraces either by an allocation of reserves to support fruit ripening or a general reduction of photosynthetic performance i e carbon assimilation due to stomatal closure as a reaction of drought experience this is supported by the δ13c analyses which showed a higher drought stress response in terms of an altered carbon assimilation in terraced vineyards compared to control during the whole period of fruit development except at site gm table 2 in general the grapevine adaptation to local conditions and the achievement of full economic performance i e yield stability and vine balance is delayed and usually lower at steep slopes comprising shallow and stony soils compared to flat rain fed vineyards certainly at site le and ls years of planting were different between the treatments terraced vineyards were planted 5 and 7 years later compared the control table 1 which may affect results due to possibly less developed or adapted root system in t over time zhang et al 2018 however at site rb vines were planted in the same year and at site gm the three year difference between treatments would not influence the established vines in their physiological behavior since young vines planted in a flat vineyard showed similar yield and pruning weights compared to fully adapted vines in the fifth year after planting bou nader et al 2019 in the present study the vines of the oldest vineyard terrace site gm showed either less stress response table 2 or did not distinguish from control in their pre dawn leaf water potential measurements fig 5 the fifty year old grapevines might have been able to root in deeper soil layers or to exploit higher soil moisture from the platform centre in addition differences between treatments might have also been reduced due to a high water holding capacity of the soils on that site table 1 studies on the impact of grapevine age on the tolerance to water deficit showed that due to a shallower root system young vines were more vulnerable to soil drying conditions compared to older and more adapted vines bou nader et al 2019 grigg et al 2018 furthermore in our study soil moisture dynamics were recorded at the platform edge of the terrace but literature cited in michalsky 1976 indicates that root growth was higher in length on terraces compared to vines planted downslope and that roots of vines planted on terraces tended to grow towards the centre of the platform where a higher soil water content would exists michalsky 1976 hence once the vines start to adapt irrigation water should be applied on the foot of the embankments through subsurface drip lines forcing the roots to grow towards the hill side modern driveable vineyard terraces have to be constructed and maintained properly poorly managed and insufficient stabilized embankments i e by the renunciation of vegetation cover or dry stones may lead to collapses of the terrace and an increase in soil erosion pijl et al 2020 rodrigo comino et al 2019 the positive contribution of weeds and other crops covering bare embankment soil of vineyard terraces are ecosystem services like the prevention of erosion the providing of food and shelter for beneficial insects or the improvement of soil physical and chemical characteristics however while young vines planted on terraces may be competing strongly with embankment vegetation used for soil stability fully adapted grapevines may benefit from higher water availability in the middle of the terrace platform depending on the water consumption of the surrounding vegetation row orientation affects the radiation energy partitioning of the grapevine and the vineyard soil zorer et al 2017 thus influencing the water balance of the vineyard kool et al 2021 depending on intercropping the evapotranspiration of the soil may be little 0 5 mm d 1 to almost as high as the grapevine transpiration 3 mm d 1 itself celette et al 2010 cover cropped embankments in e w but also in nw se aligned terraces are irradiated almost the whole day whereas the tractor alley may be shaded by the grapevine canopy to evaluate the soil water budget in terraced vineyards an already existing model for radiation partitioning and water balance for steep slope vineyards would have to be adapted for the vineyard system planted along the contour line of the hill hofmann et al 2014 lopes et al 2015 quantified the water use of several weeds and cover crops in a rain fed steep slope vineyard in the rheingau wine growing region and showed that depending on their dispersion transpiration values per square meter soil cover per day were on average 2 7 to five times higher compared to grapevine the difference in vineyard soil plant cover between the control and the terraced treatments was highest during the early part of the vegetation period mid of may when mulching is conducted in control vineyards to reduce the risk of late frost damage but embankment vegetation is maintained however only small difference in the percentage change of soil water content could be found between the treatments at all experimental sites close after the period of late frost risk fig 4b the small differences may be due to a rather dry and sunny spring table s1 soils with a fewer amount of soil water content also showed smaller percentage changes in soil water content earlier in the season the management systems displayed considerable differences in soil water loss rates from mid march to the end of april fig 4a which may also lead to a delay in shoot growth in the terraced treatment strack et al 2021 even though vineyard terraces are able to conserve water during precipitation events due to an increased water infiltration fig 3 and a reduction of run off arnáez et al 2015 pijl et al 2022 they show a large potential evaporation resulting from a larger surface exposed to solar irradiation and wind compared to down sloped vineyards lü et al 2009 the solar energy intake of the two systems may be the same during the day but terraced vineyards showed lower daytime temperatures compared to down slope planted vineyards which may indicate a cooling effect of a higher transpiration activity of embankment weeds and cover crop strack et al 2021 additionally a lower planting density resulting from a bigger distance between vineyard rows in the terrace system may increase the wind flux which further increases water consumption by accompanying vineyard plants heilman et al 1994 projections of the near future show that under a dryer climate low density vineyards in the plane i e 2 500 vines ha 1 instead of 5 000 vines ha 1 may benefit from a higher amount of free transpirable soil water ftsw van leeuwen et al 2019 however under less favorable soil conditions ftsw 100 mm as it can be often found at steep slope sites see also table 1 a lower planting density barely improved ftsw van leeuwen et al 2019 the differences in drought stress response were mainly pronounced during fruit development before the beginning of ripening fig 5 after véraison berry development is less sensitive to drought stress and may profit from a reduced vegetative growth due to better solar irradiation and a lower risks of noble rot infection smart and robinson 1991 the small changes in weekly water content measurements post véraison fig 3 implied a low plasticity of water supply from soils with low water holding capacity during summer in years of reduced precipitation on the one hand grapevine water consumption is closely linked to its leaf area more precisely the transpiration surface of the plant ohana levi et al 2020 on the other hand secondary leaf area is strongly affected by water deficit lebon et al 2001 pellegrino et al 2005 grapevine vegetative performance of the terraced vineyards was lower at harvest time at all sites fig 6 table 4 a clear tendency was shown that control vineyards display higher vigour compared to terraced treatments fig 6 table 3 in 2020 when both types of grapevine management i e vines planted on terraces or downslope at site rb were irrigated regularly table s2 treatments showed no statistical differences in lateral leaf area but a slight tendency of higher lateral leaf area in t compared to c fig 6 this suggests that a vine planted on the edge of a terrace platform is able to outperform disadvantages related to water availability if supported by means of irrigation however since the irrigation of luxury goods like wine bears the high risk of social injustice alternatives to an improved water supply or availability have to be found possible solutions may be the relocation of the drip lines to the foot of the embankment or the incorporation of an optimized drainage system during the vineyard transformation process to slowly supply excessive precipitation water from the pathways or turning plates of the terrace to the vineyard soil pijl et al 2020 tarolli et al 2015 special attention should be payed to viticultural management decisions and breeding the selection of a suitable rootstock showing better root architecture and being less vulnerable to drought stress and the scion ollat et al 2017 the trellising as well as the controlling of vine balance ratio of vegetative to generative growth has to be considered further measures are the increase of soil organic matter to improve water storage capacity ground cover management to reduce evapotranspiration a shallow soil cultivation to increase water availability during droughts or the application of soil amendments i e biochar schmidt et al 2021 and or the inoculation of beneficial root symbionts i e rhizosphere engineering dries et al 2021 to improve water storage and water uptake by grapevine roots in conclusion the collected data related to drought stress parameters highlighted a better overall performance of control vines compared to the terraced treatment however the fifty year old vineyards at site gm showed less drought stress during the seasons fig 5 this is of particular importance since the years were the study was performed will most likely become common scenarios in the near future under changing climate conditions all other terraces in this study were constructed and planted not later than ten years ago thus it may be inferred that young vines need longer to adapt to the specific conditions of a high competitive environment like the terraced situation of a larger exposed soil surface area nevertheless the transformation of steep hill sites to terraces may allow the retention of winter precipitation water and the reduction of soil and nutrient loss induced by rainfall events additionally terrace embankments have the potential to diversify the monocultural vineyard landscape and to cross link biotopes if an adequate cover cropping i e regionally adapted flower seed mixture is used for biological stabilization wersebeckmann et al 2022 a fast adaptation of grapevines to the vineyard site is desired by viticulturists for reasons of lowering costs of grapevine nursing and increasing yield in this context site specific solutions have to be developed on how to improve the adaptation and resilience of young vines on terraced vineyard sites the aim is to support a fast development of grapevine roots to overcome competition with highly drought adapted spontaneous or for stabilization reasons inevitable co vegetation to further allow successful grapevine cultivation at drought risk

9261,mobile infrared thermometers irts mounted on moving platforms provide one time of day radiometric measurements tr which can be used to calculate instantaneous actual evapotranspiration eta using the two source energy balance tseb model however irrigation scheduling decisions utilize daily eta estimates hence the need for time scaling this study evaluated different upscaling methods to calculate daily maize eta using one time of day tr under varying water stress conditions mobile irts were mounted on a high clearance mobile sensing platform and collected tr in remote locations under full deficit and rainfed conditions seven scaling methods via two pathways were employed to obtain daily eta first pathway was scaling one time of day tr sc whereas the second pathway involved use of six upscaling methods of instantaneous eta including original and modified evaporative factor ef o ef m as well as crop coefficient kc o kc m direct canopy resistance direct rc and solar radiation ratio rn rs and all were compared to a neutron based soil water balance swb determined eta from the results sc outperformed other methods in comparison to swb eta across all the selected treatments with smaller discrepancies and lower rmse 0 9 1 7 mm d 1 vs 0 7 4 3 mm d 1 for other methods furthermore methods including sc ef o ef m and rn rs had their daily average eta values in close agreement to swb eta with mean eta differences ranging between 0 2 and 1 6 mm d 1 overall sc method performed better in fully irrigated maize r2 0 52 rmse 0 9 mm d 1 than in deficit irrigated maize r2 0 48 rmse 1 4 mm d 1 but worst in rainfed maize r2 0 16 rmse 1 7 mm d 1 this implies that sc is more suited for irrigated rather than rainfed settings importantly the choice of any method depends on data requirements irrigation water management strategy and eta estimation accuracy keywords mobile infrared thermometers moving platforms irrigation scheduling time scaling methods radiometric temperature soil water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainable water management is needed to support irrigated agriculture in water limited environments scanlon et al 2012 which are experiencing increased water demand from other sectors as well as prolonged droughts due to climate change kullberg et al 2017 one of the ways is by using automated irrigation scheduling systems which are able to provide faster and accurate estimation of water stress and actual evapotranspiration eta over a larger spatial scale in real time o shaughnessy et al 2020 2017 2015 peters and evett 2008 such better scheduling techniques can provide accurate irrigation timing and depth hence contributing to precise irrigation water management which enhances water use efficiency crop water productivity and marketable yields colaizzi et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2017 2015 peters and evett 2008 actual evapotranspiration eta is often quantified using soil moisture measurements or directly measured with weighing lysimeters and or micrometeorological methods such as eddy covariance and bowen ratio while these methods are accurate they are rarely used on producer fields because of their cost difficulty in deploying and maintaining and limited by spatial coverage ben gal et al 2009 qiu and zhao 2010 rudnick and irmak 2014 however eta and water stress can now be determined using radiometric tr and canopy tc temperatures respectively collected with infrared sensors which are mounted on stationary or mobile platforms as well as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs kullberg et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2017 dejonge et al 2015 among the commonly used water stress indicators derived from tc include crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 1988 katimbo et al 2022 han et al 2018 time temperature threshold ttt peters and evett 2008 and other stress indices including degrees above non stressed canopy dans degrees above canopy threshold dact among others as reported in dejonge et al 2015 in contrast eta is computed using tr as one of the input variables in addition to other weather variables in a two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 kustas and norman 1999 liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 colaizzi et al 2017 or using tc derived water stress indices and fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach kullberg et al 2017 while there is increased use of infrared thermometers irts mounted on moving platforms to determine water stress and eta there are still challenges of establishing daily estimates from one point of day measurements thus requiring accurate time scaling methods o shaughnessy et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2017 peters and evett 2008 2004 nonetheless according to peters and evett 2004 single point of day temperature can be time scaled based on hypothesis that any measured temperature from any remote location in the field can be modeled to daily patterns using reference temperatures which are constantly measured from a well irrigated crop under non water limiting conditions interestingly application of automated irrigation scheduling based on plant water stress feedback using mobile irts boarding an irrigation system i e center pivots has already been demonstrated to simplify irrigation scheduling decisions o shaughnessy et al 2020 2017 2015 peters and evett 2008 under this system time temperature threshold ttt has been used to monitor water stress and used as a scheduling tool in comparison to neutron probe soil water measurements and it performed better with respect to achieved yields and water use efficiency in soybeans peters and evett 2008 single tc s were scaled into diurnal pattern with time scaling approach peters and evett 2004 then irrigation triggering threshold was set at 30 c above which water stress was expected likewise with similar system integrated crop water stress index icwsi using time scaled tc has also been used as plant water stress feedback then coupled with soil moisture sensing as soil water stress feedback for variable rate irrigation applications in row crops such as corn sorghum and cotton o shaughnessy et al 2020 2017 2015 furthermore colaizzi et al 2017 used similar irrigation system to collect single point tr from remote locations then scaled to find daily eta estimate using tseb which was compared against soil water balance swb eta and yielded a root mean square error rmse ranging between 1 5 and 1 8 mm d 1 two source energy balance tseb model accounts for two separate energy budgets soil and crop canopy from which evaporation and transpiration are respectively estimated chirouze et al 2014 norman et al 1995 previous research has demonstrated the reliability of tseb for estimating eta with most studies reporting a rmse of less than 2 mm d 1 diarra et al 2017 song et al 2016 xia et al 2016 semmens et al 2016 french et al 2015 morillas et al 2013 one of the main data requirements of tseb model is the radiometric temperature tr which can be measured in different ways with use of different platforms under a wide range of spatial scales such platforms include mobile irts as employed by colaizzi et al 2017 stationary irts liang et al 2021 sánchez et al 2008 song et al 2016 kustas and norman 1999 satellites diarra et al 2017 semmens et al 2016 french et al 2015 unmanned aerial vehicles uavs xia et al 2016 hoffmann et al 2016 each of these platforms has unique strengths and weaknesses for example current satellites provide coarse and less frequent thermal images whereas uavs can provide fine resolution thermal images from each on demand flight however uavs are limited in terms of payload capacity battery life and flight regulations and are incapable of the spatial extent of satellites hence such considerations have contributed to the use of stationary irts for point based measurements liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 colaizzi et al 2012 sánchez et al 2008 however to address spatial limitations of stationary irts colaizzi et al 2017 suggested use of wireless irts boarded on a center pivot to measure tr in bushland texas usa because irt sensors mounted on a moving platform such as a center pivot only provide one time of day tr time scaling methods must be employed to compute daily eta over different vegetation cover types colaizzi et al 2006 2014 2017 chávez et al 2008 even though colaizzi et al 2006 2014 explored the estimation of daily eta using different scaling methods for both stationary tr and instantaneous eta still assessing the performance of similar and other models yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 relative to tr scaling method colaizzi et al 2014 2017 under varying water stress is desired colaizzi et al 2014 performed evaluation of some methods in fully irrigated conditions of cotton in a semi arid climate however considering their performance under varying water stress different crop types and climates is also necessary furthermore while the combination of tseb and mobile irts on a center pivot for daily eta estimation was successful in southern great plains of usa colaizzi et al 2017 validation in other regions like west central nebraska is needed to assess the transferability of this technique to other regions therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of tseb model and seven scaling methods i e one tr time scaling and six instantaneous eta scaling methods in computing daily eta under varying water stress conditions for irrigated and non irrigated maize while using mobile irts mounted on a high clearance mobile sensing platform in west central nebraska usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental layout the study was conducted during the 2020 growing season at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research extension and education center wcreec in north platte nebraska usa 41 1 n 100 8 w 861 m above sea level north platte has a semi arid climate with 80 of annual precipitation occurring between late april and mid october payero et al 2009 predominant soil is a cozad silt loam with field capacity of 0 29 m3 m 3 and permanent wilting point of 0 11 m3 m 3 klocke et al 1999 the investigated treatments included full irrigation deficit irrigation receiving 60 of the full irrigation treatment s depth and rainfed no irrigation the field was irrigated using a subsurface drip system with driplines installed every 1 52 m at a depth of 0 4 m irrigation events were triggered when the full irrigation treatment reached 50 of maximum allowable depletion measured by calibrated neutron moisture meters nmm application depths included 20 and 12 mm for full and deficit irrigation respectively seasonal irrigation totals for full and deficit irrigated treatments were 244 and 146 mm respectively the experimental layout was a randomized complete block design and three replications for each treatment were considered where each plot had dimensions of 9 1 by 72 2 m all sensing and modeling efforts of this study were conducted across three plots of full deficit and rainfed treatments maize zea mays l hybrid pioneer 1197 amt corteva agriscience wilmington

nitrogen was applied at the five leaf stage v5 on june 12 at a rate of 126 kg ha 1 at the soil surface neighboring each crop row using a 360 y drop system 360 yield center morton illinois usa 2 2 sensing platform and measurements a high clearance mobile sensing platform i e a high tractor fig 1 was used to collect one time of day radiometric temperatures tr throughout the study on six field sensing campaign days i e june 24 july 3 july 13 july 31 aug 7 and aug 21 the platform was equipped with an extendable and height adjustable boom mounted with four apogee si 1h1 infrared thermometers irts apogee instruments logan utah usa four active spectral sensors i e crop circle acs 430 holland scientific lincoln nebraska usa and an external differential gps dgps receiver holland scientific lincoln nebraska usa orientation of sensors on the platform is illustrated in fig 1 sensors were maintained at a height of 1 m above the canopy for all field sensing campaigns apogee irts were pointed towards the canopy at 45 zenith angle whereas spectral sensors were positioned at nadir view above crop row before tassel and in inter rows after tassel the sensing platform travelled parallel to the plant rows at a speed of 1 0 m s 1 and two interior rows were sensed at mid day under clear sky where ta ranged between 31 and 32 c the tr was measured every 0 5 s and stored on cr1000x datalogger campbell scientific logan utah usa spectral sensors measured spectral reflectance at 670 730 and 780 nm collected every 0 2 s and stored on geoscout x dataloggers holland scientific lincoln nebraska usa all apogee irts used in the study were calibrated by the manufacturer prior to the season 2 3 ground based and field measurements stationary apogee si 1h1 irts apogee instruments logan utah usa were installed in three plots or replicates for each treatment on june 17 pointed at 45 zenith angle in the northeast direction and adjusted to 1 m above the canopy either weekly or bi weekly during the 2020 maize growing season daily and continuous radiometric tr measurements were recorded every 6 s then averaged to 1 min and logged to cr1000x dataloggers campbell scientific logan utah usa these sensors as likewise with mobile irts were factory calibrated by apogee instruments before installing them in the three plots of each treatment i e full deficit and rainfed soil volumetric water content θv was measured at depths of 0 15 2 75 m at increments of 0 30 m using both cpn 503 elite hydroprobe and cpn 503dr neutron moisture meters nmms instrotek concord california usa the conversion from count ratios to θv was based upon a local gravimetric calibration with r2 of 0 98 and rmse of 0 010 m3 m 3 lo et al 2020 furthermore two aluminum access tubes were installed around healthy plants on either side of the crop row one tube at 0 15 m and the other at 0 57 m from the drip tape to well capture the soil water dynamics in each treatment replicate or plot the average values of neutron readings between the two tubes were used to calculate eta with a soil water balance model leaf area index lai was measured using lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln nebraska usa on plants close to the tubes while taking four readings around 0600 hr either on or near days for sensing campaigns likewise plant height hc was measured on random six plants using a 4 m telescopic post with 0 1 m markings meteorological data was collected every minute from an onsite weather station monitored by nebraska climate office https mesonet unl edu within 100 m from experimentation site collected data included air temperature ta c relative humidity rh solar radiation rs w m 2 wind speed u3 m s 1 and precipitation p mm windspeed was adjusted to 2 m from measurement height of 3 m and vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from ta and rh both following allen et al 1998 2 4 processing radiometric measurements spatial filtering and averaging of tr values from mobile irts was done within a clipped length of 10 7 m in the middle of each plot by using microsoft excel s visual basic microsoft corporation redmond washington usa and open source geoprocessing software qgis desktop 3 12 3 qgis developers gruet switzerland used tr values for further tseb eta calculations were the average of median values for each of the four apogee irts from range of extracted values in the middle of each plot also spatial variability across plots were determined by computing standard deviations among the measured tr values on the other hand tr collected from stationary irts in three treatments i e full deficit and rainfed were averaged at 15 min timestep over a 24 h period however irt readings from one rainfed plot were excluded due to data skips following cable damage after it was chewed by rodents 2 5 two source energy balance eta calculation a modified two source energy balance tseb model with series resistance network fig 2 was used in this study song et al 2016 series resistance has been reported to perform better than the parallel approach under different environmental conditions kool et al 2021 the model partitions tr into canopy tc and soil surface ts temperatures eq 1 the fraction of vegetation cover fc viewed by the irt sensor at a zenith view angle is related to tc and ts whereby contributions of each of these temperatures are proportional to fc and 1 fc respectively eq 1 computation procedure of using the tseb model to estimate eta was summarized in six steps as shown in fig 2 1 t r 4 f c t c 4 1 f c t s 4 there are three key assumptions in the model first in step 2 fig 2 the initial estimate of latent heat flux at the canopy lec was determined by assuming a well transpiring canopy using eq 2 norman et al 1995 second an optimization process blue region in fig 2 was applied since les 0 is not a physical solution under daytime conditions which implies condensation of water vapor at the soil surface under dry convective conditions agam et al 2010 the priestley taylor parameter αpt was iteratively reduced until les 0 to reflect canopy stress conditions agam et al 2010 third initial tc was computed using a parallel resistance approach since this pathway is simple and allows easy computation for tc liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 as defined in eq 3 finally eta is computed from the total latent heat fluxes which are calculated as the sum of the latent heat fluxes le at both canopy i e transpiration and soil surfaces i e evaporation i e λ et c le les lec 2 le c pt f g γ r nc where lec is the latent heat flux at canopy αpt is the priestley taylor parameter and was assumed to be 1 26 fg is the fraction of green vegetation which can transpire and equal to 1 kpa c 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve γ kpa c 1 is the psychrometric constant and rnc w m 2 is the net radiation at the canopy 3 t c t a r a ρ c p le c r nc where tc k is canopy temperature ta k is air temperature ra s m 1 is aerodynamic resistance ρ 1000 kg m3 is density of water and cp 1013 j kg 1 k 1 is specific heat capacity of air it is worth noting that the net radiation was not measured but estimated by following the procedure from french et al 2015 and ortega farias et al 2010 while using eq 4 4 r n 1 r s ε a σ t a 4 ε r σ t r 4 where rs w m 2 is the incoming solar radiation α 0 23 is the surface albedo σ 5 67 10 8wm 2 k is stefan boltzmann constant ε a s m 1 is the hemispherical longwave atmospheric emissivity and ε r is the surface emissivity 0 98 ortega farias et al 2010 2 6 estimating daily tseb eta with different scaling methods as presented in fig 3 there are two different pathways of how daily eta is calculated from tseb fig 2 from collected one time of day tr measurements using setup in fig 1 1 scaling one time of day tr to diurnal tr and 2 upscaling methods of instantaneous eta eta on daily timestep is desired for easy use in irrigation scheduling or comparing to validation methods such as conventional methods i e soil water balance model or standard and more accurate methods i e lysimeters and eddy covariance conversely from both pathways total latent heat fluxes le are calculated as sum of estimated les and lec from tseb model i e le λ et a les lec scaling of one time of day tr to diurnal pattern can be performed by using a method developed by peters and evett 2004 sc which convincingly performed well when it was used by colaizzi et al 2017 and peters and evett 2008 peters and evett 2004 suggested that single point measurement i e trm t from a remote location can be scaled relative to measured reference temperatures tr s from a fully irrigated crop where water is non limiting i e no water stress using eq 5 table 1 daily eta is obtained as sum of eta values of scaled tr on 15 min interval over a 24 hr period using eq 6 table 1 total latent heat fluxes le are obtained as the sum of latent fluxes at both canopy and soil surfaces i e le lec les colaizzi et al 2017 the daily eta calculated with sc is denoted as etd sc fig 3 the other six instantaneous eta scaling methods to daily eta majority of them have been extensively used in finding satellite daily eta estimates i e etd where estimated instantaneous total latent energy fluxes λ eti or crop evapotranspiration eti are upscaled to daily estimates over larger spatial scales chávez et al 2008 therefore instantaneous total latent heat fluxes i e lei λ eti lec les in tseb model was calculated as sum of latent heat fluxes from canopy and soil surfaces colaizzi et al 2017 at the tr measurement time many of the used scaling methods associate etd to a factor which is assumed to be constant during the day yan et al 2022 the factor can be represented as a ratio between eti at a specific time of the day to a reference variable which is computed daily yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 such factors include evaporative factor ef crop coefficient kc non dynamic constant direct canopy resistance direct rc and finally solar radiation ratio rn rs evaporative factor ef method is the ratio of instantaneous total latent heat fluxes λ eti to the available energy rn g yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2006 there are two ef methods original method which considers daily mean value of g i e ef o eq 7 table 1 and modified method which assumes daily mean value of g to be zero i e ef m eq 8 table 1 therefore daily eta i e etd from both methods is estimated using eq 9 table 1 and denoted as etd ef o and etd ef m for original and modified evaporative factor respectively as illustrated in fig 3 crop coefficient kc method has been recommended by different researchers since it can easily interpolate λ eti to λ etd yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2006 it is the ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration based on short reference crop grass following original penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 there are two different crop coefficient methods original eq 10 and modified eq 11 and they differ how the resistances are computed as indicated in table 1 yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 modified crop coefficient method was developed since constant canopy resistance rc might not apply to a crop under study but only to a reference crop and it is assumed that daily rc varies due to variability in weather conditions yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 so in the original penman monteith equation dynamic rc is considered instead of constant rc yan et al 2022 todorovic 1999 for original coefficient constant rc is used in the original penman monteith equation daily eta from both methods is estimated using eq 12 table 1 which is denoted as etd kc o for original crop coefficient approach and etd kc m for modified crop coefficient approach fig 3 direct canopy resistance direct rc method assumes a constant rc as the suitable factor for scaling λ eti direct rc is computed by inverting the original penman monteith equation as shown in eq 13 table 1 yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 daily eta i e etd is calculated using eq 14 table 1 on the other hand solar radiation ratio method rn rs uses both evaporative factor ef which is assumed to be constant throughout the day as well as ratio of net to incoming solar radiation i e rn rs to calculate daily eta with eq 15 as shown in table 1 this method assumes a daytime proportionality between the net radiation and incoming or observed solar radiation french et al 2017 the method is more accurate on days with clear sky and the estimates are reasonable for mid day observations colaizzi et al 2006 french et al 2007 daily eta from direct rc and solar radiation ratio are denoted as etd direct rc and etd rn rs respectively as illustrated in fig 3 2 7 soil water balance eta calculation because actual evapotranspiration eta is commonly reported on daily interval 24 h it was paramount to have daily eta from soil water balance which would also allow a fair comparison with daily tseb eta for different scaling methods however calculated eta eq 16 with soil water balance and neutron measurements occurred once a week and matched well with weekly neutron reading intervals therefore weekly neutron soil water balance eta i e weekly swb eta was used to determine neutron based crop coefficient i e weekly kcr by dividing it by cumulative alfalfa reference evapotranspiration etr between the weekly neutron measurement days as summarized in eq 17 thereafter daily kcr values were determined by interpolating weekly kcr to daily intervals between neutron measurement days by fitting a fourth order polynomial function while using cumulative growing degree days cgdds colaizzi et al 2017 rudnick and irmak 2014 when calculating gdds considered base temperature i e minimum threshold air temperature was 10 c which must be exceeded for the maize crop to grow whereas 30 c was selected as the upper temperature threshold for the selected maize hybrid and for the study area finally daily swb eta was calculated using fao56 single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 as a product of daily kcr and daily etr following asce 2005 16 et c p i u ro dp s where eta mm is actual

growing season in 2020 was a drought year with the highest evapotranspiration demand occurring in august precipitation from may 1 to sept 30 was 198 9 mm which necessitated the need for irrigation the full and deficit treatments received a total irrigation of 244 and 146 mm respectively precipitation and irrigation events are presented in fig 4 along with total water in the 1 5 m soil profile the first θv measurement was collected at the v4 growth stage on june 5 where soil water in the 1 5 m profile was at approximately 91 3 of fc however due to lack of precipitation and high evaporative demand soil water status gradually reduced throughout the growing season with the rainfed treatment reaching pwp fig 4 it is interesting to note that during the vegetative stage in july the irrigation amount applied for fully irrigated maize matched well with evaporative demand enabling the soil water content to be maintained above a maximum allowable depletion mad of 50 in contrast during the reproductive stage starting in the month of august the irrigation capacity of about 20 mm supplied per irrigation event on two scheduling days i e mondays and thursdays per week for the fully irrigated treatment failed to satisfy crop water demand therefore as presented in fig 4 soil water content of the fully irrigated treatment dropped below a mad of 50 failing to be a fully managed treatment but rather act as a deficit treatment consequently the first four sensing campaign days were under fully irrigated maize as intended whereas the last two days were under deficit conditions on the other hand differences in leaf area index lai and plant height were district across treatments whereby rainfed treatment had the least lai and shorter plants compared to irrigated treatments fully irrigated maize had greater lai values as well as the maximum height than the deficit irrigated maize in general the peak lai in the mid season was 5 3 6 2 and 6 5 m2 m 2 whereas maximum hc was 2 2 3 1 and 3 6 m under rainfed deficit and full irrigation respectively 3 2 measured radiometric temperatures in irrigated and non irrigated maize radiometric temperatures measured by stationary irts varied across treatments over a diurnal trend for the field sensing campaign except for the last sensing day aug 21 as observed in fig 5 there were small differences in diurnal tr values across all treatments on aug 21 fig 5d indicating convergence of stress levels among treatments comparing tr by growth stage from vegetative stages v9 vt for days july 13 31 fig 5b fig 5c and fig 5d to early reproductive stages r1 r2 for day aug 7 fig 5e separation between temperatures was observed among treatments under daytime hours due to soil water differences and responsiveness of the crop to evaporative demand through aggressive water uptake therefore the magnitudes of tr reduced as maize approached full canopy closure and very low at full canopy since almost all the readings were for canopy temperatures tc for each treatment daily tr was greater in rainfed than both deficit and full irrigated treatments mid day hours 1200 1600 hr had peak tr from 33 2 to 35 8 c in rainfed 31 1 32 3 c in deficit irrigated and 29 4 31 8 c in fully irrigated maize across all sensing campaign days observed maximum peak tr values were close to what was reported by colaizzi et al 2017 who used wireless irts dynamax inc houston texas mounted on a center pivot above maize in bushland tx 3 3 scaling one point of day radiometric temperatures for field sensing campaigns there were differences in measured tr s and scaled temperatures tr m across treatments as well as scaling options i e different sources of reference temperatures from full irrigated deficit irrigated and rainfed treatments focusing on the proper scaling when using reference curve from fully irrigated treatment fig 6 small differences were observed during dawn daylight hours 0700 1800 hr in both deficit and fully irrigated maize thus producing mean absolute errors ranging between 0 2 1 0 c and 1 0 1 5 c in fully and deficit irrigated treatments respectively during sunrise and sunset hours such results support the use of reference temperatures from a non stressed canopy as also recommended by peters and evett 2004 for use in time scaling of a single tr measurement from a remote location under same scaling however rainfed treatment exhibited larger errors where the differences in tr extremely increased at both predawn and dusk hours and errors ranged between 2 0 5 0 c conversely further increase in temperature errors were evident when stressed treatment temperatures from deficit and rainfed treatment were used as reference temperatures for scaling data not shown a common observation also highlighted by peters and evett 2004 hence obtained errors were as high as 8 0 c at predawn hours whereas during the dusk hours the errors ranged from 2 0 to 5 0 c when rainfed reference temperatures were employed in general larger errors were more pronounced during both predawn and dusk hours as shown in fig 6 however exceptionally higher in a rainfed treatment across the entire day while performing the scaling calculations it was observed that larger errors might have propagated from the greater magnitudes of differences between tr m t single point measurement to be scaled and tr s t reference temperature within the stressed treatments especially rainfed compared to a non stressed treatment under fully irrigated management for those reasons the accuracy of the time scaling of one point of day tr among a stressed treatment like rainfed canopy might have been impacted as reflected in final scaled temperatures versus the actual measured temperatures 3 4 soil water balance eta calculations daily swb eta which varied between treatments were determined using fitted crop coefficient equations on weekly single crop coefficients and cumulative growing degree days cgdds as presented in fig 7 peak crop coefficients kcr for all treatments occurred in mid season at cumulative growing degree days cgdds between 600 and 1100 c where the average kcr were 0 99 0 80 and 0 74 in full deficit and rainfed treatments respectively seasonal swb eta which was summed from weekly eta values varied from 596 mm in full irrigation to 516 and 426 mm in deficit irrigation and rainfed treatments respectively daily eta estimated over months with neutron soil moisture measurements june 5 to sept 6 ranged between 1 0 and 12 1 mm with averages of 7 0 6 8 and 4 6 mm in full deficit and rainfed treatments respectively in addition the maximum registered daily eta estimate was obtained in full 7 4 mm followed by deficit 5 2 mm irrigated maize 3 5 tseb modeled temperatures latent and sensible heat fluxes at canopy and soil surfaces as it is typical with a two source energy balance tseb model the radiometric temperature tr measured with the infrared thermometers irts must be separated into two temperature components including canopy temperature tc fig 8 and soil temperature ts fig 9 after employing eq 1 under section 2 4 the modeling results indicated that there were differences in temperatures across non water stressed full and deficit irrigated versus water stressed rainfed maize figs 8 9 however the model seemed to have overestimated tc in rainfed treatments especially on june 24 fig 8a july 13 fig 8c and july 31 fig 8d it is therefore not possible to have tc of stressed crop to exceed at most 40 c as observed on those three days in contrast ts seemed realistic across all the treatments as shown in fig 9 furthermore the estimated temperatures were used to quantify the energy balance fluxes at both canopy and soil surfaces and the average values for all the field sensing campaign days are summarized in fig 10 latent heat fluxes at the canopy surface lec were greater in fully irrigated maize followed by deficit irrigated maize and relatively lower in rainfed maize however it was the opposite with the latent heat fluxes at soil surface les similar to les sensible heat fluxes both at the soil hs and canopy hc surfaces were greater in rainfed than in irrigated maize but much lower in fully irrigated maize lec ranged between 666 and 851 612 741 and 228 402 w m 2 in full deficit and rainfed treatments with the same order of treatments les ranged between 58 4 and 91 5 97 1 228 8 and 105 7 304 4 w m 2 sensible heat fluxes for full deficit and rainfed treatment respectively ranged between 17 2 and 152 3 74 6 128 2 85 7 148 5 w m 2 for hs and 5 5 16 4 15 7 48 8 64 1 190 3 w m 2 for hc lastly the mean ground heat fluxes under full deficit and rainfed were 20 0 23 6 26 8 w m 2 respectively 3 6 comparing tseb eta and soil water balance eta daily maize tseb eta was calculated with methods summarized in fig 3 and table 1 therefore fig 11 shows the results of obtained eta values on the six field sensing campaigns between the scaling methods and soil water balance swb smaller differences in daily eta 0 0 1 6 mm were seen on some field sensing campaign days with methods such as sc ef o ef m and rn rs however larger differences 2 4 3 0 mm were seen with kc m followed by kc o and direct rc as shown in figs 11a b mean eta were calculated across all the field sensing campaign days as well as the methods and presented in fig 11c therefore it can be observed that most methods except direct rc had their mean eta close to that of swb with only difference of 0 4 mm fig 11c table 2 however under deficit treatment both ef o and direct rc had greater differences which ranged between 1 8 and 3 1 mm table 2 in contrast ef m and direct rc overestimated eta under rainfed treatment with relatively larger difference 2 4 3 9 mm when compared to swb nonetheless overestimation across all treatments were observed with direct rc as compared to others which was more evident especially in rainfed maize fig 11c therefore this method failed to provide a clear separation of eta values between stressed and non stressed treatments interestingly both evaporative factor methods reported similar values across all treatments fig 11c table 2 even though the modified one did not consider ground heat flux g in the computations implying that g might be less sensitive to calculated eta overall temperature scaling in sc had less influence on the outcome of calculated eta among full and deficit irrigated treatments as compared to rainfed treatment since the calculated mean eta values were in close agreement with those of swb furthermore regression relationships of daily tseb eta from scaling methods against swb eta were developed as shown in fig 12 method sc proved to be powerful in estimating daily eta in comparison to swb than all other upscaling eta methods therefore the developed relationships i e etd sc vs swb eta were stronger in full r2 0 52 and deficit r2 0 48 irrigated treatments than in rainfed treatment r2 0 16 as summarized in table 2 even still aggregating all the data from all the three treatments sc still had a better relationship with r2 0 51 than other scaling methods where kc m r2 0 09 exhibited very poor correlation table 2 fig 12 in addition sc showed a clear distinction between achieved eta values from irrigated versus non irrigated treatments implying that it was sensitive to the water stresses imposed with smaller rmse of 0 9 mm d 1 in fully irrigated maize as presented in table 2 as shown in fig 12 other methods except kc m showed some promising correlation against swb on some occasions but greatly had poor relationships across irrigated and rainfed treatments with r2 ranging between 0 02 and 0 38 with even high rmse values 1 mm d 1 and high mae 1 mm d 1 table 2 therefore larger discrepancies were evident in the instantaneous eta upscaling methods as compared to the one time of day tr scaling sc method 4 discussion 4 1 tseb model coupled with irts on movable platforms there is an opportunity to improve precision irrigation water management by mounting thermal infrared sensors like irts or thermal cameras on linear or center pivot sprinkler systems or any other mobile sensing platform similar to what was used in this study this study has demonstrated that one time of day tr from mobile irts can be used to provide daily eta with different scaling options the tseb model is a very useful and powerful model which uses tr in addition to weather and plant parameters to provide reliable eta data over different vegetation cover types liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 colaizzi et al 2012 sánchez et al 2008 it is worth noting that the current study did not evaluate or validate the daily tseb eta from different scaling methods due to lack of standard eta measurement instruments i e lysimeters eddy covariance these instruments provide ground truth eta measurements and more accurate but instead a soil water balance with kc curve fitting was used as a proxy to the actual eta as similarly done by colaizzi et al 2017 it is therefore not surprising that most studies have used standard methods to evaluate two source energy balance because they are accurate and provide reliable eta data liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 on the other hand tr can be obtained from either stationary or mobile irts to calculate eta with tseb each setup has its pros and cons for instance one of the pros of the stationary irts unlike mobile irts is that it can minimize uncertainties with accuracy of the measurements due to spatial variability in canopy size plant height lai and soil moisture distribution under scenarios of heterogeneous textural properties of the field and it can also provide daily and continuous measurements colaizzi et al 2017 on the other side they are limited on spatial field coverage or resolution which makes mobile irts a better option in this regard colaizzi et al 2017 however scaling techniques are always needed to obtain daily eta estimates from one in time tr measurements collected by mobile irts for easier irrigation scheduling or characterization of crop response it can now be argued that information on the performance of different scaling methods under water stress conditions is very beneficial first to guide on selection of scaling method and second know the data requirements in terms of equipment or resources 4 2 radiometric temperature time scaling time scaling method sc is more intricate compared to other methods since a continously measured non stressed canopy serves as the reference to scale one point of day tr measurements to other remote locations of the field therefore according to the preliminary results data not shown after using stressed treatments both deficit and rainfed as reference temperatures larger magnitudes of errors 2 8 c were observed as also observed by peters and evett 2004 thus the reference canopy surface should never be stressed to achieve greater accuracy with time scaling method reference temperatures from a fully irrigated crop should be used colaizzi et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2017 peters and evett 2004 however in real application it is very difficult to maintain non stressed conditions even with fully irrigated treatment during a severe drought in a growing season kullberg et al 2017 in addition there could be obvious stresses contributed by very high air temperatures as well as disease infestation kullberg et al 2017 so someone should be careful if sc is to be used for daily tseb eta calculations the solution is maybe to perform the time scaling procedure with use of machine learning techniques which has not been explored yet and a potential area for future research nonetheless it is claimed that errors in scaled temperatures could be minimized if measurements are taken at a specific time preferably soon after sunset or solar noon hours colaizzi et al 2017 peters and evett 2004 however this was not investigated in the current research and could be considered in future research comparing measured and scaled temperatures under same treaments on six field sensing campaign days average errors were less in non stressed treatment i e full 0 2 1 0 c compared to stressed treatments i e deficit 1 0 1 5 c and rainfed 2 0 1 5 c overall observed errors are assumed to have propagated from spatial variability of soil water content due to observed soil textural differences along the soil profile and across the experimental field however the errors due to sensor angle effects were avoided by having four apogee irts whose temperatures were averaged to nullify errors from sensor orientation peters and evett 2008 furthermore the existence of larger errors with stressed treatments more so in rainfed indicates that sc method might be more beneficial in irrigated management strategies where water stress is less likely to happen 4 3 effect of water stress conditions on energy balance components greater impacts of water stress are visible in maize with varied irrigation levels from fully irrigated to deficit irrigated amounts and much distinct in a rainfed maize the changes can be reflected in the differences between physical characteristics such as leaf area index lai plant height hc fractional canopy cover fc all of which influence the energy balance components and their separations at both canopy and soil surfaces colaizzi et al 2016 moreover same parameters are one which mainly determine the energy fluxes calculated by the tseb model fig 10 basically the higher the fc the greater the lai which implies that the incoming solar radiation is more intercepted at the canopy surface than at the soil surface diarra et al 2017 likewise the larger percentage of the net radiation rn which contributes to the available energy for generating fluxes ends at the canopy surface and less penetrates through the canopy to contribute to fluxes at and below the soil surface therefore under irrigated conditions with less or no water stress greater canopy transpiration rates are observed hence more available energy evaporates the water through the canopy stomates contributing to higher latent heat fluxes at the canopy lec and lesser sensible heat fluxes at the canopy hc heated dry and hot air in addition lesser latent heat les and sensible heat hs fluxes at the soil surface as well as ground heat fluxes g can also be observed fig 10 however this is contrary to when severe water stress conditions are experienced especially under extreme deficit irrigated and rainfed maize with low lai and fc where almost all the available energy goes towards the soil surface but then less is intercepted by the canopy which heats up the dry air above it i e hc in addition even much less is used to evaporate water on the canopy lec due to low transpiration rates attributed to inadequate soil moisture content rajan et al 2015 according to heilman et al 2009 it was found out that le dropped to 4 and h increased by 94 during severe water stress in simple terms le dominates under low stress whereas h dominates when there is high water stress therefore it is worth noting that all the results from tseb flux modeling under different water stress scenarios as summarised in fig 10 supports the above explanation of how water stress impacts energy fluxes and energy partitioning even though there could be uncertainties of flux partitioning since a constant parameter fraction of energy reaching soil rns and g was assumed and it can vary depending on soil type moisture conditions and vegetation cover diarra et al 2017 other uncertainties are associated with input data for tseb and estimation of rn such as temperatures emissivity albedo and the scaling approach method for daily estimation of fluxes diarra et al 2017 4 4 performance of daily tseb eta against swb eta as mentioned earlier six instantaneous eta upscaling methods were used as well as one radiometric time scaling tr approach making a total of seven methods to find daily tseb eta using a one point of day tr from mobile irts the differences in mean eta calculated by swb and tseb ranged between 0 2 and 1 6 mm among methods i e sc ef o ef m rn rs except kc o kc m and direct rc as seen in fig 11c and table 2 most accurate method was sc with even stronger correlations with swb in irrigated treatments r2 0 5 and worst in rainfed treatment r2 0 2 table 2 on that note this method exhibited separation between eta due to varied water stresses hence it is very sensitive to water stress while comparing calculated eta with scaled mobile versus non scaled stationary tr smaller differences were observed in irrigated treatments 0 5 1 0 mm d 1 and higher in rainfed 2 2 mm d 1 implying that the scaling method is less likely to impact the model performance under irrigated conditions because maize crop under irrigated settings received sufficient water early in the season causing uniform canopy establishment thus less uncertainties from spatial variability in canopy size as compared to rainfed colaizzi et al 2017 same discrepancies were also seen by colaizzi et al 2014 and concluded that time scaling can have less influence on the accuracy of tseb when compared to swb in general the accuracy of the sc method is more driven by soil water conditions and spatial differences in soil moisture all influenced by soil texture differences in managed field on the other hand instantaneous eta upscaling methods showed promising results when estimating daily eta derived from tseb however the correlation relationships were poor when compared to swb eta nevertheless ef m ef o and rn rs provided acceptable and very close daily eta as it was with sc on most field sensing campaign days fig 11 table 2 overall the root mean square error rmse ranged between 1 7 and 3 9 mm d 1 among six methods which showed very large discrepancies it is worthwhile to report that the three methods ef o ef m and rn rs performed better than others and their performances were closely comparable to that of sc with their rmses being 1 6 mm d 1 thus they can be considered for daily eta calculations in case there is a problem of establishing a non stressed or fully irrigated crop to provide reference temperature if sc approach is to be employed surprisingly the comparisons between tseb eta with the best scaling methods i e sc ef m ef o and rn rs and swb yielded rmse close to what was obtained by other studies liang et al 2021 diarra et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2017 song et al 2016 morillas et al 2013 among the reported studies which had similar series resistance tseb as this study but also compared the results to swb obtained rmses which ranged between 0 5 and 1 6 mm d 1 french et al 2015 and 1 5 1 8 mm d 1 colaizzi et al 2017 overall the discrepancies as errors reflected by rmse and mae from this study might not solely be due to underperformances of the scaling models but rather due to propagated errors from the used eta models tseb and swb for this study growth stage might also have impacted the accuracy of tseb which was not a surprise since the model is recommended for eta or le estimations at partial canopy closure as well as changes in radiative properties of the canopy surfaces due to senescence at later stages which were not accounted for diarra et al 2017 however in this study tseb was employed for the most part of the partial canopy stages to early days of full canopy closure growth stages according to colaizzi et al 2017 spatial variability in micro climate can impact tseb mainly ta and rs as well as swb particularly p especially when the weather station is located at some distance away from the experimentation field for that case temporal variations in precipitation colaizzi et al 2017 in addition to heterogeneity of soil texture and water holding capacities colaizzi et al 2017 makes it difficult to have accurate swb eta values as close to the ground truth measurements when lysimeters or eddy covariance systems are used furthermore the modeled daily eta from the weekly kc and cgdds might also have contributed to discrepancies the assumption that eta is most dependent on cgdds might not be true in some circumstances even though it is known to be the main driving growth factor in the maize crop 4 5 practical considerations for field applications and future directions the study showed the applicability of different upscaling methods to provide reliable eta data which could be helpful in irrigation scheduling and management mobile irts can indeed be used to provide tr coupled with tseb model to obtain eta estimates interestingly thermal imaging techniques can also be used with similar scaling methods to calculate eta this research can benefit producers since it can be applied in irrigation scheduling at both partial and full canopy closure by using the proposed scaling methods selection of scaling method will depend on ease of data collection for instance in this study sc was the best performing method but requires reference tr measurements from a location under non water limiting conditions which might be less achievable in real life applications due to severe drought or disease infestation a potential solution is to develop a locally calibrated scaling model based on machine learning techniques or to deploy alternative models such as ef and rn rs which only require climate data to upscale instantaneous eta to daily intervals future research will explore tr time scaling using machine learning algorithms preferred measurement time window for accurate scaling of tr and combination of scaling methods to address local conditions 5 conclusion there is huge potential of using mobile irts mounted on ground based mobile platforms to provide information about crop water stress and water use however these irts only provide one time of day measurements and the scaling mechanisms are required to develop daily estimates of eta or crop water stress estimation indices from the results scaling one time of day tr approach sc outperformed all other models as validated by swb however daily average eta from other methods such as ef o ef m and rn rs were in close agreement with swb on specific field sensing campaign days i e june 24 july 31 aug 7 and aug 21 where differences ranged between 0 2 1 6 mm statistical analysis suggested that tseb model might be more accurate in non water limiting conditions e g full irrigation and less reliable in water limited environments e g rainfed with no irrigation or deficit irrigation to overcome such shortfalls model performance must be improved under water stressed conditions experienced in water limited regions furthermore this study has provided insights of how mobile irts coupled with two source energy balance model can provide daily eta estimates to support irrigation scheduling however careful selection of the scaling method is advised since all of them have shown differences in reported daily eta values and some have performed better than others future research will include the performance assessment of the scaling methods with respect to accurate eta measurements from eddy covariance system or lysimeter which are more accurate than swb method other future priority will include establishing a robust validation criterion for the tseb model under highly stressed conditions e g rainfed in an arid or semi arid environment to improve the accuracy of eta estimation lastly fusion of mobile irts and thermal imaging for both radiometric and canopy temperature measurements will be considered to manage irrigation scheduling at partial and full canopy growth stages in field experimental plots as a way of tackling poor

9261,mobile infrared thermometers irts mounted on moving platforms provide one time of day radiometric measurements tr which can be used to calculate instantaneous actual evapotranspiration eta using the two source energy balance tseb model however irrigation scheduling decisions utilize daily eta estimates hence the need for time scaling this study evaluated different upscaling methods to calculate daily maize eta using one time of day tr under varying water stress conditions mobile irts were mounted on a high clearance mobile sensing platform and collected tr in remote locations under full deficit and rainfed conditions seven scaling methods via two pathways were employed to obtain daily eta first pathway was scaling one time of day tr sc whereas the second pathway involved use of

ratio rn rs and all were compared to a neutron based soil water balance swb determined eta from the results sc outperformed other methods in comparison to swb eta across all the selected treatments with smaller discrepancies and lower rmse 0 9 1 7 mm d 1 vs 0 7 4 3 mm d 1 for other methods furthermore methods including sc ef o ef m and rn rs had their daily average eta values in close agreement to swb eta with mean eta differences ranging between 0 2 and 1 6 mm d 1 overall sc method performed better in fully irrigated maize r2 0 52 rmse 0 9 mm d 1 than in deficit irrigated maize r2 0 48 rmse 1 4 mm d 1 but worst in rainfed maize r2 0 16 rmse 1 7 mm d 1 this implies that sc is more suited for irrigated rather than rainfed settings importantly the choice of any method depends on data

while there is increased use of infrared thermometers irts mounted on moving platforms to determine water stress and eta there are still challenges of establishing daily estimates from one point of day measurements thus requiring accurate time scaling methods o shaughnessy et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2017 peters and evett 2008 2004 nonetheless according to peters and evett 2004 single point of day temperature can be time scaled based on hypothesis that any measured temperature from any remote location in the field can be modeled to daily patterns using reference temperatures which are constantly measured from a well irrigated crop under non water limiting conditions interestingly application of automated irrigation scheduling based on plant water stress feedback using mobile irts boarding an irrigation system i e center pivots has already been demonstrated to simplify irrigation scheduling decisions o shaughnessy et al 2020 2017 2015 peters and evett 2008 under this system time temperature threshold ttt has been used to monitor water stress and used as a scheduling tool in comparison to neutron probe soil water measurements and it performed better with respect to achieved yields and water use efficiency in soybeans peters and evett 2008 single tc s were scaled into diurnal pattern with time scaling approach peters and evett 2004 then irrigation triggering threshold was set at 30 c above which water stress was expected likewise with similar system integrated crop water stress index icwsi using time scaled tc has also been used as plant water stress feedback then coupled with soil moisture sensing as soil water stress feedback for variable rate irrigation applications in row crops such as corn sorghum and cotton o shaughnessy et al 2020 2017 2015 furthermore colaizzi et al 2017 used similar irrigation system to collect single point tr from remote locations then scaled to find daily eta estimate using tseb which was compared against soil water balance swb eta and yielded a root mean square error rmse ranging between 1 5 and 1 8 mm d 1 two source energy balance tseb model accounts for two separate energy budgets soil and crop canopy from which evaporation and transpiration are respectively estimated chirouze et al 2014 norman et al 1995 previous research has demonstrated the reliability of tseb for estimating eta with most studies reporting a rmse of less than 2 mm d 1 diarra et al 2017 song et al 2016 xia et al 2016 semmens et al 2016 french et al 2015 morillas et al 2013 one of the main data requirements of tseb model is the radiometric temperature tr which can be measured in different ways with use of different platforms under a wide range of spatial scales such platforms include mobile irts as employed by colaizzi et al 2017 stationary irts liang et al 2021 sánchez et al 2008 song et al 2016 kustas and norman 1999 satellites diarra et al 2017 semmens et al 2016 french et al 2015 unmanned aerial vehicles uavs xia et al 2016 hoffmann et al 2016 each of these platforms has unique strengths and weaknesses for example current satellites provide coarse and less frequent thermal images whereas uavs can provide fine resolution thermal images from each on demand flight however uavs are limited in terms of payload capacity battery life and flight regulations and are incapable of the spatial extent of satellites hence such considerations have contributed to the use of stationary irts for point based measurements liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 colaizzi et al 2012 sánchez et al 2008 however to address spatial limitations of stationary irts colaizzi et al 2017 suggested use of wireless irts boarded on a center pivot to measure tr in bushland texas usa because irt sensors mounted on a moving platform such as a center pivot only provide one time of day tr time scaling methods must be employed to compute daily eta over different vegetation cover types colaizzi et al 2006 2014 2017 chávez et al 2008 even though colaizzi et al 2006 2014 explored the estimation of daily eta using different scaling methods for both stationary tr and instantaneous eta still assessing the performance of similar and other models yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 relative to tr scaling method colaizzi et al 2014 2017 under varying water stress is desired colaizzi et al 2014 performed evaluation of some methods in fully irrigated conditions of cotton in a semi arid climate however considering their performance under varying water stress different crop types and climates is also necessary furthermore while the combination of tseb and mobile irts on a center pivot for daily eta estimation was successful in southern great plains of usa colaizzi et al 2017 validation in other regions like west central nebraska is needed to assess the transferability of this technique to other regions therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of tseb model and seven scaling methods i e one tr time scaling and six instantaneous eta scaling methods in computing daily eta under varying water stress conditions for irrigated and non irrigated maize while using mobile irts mounted on a high clearance mobile sensing platform in west central nebraska usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental layout the study was conducted during the 2020 growing season at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research extension and education center wcreec in north platte nebraska usa 41 1 n 100 8 w 861 m above sea level north platte has a semi arid climate with 80 of annual

et al 1999 the investigated treatments included full irrigation deficit irrigation receiving 60 of the full irrigation treatment s depth and rainfed no irrigation the field was irrigated using a subsurface drip system with driplines installed every 1 52 m at a depth of 0 4 m irrigation events were triggered when the full irrigation treatment reached 50 of maximum allowable depletion measured by calibrated neutron moisture meters nmm application depths included 20 and 12 mm for full and deficit irrigation respectively seasonal irrigation totals for full and deficit irrigated treatments were 244 and 146 mm respectively the experimental layout was a randomized complete block design and three replications for each treatment were considered where each plot had dimensions of 9 1 by 72 2

sensing platform and measurements a high clearance mobile sensing platform i e a high tractor fig 1 was used to collect one time of day radiometric temperatures tr throughout the study on six field sensing campaign days i e june 24 july 3 july 13 july 31 aug 7 and aug 21 the platform was equipped with an extendable and height adjustable boom mounted with four apogee si 1h1 infrared thermometers irts apogee instruments logan utah usa four active spectral sensors i e crop circle acs 430 holland scientific lincoln nebraska usa and an external differential gps dgps receiver holland scientific lincoln nebraska usa orientation of sensors on the platform is illustrated in fig 1 sensors were maintained at a height of 1 m above the canopy for all field sensing campaigns apogee irts were pointed towards the canopy at 45 zenith angle whereas spectral sensors were positioned at nadir view above crop row before tassel and in inter rows after tassel the sensing platform travelled parallel to the plant rows at a speed of 1 0 m s 1 and two interior rows were sensed at mid day under clear sky where ta ranged between 31 and 32 c the tr was measured every 0 5 s and stored on cr1000x datalogger campbell scientific logan utah usa spectral sensors measured spectral reflectance at 670 730 and 780 nm collected every 0 2 s and stored on geoscout x dataloggers holland scientific lincoln nebraska

were installed in three plots or replicates for each treatment on june 17 pointed at 45 zenith angle in the northeast direction and adjusted to 1 m above the canopy either weekly or bi weekly during the 2020 maize growing season daily and continuous radiometric tr measurements were recorded every 6 s then averaged to 1 min and logged to cr1000x dataloggers campbell scientific logan utah usa these sensors as likewise with mobile irts were factory calibrated by apogee instruments before installing them in the three plots of each treatment i e full deficit and rainfed soil volumetric water content θv was measured at depths of 0 15 2 75 m at increments of 0 30 m using both cpn 503 elite hydroprobe and cpn 503dr neutron moisture meters nmms instrotek concord california usa the conversion from count ratios to θv was based upon a local gravimetric calibration with r2 of 0 98 and rmse of 0 010 m3 m 3 lo et al 2020 furthermore two aluminum access tubes were installed around healthy plants on either side of the crop row one tube at 0 15 m and the other at 0 57 m from the drip tape to well capture the soil water dynamics in each treatment replicate or plot the average values of neutron readings between the two tubes were used to calculate eta with a soil water balance model leaf area index lai was measured using lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln nebraska usa on plants close to the tubes while taking four readings around 0600 hr either on or near days for sensing campaigns likewise plant height hc was measured on random six plants using a 4 m telescopic post with 0 1 m markings meteorological data was collected every minute from an onsite weather station monitored by nebraska climate office https mesonet unl edu within 100 m from experimentation site collected data included air temperature ta c relative humidity rh solar radiation rs w m 2 wind speed u3 m s 1 and precipitation p mm windspeed was adjusted to 2 m from measurement height of 3 m and vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from ta and rh both following allen et al 1998 2 4 processing radiometric measurements spatial filtering and averaging of tr values from mobile irts was done within a clipped length of 10 7 m in the middle of each plot by using microsoft excel s visual basic microsoft corporation redmond washington usa and open source geoprocessing software qgis desktop 3 12 3 qgis developers gruet switzerland used tr values for further tseb eta calculations were the average of median values for each of the four apogee irts from range of extracted values in the middle of each plot also spatial variability across plots were determined by computing standard deviations among the measured tr values on the other hand tr collected from stationary irts in three treatments i e full deficit and rainfed were averaged at 15 min timestep over a 24 h period however irt readings from one rainfed plot were excluded due to data skips following cable damage after it was chewed by rodents 2 5 two source energy balance eta calculation a modified two source energy balance tseb model with series resistance network fig 2 was used in this study song et al 2016 series resistance has been reported to perform better than the parallel approach under different environmental conditions kool et al 2021 the model partitions tr into canopy tc and soil surface ts temperatures eq 1 the fraction of vegetation cover fc viewed by the irt sensor at a zenith view angle is related to tc and ts whereby contributions of each of these temperatures are proportional to fc and 1 fc respectively eq 1 computation procedure of using the tseb model to estimate eta was summarized in six steps as shown in fig 2 1 t r 4 f c t c 4 1 f c t s 4 there are three key assumptions in the model first in step 2 fig 2 the initial estimate of latent heat flux at the canopy lec was determined by assuming a well transpiring canopy using eq 2 norman et al 1995 second an optimization process blue region in fig 2 was applied since les 0 is not a physical solution under daytime conditions which implies condensation of water vapor at the soil surface under dry convective conditions agam et al 2010 the priestley taylor parameter αpt was iteratively reduced until les 0 to reflect canopy stress conditions agam et al 2010 third initial tc was computed using a parallel resistance approach since this pathway is simple and allows easy computation for tc liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 as defined in eq 3 finally eta is computed from the total latent heat fluxes which are calculated as the sum of the latent heat fluxes le at both canopy i e transpiration and soil surfaces i e evaporation i e λ et c le les lec 2 le c pt f g γ r nc where lec is the latent heat flux at canopy αpt is the priestley taylor parameter and was assumed to be 1 26 fg is the fraction of green vegetation which can transpire and equal to 1 kpa c 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve γ kpa c 1 is the psychrometric constant and rnc w m 2 is the net radiation at the canopy 3 t c t a r a ρ c p le c r nc where tc k is canopy temperature ta k is air temperature ra s m 1 is aerodynamic resistance ρ 1000 kg m3 is density of water and cp 1013 j kg 1 k 1 is specific heat capacity of air it is worth noting that the net radiation was not measured but estimated by following the procedure from french et al 2015 and ortega farias et al 2010 while using eq 4 4 r n 1 r s ε a σ t a 4 ε r σ t r 4 where rs w m 2 is the incoming solar radiation α 0 23 is the surface albedo σ 5 67 10 8wm 2 k is stefan boltzmann constant ε a s m 1 is the hemispherical longwave atmospheric emissivity and ε r is the surface emissivity 0 98 ortega farias et al 2010 2 6 estimating daily tseb eta with different scaling methods as presented in fig 3 there are two different pathways of how daily eta is calculated from tseb fig 2 from collected one time of day tr measurements using setup in fig 1 1 scaling one time of day tr to diurnal tr and 2 upscaling methods of instantaneous eta eta on daily timestep is desired for easy use in irrigation scheduling or comparing to validation methods such as conventional methods i e soil water balance model or standard and more accurate methods i e lysimeters and eddy covariance conversely from both pathways total latent heat fluxes le are calculated as sum of estimated les and lec from tseb model i e le λ et a les lec scaling of one time of day tr to diurnal pattern can be performed by using a method developed by peters and evett 2004 sc which convincingly performed well when it was used by colaizzi et al 2017 and peters and evett 2008 peters and evett 2004 suggested that single point measurement i e trm t from a remote location can be scaled relative to measured reference temperatures tr s from a fully irrigated crop where water is non limiting i e no water stress using eq 5 table 1 daily eta is obtained as sum of eta values of scaled tr on 15 min interval over a 24 hr period using eq 6 table 1 total latent heat fluxes le are obtained as the sum of latent fluxes at both canopy and soil surfaces i e le lec les colaizzi et al 2017 the daily eta calculated with sc is denoted as etd sc fig 3 the other six instantaneous eta scaling methods to daily eta majority of them have been extensively used in finding satellite daily eta estimates i e etd where estimated instantaneous total latent energy fluxes λ eti or crop evapotranspiration eti are upscaled to daily estimates over larger spatial scales chávez et al 2008 therefore instantaneous total latent heat fluxes i e lei λ eti lec les in tseb model was calculated as sum of latent heat fluxes from canopy and soil surfaces colaizzi et al 2017 at the tr measurement time many of the used scaling methods associate etd to a factor which is assumed to be constant during the day yan et al 2022 the factor can be represented as a ratio between eti at a specific time of the day to a reference variable which is computed daily yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 such factors include evaporative factor ef crop coefficient kc non dynamic constant direct canopy resistance direct rc and finally solar radiation ratio rn rs evaporative factor ef method is the ratio of instantaneous total latent heat fluxes λ eti to the available energy rn g yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2006 there are two ef methods original method which considers daily mean value of g i e ef o eq 7 table 1 and modified method which assumes daily mean value of g to be zero i e ef m eq 8 table 1 therefore daily eta i e etd from both methods is estimated using eq 9 table 1 and denoted as etd ef o and etd ef m for original and modified evaporative factor respectively as illustrated in fig 3 crop coefficient kc method has been recommended by different researchers since it can easily interpolate λ eti to λ etd yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2006 it is the ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration based on short reference crop grass following original penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 there are two different crop coefficient methods original eq 10 and modified eq 11 and they differ how the resistances are computed as indicated in table 1 yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 modified crop coefficient method was developed since constant canopy resistance rc might not apply to a crop under study but only to a reference crop and it is assumed that daily rc varies due to variability in weather conditions yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 so in the original penman monteith equation dynamic rc is considered instead of constant rc yan et al 2022 todorovic 1999 for original coefficient constant rc is used in the original penman monteith equation daily eta from both methods is estimated using eq 12 table 1 which is denoted as etd kc o for original crop coefficient approach and etd kc m for modified crop coefficient approach fig 3 direct canopy resistance direct rc method assumes a constant rc as the suitable factor for scaling λ eti direct rc is computed by inverting the original penman monteith equation as shown in eq 13 table 1 yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 daily eta i e etd is calculated using eq 14 table 1 on the other hand solar radiation ratio method rn rs uses both evaporative factor ef which is assumed to be constant throughout the day as well as ratio of net to incoming solar radiation i e rn rs to calculate daily eta with eq 15 as shown in table 1 this method assumes a daytime proportionality between the net radiation and incoming or observed solar radiation french et al 2017 the method is more accurate on days with clear sky and the estimates are reasonable for mid day observations colaizzi et al 2006 french et al 2007 daily eta from direct rc and solar radiation ratio are denoted as etd direct rc and etd rn rs respectively as illustrated in fig 3 2 7 soil water balance eta calculation because actual evapotranspiration eta is commonly reported on daily interval 24 h it was paramount to have daily eta from soil water balance which would also allow a fair comparison with daily tseb eta for different scaling methods however calculated eta eq 16 with soil water balance and neutron measurements occurred once a week and matched well with weekly neutron reading intervals therefore weekly neutron soil water balance eta i e weekly swb eta was used to determine neutron based crop coefficient i e weekly kcr by dividing it by cumulative alfalfa reference evapotranspiration etr between the weekly neutron measurement days as summarized in eq 17 thereafter daily kcr values were determined by interpolating weekly kcr to daily intervals between neutron measurement days by fitting a fourth order polynomial function while using cumulative growing degree days cgdds colaizzi et al 2017 rudnick and irmak 2014 when calculating gdds considered base temperature i e minimum threshold air temperature was 10 c which must be exceeded for the maize crop to grow whereas 30 c was selected as the upper temperature threshold for the selected maize hybrid and for the study area finally daily swb eta was calculated using fao56 single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 as a product of daily kcr and daily etr following asce 2005 16 et c p i u ro dp s where eta mm is actual evapotranspiration p mm is precipitation i mm is irrigation u mm is upward water flux into the root zone assumed to be zero since water table is deeper and exceeds rooting depth ro mm is runoff estimated with curve number method usda nrcs 1985 commonly used in swb calculations rudnick and irmak 2014 rudnick et al 2017 dp mm is deep percolation from the root zone estimated using a daily soil water balance method as described in payero et al 2009 and djaman and irmak 2012 and s mm is change in soil water storage measured using nmms 17 k cr et a i 1 n 7 et r i where subscripts i is the number of days between neutron measurements kcr is the weekly crop coefficient eta mm d 1 is the weekly actual evapotranspiration from soil water balance and neutron soil moisture measurements and etr mm d 1 is the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration 2 8 daily tseb eta calculations with different scaling methods as mentioned daily tseb eta determined with two pathways as seen in fig 3 and using equations in table 1 first pathway time scaling tr sc with the daily tseb eta denoted as etd sc was calculated with eqs 5 6 second pathway with six instantaneous eta upscaling methods had daily tseb eta calculated for each method 1 evaporative factor original etd ef o eqs 7 9 modified etd ef m eqs 8 9 2 crop coefficient original etd kc o eqs 10 12 modified etd kc m eqs 11 12 3 direct canopy resistance etd direct rc eqs 13 14 and 4 solar radiation ratio etd rn rs eq 15 2 9 comparison between soil water balance and scaling methods the comparisons included identifying differences in mean eta values among the scaling methods and between the swb furthermore different performance metrics were used during the comparisons which included correlation strength using coefficient of determination r2 eq 18 root mean square error rmse eq 19 and mean absolute error mae eq 20 18 r 2 n o i p i o i p i n o i 2 o i 2 n p i 2 p i 2 19 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 20 mae i 1 n p i o i n where pi is the tseb model predicted eta value oi is the swb model calculated eta value and n is the number of observations 3 results 3 1 irrigation soil moisture measurements and growth parameters maize growing season in 2020 was a drought year with the highest evapotranspiration demand occurring in august precipitation from may 1 to sept 30 was 198 9 mm which necessitated the need for irrigation the full and deficit treatments received a total irrigation of 244 and 146 mm respectively precipitation and irrigation events are presented in fig 4 along with total water in the 1 5 m soil profile the first θv measurement was collected at the v4 growth stage on june 5 where soil water in the 1 5 m profile was at approximately 91 3 of fc however due to lack of precipitation and high evaporative demand soil water status gradually reduced throughout the growing season with the rainfed treatment reaching pwp fig 4 it is interesting to note that during the vegetative stage in july the irrigation amount applied for fully irrigated maize matched well with evaporative demand enabling the soil water content to be maintained above a maximum allowable depletion mad of 50 in contrast during the reproductive stage starting in the month of august the irrigation capacity of about 20 mm supplied per irrigation event on two scheduling days i e mondays and thursdays per week for the fully irrigated treatment failed to satisfy crop water demand therefore as presented in fig 4 soil water content of the fully irrigated treatment dropped below a mad of 50 failing to be a fully managed treatment but rather act as a deficit treatment consequently the first four sensing campaign days were under fully irrigated maize as intended whereas the last two days were under deficit conditions on the other hand differences in leaf area index lai and plant height were district across treatments whereby rainfed treatment had the least lai and shorter plants compared to irrigated treatments fully irrigated maize had greater lai values as well as the maximum height than the deficit irrigated maize in general the peak lai in the mid season was 5 3 6 2 and 6 5 m2 m 2 whereas maximum hc was 2 2 3 1 and 3 6 m under rainfed deficit and full irrigation respectively 3 2 measured radiometric temperatures in irrigated and non irrigated maize radiometric temperatures measured by stationary irts varied across treatments over a diurnal trend for the field sensing campaign except for the last sensing day aug 21 as observed in fig 5 there were small differences in diurnal tr values across all treatments on aug 21 fig 5d indicating convergence of stress levels among treatments comparing tr by growth stage from vegetative stages v9 vt for days july 13 31 fig 5b fig 5c and fig 5d to early reproductive stages r1 r2 for day aug 7 fig 5e separation between temperatures was observed among treatments under daytime hours due to soil water differences and responsiveness of the crop to evaporative demand through aggressive water uptake therefore the magnitudes of tr reduced as maize approached full canopy closure and very low at full canopy since almost all the readings were for canopy temperatures tc for each treatment daily tr was greater in rainfed than both deficit and full irrigated treatments mid day hours 1200 1600 hr had peak tr from 33 2 to 35 8 c in rainfed 31 1 32 3 c in deficit irrigated and 29 4 31 8 c in fully irrigated maize across all sensing campaign days observed maximum peak tr values were close to what was reported by colaizzi et al 2017 who used wireless irts dynamax inc houston texas mounted on a center pivot above maize in bushland tx 3 3 scaling one point of day radiometric temperatures for field sensing campaigns there were differences in measured tr s and scaled temperatures tr m across treatments as well as scaling options i e different sources of reference temperatures from full irrigated deficit irrigated and rainfed treatments focusing on the proper scaling when using reference curve from fully irrigated treatment fig 6 small differences were observed during dawn daylight hours 0700 1800 hr in both deficit and fully irrigated maize thus producing mean absolute errors ranging between 0 2 1 0 c and 1 0 1 5 c in fully and deficit irrigated treatments respectively during sunrise and sunset hours such results support the use of reference temperatures from a non stressed canopy as also recommended by peters and evett 2004 for use in time scaling of a single tr measurement from a remote location under same scaling however rainfed treatment exhibited larger errors where the differences in tr extremely increased at both predawn and dusk hours and errors ranged between 2 0 5 0 c conversely further increase in temperature errors were evident when stressed treatment temperatures from deficit and rainfed treatment were used as reference temperatures for scaling data not shown a common observation also highlighted by peters and evett 2004 hence obtained errors were as high as 8 0 c at predawn hours whereas during the dusk hours the errors ranged from 2 0 to 5 0 c when rainfed reference temperatures were employed in general larger errors were more pronounced during both predawn and dusk hours as shown in fig 6 however exceptionally higher in a rainfed treatment across the entire day while performing the scaling calculations it was observed that larger errors might have propagated from the greater magnitudes of differences between tr m t single point measurement to be scaled and tr s t reference temperature within the stressed treatments especially rainfed compared to a non stressed treatment under fully irrigated management for those reasons the accuracy of the time scaling of one point of day tr among a stressed treatment like rainfed canopy might have been impacted as reflected in final scaled temperatures versus the actual measured temperatures 3 4 soil water balance eta calculations daily swb eta which varied between treatments were determined using fitted crop coefficient equations on weekly single crop coefficients and cumulative growing degree days cgdds as presented in fig 7 peak crop coefficients kcr for all treatments occurred in mid season at cumulative growing degree days cgdds between 600 and 1100 c where the average kcr were 0 99 0 80 and 0 74 in full deficit and rainfed treatments respectively seasonal swb eta which was summed from weekly eta values varied from 596 mm in full irrigation to 516 and 426 mm in deficit irrigation and rainfed treatments respectively daily eta estimated over months with neutron soil moisture measurements june 5 to sept 6 ranged between 1 0 and 12 1 mm with averages of 7 0 6 8 and 4 6 mm in full deficit and rainfed treatments respectively in addition the maximum registered daily eta estimate was obtained in full 7 4 mm followed by deficit 5 2 mm irrigated maize 3 5 tseb modeled temperatures latent and sensible heat fluxes at canopy and soil surfaces as it is typical with a two source energy balance tseb model the radiometric temperature tr measured with the infrared thermometers irts must be separated into two temperature components including canopy temperature tc fig 8 and soil temperature ts fig 9 after employing eq 1 under section 2 4 the modeling results indicated that there were differences in temperatures across non water stressed full and deficit irrigated versus water stressed rainfed maize figs 8 9 however the model seemed to have overestimated tc in rainfed treatments especially on june 24 fig 8a july 13 fig 8c and july 31 fig 8d it is therefore not possible to have tc of stressed crop to exceed at most 40 c as observed on those three days in contrast ts seemed realistic across all the treatments as shown in fig 9 furthermore the estimated temperatures were used to quantify the energy balance fluxes at both canopy and soil surfaces and the average values for all the field sensing campaign days are summarized in fig 10 latent heat fluxes at the canopy surface lec were greater in fully irrigated maize followed by deficit irrigated maize and relatively lower in rainfed maize however it was the opposite with the latent heat fluxes at soil surface les similar to les sensible heat fluxes both at the soil hs and canopy hc surfaces were greater in rainfed than in irrigated maize but much lower in fully irrigated maize lec ranged between 666 and 851 612 741 and 228 402 w m 2 in full deficit and rainfed treatments with the same order of treatments les ranged between 58 4 and 91 5 97 1 228 8 and 105 7 304 4 w m 2 sensible heat fluxes for full deficit and rainfed treatment respectively ranged between 17 2 and 152 3 74 6 128 2 85 7 148 5 w m 2 for hs and 5 5 16 4 15 7 48 8 64 1 190 3 w m 2 for hc lastly the mean ground heat fluxes under full deficit and rainfed were 20 0 23 6 26 8 w m 2 respectively 3 6 comparing tseb eta and soil water balance eta daily maize tseb eta was calculated with methods summarized in fig 3 and table 1 therefore fig 11 shows the results of obtained eta values on the six field sensing campaigns between the scaling methods and soil water balance swb smaller differences in daily eta 0 0 1 6 mm were seen on some field sensing campaign days with methods such as sc ef o ef m and rn rs however larger differences 2 4 3 0 mm were seen with kc m followed by kc o and direct rc as shown in figs 11a b mean eta were calculated across all the field sensing campaign days as well as the methods and presented in fig 11c therefore it can be observed that most methods except direct rc had their mean eta close to that of swb with only difference of 0 4 mm fig 11c table 2 however under deficit treatment both ef o and direct rc had greater differences which ranged between 1 8 and 3 1 mm table 2 in contrast ef m and direct rc overestimated eta under rainfed treatment with relatively larger difference 2 4 3 9 mm when compared to swb nonetheless overestimation across all treatments were observed with direct rc as compared to others which was more evident especially in rainfed maize fig 11c therefore this method failed to provide a clear separation of eta values between stressed and non stressed treatments interestingly both evaporative factor methods reported similar values across all treatments fig 11c table 2 even though the modified one did not consider ground heat flux g in the computations implying that g might be less sensitive to calculated eta overall temperature scaling in sc had less influence on the outcome of calculated eta among full and deficit irrigated treatments as compared to rainfed treatment since the calculated mean eta values were in close agreement with those of swb furthermore regression relationships of daily tseb eta from scaling methods against swb eta were developed as shown in fig 12 method sc proved to be powerful in estimating daily eta in comparison to swb than all other upscaling eta methods therefore the developed relationships i e etd sc vs swb eta were stronger in full r2 0 52 and deficit r2 0 48 irrigated treatments than in rainfed treatment r2 0 16 as summarized in table 2 even still aggregating all the data from all the three treatments sc still had a better relationship with r2 0 51 than other scaling methods where kc m r2 0 09 exhibited very poor correlation table 2 fig 12 in addition sc showed a clear distinction between achieved eta values from irrigated versus non irrigated treatments implying that it was sensitive to the water stresses imposed with smaller rmse of 0 9 mm d 1 in fully irrigated maize as presented in table 2 as shown in fig 12 other methods except kc m showed some promising correlation against swb on some occasions but greatly had poor relationships across irrigated and rainfed treatments with r2 ranging between 0 02 and 0 38 with even high rmse values 1 mm d 1 and high mae 1 mm d 1 table 2 therefore larger discrepancies were evident in the instantaneous eta upscaling methods as compared to the one time of day tr scaling sc method 4 discussion 4 1 tseb model coupled with irts on movable platforms there is an opportunity to improve precision irrigation water management by mounting thermal infrared sensors like irts or thermal cameras on linear or center pivot sprinkler systems or any other mobile sensing platform similar to what was used in this study this study has demonstrated that one time of day tr from mobile irts can be used to provide daily eta with different scaling options the tseb model is a very useful and powerful model which uses tr in addition to weather and plant parameters to provide reliable eta data over different vegetation cover types liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 colaizzi et al 2012 sánchez et al 2008 it is worth noting that the current study did not evaluate or validate the daily tseb eta from different scaling methods due to lack of standard eta measurement instruments i e lysimeters eddy covariance these instruments provide ground truth eta measurements and more accurate but instead a soil water balance with kc curve fitting was used as a proxy to the actual eta as similarly done by colaizzi et al 2017 it is therefore not surprising that most studies have used standard methods to evaluate two source energy balance because they are accurate and provide reliable eta data liang et al 2021 song et al 2016 on the other hand tr can be obtained from either stationary or mobile irts to calculate eta with tseb each setup has its pros and cons for instance one of the pros of the stationary irts unlike mobile irts is that it can minimize uncertainties with accuracy of the measurements due to spatial variability in canopy size plant height lai and soil moisture distribution under scenarios of heterogeneous textural properties of the field and it can also provide daily and continuous measurements colaizzi et al 2017 on the other side they are limited on spatial field coverage or resolution which makes mobile irts a better option in this regard colaizzi et al 2017 however scaling techniques are always needed to obtain daily eta estimates from one in time tr measurements collected by mobile irts for easier irrigation scheduling or characterization of crop response it can now be argued that information on the performance of different scaling methods under water stress conditions is very beneficial first to guide on selection of scaling method and second know the data requirements in terms of equipment or resources 4 2 radiometric temperature time scaling time scaling method sc is more intricate compared to other methods since a continously measured non stressed canopy serves as the reference to scale one point of day tr measurements to other remote locations of the field therefore according to the preliminary results data not shown after using stressed treatments both deficit and rainfed as reference temperatures larger magnitudes of errors 2 8 c were observed as also observed by peters and evett 2004 thus the reference canopy surface should never be stressed to achieve greater accuracy with time scaling method reference temperatures from a fully irrigated crop should be used colaizzi et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2017 peters and evett 2004 however in real application it is very difficult to maintain non stressed conditions even with fully irrigated treatment during a severe drought in a growing season kullberg et al 2017 in addition there could be obvious stresses contributed by very high air temperatures as well as disease infestation kullberg et al 2017 so someone should be careful if sc is to be used for daily tseb eta calculations the solution is maybe to perform the time scaling procedure with use of machine learning techniques which has not been explored yet and a potential area for future research nonetheless it is claimed that errors in scaled temperatures could be minimized if measurements are taken at a specific time preferably soon after sunset or solar noon hours colaizzi et al 2017 peters and evett 2004 however this was not investigated in the current research and could be considered in future research comparing measured and scaled temperatures under same treaments on six field sensing campaign days average errors were less in non stressed treatment i e full 0 2 1 0 c compared to stressed treatments i e deficit 1 0 1 5 c and rainfed 2 0 1 5 c overall observed errors are assumed to have propagated from spatial variability of soil water content due to observed soil textural differences along the soil profile and across the experimental field however the errors due to sensor angle effects were avoided by having four apogee irts whose temperatures were averaged to nullify errors from sensor orientation peters and evett 2008 furthermore the existence of larger errors with stressed treatments more so in rainfed indicates that sc method might be more beneficial in irrigated management strategies where water stress is less likely to happen 4 3 effect of water stress conditions on energy balance components greater impacts of water stress are visible in maize with varied irrigation levels from fully irrigated to deficit irrigated amounts and much distinct in a rainfed maize the changes can be reflected in the differences between physical characteristics such as leaf area index lai plant height hc fractional canopy cover fc all of which influence the energy balance components and their separations at both canopy and soil surfaces colaizzi et al 2016 moreover same parameters are one which mainly determine the energy fluxes calculated by the tseb model fig 10 basically the higher the fc the greater the lai which implies that the incoming solar radiation is more intercepted at the canopy surface than at the soil surface diarra et al 2017 likewise the larger percentage of the net radiation rn which contributes to the available energy for generating fluxes ends at the canopy surface and less penetrates through the canopy to contribute to fluxes at and below the soil surface therefore under irrigated conditions with less or no water stress greater canopy transpiration rates are observed hence more available energy evaporates the water through the canopy stomates contributing to higher latent heat fluxes at the canopy lec and lesser sensible heat fluxes at the canopy hc heated dry and hot air in addition lesser latent heat les and sensible heat hs fluxes at the soil surface as well as ground heat fluxes g can also be observed fig 10 however this is contrary to when severe water stress conditions are experienced especially under extreme deficit irrigated and rainfed maize with low lai and fc where almost all the available energy goes towards the soil surface but then less is intercepted by the canopy which heats up the dry air above it i e hc in addition even much less is used to evaporate water on the canopy lec due to low transpiration rates attributed to inadequate soil moisture content rajan et al 2015 according to heilman et al 2009 it was found out that le dropped to 4 and h increased by 94 during severe water stress in simple terms le dominates under low stress whereas h dominates when there is high water stress therefore it is worth noting that all the results from tseb flux modeling under different water stress scenarios as summarised in fig 10 supports the above explanation of how water stress impacts energy fluxes and energy partitioning even though there could be uncertainties of flux partitioning since a constant parameter fraction of energy reaching soil rns and g was assumed and it can vary depending on soil type moisture conditions and vegetation cover diarra et al 2017 other uncertainties are associated with input data for tseb and estimation of rn such as temperatures emissivity albedo and the scaling approach method for daily estimation of fluxes diarra et al 2017 4 4 performance of daily tseb eta against swb eta as mentioned earlier six instantaneous eta upscaling methods were used as well as one radiometric time scaling tr approach making a total of seven methods to find daily tseb eta using a one point of day tr from mobile irts the differences in mean eta calculated by swb and tseb ranged between 0 2 and 1 6 mm among methods i e sc ef o ef m rn rs except kc o kc m and direct rc as seen in fig 11c and table 2 most accurate method was sc with even stronger correlations with swb in irrigated treatments r2 0 5 and worst in rainfed treatment r2 0 2 table 2 on that note this method exhibited separation between eta due to varied water stresses hence it is very sensitive to water stress while comparing calculated eta with scaled mobile versus non scaled stationary tr smaller differences were observed in irrigated treatments 0 5 1 0 mm d 1 and higher in rainfed 2 2 mm d 1 implying that the scaling method is less likely to impact the model performance under irrigated conditions because maize crop under irrigated settings received sufficient water early in the season causing uniform canopy establishment thus less uncertainties from spatial variability in canopy size as compared to rainfed colaizzi et al 2017 same discrepancies were also seen by colaizzi et al 2014 and concluded that time scaling can have less influence on the accuracy of tseb when compared to swb in general the accuracy of the sc method is more driven by soil water conditions and spatial differences in soil moisture all influenced by soil texture differences in managed field on the other hand instantaneous eta upscaling methods showed promising results when estimating daily eta derived from tseb however the correlation relationships were poor when compared to swb eta nevertheless ef m ef o and rn rs provided acceptable and very close daily eta as it was with sc on most field sensing campaign days fig 11 table 2 overall the root mean square error rmse ranged between 1 7 and 3 9 mm d 1 among six methods which showed very large discrepancies it is worthwhile to report that the three methods ef o ef m and rn rs performed better than others and their performances were closely comparable to that of sc with their rmses being 1 6 mm d 1 thus they can be considered for daily eta calculations in case there is a problem of establishing a non stressed or fully irrigated crop to provide reference temperature if sc approach is to be employed surprisingly the comparisons between tseb eta with the best scaling methods i e sc ef m ef o and rn rs and swb yielded rmse close to what was obtained by other studies liang et al 2021 diarra et al 2017 colaizzi et al 2017 song et al 2016 morillas et al 2013 among the reported studies which had similar series resistance tseb as this study but also compared the results to swb obtained rmses which ranged between 0 5 and 1 6 mm d 1 french et al 2015 and 1 5 1 8 mm d 1 colaizzi et al 2017 overall the discrepancies as errors reflected by rmse and mae from this study might not solely be due to underperformances of the scaling models but rather due to propagated errors from the used eta models tseb and swb for this study growth stage might also have impacted the accuracy of tseb which was not a surprise since the model is recommended for eta or le estimations at partial canopy closure as well as changes in radiative properties of the canopy surfaces due to senescence at later stages which were not accounted for diarra et al 2017 however in this study tseb was employed for the most part of the partial canopy stages to early days of full canopy closure growth stages according to colaizzi et al 2017 spatial variability in micro climate can impact tseb mainly ta and rs as well as swb particularly p especially when the weather station is located at some distance away from the experimentation field for that case temporal variations in precipitation colaizzi et al 2017 in addition to heterogeneity of soil texture and water holding capacities colaizzi et al 2017 makes it difficult to have accurate swb eta values as close to the ground truth measurements when lysimeters or eddy covariance systems are used furthermore the modeled daily eta from the weekly kc and cgdds might also have contributed to discrepancies the assumption that eta is most dependent on cgdds might not be true in some circumstances even though it is known to be the main driving growth factor in the maize crop 4 5 practical considerations for field applications and future directions the study showed the applicability of different upscaling methods to provide reliable eta data which could be helpful in irrigation scheduling and management mobile irts can indeed be used to provide tr coupled with tseb model to obtain eta estimates interestingly thermal imaging techniques can also be used with similar scaling methods to calculate eta this research can benefit producers since it can be applied in irrigation scheduling at both partial and full canopy closure by using the proposed scaling methods selection of scaling method will depend on ease of data collection for instance in this study sc was the best performing method but requires reference tr measurements from a location under non water limiting conditions which might be less achievable in real life applications due to severe drought or disease infestation a potential solution is to develop a locally calibrated scaling model based on machine learning techniques or to deploy alternative models such as ef and rn rs which only require climate data to upscale instantaneous eta to daily intervals future research will explore tr time scaling using machine learning algorithms preferred measurement time window for accurate scaling of tr and combination of scaling methods to address local conditions 5 conclusion there is huge potential of using mobile irts mounted on ground based mobile platforms to provide information about crop water stress and water use however these irts only provide one time of day measurements and the scaling mechanisms are required to develop daily estimates of eta or crop water stress estimation indices from the results scaling one time of day tr approach sc outperformed all other models as validated by swb however daily average eta from other methods such as ef o ef m and rn rs were in close agreement with swb on specific field sensing campaign days i e june 24 july 31 aug 7 and aug 21 where differences ranged between 0 2 1 6 mm statistical analysis suggested that tseb model might be more accurate in non water limiting conditions e g full irrigation and less reliable in water limited environments e g rainfed with no irrigation or deficit irrigation to overcome such shortfalls model performance must be improved under water stressed conditions experienced in water limited regions furthermore this study has provided insights of how mobile irts coupled with two source energy balance model can provide daily eta estimates to support irrigation scheduling however careful selection of the scaling method is advised since all of them have shown differences in reported daily eta values and some have performed better than others future research will include the performance assessment of the scaling methods with respect to accurate eta measurements from eddy covariance system or lysimeter which are more accurate than swb method other future priority will include establishing a robust validation criterion for the tseb model under highly stressed conditions e g rainfed in an arid or semi arid environment to improve the accuracy of eta estimation lastly fusion of mobile irts and thermal imaging for both radiometric and canopy temperature measurements will be considered to manage irrigation scheduling at partial and full canopy growth stages in field experimental plots as a way of tackling poor

aims to evaluate the effects on stem water potential swp and stomatal conductance gs vegetative growth trunk cross sectional area canopy volume and canopy porosity and water productivity in terms of yield of four water irrigation regimes t50 t75 t100 and t125 the plants were irrigated at 50 75 100 and 125 of crop evapotranspiration respectively over two consecutive seasons 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the experiment was carried out in a young walnut orchard cv chandler in a semiarid environment in la rioja province argentina swp and gs had similar seasonal behavior in both seasons t100 swp remained between 0 5 and 0 8 mpa like t75 while t50 reached minimum values of 1 0 mpa stomatal conductance was less responsive than swp to water deficit showing significant differences only at 100 days after bloom vegetative growth and yield components did not differ among treatments compared to t100 and t50 crop water productivity cwp increased from 4 30 to 5 29 dry yield mm 1 ha 1 in 2018 2019 and from 5 25 to 7 28 kg dry yield mm 1 ha 1 in 2019 2020 while t75 cwp did not differ from the cwp of t100 irrigation doses greater than crop requirements t125 have no effect on yield if compared with t100 and in terms of the water productivity function irrigation at 90 of t100 would have allowed for maximum productivity in both seasons keywords cv chandler kernel weight kernel oil concentration water productivity function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the 2000 s in the central western region of argentina there has been a significant increase in the walnut planted area from 12 000 ha in 2002 16 000 ha in 2018 indec 2020 after more than a century of traditional low density 100 trees ha 1 and surface irrigated walnut orchards new commercial orchards are now being established using technologies that combine localized irrigation and high tree density 300 trees ha 1 sibbett et al 1997 lemus 2010 the central western region of argentina is characterized by low annual rainfall in the range of 200 600 mm concentrated in the summer months rubí bianchi and cravero 2010 where walnut growing is only possible under irrigation despite the expansion of walnut in argentina local studies focused on crop water demands are scarce the increasing limitations of water resources in cost and availability rivera et al 2021 have led to a growing interest in knowing the walnut water needs and improving crop water productivity cwp to reduce costs and increase the planted area crop evapotranspiration etc varies according to the environment variety plant density and crop age pereira et al 2015 the main limitation for crop evapotranspiration estimation is the use of expensive equipment such as lysimeters and long term studies in argentina walnut farmers use the irrigation scheduling crop coefficients kc estimated for california usa in agro climatic conditions different from those of argentina the walnut s annual etc is estimated in the range of 1000 mm ha 1 with a kc range of 0 12 1 14 goldhamer et al 1998 steduto et al 2012 in this context applying different irrigation levels seems to be the best strategy for quantifying the walnut water productivity function in order to define irrigation strategies leading to increased cwp in fruit crops for the control of tree water status the most widespread measurement is water potential although other measures such as thermal sensing stomatal conductance and stem dendrometry are performed in conjunction parkash and singh 2020 in walnut the midday stem water potential swp threshold to avoid productive loss with vegetative growth control was estimated at 0 8 mpa fulton et al 2014 while stomatal conductance gs lower than 20 mmol m 2 s 1 has been associated with water deficit conditions rosati et al 2006 fulton and buchner 2015 reviewed articles about the effect of the application of deficit irrigation strategies on walnut throughout the season in california agro climatic conditions categorizing strategies into i reduction in applied water of up to 20 of etc swp from 0 4 to 0 8 mpa which increases dark kernels and slightly lowers yield ii reduction in irrigation between 20 and 50 of etc swp from 0 5 to 1 mpa in this case if the reduction occurs gradually between kernel filling and harvest the effect can be a slight reduction in yield i e the first strategy if the reduction is close to 50 not only will the percentage of dark kernels and yield reduction increase but the yield of the following season might also be affected by an excessive reduction of vegetative growth iii severe irrigation reductions above 50 of etc swp of 0 8 to 1 2 mpa have an inevitable negative effect on the quantity and quality of production and the recovery period could take more than two seasons with regular irrigation on the other hand cohen et al 1997 applying surplus irrigation equivalent to 130 of etc showed that yield and quality were not significantly higher than the control irrigated 100 of etc and also promoted excessive vegetative growth we hypothesized that the negative effect on walnut production of deficit irrigation strategies throughout the growing season is of little significance in central western argentina since the summer rainfall regime of this region reduces water crop demand thus the aim of this work is to study the effects of four irrigation regimes at 50 75 100 and 125 of etc on stem water potential stomatal conductance vegetative growth indicators trunk cross sectional area canopy volume and canopy porosity as well as yield and its components in order to quantify the water productivity function of a young walnut orchard cv chandler and contributing with more information to improve the irrigation scheduling decisions 2

blocks with four irrigation levels each one with four replications at the beginning of the study total height canopy volume and trunk cross sectional area tcsa at 50 cm aboveground were measured in 175 trees distributed in 5 contiguous rows to be used as blocking criteria sixteen experimental plots were selected which consisted of 12 trees 3 rows x 4 trees per row where two central trees similar in height canopy volume and tcsa from the central row were used for data collection and the remaining trees were guard tree borders of the central trees one was kept unaltered until harvest vegetative growth measurements were made on it and yield at harvest was determined while potentially destructive measurements such as water potential and nut sample collection were made on the other tree 2 3

following equation etc et 0 kc kr et0 was estimated from weather station data subjected to the penman monteith equation modified by fao allen et al 1998 while monthly values of kc proposed by goldhamer et al 1998 are shown in table 2 kr is a reduction coefficient associated with crop cover percentage estimated from the equation kr 2 cover 100 which can be assumed to have a maximum value of

irrigation water applied to each treatment in both seasons are shown in table 3 in 2018 2019 the total rainfall accumulated was 524 mm with events mostly above 20 mm uniformly distributed in the summer months the 2019 2020 season was drier than 2018 2019 with an accumulated rainfall of 374 mm with events concentrated in january and february table 3 and fig 1b in this sense et0 was nearly similar between seasons with 774 mm accumulated in the 2018 2019 season and 802 mm in 2019 2020 fig 1b it is also important to note that etc in both seasons was 656 mm and 709 mm respectively table 3 effective rainfall contributed to an equivalent of 20 and 11 of etc in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively irrigation plus effective rainfall total applied water was slightly higher than the planned

conductance stem water potential had similar seasonal behavior among treatments in both seasons fig 2a b t100 maintained swp values of around 0 80 mpa over the growing season the t75 treatment showed similar seasonal patterns and values to t100 in t50 swp values were significantly lower than t100 especially at mid season when t50 reached a swp of 0 90 mpa on the other hand t125 presented a consistently higher swp than t100 from 0 7 to 0 5 mpa at harvest and post harvest all treatments had a similar swp of 0 50 mpa and 0 25 mpa respectively stomatal conductance in the first season ranged between 350 and 450 mmol m 2 s 1 for all treatments fig 2c in the second season gs values ranged from 400 to 600 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 2d higher than in the first seasons when higher cumulative rainfall occurred table 3 statistical differences in gs among treatments were observed around 100 dab in both seasons and at harvest only in the second season on these measurement days the gs of t125 and t100 were higher than those of t75 and t50 stomatal conductance towards post harvest was drastically reduced at 100 mmol m 2 s 1 in both seasons 3 3 trunk cross sectional area canopy volume and canopy porosity canopy volume growth was not significantly affected by treatments in 2018 2019 but showed differences in the early 2019 2020 season canopy volumes in most cases were similar in t100 and t125 t75 was intermediate and t50 was the lowest fig 3a trunk cross sectional area fig 3c was more responsive to the irrigation treatments at the beginning of both seasons when tcsa from t50 was significantly lower than from the rest of the treatments later although these differences were not statistically significant a different behavior could be appreciated when comparing t50 with the t75 100 125 group tcsa and canopy volume had a positive relationship r2 0 52 fig 3d at harvest canopy porosity determined as a proportion of transmitted irradiance at midday did not differ among treatments during both seasons fig 3b 3 4 yield yield components and crop water productivity yield and its components were not affected by irrigation treatments table 4 dry yield in shell nuts moisture 4 did not differ among treatments in both seasons but when comparing t50 and t100 there was a reduction of 20 in the first season and 17 in the second season the fresh and dry weight of 100 nuts did not vary among treatments similarly nut fill did not differ among treatments but a marked trend was evident with the t50 treatment losing 3 nut fill when compared to the t75 100 125 group nut numbers per tree were the highest in t125 1088 nuts per tree 1 in 2018 2019 and 1270 nuts per tree 1 in 2019 2020 and the lowest in t50 805 nuts tree 1 in 2018 2019 and 1048 nuts tree 1 in 2019 2020 although oil concentration was not significantly different among treatments nuts from the t50 treatment accumulated 5 less oil than t100 in 2018 2019 while oil concentration increased by 2 in t125 compared to t100 in 2019 2020 t125 had 3 more oil concentration compared to the average of the other treatments cwp significantly varied among treatments where t50 showed higher cwp with increases of 1 and 2 kg dry yield mm 1 ha 1 compared to t100 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively treatment t125 showed lower cwp with an average cwp value of 1 kg dry yield mm 1 ha 1 lower than t100 in both seasons in this context it is interesting to note that the t75 cwp did not differ from the t100 cwp allowing irrigation water savings of 24 in both seasons relative dry yield was strongly associated with total water applied fig 4 in a single segmental linear regression for both seasons r2 0 90 where the 0 slope breakpoint was obtained at 663 2 mm the pre breakpoint slope was 0 9 relative yield per mm of applied water and the intercept was 38 relative yield on the other hand the relative yield post breakpoint was 98 4 discussion 4 1 stem water potential and stomatal conductance in walnut trees irrigated between 75 and 125 of the control treatment showed midday swp values above 0 8 mpa throughout the growing season in line with the threshold of absent water deficit proposed by fulton et al 2014 however swp in the t50 treatment was close to 1 mpa from 25 dab i e fruit set to 100 dab i e kernel filling with no significant yield loss table 4 this finding suggests that the severity phenological stage and duration of the water deficit period with water potentials below 0 8 mpa are determining factors for whether there is yield loss or not in addition our results obtained from a semiarid environment could also indicate that swp thresholds vary according to the environmental conditions of each site in agreement with what corell et al 2016 reported for olives in different locations in spain stem water potential was more sensitive to irrigation treatments than gs showing significant differences between treatments throughout the entire season average gs was similar among treatments within each season as it varied between 277 and 291 mmol m 2 s 1 in the 2018 2019 season and between 365 and 405 mmol m 2 s 1 in the 2019 2020 season rosati et al 2006 found an exponential relationship between gs and swp in walnut trees irrigated at 50 etc when their swp was lower than 0 8 mpa up to 1 2 mpa the gs ranged between 20 and 200 mmol m 2 s 1 however for trees irrigated at 100 etc and with swp higher than 0 8 mpa up to 0 mpa the response was less linear with gs between 200 and 800 mmol m 2 s 1 therefore the absence of significant differences in our gs measurements may be due to the fact that we did not reach critical levels of stomatal closure and therefore the amount of assimilated co2 was not severely affected 4 2 vegetative growth indicators comparisons among irrigation regimes vegetative growth expressed as canopy volume was not significantly affected by treatments even though significant differences in swp appeared between 50 and 75 dab at the time of active full vegetative and fruit growth tcsa behaved similarly to canopy volume so it may serve as an indicator of canopy growth during the season in line with cohen et al 1997 a significant reduction in water supply to the crop at t50 may reduce tcsa growth the difference in canopy volumes near the end of the second season resulted in a difference in nut load between t50 and t100 of 200 nuts but with no significant differences between treatments the combination of a compact canopy with high porosity i e minor canopy leaf area allows a significant reduction in etc by reducing the transpiration surface pereira et al 2006 although these results could lead to a significant reduction in the proportion of intercepted radiation they seem to be a good way to form and manage high density walnut orchards minimizing pruning tasks while generating a reduction in crop maintenance costs and the amount of water applied costa 2007 to understand the behavior of vegetative growth it is necessary to consider soil water retention capacity its textural class table 1 and atmospheric water inputs table 3 at our experimental site etc was 656 and 709 mm yr 1 in a monzonic like regime equivalent to 70 of the average etc in california 1050 mm in a mediterranean like rainfall regime goldhamer et al 1998 therefore the kc used in our study may lead to an overestimation of irrigation demands 4 3 yield components and crop water productivity responses to water regimes in general yield and yield component responses to study water deficit regimes differ from those reviewed by fulton and buchner 2015 from deficit irrigation experiences in california where yield was severely affected by 20 50 irrigation reductions in this sense we did not find significant differences in yield or yield components table 4 the most stable yield component was the weight of 100 fresh nuts and fruit fill kernel whole nut weight ratio ramos et al 1978 reported that if the water deficit occurs in the first half of the season the size and quantity of nuts could be affected while if the deficit occurs in the second half kernel quality and oil concentration will be the most affected in our experiment soil filling at the beginning of the season may have had an effect which is why kernel size remained stable since as the season progressed the soil water reserve was depleted in irrigation deficit treatments oil concentration did not show significant differences but a difference of 5 and 3 when comparing the results of treatments t50 and t75 seems to indicate greater sensitivity to the deficit in the second half of the cycle when most oil accumulation in seeds occurs ramos et al 1978 buchner et al 2008 in walnut trees grafted on two different rootstocks evaluated different irrigation strategies for three consecutive seasons the strategy consisted first of maintaining a high swp through the vegetative growth phase thus trying to ensure vegetative growth and nut size and once vegetative growth had stopped three irrigation levels were applied fully irrigated swp from 0 3 to 0 6 mpa medium water deficit swp from 0 7 to 0 9 mpa and moderate water deficit 0 9 to 1 1 mpa their results indicated that the nut load was reduced in the medium deficit treatment by 19 28 with respect to t100 while for the moderate deficit irrigation treatment the load was reduced from 30 to 38 considering our case the mean swp of treatment t50 was 0 68 and 0 71 mpa for seasons 1 and 2 respectively in comparison to our treatment t50 would correspond to the moderate water deficit treatment 5 conclusions the application of deficit irrigation regimes at 50 and 75 of etc improved crop water productivity relationship between relative yield and total applied water and partially controlled vegetative growth without significant negative implications on the production and yield components this was observed in two consecutive seasons on young walnut trees in the semi arid central western argentina where water is the most limiting factor and the cost of each unit of water applied weighs on the crop s economic efficiency moreover in relation to the water productivity function irrigation at 90 of t100 would have allowed us to reach the maximum productivity in both seasons this relationship is interesting for areas where water is not limited or has a low cost continuing observation at the current experimental site and further work elsewhere are needed to confirm these conclusions especially concerning the similar productive performance of t50 and t100 in this context it would also be interesting to study the effect of a more restrictive deficit irrigation regime than t50 credit authorship contribution statement all authors contributed to the study conception and design material

9262,the area dedicated to walnut orchards has recently expanded in central western argentina nevertheless studies on crop water demand are scarce and fundamental in semi arid environments this work aims to evaluate the effects on stem water potential swp and stomatal conductance gs vegetative growth trunk cross sectional area canopy volume and canopy porosity and water productivity in terms of yield of four water irrigation regimes t50 t75 t100 and t125 the plants were irrigated at 50 75 100 and 125 of crop evapotranspiration respectively over two consecutive seasons 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the experiment was carried out in a young walnut orchard cv chandler in a semiarid environment in la rioja province argentina swp and gs had similar seasonal behavior in both seasons t100 swp remained between 0 5 and 0 8 mpa like t75 while t50 reached minimum values of 1 0 mpa stomatal conductance was less responsive than swp to water deficit showing significant differences only at 100 days after bloom vegetative growth and yield components did not differ among treatments compared to t100 and t50 crop water productivity cwp increased from 4 30 to 5 29 dry yield mm 1 ha 1 in 2018 2019 and from 5 25 to 7 28 kg dry yield mm 1 ha 1 in 2019 2020 while t75 cwp did not differ from the cwp of t100 irrigation doses greater than crop requirements t125 have no effect on yield if compared with t100 and in terms of the water productivity function irrigation at 90 of t100 would have allowed for maximum productivity in both seasons keywords cv chandler kernel weight kernel oil concentration water productivity function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the 2000 s in the central western region of argentina there has been a significant increase in the walnut planted area from 12 000 ha in 2002 16 000 ha in 2018 indec 2020 after more than a century of traditional low density 100 trees ha 1 and surface irrigated walnut orchards new commercial orchards are now being established using technologies that combine localized irrigation and high tree density 300 trees ha 1 sibbett et al 1997 lemus 2010 the central western region of argentina is characterized by low annual rainfall in the range of 200 600 mm concentrated in the summer months rubí bianchi and cravero 2010 where walnut growing is only possible under irrigation despite the expansion of walnut in argentina local studies focused on crop water demands are scarce the increasing limitations of water resources in cost and availability rivera et al 2021 have led to a growing interest in knowing the walnut water needs and improving crop water productivity cwp to reduce costs and increase the planted area crop evapotranspiration etc varies according to the environment variety plant density and crop age pereira et al 2015 the main limitation for crop evapotranspiration estimation is the use of expensive equipment such as lysimeters and long term studies in argentina walnut farmers use the irrigation scheduling crop coefficients kc estimated for california usa in agro climatic conditions different from those of argentina the walnut s annual etc is estimated in the range of 1000 mm ha 1 with a kc range of 0 12 1 14 goldhamer et al 1998 steduto et al 2012 in this context applying different irrigation levels seems to be the best strategy for quantifying the walnut water productivity function in order to define irrigation strategies leading to increased cwp in fruit crops for the control of tree water status the most widespread measurement is water potential although other measures such as thermal sensing stomatal conductance and stem dendrometry are performed in conjunction parkash and singh 2020 in walnut the midday stem water potential swp threshold to avoid productive loss with vegetative growth control was estimated at 0 8 mpa fulton et al 2014 while stomatal conductance gs lower than 20 mmol m 2 s 1 has been associated with water deficit conditions rosati et al 2006 fulton and buchner 2015 reviewed articles about the effect of the application of deficit irrigation strategies on walnut throughout the season in california agro climatic conditions categorizing strategies into i reduction in applied water of up to 20 of etc swp from 0 4 to 0 8 mpa which increases dark kernels and slightly lowers yield ii reduction in irrigation between 20 and 50 of etc swp from 0 5 to 1 mpa in this case if the reduction occurs gradually between kernel filling and harvest the effect can be a slight reduction in yield i e the first strategy if the reduction is close to 50 not only will the percentage of dark kernels and yield reduction increase but the yield of the following season might also be affected by an excessive reduction of vegetative growth iii severe irrigation reductions above 50 of etc swp of 0 8 to 1 2 mpa have an inevitable negative effect on the quantity and quality of production and the recovery period could take more than two seasons with regular irrigation on the other hand cohen et al 1997 applying surplus irrigation equivalent to 130 of etc showed that yield and quality were not significantly higher than the control irrigated 100 of etc and also promoted excessive vegetative growth we hypothesized that the negative effect on walnut production of deficit irrigation strategies throughout the growing season is of little significance in central western argentina since the summer rainfall regime of this region reduces water crop demand thus the aim of this work is to study the effects of four irrigation regimes at 50 75 100 and 125 of etc on stem water potential stomatal conductance vegetative growth indicators trunk cross sectional area canopy volume and canopy porosity as well as yield and its components in order to quantify the water productivity function of a young walnut orchard cv chandler and contributing with more information to improve the irrigation scheduling decisions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and orchard description the experiment was conducted on a six years old commercial chandler walnut variety orchard in guanchín 29 10 s 67 40 w 1750 masl la rioja province argentina over two seasons 2018 2019 season 1 from october 1 2018 to may 31 2019 and 2019 2020 season 2 from october 1 2019 to may 31 2020 the orchard was established in 2012 with trees spaced at 7 m x 5 m 285 trees ha 1 and irrigated with one microjet per tree the region has a mean annual temperature of 13 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 534 mm 2010 2020 with the majority of rainfall falling during the summer months december to march in the southern hemisphere at a weather station near the experimental site daily meteorological data such as maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity solar radiation wind speed rainfall and reference evapotranspiration et0 were collected soil physicochemical characteristics were analyzed at depths up to 1 m at the beginning of the experiment table 1 the soil was loam to 0 75 m and clay loam from 0 75 to 1 m depth the sodium absorption ratio was less than 0 16 meq kg 1 and the organic matter decreased from 5 in the first 25 cm to 3 7 at 1 0 m depth ph remained stable throughout the soil profile at values ranging from 8 5 to 8 8 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was framed in randomized complete blocks with four irrigation levels each one with four replications at the beginning of the study total height canopy volume and trunk cross sectional area tcsa at 50 cm aboveground were measured in 175 trees distributed in 5 contiguous rows to be used as blocking criteria sixteen experimental plots were selected which consisted of 12 trees 3 rows x 4 trees per row where two central trees similar in height canopy volume and tcsa from the central row were used for data collection and the remaining trees were guard tree borders of the central trees one was kept unaltered until harvest vegetative growth measurements were made on it and yield at harvest was determined while potentially destructive measurements such as water potential and nut sample collection were made on the other tree 2 3 irrigation treatments the four irrigation treatments regimes were carried out between october 1 2018 and may 15 2020 the t100 treatment received a seasonal water amount equivalent to 100 of etc the t50 t75 and t125 treatments received seasonal water amounts equivalent to 50 75 and 125 of t100 to replenish the water needs in each treatment self compensating microjets with different flow rates t50 20 l h 1 t75 30 l h 1 t100 40 l h 1 and t125 50 l h 1 were used allowing a similar spatial distribution of emitters and irrigation frequency to be maintained the etc was estimated according to the following equation etc et 0 kc kr et0 was estimated from weather station data subjected to the penman monteith equation modified by fao allen et al 1998 while monthly values of kc proposed by goldhamer et al 1998 are shown in table 2 kr is a reduction coefficient associated with crop cover percentage estimated from the equation kr 2 cover 100 which can be assumed to have a maximum value of 1 fereres 1982 in this case since the trees had already covered more than 50 of the soil surface at the beginning of the experiment kr was equal to 1 the irrigation schedule considered the effective rainfall er from daily rainfall r by applying the following equations puertas 2009 r 12 mm er 0 r 12 mm er r 12 0 8 the interval between irrigation events from bloom to harvest was weekly except if the er was significant then the interval was extended 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 stem water potential and stomatal conductance stem water potential swp and stomatal conductance gs were monthly measured on the same completely clear days from the beginning of sprouting november to harvest march measurements of swp were made between 12 00 and 13 00 h solar time using a scholander type pressure chamber biocontrol 0 4 mpa buenos aires argentina following the methodology proposed by mccutchan and shackel 1992 two apical leaflets of mature leaves from shoots close to the trunk were selected from the center tree of each replicate the selected leaflets were placed in a reflective and waterproof plastic bag at least 90 min before measurement stomatal conductance was measured in two apical leaflets of two fully developed leaves on one tree per replicate during mid morning 10 00 11 00 h solar time with a previously calibrated stomatal diffusion porometer delta t ap4 cambridge uk 2 4 2 trunk cross sectional area canopy volume and canopy porosity tcsa was estimated from the perimeter at 50 cm from the soil surface in one central tree of each replicate trunk perimeter was measured at three phenological stages in each season budbreak endocarp hardening coinciding with the end of shoot growth and maturity mid march with the same frequency of tcsa measurements and in the same trees canopy volume and porosity were estimated the canopy volume was calculated by measuring the total tree height measured from the soil the insertion height of the first branch and the radii of the canopy in the four directions according to its shade projection on the ground by applying the following equation canopy vol m 3 1 3 π mean width m 2 4 height m height of first branch m canopy porosity gap percentage was estimated using photographs of the shadow projection at midday sun on a white blanket of a known area 1 m2 extended 1 m from the trunk of the central tree of each replicate the photographs were then processed to determine the percent of unshaded area i e gap percentage with cobcal v2 1 2 4 3 yield yield components and crop water productivity once the nuts reached maturity march 23 in 2019 and march 19 in 2020 one central tree per replicate was manually harvested and immediately weighed a sample of 100 nuts was taken and weighed with a precision balance precisa 320 xt dietikon switzerland the average nut fresh weight was then estimated the number of nuts per tree was determined from the total yield weight and the average nut fresh weight the sample of 100 nuts was oven dried with forced air current at 30 c to a seed water concentration of 4 a thermobalance with an accuracy of 0 001 g precisa xm60 dietikon switzerland was used to check seed moisture during drying the dry yield per tree was estimated from the nut dry weight moisture 4 and the estimated number of nuts per tree next the 100 nuts were manually cracked and the kernels weighed to obtain the percentage of nut fill oil concentration was estimated by solvent extraction with an automated soxhlet extractor ankom xt10 new york usa the official methodology aoac 920 39 thiex et al 2003 was used which consisted of grinding 30 kernels per treatment and 2 g samples were taken in duplicate from the paste formed the subsamples were dried until constant weight in an oven with a forced air flow at 70 c solvent extraction was carried out with petroleum ether in a cyclic extraction program of 60 min once the extraction was finished the sample was weighted and the kernel oil concentration was estimated crop water productivity cwp was estimated for each replicate and season as the ratio of dry yield per hectare of unshelled nuts kg ha 1 and the total amount of water applied i e irrigation water plus effective rainfall mm relative dry yield was calculated as the proportion of maximum dry yield in each season 2 5 statistical analysis data analysis was performed in the r v 4 1 2 r core team 2021 environment for statistical computing with nlme pinheiro et al 2021 and emmeans length 2021 packages a linear mixed model was used assuming treatment was a fixed effect and block was a

water use absolute maximum temperatures were similar in both seasons at 35 2 c on december 24 2018 in season 1 and 34 2 c on january 25 2019 in season 2 absolute minimum temperatures varied between growing seasons during the 2018 2019 season the minimum temperature recorded was 1 1 c on october 2 and 1 1 c on may 7 at the end of the 2019 2020 season fig 1a the et0 etc rainfall and total irrigation water applied to each treatment in both seasons are shown in table 3 in 2018 2019 the total rainfall accumulated was 524 mm with events mostly above 20 mm uniformly distributed in the summer months the 2019 2020 season was drier than 2018 2019 with an accumulated rainfall of 374 mm with events concentrated in january and february table 3 and fig 1b in this sense et0 was nearly similar between seasons with 774 mm accumulated in the 2018 2019 season and 802 mm in 2019 2020 fig 1b it is also important to note that etc in both seasons was 656 mm and 709 mm respectively table 3 effective rainfall contributed to an equivalent of 20 and 11 of etc in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively irrigation plus effective rainfall total applied water was slightly higher than the planned treatments at 50 75 100 and 125 of etc replenishing volumes equivalent to 65 80 100 and 123 of etc in 2018 2019 and 62 79 100 and 125 of etc in 2019 2020 3 2 stem water potential and stomatal conductance stem water potential had similar seasonal behavior among treatments in both seasons fig 2a b t100 maintained swp values of around 0 80 mpa over the growing season the t75 treatment showed similar seasonal patterns and values to t100 in t50 swp values were significantly lower than t100 especially at mid season when t50 reached a swp of 0 90 mpa on the other hand t125 presented a consistently higher swp than t100 from 0 7 to 0 5 mpa at harvest and post harvest all treatments had a similar swp of 0 50 mpa and 0 25 mpa respectively stomatal conductance in the first season ranged between 350 and 450 mmol m 2 s 1 for all treatments fig 2c in the second season gs values ranged from 400 to 600 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 2d higher than in the first seasons when higher cumulative rainfall occurred table 3 statistical differences in gs among treatments were observed around 100 dab in both seasons and at harvest only in the second season on these measurement days the gs of t125 and t100 were higher than those of t75 and t50 stomatal conductance towards post harvest was drastically reduced at 100 mmol m 2 s 1 in both seasons 3 3 trunk cross sectional area canopy volume and canopy porosity canopy volume growth was not significantly affected by treatments in 2018 2019 but showed differences in the early 2019 2020 season canopy volumes in most cases were similar in t100 and t125 t75 was intermediate and t50 was the lowest fig 3a trunk cross sectional area fig 3c was more responsive to the irrigation treatments at the beginning of both seasons when tcsa from t50 was significantly lower than from the rest of the treatments later although these differences were not statistically significant a different behavior could be appreciated when comparing t50 with the t75 100 125 group tcsa and canopy volume had a positive relationship r2 0 52 fig 3d at harvest canopy porosity determined as a proportion of transmitted irradiance at midday did not differ among treatments during both seasons fig 3b 3 4 yield yield components and crop water productivity yield and its components were not affected by irrigation treatments table 4 dry yield in shell nuts moisture 4 did not differ among treatments in both seasons but when comparing t50 and t100 there was a reduction of 20 in the first season and 17 in the second season the fresh and dry weight of 100 nuts did not vary among treatments similarly nut fill did not differ among treatments but a marked trend was evident with the t50 treatment losing 3 nut fill when compared to the t75 100 125 group nut numbers per tree were the highest in t125 1088 nuts per tree 1 in 2018 2019 and 1270 nuts per tree 1 in 2019 2020 and the lowest in t50 805 nuts tree 1 in 2018 2019 and 1048 nuts tree 1 in 2019 2020 although oil concentration was not significantly different among treatments nuts from the t50 treatment accumulated 5 less oil than t100 in 2018 2019 while oil concentration increased by 2 in t125 compared to t100 in 2019 2020 t125 had 3 more oil concentration compared to the average of the other treatments cwp significantly varied among treatments where t50 showed higher cwp with increases of 1 and 2 kg dry yield mm 1 ha 1 compared to t100 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively treatment t125 showed lower cwp with an average cwp value of 1 kg dry yield mm 1 ha 1 lower than t100 in both seasons in this context it is interesting to note that the t75 cwp did not differ from the t100 cwp allowing irrigation water savings of 24 in both seasons relative dry yield was strongly associated with total water applied fig 4 in a single segmental linear regression for both seasons r2 0 90 where the 0 slope breakpoint was obtained at 663 2 mm the pre breakpoint slope was 0 9 relative yield

etc and with swp higher than 0 8 mpa up to 0 mpa the response was less linear with gs between 200 and 800 mmol m 2 s 1 therefore the absence of significant differences in our gs measurements may be due to the fact that we did not reach critical levels of stomatal closure and therefore the amount of assimilated co2 was not severely affected 4 2 vegetative growth indicators comparisons among

stopped three irrigation levels were applied fully irrigated swp from 0 3 to 0 6 mpa medium water deficit swp from 0 7 to 0 9 mpa and moderate water deficit 0 9 to 1 1 mpa their results indicated that the nut load was reduced in the medium deficit treatment by 19 28 with respect to t100 while for the moderate deficit irrigation treatment the load was reduced from 30 to 38 considering our case the mean swp of treatment t50 was 0 68 and 0 71 mpa for seasons 1 and 2 respectively in comparison to our treatment t50 would correspond to the moderate water deficit treatment 5 conclusions the application of deficit irrigation regimes at 50 and 75 of etc improved crop water productivity relationship between relative yield and total applied water and partially controlled vegetative growth without significant negative implications on the production and yield components this was observed in two consecutive seasons on young walnut trees in the semi arid central western argentina where water is the most limiting factor and the cost of each unit of water applied weighs on the crop s economic efficiency moreover in relation to the water productivity function irrigation at 90 of t100 would have allowed us to reach the maximum productivity in both seasons this relationship is interesting for areas where water is not limited or has a low cost continuing observation at the current experimental site and further work elsewhere are needed to confirm these conclusions especially concerning the similar productive performance of t50 and t100 in this context it would also be interesting to study the effect of a more restrictive deficit irrigation regime than t50 credit authorship contribution statement all authors contributed to the study conception and design material

9263,evaporative cooling systems are the currently used technology for providing cooling to greenhouses in arid regions where typically the greenhouse is ventilated however they consume a large quantity of water to cool the air a closed greenhouse is proposed that uses earth air heat exchangers eahe and fogging to control the interior temperature and relative humidity in a water efficient manner a numerical model has been developed for the greenhouse and eahe and have been validated against experimental data collected from literature simulations are performed to compare the proposed closed greenhouse performance against the fan pad system in a ventilated greenhouse in maintaining a suitable temperature and humidity and to estimate the water usages the eahe reduced the water consumed by the fogging system by 50 and the maximum interior temperature from 50 c to 35 c the temperature reduction was found comparable to a fan pad system with a ventilation rate of 20 air changes per hour however with a more stable relative humidity at approximately 75 furthermore water used for cooling was lower by one tenth of that of the fan pad system reducing it from 53 litre day to 5

introduction greenhouses are a way to meet the growing global demand for food through the improvements in agricultural productivity they protect plants against adverse environmental conditions and enable planting during off seasons by maintaining the interior temperature to that is required for the crops growth for example in cold climates such as canada greenhouse cultivation is the only viable method for agriculture during the low temperatures experienced during winter enabling crops to be protected from snow and wind and to be maintained at a clement temperature brundrett 1979 henshaw 2017 in contrast in hot climates specialized greenhouses have been developed to maintain a cool internal climate for plant cultivation for example in the persian gulf region where the ambient temperature can exceed 40 c in the summer al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 davies 2005 cooling is necessary to maintain a temperature suitable for plant growth as such several studies have been concerned with the cooling technologies for greenhouses in tropical and subtropical regions kumar et al 2009 hot and arid regions ghani et al 2019 and for worldwide applications sethi and sharma 2007 it was reported that evaporative cooling methods are the most effective for cooling greenhouses in hot arid regions kumar et al 2009 ghani et al 2019 sethi and sharma 2007 evaporative cooling relies on the fact that as the water evaporates it absorbs heat from the air lowering its temperature these systems are based on the mechanical supply of water and the conversion of sensible heat into latent heat of evaporated water the total heat enthalpy of the air remains constant throughout the process however the technology consumes large quantities of water which is undesirable in regions where water is scarce al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 montero 2006 for instance 67 of the freshwater consumption for a greenhouse in oman is used by its fan pad evaporative cooling system al mulla 2006 furthermore the evaporative cooling potential for a fan pad system is limited by the ambient relative humidity and the higher the relative humidity is the lower the cooling potential hence the system is only effective in regions with hot dry weather kumar et al 2009 which are typically regions with a low availability of fresh water controlling the environment inside a greenhouse so that it is suitable for plant cultivation is demanding in terms of both energy and water consumption cuce et al 2016 researchers have studied sustainable energy technologies and energy saving techniques such as solar energy and thermal energy storage systems cuce et al 2016 cao et al 2019 berroug et al 2011 esen and yuksel 2013 magadley et al 2020 amara et al 2021 gorjian et al 2021 or wind energy pakari and ghani 2019 to meet these demands and minimize energy consumption other researchers have utilized shallow geothermal energy down to a depth of 4 m by using earth to air heat exchangers eahe to cool mongkon et al 2013 2014 yildiz et al 2011 2012 ozgener and ozgener 2010b or heat levit et al 1989 ozgener and ozgener 2010a ghosal and tiwari 2005 hegazy et al 2021 greenhouses it was reported that an eahe system had a higher potential to provide cooling in summer than heating in winter under the weather conditions experienced in new delhi india tiwari et al 2006 in hot dry and water scarce regions it is desirable to minimize water consumption and this can be affected in two ways by reducing the water usage necessary for evaporative cooling and through regulating the irrigation water to reduce the high fresh water demands of evaporative cooling in coastal locations seawater has been used in fan pad evaporative cooling systems and freshwater for crop cultivation has been generated with a condenser al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 this system reduced the freshwater needed for cooling however the quantity of freshwater produced may be insufficient for irrigation al mulla 2006 in addition the quantity of freshwater produced varied with season which made it an unreliable source of freshwater for continuous irrigation al mulla 2006 moreover the evaporatively cooled greenhouses developed in hot dry regions have been ventilated open greenhouses with a large number of air changes per hour to help reduce the interior temperature in the hot dry region of east south jordan the results in al jamal 1994 demonstrated that for the local climate 20 air changes per hour were required to maintain a temperature suitable for cultivation the high ventilation rate makes it harder to control the indoor relative humidity and so in dry climates the relative humidity inside the greenhouses are typically low which results in a high crop transpiration rate and therefore an increased requirement for irrigation water katsoulas et al 2015 a high ventilation rate reflects on a higher water loss to the ambient in the form of water vapor katsoulas et al 2015 and given that ventilation is used for temperature regulation pakari and ghani 2019 li et al 2017 akrami et al 2020 the addition of a cooling module to a greenhouse can reduce the required ventilation rate katsoulas et al 2015 the results presented in katsoulas et al 2015 have demonstrated that the addition of cooling at a rate of 170 w m 2 reduced the daily ventilation rate requirement by 50 however in the study the system that provided the cooling was not specified in addition the study confined itself to the climates of central europe the netherlands and the mediterranean greece and algeria and excluded the extreme conditions experienced in hot dry regions in such regions it is logical to think that the water loss due to ventilation is expected to be higher because of the significantly dryer ambient conditions therefore a closed greenhouse with a water efficient cooling module is hypothesized to be even more beneficial in such a scenario furthermore the interior humidity of such a closed greenhouse has been shown to be easier to control with less energy and water usage as compared to a ventilated greenhouse vadiee and martin 2013 one possible sustainable cooling mechanism that can be operated in a closed loop with the greenhouse yildiz et al 2011 2012 hepbasli 2013 ozgener and ozgener 2013 2011 ozgener et al 2011 hegazy et al 2021 is eahe which would consequently enable temperature regulation without the need to exchange air with the ambient through ventilation this is the water conservative cooling strategy that is proposed for hot arid regions in this work the objective of this study is to investigate the potential of eahe in providing cooling to a closed greenhouse in a hot arid climate and to compare that against a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse as a benchmark and a closed greenhouse without cooling as the reference case the assessment considers the interior air temperature air relative humidity and water consumption also the operation of fogging system alongside eahe is considered to enable controlling the humidity in the closed greenhouse and examine the fogging system cooling potential the novelty of this work is to develop a sustainable cooling system for closed greenhouse operation regime that would maintain the interior air temperature and relative humidity at a range suitable for cultivation yet consumes less water compared to current greenhouse evaporative cooling methods thereby we present for the first time to the authors knowledge a closed greenhouse cooling concept that relies on the combined operation of eahe and fogging that is developed for hot arid regions aiming at replacing the current water intensive ventilated evaporatively cooled greenhouses the location of hurghada egypt 27 26 n 33 81 e was selected to perform a case study analysis on a representative day of the warmest month of the year i e august using typical meteorological year tmy data typically 30 years energyplus 2019a the location lies in the far east of the eastern sahara desert at the edge of the red sea that location was selected based on it having a hot and dry climate that is challenging for plant cultivation and it being representative of the vast unused desert landscapes of egypt located far from the delta and the banks of the nile finally data is presented for the other warm months of the year to demonstrate the trends for august are typical for the entire summer period 2 methodology 2 1 semi closed greenhouse modeling the model used in the study has been developed based on the work presented in joudi and farhan 2015 the greenhouse was divided into five components the greenhouse cover the interior air the soil surface and two sub soil layers and then an energy balance is applied on each of these component to formulate a comprehensive greenhouse model fig 1 illustrates the heat flows between the greenhouse components and its surroundings the following assumptions are made 1 the greenhouse cover inside air and soil layers are considered as lumped systems with a uniform temperature joudi and farhan 2015 2 the interior air is assumed to be perfectly mixed 3 the interior air does not participate in radiation heat transfer 4 since it is a dry region condensation on the cover is unlikely as observed in tsafaras et al 2022 hence it was neglected such assumption is inline as well with studies in similar climate al jamal 1994 joudi and farhan 2015 5 the soil is assumed to have low moisture content and negligible evaporation takes place joudi and farhan 2015 6 for simplicity it is assumed that there is no crop inside the greenhouse al jamal 1994 joudi and farhan 2015 that empty greenhouse condition resembles the stage when crops are seeded or transplanted in commercial greenhouses lopez et al 2012 the energy balance equations for the greenhouse components are as follows 1 the energy balance for the greenhouse cover can be expressed as 1 ρ c c p c b a c d t c d t q s o l a r c q r a d c n e t q c o n v i c q c o n v a m b c where the solar radiation q s o l a r c includes the reflected radiation from the soil surface joudi and farhan 2015 and is calculated as 2 q s o l a r c α c i a c 1 τ c 1 α

available it is commonly acceptable to assume that the outdoor ground surface temperature is equal to the ambient temperature t out soil t amb mcclellan and pedersen 1997 bisoniya et al 2015 the view

2015 2 the energy balance for the greenhouse interior air is 13 ρ a c p a v g h d t i d t q i n f q c o n v c i q c o n v s i q w e v a p q e q v where v gh is the greenhouse volume the heat flow due

soil and the internal air using the absolute temperature difference between the internal air and the soil surface is h conv s i 1 52 t s t i 0 33 joudi and farhan 2015 the humidity within the greenhouse is controlled by spraying water i e fogging or misting inside and this can also be used to provide cooling assuming the sprayed water is completely evaporated into vapor then the cooling provided through water evaporation is 16 q w e v a p h f g m w e v a p where h fg is the latent heat of vaporization of water and is equal to 2 257 106 j kg cooling is also provided by passing the interior air through a total of n e earth air heat exchangers that operate in parallel the cooling provided by these is given by 17 q e n e m e c p a t e o u t l e t t i where m e is the air mass flow rate for one eahe pipe when modeling the greenhouse in a ventilated operation the following heat load is added to the right hand side of the air energy balance equation eq 13 18 q v m v c p a t a m b t i when modeling a fan pad evaporatively cooled ventilated greenhouse as is currently in use in hot arid regions the term t amb which is the dry bulb temperature of the ambient air in eq 18 is replaced by the wet bulb temperature t amb wbt assuming the inlet air to the greenhouse after the fan pad is saturated air in other words the fan pad is assumed ideal with an efficiency of 100 in such case the water consumed by the ideal fan pad system is the amount of water that drops the ventilation air temperature from the ambient dry bulb temperature t amb to the wet bulb temperature t amb wbt that assumption was considered for simplicity and for easier comparison with the study al jamal 1994 for an arid region in jordan however it should be noted that in practice the efficiency might be lower than 100 and will not be constant during the day as shown in the experimental work in tsafaras et al 2021 nevertheless we accordingly modified eq 18 as follows 19 q v m v c p a t a m b w b t t i where for both cases m v ρ a v g h n v 3600 s h r otherwise for a closed greenhouse operation the ventilation heat flow is set to zero m v 0 3 the energy balance for the soil surface is 20 ρ s c p s δ

at a depth of 0 5 m where at that depth the diurnal surface temperature fluctuation is ceased as shown experimentally by florides and kalogirou 2005 pouloupatis et al 2011 and wu et al 2010 and numerically by singh and sharma 2017 the water mass balance within the greenhouse is given by 27 d m w g h d t m i n f ω a m b ω g h m w e v a p m v ω a m b ω g h where m i n f is the air exchange rate with the ambient air due to infiltration where m i n f ρ a v g h n i n f 3600 for a closed greenhouse m v is set to zero since the air exchange is limited to the uncontrolled infiltration phenomenon for the condition of a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse the third term on the r h s of eq 27 m v ω a m b ω g h is replaced by m v ω a m b w b t ω g h where ω amb wbt is the humidity ratio of saturated air at the ambient wet bulb temperature the humidity ratio is the ratio between the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air and is sometimes called specific humidity accordingly the humidity ratio of the greenhouse inside air ω gh is calculated from 28 ω g h m w g h ρ a v g h and the rate that water is evaporated inside the greenhouse to reach the desired greenhouse relative humidity level rh is 29 m w e v a p ω t a r g e t ω g h v g h ρ a τ where ω target is the humidity ratio hr of the inside air at the desired relative humidity rh level and τ is response time of the humidification system the energy and mass balance equations described above are ordinary differential equations odes that are solved using a matlab code that uses ode15s solver which is a variable step variable order solver based on the numerical differentiation formulas of orders 1 5 details on the method and algorithm can be found in shampine et al 2003 the initial temperatures for all the greenhouse components were assumed to be equal to t amb at the starting hour of the day similarly the initial greenhouse air relative humidity rh and humidity ratio were set to the ambient conditions the solver then stepped forward in time with the ambient input parameters being interpolated from tabulated data except for the greenhouse validation for the representative day of the month the whole 24 h data are cycled 5 times 5 whole days to minimize the dependence on the initial conditions 2 1 1 greenhouse model validation the greenhouse model was validated against the experimental data of a greenhouse in baghdad iraq joudi and farhan 2015 the input measured meteorological data provided for the days of 16 01 2013 and 17 01 2013 are shown in fig 2 and the properties of the greenhouse components and parameters used are listed in table 1 the measuring equipment are described in more details in the reference joudi and farhan 2015 the mean wind speeds for the two days were 2 78 and 1 84 m s respectively weather underground 2019 no cooling was provided in the experiment and so the following energy and mass flows were set to zero q w a t e r e v a p 0 q e a h e 0 q v 0 m w e v a p 0 m e a h e 0 m v 0 further since the greenhouse cover is vertical in the experiment the inclination angle of the cover β was set to 90 fig 2 shows the predicted temperature of the air inside the greenhouse compared with the experimental values the measured internal air temperature values were the average of six sensors installed inside the greenhouse as described in joudi and farhan 2015 it can be seen that the predicted temperatures are in good agreement with the instantaneous experimental measured values over the course of the two days recording an average absolute deviation aad of 1 5 c calculated from eq 30 where n is the total number of hours there is a larger discrepancy between the predicted and experimental values in the first 6 h of the simulation and this is attributed to the choice of the initial condition which set all temperatures to be equal to the ambient air temperature at the initial time the discrepancy that is occurring during the sun hours arose from using integrated not instantaneous measured solar radiation on the inclined roof as an input to the model in addition a fixed average wind speed on each day was used nevertheless it can be concluded that the model can accurately predict the greenhouse temperature 30 a a d 1 n h r 1 n t h r p r e d i c t e d t h r m e a s u r e d 2 2 soil temperature modeling the ground sub surface temperature varies with depth and time and is influenced by the soil s thermo physical properties and the ground surface temperature the sub surface temperature distribution was modeled as heat conduction through a semi infinite solid the soil thermal properties were assumed to be constant with depth and along the eahe pipe axial length while the ground surface temperature varies with time that variation is caused by the complex heat transfer interaction between the ground surface and the surroundings with the dominant mode of heat transfer being due to the solar load and convective heat transfer between the ambient air and the ground another heat load which is less significant in arid regions is evaporation occurring at moist ground surfaces and this was neglected in this study understanding those ground surface interactions it can be concluded that the surface temperature is mainly affected by the climatic conditions and since the climatic temperatures follow a cyclic behavior on annual basis the surface temperature history can be approximated as a sinusoidal temperature variation with time through the year watson 1983 by applying this cyclic temperature variation as a boundary condition at the surface of t 0 t t m e a n δ t s u r f cos ω t t o bergman et al 2011 where t mean is the mean temperature of the ground surface δt surf is the amplitude of the variation in the surface temperature and t o is a phase constant with an internal boundary condition of t t t mean bergman et al 2011 the sub surface temperature profile at any depth or time is given by watson 1983 31 t z t t m e a n δ t s u r f e z π 365 α cos 2 π 365 t t o z 2 365 π α where α and z are the thermal diffusivity of the soil and the depth respectively note that in eq 31 α has a unit of m 2 day to calculate the performance of the eahe knowledge of the ambient air temperature the thermal diffusivity of the soil and the temperature of the soil at the installation depth is required the climatic data for the selected location hurghada egypt was collected from energyplus which presents hourly averaged data from a period of historical records typically 30 years representative of the location energyplus 2019a the thermal diffusivity of the soil could be determined from its density specific heat and thermal conductivity which were estimated as 2050 kg m 3 1840 j kg k and 0 52 w m k respectively bergman et al 2011 as seen in eq 31 to be able to calculate the soil temperature at a certain depth t mean δt surf and t o are required these first two values require the availability of long term surface temperature data which are in most cases not available however following watson and labs watson 1983 the value of the mean surface temperature can be approximated by adding 1 7 c to the average annual air temperature similarly the annual temperature variation from the mean surface temperature can be estimated by adding 1 1 c to one half the difference between the monthly average air temperatures of july and january these approximations have experimentally been shown valid for arid regions such as in kuwait al temeemi and harris 2001 moustafa et al 1981 the values of t mean and δt surf for hurghada egypt are 26 9 c and 8 5 c respectively the phase constant to is estimated following watson 1983 where the phase of the solar radiation lags behind the cyclic wave of surface temperature by 1 8 of a cycle or 46 days since the day of minimum solar radiation occurs on day 355 of the year watson 1983 then counting 46 days from that day the value of to is 36 which is the value used in the calculation accordingly the annual variation of the soil temperature at different depths can be estimated as shown in fig 3 it can be noted that the annual variation in soil temperature is only 0 5 c at a depth of 4 m and half that at 5 m depth 2 3 eahe modeling an eahe is a set of pipes buried underground to allow exchange of heat between the air in the pipe and the surrounding soil to simplify the analysis the vertical inlet and outlet pipes are insulated hence only the heat transfer in the horizontal pipe at depth is considered the convective heat transfer coefficient of the air flowing in the pipe is calculated from the nusselt number using h c o n v n u k a d p i p e i n n e r where the nusselt number is calculated using the dittus bolter correlation nu 0 023re 0 8 pr 0 3 bergman et al 2011 assuming a prefect contact between the soil and pipe wall the wall temperature can be considered to be equal to the sub soil temperature at installation depth which is an assumption that has been addressed previous studies de paepe and janssens 2003 bisoniya et al 2015 niu et al 2015 accordingly the eahe is treated as a heat exchanger with a constant wall temperature and the ntu effectiveness method can be used with ϵ 1 e ntu bergman et al 2011 de paepe and janssens 2003 where the effectiveness ϵ number of transfer units ntu and overall heat transfer coefficient u are given

i p e k p i p e the surface area is a pipe πd pipe outer l pipe and d pipe inner and d pipe outer are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe respectively accordingly for a given pipe length the outlet temperature of the air flowing through an eahe can be calculated from 35 t e o u t l e t t e i n l e t t z t t e i n l e t 1 e n t u the total power required by the fan to force the air through the eahe pipes is calculated from 36 f a n p o w e r δ p q a i r η f a n n e where q air is the volume flow rate of air through a single eahe in m 3 s the pressure drop δp is calculated as 37 δ p f l

mathematical model developed was validated against the experimental data reported in bisoniya et al 2015 the type of pipe used for the simulation was a pvc pipe with an inner diameter of 0 1016 m and the other parameters were taken from bisoniya et al 2015 where the measuring equipment are described in details the predicted outlet temperatures are compared against the experimental measurements for air velocities of 2 3 5 and 5 m s in table 2 the predictions have the same trend as the experiments with the outlet temperature increasing the temperature drop in the eahe decreasing with increasing air velocity the relative difference between the predicted and measured values of the temperature drop within the eahe varies between 2 4 and 14 8 showing that the model is much more accurate for slower speed flow the differences may be due to errors in the heat transfer correlation used the assumption that the ground around the eahe is at constant temperature or the neglect of the vertical pipes at either end of the eahe an air velocity of 2 m s was used for the rest of the study since it is recommended to have a lower air velocity in the pipe where the lower air velocity allows a longer contact time between the air and pipe and therefore the air effectively gets closer to the wall temperature agrawal et al 2018 since the error was only 2 4 for this condition the model was deemed suitable for the study 2 4 integrated model the mean hourly tmy data for a representative day of the warmest month i e august of hurghada egypt 27 26 n 33 81 e were used to compare the performance of the existing fan pad systems eahes and internal evaporative cooling it is seen in fig 4 that the selected location is characterized by a hot dry summer which is a challenging climate for agriculture as shown in the figure the maximum temperature is in excess of 30 c and exceeds the temperature range for cultivation of conventional crops american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 for instance the recommended temperature range for tomato plants is 20 30 c mahmood and al ansari 2021 therefore it can be concluded that a greenhouse with active cooling is required to maintain the temperature in the required range in such a harsh environment furthermore it should be noted that the relative humidity is another important parameter that should be maintained within the range of 50 80 american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 below that range the plant will be water stressed and above it the plant will be saturated which would make the plant prone to fungal infection and disturb its transpiration process mutwiwa et al 2006 considering this the relative humidity was to be controlled within the greenhouse by misting or dehumidification since the eahes are intended as a cooling mechanism for a closed greenhouse their operation was a closed cycled system with air being drawn from the greenhouse interior passing through the eahes and then returned to the greenhouse the parameters and dimensions of the greenhouse presented by in joudi and farhan 2015 were used for the case study for comparing the two cooling mechanisms the used parameters are presented in table 1 the thermo physical properties of the eahe used in the study are presented in table 3 however in our study we chose a pipe length of 50 m to eliminate near soil thermal saturation that might be caused by eahe warming up the soil under continuous operation that pipe length was a recommended strategy suggested in agrawal et al 2018 and peretti et al 2013 and was proven experimentally wei et al 2020 and minaei and safikhani 2021 to be sufficient for a negligible near soil saturation effect on the eahe performance a combined matlab code was developed to solve the set of equations which include the validated greenhouse numerical model sub soil temperature mathematical model and eahe mathematical model the study presents the following cases 1 ventilated greenhouse cooled using ambient air 2 ventilated greenhouse cooled using fan pad evaporative cooling system the benchmark case 3 closed greenhouse without cooling the reference case 4 closed greenhouse cooled using fogging only 5 closed greenhouse cooled using a single or multiple eahe pipes 6 closed greenhouse cooled using eahe and fogging 3 results and discussion 3 1 ventilated gh operation ventilation with and without fan pad cooling the simplest greenhouse cooling mechanism relies on exchange of the greenhouse air with the ambient through either natural or forced ventilation for a ventilated greenhouse the air exchange rate n v is the factor that controls the magnitude of the effect on the environment of the greenhouse interior and for natural ventilation this is difficult to accurately predict and control al helal et al 2015 therefore it is easier to control the greenhouse interior environment with forced ventilation kittas et al 2005 accordingly the simulation of this case was set by setting q w e v a p 0 and q e 0 in eq 13 and setting an input air exchange value n v for the term q v where it was calculated using eq 18 fig 5 shows the effect of ventilation on the interior temperature of the case study greenhouse located in hurghada egypt as the air exchange rate increases from n v 20 60 air changes per hour the greenhouse interior air temperature asymptotically approaches the ambient temperature as confirmed in american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 which shows the validity of our trend in fig 5 this figure also demonstrates the drawbacks of the method while it is an effective method for cooling in regions where the ambient air temperature is less than the maximum temperature for cultivation 30 c in hurghada the ambient temperature exceeds this throughout the day so ventilation is ultimately an ineffective strategy for locations where the ambient temperature exceeds the maximum allowable temperature one strategy is to decrease the ventilation air temperature from the ambient dry bulb temperature to the wet bulb temperature through the use of a fan pad evaporative cooling systems these systems are currently employed in dry hot arid regions al jamal 1994 al mulla 2006 al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 montero 2006 the effectiveness of these systems is dependent on the local ambient relative humidity since the lower the relative humidity is the lower the wet bulb temperature and hence more cooling could be performed hence these systems have the greatest potential for cooling in hot dry regions as seen in fig 5 there is a significant drop in the inlet air temperature when comparing the ambient temperature and ambient wet bulb temperature wbt attributed to the dry ambient air condition fig 4 the operation of fan pad system is set by replacing the term t amb by t amb wbt for the term q v in eq 18 as explained in the methodology section in the work al jamal 1994 it was reported that for the hot dry region of south east jordan a fan pad system with 20 air changes per hour n v 20 was sufficient to achieve a greenhouse temperature that was suitable for cultivation for hurghada which is another hot dry region where the hourly averaged relative humidity in summer is less than 40 for the majority of the day fig 8 using a fan pad system with 20 air changes per hour dropped the daily maximum temperature from 50 c to 36 c as shown in fig 5 and kept the greenhouse temperature below 30 c for majority of the day nevertheless it should be noted that hurghada has a higher humidity than the location studied in al jamal 1994 so a higher rate of ventilation might be expected to be needed indeed by doubling the ventilation air flow rate to 40 air changes per hour the peak interior temperature was reduced to approximately 32 c the trend that is common with the findings in al jamal 1994 and ghani et al 2020 confirms the validity of our findings in fig 5 since the ambient humidity ratio in hurghada is higher than that used in al jamal 1994 while the cooling potential per air change is reduced in hurghada the water consumption is similarly reduced as seen in table 4 increasing the number air changes per hour for the fan pad system from 20 to 40 doubled the amount of water consumed from 53 3 to 106 6 litre day 3 2 closed gh operation fogging misting and or earth air heat exchangers the operation of fan pad cooled ventilated greenhouse has shown in the previous section to provide significant temperature reduction to the greenhouse air keeping the greenhouse temperature below the maximum threshold 30 c for most hours of the day except midday however the amount of water required to provide the cooling is significantly high which is confirmed by this work and others al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 montero 2006 al mulla 2006 sabeh et al 2011 al helal et al 2004 tsafaras et al 2021 therefore in this section we shall examine the water saving potential of using a closed greenhouse while ensuring interior temperatures and relative humidities suitable for successful cultivation for setting a closed greenhouse system there is no ventilation i e q v 0 then we shall consider cooling the greenhouse via combinations of closed loop eahes or through fogging misting of the interior air 3 2 1 closed greenhouse with no cooling the simplest case of a closed greenhouse is with no cooling and in this case the interior climate is dependant on the properties of the greenhouse and the surrounding environment no cooling was provided for this case hence beside q v 0 the following energy flows in eq 13 were set to zero q w a t e r e v a p 0 and q e a h e 0 fig 6 shows the interior air temperature of the greenhouse and it can be seen that it peaks in the afternoon reaching a maximum of approximately 50 c not long after the solar radiation peaks at the same time the relative humidity drops to less than 20 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the humidity ratio remains almost constant during the day so it can be concluded that the changes in the relative humidity are primarily due to the changes in temperature assuming a small amount on the infiltration from the ambient while a closed greenhouse might prevent water loss from the greenhouse it can be seen that the interior temperature and humidity reached extreme values that are unsuitable for any cultivation and hence some form of cooling and possibly humidity control are necessary 3 2 2 cooling via fogging misting interior evaporative cooling in the second case a closed greenhouse with cooling only via fogging misting interior evaporative cooling was modeled the variable q w e v a p is the heat flow that sets the cooling provided in such case the maximum limit for the greenhouse relative humidity has been set to 80 so the evaporative cooling is limited by the quantity of water m w e v a p needed to be evaporated to reach this target and if the interior relative humidity equals or exceeds 80 no evaporation will take place and so no cooling can be provided from fig 6 it can be seen that interior evaporative cooling is only able to decrease the maximum interior temperature by 5 c during the middle of the day however the interior relative humidity at midday as shown in fig 6 is increased to approximately 75 although the relative humidity set point was 80 due to the time constant τ of 15 min 900 s for the controller based on observations of humidity an temperature control system of the environmental chamber at the university of auckland thermo fluid lab the relative humidity does not reach 80 this clearly shows that the high elevated level of relative humidity which is a result of a closed greenhouse operation sets a limitation to the fogging misting systems in supplying cooling to the greenhouse however it is beneficial in keeping a greenhouse indoor relative humidity within the range 50 80 that is favorable to cultivation american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 by integrating the water consumption rate in fig 6 the water consumption of the sprayed water was found to be 10 litre day 3 2 3 cooling via earth air heat exchangers eahes a single eahe we now consider the situation were cooling is provided by the use of a single eahe pipe which runs in a closed loop where the air is drawn from the gh through the pipe and then goes back to the gh through the eahe pipe outlet the cooling provided by the eahe is calculated from eq 17 where the number of eahe pipes n e is set to one as shown in fig 6 a single eahe can provide cooling during the middle of the day reducing the maximum internal temperature of the greenhouse by approximately 5 c this is on the same scale as using fogging misting interior evaporative cooling but without causing a change in the interior humidity levels fig 6 shows that there has been a small increase in the relative humidity compared to the closed greenhouse with no cooling which is due to the drop in temperature it should be noted that since it is a dry and hot environment the temperature of sub soil at the eahe installation depth is higher than the dew point temperature of the greenhouse air at the corresponding relative humidity and hence no condensation takes place within the eahe b multiple eahe pipes the cooling can be improved by using multiple eahe in parallel where the number of eahe is set by the variable n e in eq 17 fig 6 shows the greenhouse interior temperatures when using 5 or 10 eahe pipes it is observed that as the number of eahes increases the peak interior temperature of the greenhouse drops however limiting factors for the use of multiple eahes include 1 installation challenges for example land use efficiency and availability and eahe pipes spacing 2 increased installation cost and 3 increased running cost caused by higher pressure drop points one and two are beyond the scope of the present study however they should be considered for a given installation site which would set a constraint to the number of pipes to be installed but in general from a thermal point of view the higher the number of eahe pipes the better is the cooling capacity of the eahe installation as for the final point the power required by a fan to blow the air through the eahe pipe s are 0 8 4 and 8 watts for 1 5 and 10 pipes respectively and could easily be met by a solar photovoltaic installation especially since the power requirement is primarily needed during daylight the operation of eahe does show flexibility over fogging misting in terms of supplying cooling to a closed greenhouse depending on the sub soil temperature of eahe installation the cooling supplied by the eahes can be increased through increasing the number of operating pipes unlike fogging which is constricted by the relative humidity further no water usage is required to supply cooling and that is a main water saving advantage over fogging misting systems the operation of 10 eahe in parallel managed to drop the closed greenhouse temperature achieving a maximum recorded day peak of approximately 36 c without a penalty of a higher water consumption the relative humidity was found to get more stable as the number of eahe increases where 10 eahe maintained a relative humidity range between 35 and 50 3 2 4 cooling with both fogging misting and earth air heat exchangers finally we consider using both fogging misting and eahes to cool the greenhouse the fogging misting set point was kept at 80 relative humidity and 10 eahe pipes were used it is apparent in fig 6 that the addition of the fogging misting has only a minor effect on the interior temperature when compared to using 10 eahe pipes recording a peak day temperature of approximately 35 c however the addition of fogging misting had a significant effect on the interior relative humidity which increased to approximately 75 during the 24 h which is favorable for cultivation compared to below 50 under eahe operation only as seen in fig 6 as for water usage fig 6 shows that using the eahes decreased the evaporated water mass flow rate needed for fogging misting compared to using fogging misting alone by 50 with the daily water consumption dropping from 10 litre day to 5 litre day this is to be expected since the eahes decrease the interior dry bulb temperature thereby decreasing the saturation pressure and so the quantity of water needed to reach the set point relative humidity of the air is decreased 3 3 comparison of cooling strategies the fan pad misting fogging and eahe cooling methods are now examined with respect to controlling the greenhouse interior temperature relative humidity level and the water consumption fig 7 shows that the combined use of fogging misting with 10 eahes reduces the temperature to a similar value as the ventilated fan pad system with 20 air changes per hour with an approximately 1 c difference between the two while doubling the air exchange rate of the fan pad cooling system from 20 to 40 air changes per hour reduces the peak temperature by a further 3 c the peak temperature was remained at 32 c which is greater than the target temperature of 30 c during the early and late hours of the day the fan pad system dropped the temperature the most compared to the other cooling cases nevertheless all cases are found below the targeted temperature of 30 c while the fan pad and combined fogging misting with a eahe system achieved similar temperature reductions the daily water consumption shown in table 4 shows that a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse consumes significantly more water for cooling than a closed greenhouse for a 20 and 40 ventilation rates per hour the water lost to the ambient was 53 and 107 litre day respectively a closed greenhouse using both fogging misting and 10 eahes for cooling looses 10 5 and 21 times less water compared to the ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse with 20 and 40 air change per hour respectively recording only 5 litre day this demonstrates the water saving potential of the proposed closed greenhouse operation regarding the interior relative humidity the evaporative cooling technologies whether through fan pad system or fogging misting maintained a high relative humidity suitable for cultivation by introducing more water to the greenhouse indoor air and reducing the interior temperature as seen in fig 7 it is noticeable that for the case of fan pad system the interior relative humidity increases as the air exchange rate increases however it fluctuates throughout the day peaking in early hours of the day and troughs at noon during the peak temperature hour the difference between the maximum and minimum relative humidity is approximately 25 and 30 for fan pad cooling with 20 and 40 air changes per hour with relative humidity ranges of 45 75 and 58 83 respectively on the other hand the relative humidity for the cases of closed greenhouse stayed stable with lower fluctuations through the day for the case of eahe operation alone with 10 eahe pipes the relative humidity was between 33 and 50 where the increase in the relative humidity compared to the closed greenhouse with no cooling is due to the sensible cooling that eahe provides to the circulating air with the combined operation of the eahe and fogging misting the relative humidity was the most stable of all of the cases presented staying in the range 70 75 3 3 1 comparison over other summer months additional simulations were performed to determine if the trends in water consumption interior temperature and relative humidity observed for august were typical for the rest of the summer period data in fig fig 8 for a representative day for june july and september in hurghada egypt were used to define the exterior environment the daily total water consumption data for evaporative cooling systems shown in fig 9 confirm that fogging misting in a closed greenhouse consumes less water than ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse during the months of june and july the water consumption for all the cases were higher than that during the month of august despite the fact that the peak temperatures of these months were approximately the same this was attributed to the ambient relative humidity in july and june being lower than that in august as seen in fig 8 which shows the effect of dry weather on raising the level water consumption the addition of eahe cooling throughout the warm months consistently reduces the water required by the fogging misting cooling system by approximately 50 as presented in table 5 recording a water consumption of 6 litre day for june and july and 5 litre day for august and september looking at the case with the highest water consumption rate ventilated greenhouse at 40 air changes per hour with fan pad system it can be seen in table 5 a maximum value of 113 litre day in july despite that the relative humidity dropped to a minimum of 55 as shown in fig 11 on the other hand on the same month for the case of a closed greenhouse cooled with a fogging system and eahe the water consumption rate was much lower at 6 litre day recording a minimum relative humidity of 70 as illustrated in fig 11 with stable relative humidity of 70 75 that comparison evidently demonstrates an enhanced water usage through maintaining a favorable interior relative humidity also it shows the advantageous benefit of closed greenhouse operation which isolates the greenhouse interior from the dry ambient condition regarding the temperature extremes the minimum interior temperature for all cases does not fall below the minimum temperature for cultivation 20 c during the warm months as seen in fig 10 using the cooling strategies presented in this study none of the operation regimes was able to reduce the maximum greenhouse interior temperature below the recommended maximum temperature for cultivation 30 c suggesting that an additional cooling mechanism is required unless a crop that can tolerate a higher environmental temperature of 35 c is chosen for cultivation only a fan pad cooled greenhouse with 40 air changes per hour was able to decrease the maximum temperature to 32 c as shown in fig 10 but with a penalty of very high rate of water consumption as for the interior relative humidity it is stable at approximately 70 for the cases of a closed greenhouse with fogging misting as was seen in august fig 11 4 future work while a significant temperature reduction was achieved through the proposed closed greenhouse cooling system at noon hours the temperature was above the maximum desired value 30 c as demonstrated in fig 12 that summarizes our findings therefore future work should consider investigating additional cooling methods during the noon hours finally it should be noted that for simplicity no crop was modeled in the current study while the presence of the crop will affect the humidity and temperature of the greenhouse and so will be included in a future model the present model is sufficient to demonstrate the ability of the proposed closed eahe cooled greenhouse to reduce water consumption 5 conclusions the presented work provides a sustainable strategy to minimize the high water demand associated with the evaporative cooling methods that are currently in use to provide cooling to greenhouses in hot and arid regions the proposed strategy relies on a closed greenhouse that is cooled through eahe operating in a closed loop and fogging to control the interior temperature and relative humidity in a water efficient manner the objective of this study was to investigate the performance of the closed greenhouse under the proposed strategy and compare it against a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse as a benchmark and a closed greenhouse without cooling as the reference case to achieve that a numerical model for the greenhouse and the eahe have been developed and validated against experimental data collected from literature then simulations for the integrated model have been performed for the hot arid climate of hurghada egypt for a closed greenhouse with and without cooling and these have been compared against fan pad cooling which is currently used in hot arid regions the results indicated that the operation of 10 eahe pipes provided sufficient cooling for a closed greenhouse offering a non water reliant substitute to evaporative cooling methods the operation of eahe alongside the fogging system reduced its water consumption by 50 furthermore the operation of 10 eahe and the combined eahe and fogging operation maintained the temperature within the favorable cultivation temperature range 20 30 c for most hours of the representative days of the summer months except for the noon hours where it peaked at around 35 c similar to a ventilated greenhouse cooled via fan pad cooling system with 20 air changes per hour however the combined operation of eahe and fogging excelled at maintaining a more stable relative humidity at the optimal range 70 80 compared to the other strategies moreover from a water consumption perspective the water use was approximately tenfold less than that of the fan pad system showing a remarkable water saving and a more optimal water usage through the assessments presented in this study it can be concluded that the proposed closed greenhouse cooled via eahe and fogging is a sustainable water saving strategy suitable for hot arid regions that is an alternative to ventilated evaporatively cooled greenhouses future work will be focused on investigating additional cooling methods during the noon hours of the summer season and including the influence of crops on the greenhouse temperature and humidity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9263,evaporative cooling systems are the currently used technology for providing cooling to greenhouses in arid regions where typically the greenhouse is ventilated however they consume a large quantity of water to cool the air a closed greenhouse is proposed that uses earth air heat exchangers eahe and fogging to control the interior temperature and relative humidity in a water efficient manner a numerical model has been developed for the greenhouse and eahe and have been validated against experimental data collected from literature simulations are performed to compare the proposed closed greenhouse performance against the fan pad system in a ventilated greenhouse in maintaining a suitable temperature and humidity and to estimate the water usages the eahe reduced the water consumed by the fogging system by 50 and the maximum interior temperature from 50 c to 35 c the temperature reduction was found comparable to a fan pad system with a ventilation rate of 20 air changes per hour however with a more stable relative humidity at approximately 75 furthermore water used for cooling was lower by one tenth of that of the fan pad system reducing it from 53 litre day to 5

introduction greenhouses are a way to meet the growing global demand for food through the improvements in agricultural productivity they protect plants against adverse environmental conditions and enable planting during off seasons by maintaining the interior temperature to that is required for the crops growth for example in cold climates such as canada greenhouse cultivation is the only viable method for agriculture during the low temperatures experienced during winter enabling crops to be protected from snow and wind and to be maintained at a clement temperature brundrett 1979 henshaw 2017 in contrast in hot climates specialized greenhouses have been developed to maintain a cool internal climate for plant cultivation for example in the persian gulf region where the ambient temperature can exceed 40 c in the summer al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 davies 2005 cooling is necessary to maintain a temperature suitable for plant growth as such several studies have been concerned with the cooling technologies for greenhouses in tropical and subtropical regions kumar et al 2009 hot and arid regions ghani et al 2019 and for worldwide applications sethi and sharma 2007 it was reported that evaporative cooling methods are the most effective for cooling greenhouses in hot arid regions kumar et al 2009 ghani et al 2019 sethi and sharma 2007 evaporative cooling relies on the fact that as the water evaporates it absorbs heat from the air lowering its temperature these systems are based on the mechanical supply of water and the conversion of sensible heat into latent heat of evaporated water the total heat enthalpy of the air remains constant throughout the process however the technology consumes large quantities of water which is undesirable in regions where water is scarce al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 montero 2006 for instance 67 of the freshwater consumption for a greenhouse in oman is used by its fan pad evaporative cooling system al mulla 2006 furthermore the evaporative cooling potential for a fan pad system is limited by the ambient relative humidity and the higher the relative humidity is the lower the cooling potential hence the system is only effective in regions with hot dry weather kumar et al 2009 which are typically regions with a low availability of fresh water controlling the environment inside a greenhouse so that it is suitable for plant cultivation is demanding in terms of both energy and water consumption cuce et al 2016 researchers have studied sustainable energy technologies and energy saving techniques such as solar energy and thermal energy storage systems cuce et al 2016 cao et al 2019 berroug et al 2011 esen and yuksel 2013 magadley et al 2020 amara et al 2021 gorjian et al 2021 or wind energy pakari and ghani 2019 to meet these demands and minimize energy consumption other researchers have utilized shallow geothermal energy down to a depth of 4 m by using earth to air heat exchangers eahe to cool mongkon et al 2013 2014 yildiz et al 2011 2012 ozgener and ozgener 2010b or heat levit et al 1989 ozgener and ozgener 2010a ghosal and tiwari 2005 hegazy et al 2021 greenhouses it was reported that an eahe system had a higher potential to provide cooling in summer than heating in winter under the weather conditions experienced in new delhi india tiwari et al 2006 in hot dry and water scarce regions it is desirable to minimize water consumption and this can be affected in two ways by reducing the water usage necessary for evaporative cooling and through regulating the irrigation water to reduce the high fresh water demands of evaporative cooling in coastal locations seawater has been used in fan pad evaporative cooling systems and freshwater for crop cultivation has been generated with a condenser al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 this system reduced the freshwater needed for cooling however the quantity of freshwater produced may be insufficient for irrigation al mulla 2006 in addition the quantity of freshwater produced varied with season which made it an unreliable source of freshwater for continuous irrigation al mulla 2006 moreover the evaporatively cooled greenhouses developed in hot dry regions have been ventilated open greenhouses with a large number of air changes per hour to help reduce the interior temperature in the hot dry region of east south jordan the results in al jamal 1994 demonstrated that for the local climate 20 air changes per hour were required to maintain a temperature suitable for cultivation the high ventilation rate makes it harder to control the indoor relative humidity and so in dry climates the relative humidity inside the greenhouses are typically low which results in a high crop transpiration rate and therefore an increased requirement for irrigation water katsoulas et al 2015 a high ventilation rate reflects on a higher water loss to the ambient in the form of water vapor katsoulas et al 2015 and given that ventilation is used for temperature regulation pakari and ghani 2019 li et al 2017 akrami et al 2020 the addition of a cooling module to a greenhouse can reduce the required ventilation rate katsoulas et al 2015 the results presented in katsoulas et al 2015 have demonstrated that the addition of cooling at a rate of 170 w m 2 reduced the daily ventilation rate requirement by 50 however in the study the system that provided the cooling was not specified in addition the study confined itself to the climates of central europe the netherlands and the mediterranean greece and algeria and excluded the extreme conditions experienced in hot dry regions in such regions it is logical to think that the water loss due to ventilation is expected to be higher because of the significantly dryer ambient conditions therefore a closed greenhouse with a water efficient cooling module is hypothesized to be even more beneficial in such a scenario furthermore the interior humidity of such a closed greenhouse has been shown to be easier to control with less energy and water usage as compared to a ventilated greenhouse vadiee and martin 2013 one possible sustainable cooling mechanism that can be operated in a closed loop with the greenhouse yildiz et al 2011 2012 hepbasli 2013 ozgener and ozgener 2013 2011 ozgener et al 2011 hegazy et al 2021 is eahe which would consequently enable temperature regulation without the need to exchange air with the ambient through ventilation this is the water conservative cooling strategy that is proposed for hot arid regions in this work the objective of this study is to investigate the potential of eahe in providing cooling to a closed greenhouse in a hot arid climate and to compare that against a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse as a benchmark and a closed greenhouse without cooling as the reference case the assessment considers the interior air temperature air relative humidity and water consumption also the operation of fogging system alongside eahe is considered to enable controlling the humidity in the closed greenhouse and examine the fogging system cooling potential the novelty of this work is to develop a sustainable cooling system for closed greenhouse operation regime that would maintain the interior air temperature and relative humidity at a range suitable for cultivation yet consumes less water compared to current greenhouse evaporative cooling methods thereby we present for the first time to the authors knowledge a closed greenhouse cooling concept that relies on the combined operation of eahe and fogging that is developed for hot arid regions aiming at replacing the current water intensive ventilated evaporatively cooled greenhouses the location of hurghada egypt 27 26 n 33 81 e was selected to perform a case study analysis on a representative day of the warmest month of the year i e august using typical meteorological year tmy data typically 30 years energyplus 2019a the location lies in the far east of the eastern sahara desert at the edge of the red sea that location was selected based on it having a hot and dry climate that is challenging for plant cultivation and it being representative of the vast unused desert landscapes of egypt located far from the delta and the banks of the nile finally data is presented for the other warm months of the year to demonstrate the trends for august are typical for the entire summer period 2 methodology 2 1 semi closed greenhouse modeling the model used in the study has been developed based on the work presented in joudi and farhan 2015 the greenhouse was divided into five components the greenhouse cover the interior air the soil surface and two sub soil layers and then an energy balance is applied on each of these component to formulate a comprehensive greenhouse model fig 1 illustrates the heat flows between the greenhouse components and its surroundings the following assumptions are made 1 the greenhouse cover inside air and soil layers are considered as lumped systems with a uniform temperature joudi and farhan 2015 2 the interior air is assumed to be perfectly mixed 3 the interior air does not participate in radiation heat transfer 4 since it is a dry region condensation on the cover is unlikely as observed in tsafaras et al 2022 hence it was neglected such assumption is inline as well with studies in similar climate al jamal 1994 joudi and farhan 2015 5 the soil is assumed to have low moisture content and negligible evaporation takes place joudi and farhan 2015 6 for simplicity it is assumed that there is no crop inside the greenhouse al jamal 1994 joudi and farhan 2015 that empty greenhouse condition resembles the stage when crops are seeded or transplanted in commercial greenhouses lopez et al 2012 the energy balance equations for the greenhouse components are as follows 1 the energy balance for the greenhouse cover can be expressed as 1 ρ c c p c b a c d t c d t q s o l a r c q r a d c n e t q c o

greenhouse is controlled by spraying water i e fogging or misting inside and this can also be used to provide cooling assuming the sprayed water is completely evaporated into vapor then the cooling provided through water evaporation is 16 q w e v a p h f g m w e v a p where h fg is the latent heat of vaporization of water and is equal to 2 257 106 j kg cooling is also provided by passing the interior air through a total of n e earth air heat exchangers that operate in parallel the cooling provided by these is given by 17 q e n e m e c p a t e o u t l e t t i where m e is the air mass flow

t i when modeling a fan pad evaporatively cooled ventilated greenhouse as is currently in use in hot arid regions the term t amb which is the dry bulb temperature of the ambient air in eq 18 is replaced by the wet bulb temperature t amb wbt assuming the inlet air to the greenhouse after the fan pad is saturated air in other words the fan pad is assumed ideal with an efficiency of 100 in such case the water consumed by the ideal fan pad system is the amount of water that drops the ventilation air temperature from the ambient dry bulb temperature t amb to the wet bulb temperature t amb wbt that assumption was considered for simplicity and for easier comparison with the study al jamal 1994 for an arid region in jordan however it should be noted that in practice the efficiency might be lower than 100 and will not be constant during the day as shown in the experimental work in tsafaras et al 2021 nevertheless we accordingly modified eq 18 as follows 19 q v m v c p a t a m b w b t t i where for both cases m v ρ a v g h n v 3600 s h r otherwise for a closed greenhouse operation the ventilation heat flow is set to zero m v 0 3 the energy balance for the soil surface is 20 ρ s c p s δ

at a depth of 0 5 m where at that depth the diurnal surface temperature fluctuation is ceased as shown experimentally by florides and kalogirou 2005 pouloupatis et al 2011 and wu et al 2010 and numerically by singh and sharma 2017 the water mass balance within the greenhouse is given by 27 d m w g h d t m i n f ω a m b ω g h m w e v a p m v ω a m b ω g h where m i n f is the air exchange rate with the ambient air due to infiltration where m i n f ρ a v g h n i n f 3600 for a closed greenhouse m v is set to zero since the air exchange is limited to the uncontrolled infiltration phenomenon for the condition of a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse the third term on the r h s of eq 27 m v ω a m b ω g h is replaced by m v ω a m b w b t ω g h where ω amb wbt is the humidity ratio of saturated air at the ambient wet bulb temperature the humidity ratio is the ratio between the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air and is sometimes called specific humidity accordingly the humidity ratio of the greenhouse inside air ω gh is calculated from 28 ω g h m w g h ρ a v g h and the rate that water is evaporated inside the greenhouse to reach the desired greenhouse relative humidity level rh is 29 m w e v a p ω t a r g e t ω g h v g h ρ a τ where ω target is the humidity ratio hr of the inside air at the desired relative humidity rh level and τ is response time of the humidification system the energy and mass balance equations described above are ordinary differential equations odes that are solved using a matlab code that uses ode15s solver which is a variable step variable order solver based on the numerical differentiation formulas of orders 1 5 details on the method and algorithm can be found in shampine et al 2003 the initial temperatures for all the greenhouse components were assumed to be equal to t amb at the starting hour of the day similarly the initial greenhouse air relative humidity rh and humidity ratio were set to the ambient conditions the solver then stepped forward in time with the ambient input parameters being interpolated from tabulated data except for the greenhouse validation for the representative day of the month the whole 24 h data are cycled 5 times 5 whole days to minimize the dependence on the initial conditions 2 1 1 greenhouse model validation the greenhouse model was validated against the experimental data of a greenhouse in baghdad iraq joudi and farhan 2015 the input measured meteorological data provided for the days of 16 01 2013 and 17 01 2013 are shown in fig 2 and the properties of the greenhouse components and parameters used are listed in table 1 the measuring equipment are described in more details in the reference joudi and farhan 2015 the mean wind speeds for the two days were 2 78 and 1 84 m s respectively weather underground 2019 no cooling was provided in the experiment and so the following energy and mass flows were set to zero q w a t e r e v a p 0 q e a h e 0 q v 0 m w e v a p 0 m e a h e 0 m v 0 further since the greenhouse cover is vertical in the experiment the inclination angle of the cover β was set to 90 fig 2 shows the predicted temperature of the air inside the greenhouse compared with the experimental values the measured internal air temperature values were the average of six sensors installed inside the greenhouse as described in joudi and farhan 2015 it can be seen that the predicted temperatures are in good agreement with the instantaneous experimental measured values over the course of the two days recording an average absolute deviation aad of 1 5 c calculated from eq 30 where n is the total number of hours there is a larger discrepancy between the predicted and experimental values in the first 6 h of the simulation and this is attributed to the choice of the initial condition which set all temperatures to be equal to the ambient air temperature at the initial time the discrepancy that is occurring during the sun hours arose from using integrated not instantaneous measured solar radiation on the inclined roof as an input to the model in addition a fixed average wind speed on each day was used nevertheless it can be concluded that the model can accurately predict the greenhouse temperature 30 a a d 1 n h r 1 n t h r p r e d i c t e d t h r m e a s u r e d 2 2 soil temperature modeling the ground sub surface temperature varies with depth and time and is influenced by the soil s thermo physical properties and the ground surface temperature the sub surface temperature distribution was modeled as heat conduction through a semi infinite solid the soil thermal properties were assumed to be constant with depth and along the eahe pipe axial length while the ground surface temperature varies with time that variation is caused by the complex heat transfer interaction between the ground surface and the surroundings with the dominant mode of heat transfer being due to the solar load and convective heat transfer between the ambient air and the ground another heat load which is less significant in arid regions is evaporation occurring at moist ground surfaces and this was neglected in this study understanding those ground surface interactions it can be concluded that the surface temperature is mainly affected by the climatic conditions and since the climatic temperatures follow a cyclic behavior on annual basis the surface temperature history can be approximated as a sinusoidal temperature variation with time through the year watson 1983 by applying this cyclic temperature variation as a boundary condition at the surface of t 0 t t m e a n δ t s u r f cos ω t t o bergman et al 2011 where t mean is the mean temperature of the ground surface δt surf is the amplitude of the variation in the surface temperature and t o is a phase constant with an internal boundary condition of t t t mean bergman et al 2011 the sub surface temperature profile at any depth or time is given by watson 1983 31 t z t t m e a n δ t s u r f e z π 365 α cos 2 π 365 t t o z 2 365 π α where α and z are the thermal diffusivity of the soil and the depth respectively note that in eq 31 α has a unit of m 2 day to calculate the performance of the eahe knowledge of the ambient air temperature the thermal diffusivity of the soil and the temperature of the soil at the installation depth is required the climatic data for the selected location hurghada egypt was collected from energyplus which presents hourly averaged data from a period of historical records typically 30 years representative of the location energyplus 2019a the thermal diffusivity of the soil could be determined from its density specific heat and thermal conductivity which were estimated as 2050 kg m 3 1840 j kg k and 0 52 w m k respectively bergman et al 2011 as seen in eq 31 to be able to calculate the soil temperature at a certain depth t mean δt surf and t o are required these first two values require the availability of long term surface temperature data which are in most cases not available however following watson and labs watson 1983 the value of the mean surface temperature can be approximated by adding 1 7 c to the average annual air temperature similarly the annual temperature variation from the mean surface temperature can be estimated by adding 1 1 c to one half the difference between the monthly average air temperatures of july and january these approximations have experimentally been shown valid for arid regions such as in kuwait al temeemi and harris 2001 moustafa et al 1981 the values of t mean and δt surf for hurghada egypt are 26 9 c and 8 5 c respectively the phase constant to is estimated following watson 1983 where the phase of the solar radiation lags behind the cyclic wave of surface temperature by 1 8 of a cycle or 46 days since the day of minimum solar radiation occurs on day 355 of the year watson 1983 then counting 46 days from that day the value of to is 36 which is the value used in the calculation accordingly the annual variation of the soil temperature at different depths can be estimated as shown in fig 3 it can be noted that the annual variation in soil temperature is only 0 5 c at a depth of 4 m and half that at 5 m depth 2 3 eahe modeling an eahe is a set of pipes buried underground to allow exchange of heat between the air in the pipe and the surrounding soil to simplify the analysis the vertical inlet and outlet pipes are insulated hence only the heat transfer in the horizontal pipe at depth is considered the convective heat transfer coefficient of the air flowing in the pipe is calculated from the nusselt number using h c o n v n u k a d p i p e i n n e r where the nusselt number is calculated using the dittus bolter correlation nu 0 023re 0 8 pr 0 3 bergman et al 2011 assuming a prefect contact between the soil and pipe wall the wall temperature can be considered to be equal to the sub soil temperature at installation depth which is an assumption that has been addressed previous studies de paepe and janssens 2003 bisoniya et al 2015 niu et al 2015 accordingly the eahe is treated as a heat exchanger with a constant wall temperature and the ntu effectiveness method can be used with ϵ 1 e ntu bergman et al 2011 de paepe and janssens 2003 where the effectiveness ϵ number of transfer units ntu and overall heat transfer coefficient u are given by 32 ϵ t e i n l e t t e o u t l e t t e i n l e t t z t 33 n t u u a p i p e m e c p a 34 1 u a p i p e 1 π d p i p e i n n e r l p i p e h c o n v ln d p i p e o u t e r d p i p e i n n e r 2 π l p i p e k p i p e the surface area is a pipe πd pipe outer l pipe and d pipe inner and d pipe outer are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe respectively accordingly for a given pipe length the outlet temperature of the air flowing through an eahe can be calculated from 35 t e o u t l e t t e i n l e t t z t t e i n l e t 1 e n t u the total power required by the fan to force the air through the eahe pipes is calculated from 36 f a n p o w e r δ p q a i r η f a n n e where q air is the volume flow rate of air through a single eahe in m 3 s the pressure drop δp is calculated as 37 δ p f l p i p e d p i p e i n n e r ρ a v a 2 2 where for a smooth pipe pvc de paepe and janssens 2003 the friction coefficient is estimated by 38 f 1 82 log r e 1 64 2 2 3 1 eahe model validation the eahe mathematical model developed was validated against the experimental data reported in bisoniya et al 2015 the type of pipe used for the simulation was a pvc pipe with an inner diameter of 0 1016 m and the other parameters were taken from bisoniya et al 2015 where the measuring equipment are described in details the predicted outlet temperatures are compared against the experimental measurements for air velocities of 2 3 5 and 5 m s in table 2 the predictions have the same trend as the experiments with the outlet temperature increasing the temperature drop in the eahe decreasing with increasing air velocity the relative difference between the predicted and measured values of the temperature drop within the eahe varies between 2 4 and 14 8 showing that the model is much more accurate for slower speed flow the differences may be due to errors in the heat transfer correlation used the assumption that the ground around the eahe is at constant temperature or the neglect of the vertical pipes at either end of the eahe an air velocity of 2 m s was used for the rest of the study since it is recommended to have a lower air velocity in the pipe where the lower air velocity allows a longer contact time between the air and pipe and therefore the air effectively gets closer to the wall temperature agrawal et al 2018 since the error was only 2 4 for this condition the model was deemed suitable for the study 2 4 integrated model the mean hourly tmy data for a representative day of the warmest month i e august of hurghada egypt 27 26 n 33 81 e were used to compare the performance of the existing fan pad systems eahes and internal evaporative cooling it is seen in fig 4 that the selected location is characterized by a hot dry summer which is a challenging climate for agriculture as shown in the figure the maximum temperature is in excess of 30 c and exceeds the temperature range for cultivation of conventional crops american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 for instance the recommended temperature range for tomato plants is 20 30 c mahmood and al ansari 2021 therefore it can be concluded that a greenhouse with active cooling is required to maintain the temperature in the required range in such a harsh environment furthermore it should be noted that the relative humidity is another important parameter that should be maintained within the range of 50 80 american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 below that range the plant will be water stressed and above it the plant will be saturated which would make the plant prone to fungal infection and disturb its transpiration process mutwiwa et al 2006 considering this the relative humidity was to be controlled within the greenhouse by misting or dehumidification since the eahes are intended as a cooling mechanism for a closed greenhouse their operation was a closed cycled system with air being drawn from the greenhouse interior passing through the eahes and then returned to the greenhouse the parameters and dimensions of the greenhouse presented by in joudi and farhan 2015 were used for the case study for comparing the two cooling mechanisms the used parameters are presented in table 1 the thermo physical properties of the eahe used in the study are presented in table 3 however in our study we chose a pipe length of 50 m to eliminate near soil thermal saturation that might be caused by eahe warming up the soil under continuous operation that pipe length was a recommended strategy suggested in agrawal et al 2018 and peretti et al 2013 and was proven experimentally wei et al 2020 and minaei and safikhani 2021 to be sufficient for a negligible near soil saturation effect on the eahe performance a combined matlab code was developed to solve the set of equations which include the validated greenhouse numerical model sub soil temperature mathematical model and eahe mathematical model the study presents the following cases 1 ventilated greenhouse cooled using ambient air 2 ventilated greenhouse cooled using fan pad evaporative cooling system the benchmark case 3 closed greenhouse without cooling the reference case 4 closed greenhouse cooled using fogging only 5 closed greenhouse cooled using a single or multiple eahe pipes 6 closed greenhouse cooled using eahe and fogging 3 results and discussion 3 1 ventilated gh operation ventilation with and without fan pad cooling the simplest greenhouse cooling mechanism relies on exchange of the greenhouse air with the ambient through either natural or forced ventilation for a ventilated greenhouse the air exchange rate n v is the factor that controls the magnitude of the effect on the environment of the greenhouse interior and for natural ventilation this is difficult to accurately predict and control al helal et al 2015 therefore it is easier to control the greenhouse interior environment with forced ventilation kittas et al 2005 accordingly the simulation of this case was set by setting q w e v a p 0 and q e 0 in eq 13 and setting an input air exchange value n v for the term q v where it was calculated using eq 18 fig 5 shows the effect of ventilation on the interior temperature of the case study greenhouse located in hurghada egypt as the air exchange rate increases from n v 20 60 air changes per hour the greenhouse interior air temperature asymptotically approaches the ambient temperature as confirmed in american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 which shows the validity of our trend in fig 5 this figure also demonstrates the drawbacks of the method while it is an effective method for cooling in regions where the ambient air temperature is less than the maximum temperature for cultivation 30 c in hurghada the ambient temperature exceeds this throughout the day so ventilation is ultimately an ineffective strategy for locations where the ambient temperature exceeds the maximum allowable temperature one strategy is to decrease the ventilation air temperature from the ambient dry bulb temperature to the wet bulb temperature through the use of a fan pad evaporative cooling systems these systems are currently employed in dry hot arid regions al jamal 1994 al mulla 2006 al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 montero 2006 the effectiveness of these systems is dependent on the local ambient relative humidity since the lower the relative humidity is the lower the wet bulb temperature and hence more cooling could be performed hence these systems have the greatest potential for cooling in hot dry regions as seen in fig 5 there is a significant drop in the inlet air temperature when comparing the ambient temperature and ambient wet bulb temperature wbt attributed to the dry ambient air condition fig 4 the operation of fan pad system is set by replacing the term t amb by t amb wbt for the term q v in eq 18 as explained in the methodology section in the work al jamal 1994 it was reported that for the hot dry region of south east jordan a fan pad system with 20 air changes per hour n v 20 was sufficient to achieve a greenhouse temperature that was suitable for cultivation for hurghada which is another hot dry region where the hourly averaged relative humidity in summer is less than 40 for the majority of the day fig 8 using a fan pad system with 20 air changes per hour dropped the daily maximum temperature from 50 c to 36 c as shown in fig 5 and kept the greenhouse temperature below 30 c for majority of the day nevertheless it should be noted that hurghada has a higher humidity than the location studied in al jamal 1994 so a higher rate of ventilation might be expected to be needed indeed by doubling the ventilation air flow rate to 40 air changes per hour the peak interior temperature was reduced to approximately 32 c the trend that is common with the findings in al jamal 1994 and ghani et al 2020 confirms the validity of our findings in fig 5 since the ambient humidity ratio in hurghada is higher than that used in al jamal 1994 while the cooling potential per air change is reduced in hurghada the water consumption is similarly reduced as seen in table 4 increasing the number air changes per hour for the fan pad system from 20 to 40 doubled the amount of water consumed from 53 3 to 106 6 litre day 3 2 closed gh operation fogging misting and or earth air heat exchangers the operation of fan pad cooled ventilated greenhouse has shown in the previous section to provide significant temperature reduction to the greenhouse air keeping the greenhouse temperature below the maximum threshold 30 c for most hours of the day except midday however the amount of water required to provide the cooling is significantly high which is confirmed by this work and others al ismaili and jayasuriya 2016 montero 2006 al mulla 2006 sabeh et al 2011 al helal et al 2004 tsafaras et al 2021 therefore in this section we shall examine the water saving potential of using a closed greenhouse while ensuring interior temperatures and relative humidities suitable for successful cultivation for setting a closed greenhouse system there is no ventilation i e q v 0 then we shall consider cooling the greenhouse via combinations of closed loop eahes or through fogging misting of the interior air 3 2 1 closed greenhouse with no cooling the simplest case of a closed greenhouse is with no cooling and in this case the interior climate is dependant on the properties of the greenhouse and the surrounding environment no cooling was provided for this case hence beside q v 0 the following energy flows in eq 13 were set to zero q w a t e r e v a p 0 and q e a h e 0 fig 6 shows the interior air temperature of the greenhouse and it can be seen that it peaks in the afternoon reaching a maximum of approximately 50 c not long after the solar radiation peaks at the same time the relative humidity drops to less than 20 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the humidity ratio remains almost constant during the day so it can be concluded that the changes in the relative humidity are primarily due to the changes in temperature assuming a small amount on the infiltration from the ambient while a closed greenhouse might prevent water loss from the greenhouse it can be seen that the interior temperature and humidity reached extreme values that are unsuitable for any cultivation and hence some form of cooling and possibly humidity control are necessary 3 2 2 cooling via fogging misting interior evaporative cooling in the second case a closed greenhouse with cooling only via fogging misting interior evaporative cooling was modeled the variable q w e v a p is the heat flow that sets the cooling provided in such case the maximum limit for the greenhouse relative humidity has been set to 80 so the evaporative cooling is limited by the quantity of water m w e v a p needed to be evaporated to reach this target and if the interior relative humidity equals or exceeds 80 no evaporation will take place and so no cooling can be provided from fig 6 it can be seen that interior evaporative cooling is only able to decrease the maximum interior temperature by 5 c during the middle of the day however the interior relative humidity at midday as shown in fig 6 is increased to approximately 75 although the relative humidity set point was 80 due to the time constant τ of 15 min 900 s for the controller based on observations of humidity an temperature control system of the environmental chamber at the university of auckland thermo fluid lab the relative humidity does not reach 80 this clearly shows that the high elevated level of relative humidity which is a result of a closed greenhouse operation sets a limitation to the fogging misting systems in supplying cooling to the greenhouse however it is beneficial in keeping a greenhouse indoor relative humidity within the range 50 80 that is favorable to cultivation american society of heating inc ashrae and engineers 2019 by integrating the water consumption rate in fig 6 the water consumption of the sprayed water was found to be 10 litre day 3 2 3 cooling via earth air heat exchangers eahes a single eahe we now consider the situation were cooling is provided by the use of a single eahe pipe which runs in a closed loop where the air is drawn from the gh through the pipe and then goes back to the gh through the eahe pipe outlet the cooling provided by the eahe is calculated from eq 17 where the number of eahe pipes n e is set to one as shown in fig 6 a single eahe can provide cooling during the middle of the day reducing the maximum internal temperature of the greenhouse by approximately 5 c this is on the same scale as using fogging misting interior evaporative cooling but without causing a change in the interior humidity levels fig 6 shows that there has been a small increase in the relative humidity compared to the closed greenhouse with no cooling which is due to the drop in temperature it should be noted that since it is a dry and hot environment the temperature of sub soil at the eahe installation depth is higher than the dew point temperature of the greenhouse air at the corresponding relative humidity and hence no condensation takes place within the eahe b multiple eahe pipes the cooling can be improved by using multiple eahe in parallel where the number of eahe is set by the variable n e in eq 17 fig 6 shows the greenhouse interior temperatures when using 5 or 10 eahe pipes it is observed that as the number of eahes increases the peak interior temperature of the greenhouse drops however limiting factors for the use of multiple eahes include 1 installation challenges for example land use efficiency and availability and eahe pipes spacing 2 increased installation cost and 3 increased running cost caused by higher pressure drop points one and two are beyond the scope of the present study however they should be considered for a given installation site which would set a constraint to the number of pipes to be installed but in general from a thermal point of view the higher the number of eahe pipes the better is the cooling capacity of the eahe installation as for the final point the power required by a fan to blow the air through the eahe pipe s are 0 8 4 and 8 watts for 1 5 and 10 pipes respectively and could easily be met by a solar photovoltaic installation especially since the power requirement is primarily needed during daylight the operation of eahe does show flexibility over fogging misting in terms of supplying cooling to a closed greenhouse depending on the sub soil temperature of eahe installation the cooling supplied by the eahes can be increased through increasing the number of operating pipes unlike fogging which is constricted by the relative humidity further no water usage is required to supply cooling and that is a main water saving advantage over fogging misting systems the operation of 10 eahe in parallel managed to drop the closed greenhouse temperature achieving a maximum recorded day peak of approximately 36 c without a penalty of a higher water consumption the relative humidity was found to get more stable as the number of eahe increases where 10 eahe maintained a relative humidity range between 35 and 50 3 2 4 cooling with both fogging misting and earth air heat exchangers finally we consider using both fogging misting and eahes to cool the greenhouse the fogging misting set point was kept at 80 relative humidity and 10 eahe pipes were used it is apparent in fig 6 that the addition of the fogging misting has only a minor effect on the interior temperature when compared to using 10 eahe pipes recording a peak day temperature of approximately 35 c however the addition of fogging misting had a significant effect on the interior relative humidity which increased to approximately 75 during the 24 h which is favorable for cultivation compared to below 50 under eahe operation only as seen in fig 6 as for water usage fig 6 shows that using the eahes decreased the evaporated water mass flow rate needed for fogging misting compared to using fogging misting alone by 50 with the daily water consumption dropping from 10 litre day to 5 litre day this is to be expected since the eahes decrease the interior dry bulb temperature thereby decreasing the saturation pressure and so the quantity of water needed to reach the set point relative humidity of the air is decreased 3 3 comparison of cooling strategies the fan pad misting fogging and eahe cooling methods are now examined with respect to controlling the greenhouse interior temperature relative humidity level and the water consumption fig 7 shows that the combined use of fogging misting with 10 eahes reduces the temperature to a similar value as the ventilated fan pad system with 20 air changes per hour with an approximately 1 c difference between the two while doubling the air exchange rate of the fan pad cooling system from 20 to 40 air changes per hour reduces the peak temperature by a further 3 c the peak temperature was remained at 32 c which is greater than the target temperature of 30 c during the early and late hours of the day the fan pad system dropped the temperature the most compared to the other cooling cases nevertheless all cases are found below the targeted temperature of 30 c while the fan pad and combined fogging misting with a eahe system achieved similar temperature reductions the daily water consumption shown in table 4 shows that a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse consumes significantly more water for cooling than a closed greenhouse for a 20 and 40 ventilation rates per hour the water lost to the ambient was 53 and 107 litre day respectively a closed greenhouse using both fogging misting and 10 eahes for cooling looses 10 5 and 21 times less water compared to the ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse with 20 and 40 air change per hour respectively recording only 5 litre day this demonstrates the water saving potential of the proposed closed greenhouse operation regarding the interior relative humidity the evaporative cooling technologies whether through fan pad system or fogging misting maintained a high relative humidity suitable for cultivation by introducing more water to the greenhouse indoor air and reducing the interior temperature as seen in fig 7 it is noticeable that for the case of fan pad system the interior relative humidity increases as the air exchange rate increases however it fluctuates throughout the day peaking in early hours of the day and troughs at noon during the peak temperature hour the difference between the maximum and minimum relative humidity is approximately 25 and 30 for fan pad cooling with 20 and 40 air changes per hour with relative humidity ranges of 45 75 and 58 83 respectively on the other hand the relative humidity for the cases of closed greenhouse stayed stable with lower fluctuations through the day for the case of eahe operation alone with 10 eahe pipes the relative humidity was between 33 and 50 where the increase in the relative humidity compared to the closed greenhouse with no cooling is due to the sensible cooling that eahe provides to the circulating air with the combined operation of the eahe and fogging misting the relative humidity was the most stable of all of the cases presented staying in the range 70 75 3 3 1 comparison over other summer months additional simulations were performed to determine if the trends in water consumption interior temperature and relative humidity observed for august were typical for the rest of the summer period data in fig fig 8 for a representative day for june july and september in hurghada egypt were used to define the exterior environment the daily total water consumption data for evaporative cooling systems shown in fig 9 confirm that fogging misting in a closed greenhouse consumes less water than ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse during the months of june and july the water consumption for all the cases were higher than that during the month of august despite the fact that the peak temperatures of these months were approximately the same this was attributed to the ambient relative humidity in july and june being lower than that in august as seen in fig 8 which shows the effect of dry weather on raising the level water consumption the addition of eahe cooling throughout the warm months consistently reduces the water required by the fogging misting cooling system by approximately 50 as presented in table 5 recording a water consumption of 6 litre day for june and july and 5 litre day for august and september looking at the case with the highest water consumption rate ventilated greenhouse at 40 air changes per hour with fan pad system it can be seen in table 5 a maximum value of 113 litre day in july despite that the relative humidity dropped to a minimum of 55 as shown in fig 11 on the other hand on the same month for the case of a closed greenhouse cooled with a fogging system and eahe the water consumption rate was much lower at 6 litre day recording a minimum relative humidity of 70 as illustrated in fig 11 with stable relative humidity of 70 75 that comparison evidently demonstrates an enhanced water usage through maintaining a favorable interior relative humidity also it shows the advantageous benefit of closed greenhouse operation which isolates the greenhouse interior from the dry ambient condition regarding the temperature extremes the minimum interior temperature for all cases does not fall below the minimum temperature for cultivation 20 c during the warm months as seen in fig 10 using the cooling strategies presented in this study none of the operation regimes was able to reduce the maximum greenhouse interior temperature below the recommended maximum temperature for cultivation 30 c suggesting that an additional cooling mechanism is required unless a crop that can tolerate a higher environmental temperature of 35 c is chosen for cultivation only a fan pad cooled greenhouse with 40 air changes per hour was able to decrease the maximum temperature to 32 c as shown in fig 10 but with a penalty of very high rate of water consumption as for the interior relative humidity it is stable at approximately 70 for the cases of a closed greenhouse with fogging misting as was seen in august fig 11 4 future work while a significant temperature reduction was achieved through the proposed closed greenhouse cooling system at noon hours the temperature was above the maximum desired value 30 c as demonstrated in fig 12 that summarizes our findings therefore future work should consider investigating additional cooling methods during the noon hours finally it should be noted that for simplicity no crop was modeled in the current study while the presence of the crop will affect the humidity and temperature of the greenhouse and so will be included in a future model the present model is sufficient to demonstrate the ability of the proposed closed eahe cooled greenhouse to reduce water consumption 5 conclusions the presented work provides a sustainable strategy to minimize the high water demand associated with the evaporative cooling methods that are currently in use to provide cooling to greenhouses in hot and arid regions the proposed strategy relies on a closed greenhouse that is cooled through eahe operating in a closed loop and fogging to control the interior temperature and relative humidity in a water efficient manner the objective of this study was to investigate the performance of the closed greenhouse under the proposed strategy and compare it against a ventilated fan pad cooled greenhouse as a benchmark and a closed greenhouse without cooling as the reference case to achieve that a numerical model for the greenhouse and the eahe have been developed and validated against experimental data collected from literature then simulations for the integrated model have been performed for the hot arid climate of hurghada egypt for a closed greenhouse with and without cooling and these have been compared against fan pad cooling which is currently used in hot arid regions the results indicated that the operation of 10 eahe pipes provided sufficient cooling for a closed greenhouse offering a non water reliant substitute to evaporative cooling methods the operation of eahe alongside the fogging system reduced its water consumption by 50 furthermore the operation of 10 eahe and the combined eahe and fogging operation maintained the temperature within the favorable cultivation temperature range 20 30 c for most hours of the representative days of the summer months except for the noon hours where it peaked at around 35 c similar to a ventilated greenhouse cooled via fan pad cooling system with 20 air changes per hour however the combined operation of eahe and fogging excelled at maintaining a more stable relative humidity at the optimal range 70 80 compared to the other strategies moreover from a water consumption perspective the water use was approximately tenfold less than that of the fan pad system showing a remarkable water saving and a more optimal water usage through the assessments presented in this study it can be concluded that the proposed closed greenhouse cooled via eahe and fogging is a sustainable water saving strategy suitable for hot arid regions that is an alternative to ventilated evaporatively cooled greenhouses future work will be focused on investigating additional cooling methods during the noon hours of the summer season and including the influence of crops on the

corresponding author handling editor enrique fernández alternate wetting drying awd is known to reduced water use and at the same time also reduced greenhouse gas ghg emissions from rice fields the

the implementation of awd on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and gwp expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice system in terms of ghg mitigation action and saving irrigation water keywords agriculture water management water productivity biochar compost soil factors greenhouse gases ghg emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s population has grown rapidly to almost 8 billion people more than half of whom depend on rice as their staple food haque et al 2014 to meet demand as the population continues to grow rice farmers will need to increase production by 114 mt by the year 2035 despite several threats including declining arable land labor and water for agriculture increased costs for all the inputs and worsened impacts of climate change redfern et al 2012 climate change is caused by a substantial increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions into the atmosphere the anthropogenic ghg emissions was estimated for about 59 6 6 gt co2 eq in 2019 pudcha et al 2022 agriculture is one of the most significant sources producing 13 of the global ghg emissions during the 55 year time period between 1961 and 2016 ghg emissions from anthropogenic sources related to agricultural activities increased from 3 1 gt co2 e yr 1 to 5 8 gt co2 e yr 1 ipcc 2018a methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o from activities related to agriculture contributed about 60 and 38 respectively to the total ghg emissions globally ipcc 2018b zhao et al 2019 these ghg have a large impact on global warming because respectively they have warming potentials that are 28 and 265 times greater than that of co2 ipcc 2013 globally irrigated rice fields which are typically maintained under continuous flooded conditions occupy about 60 of the total 158 m ha world rice area rao et al 2017 this irrigated rice field are considered as the main contributor to the methane emission from agriculture rice consumes an estimated 40 1 of the total world s irrigation water which represent 24 30 of the total developed fresh water resources the demand of freshwater for human needs as the population grows will out competes the water supply for irrigation besides continuously flooded rice also has been widely shown to emit large amounts of ch4 flooded rice fields contribute about 493 723 mt co2e year 1 to the global ch4 emissions eickemeier et al 2014 thus many rice producing countries face the challenge of reducing ch4 emissions and water use from rice cultivation while maintaining or even increasing yield study by yagi et al 2019 stated that alternate wetting and drying awd is a promising option to mitigate ch4 emission and also save water in asia this would be an ideal option to mitigate the challenge of water scarcity and ghg emission over 90 of the world s rice is produced and consumed in asia in order to save water and simultaneously reduce ch4 emissions many rice producing countries across south east asia and china have implemented awd as an irrigation management system for rice lampayan et al 2015 under awd practices the rice field are not always in continuously flooded condition the irrigation water is allowed to dry out for a certain number of days ye et al 2013 before re irrigated and so the soil water regime is in alternately aerobic and anaerobic condition tan et al 2013 safe awd is when re irrigation was applying whenever the water level fall below the soil surface of 15 cm and kept the field in flooded condition during flowering stage setyanto et al 2018 methane emission was suppressed due to the availability of oxygen during dry period of the field on the other hand this condition leads to triggering n2o emission lagomarsino et al 2016 awd was reported could suppress ch4 emission by 25 80 compare to continuously flooding irrigation chidthaisong et al 2018 islam et al 2020 setyanto et al 2018 sriphirom et al 2019 tran et al 2018 but there are also studies that show an increase in n2o emission with the implementation of awd islam et al 2020 sibayan et al 2018 sriphirom et al 2019 during the aerobic conditions of the drying period the abundance of oxygen o2 leads to the production of n2o by the nitrification process sriphirom et al 2019 in addition the rice yield from awd is variable some studies show an increasing of rice yield as compared to continuously flooding irrigation system song et al 2021 2019 other studies show a decrease of yield lagomarsino et al 2016 sriphirom et al 2019 and others show no effect of awd implementation on yield compare to continuously flooding irrigation chidthaisong et al 2018 islam et al 2020 setyanto et al 2018 however due to repeated changes between wetting and drying of the soil in this irrigation system cracks in the soil may occured which result in loss of nutrients from the topsoil hamoud et al 2018 this soil cracks are worsened on a fine soil texture which rich in clay soil also loses surface moisture during dry conditions under these alternating between aerobic and anaerobic ecosystems organic carbon and soil nitrogen may be lost due to heterotrophic microbial activity hamoud et al 2019 this negative impact of awd irrigation may not be seen in the short term study but in the long term it is likely to reduce soil productivity soil organic carbon enrichment plays an important role in soil physical and chemical properties to increase crop productivity the addition of organic matter is known to increase soil fertility by increasing nutrients and improving soil structure thereby increasing crop productivity and increasing crop yields chen et al 2021 previous research suggested the application of organic matter mixture in a stable form such as compost and biochar into rice cultivation systems kim et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 other studies have also indicated that the simultaneous application of biochar and compost resulted in enhanced soil fertility by increasing soil organic matter content water holding capacity crop yield carbon sequestration nutrient concentration increasing nutrient uptake and retention in the soil agegnehu et al 2015 mensah and frimpong 2018 therefore combining the addition of biochar compost with awd irrigation is expected to effectively enhanced field productivity in a longer term in addition to field management practices ghg emissions from rice fields are also influenced by edaphic factor such as soil texture brye et al 2016 2013 ishfaq et al 2020 ideally rice is cultivated in finely textured soil rich in nutrients lal 1985 but rice is actually grown in soil with various textures brye et al 2013 a 20 year field experiment 1990 2010 on rice cultivation in a field in northeast china confirmed the significantly higher ch4 emissions from sandy loam soil textures compared with finer textured soil due to the differences in soil porosity zhang et al 2012 studies in us stated the importance to consider soil texture to quantify ch4 emission from rice field brye et al 2013 numerous studies in south east asia have reported ch4 emissions from clay and silty clay soils to generally not exceed 200 kg ch4 ha 1 season 1 chidthaisong et al 2018 sibayan et al 2018 whereas others have reported ch4 emissions from silt loam and coarser textured soils in excess of 500 kg ch4 ha 1 season 1 setyanto et al 2018 tran et al 2018 when applying awd the number of non flooded days of soil between irrigations can vary from 1 to more than 10 days depending on the number of factors such as soil texture evaporation transpiration rainfall and crop growth stage rice in indonesia as the third larger rice producer in the world is mostly growing on loam or clay soil researchers have documented that ch4 emissions are lower in clay soils than silt loam soils in indonesia susilawati et al 2015 many studies on awd have been conducted but they mainly focused on the effect on grain yield the efficiency of water and nitrogen use and ch4 emissions however studies concerning the effect of awd irrigation on contrasting soil textures i e coarse texture and finer texture in terms of water use ch4 as well as n2o emission and gwp are still lacking this study aimed to demonstrate the influence of awd and biochar compost amendment as well as their interaction to water use ch4 emission n2o emission and gwp on different soil textures to provide new insight into the mitigation actions in the rice systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites field experiments were conducted on a silt loam soil representing coarse soil texture aeric endoaquepts at the research station of the indonesian agricultural environment research institute iaeri jakenan 6 46 44 south and 1110 11 54 east and on a silty clay soil representing finer soil texture ustic endoaquerts at wedarijaksa s farmers field 6 40 10 south and 1110 05 29 east during the 2020 dry season march june the location of the experimental sites is shown in fig 1 the timing of the study during the dry season was based on previous studies which demonstrated that awd worked best when implemented during the dry season sriphirom et al 2019 yagi et al 2019 the study areas at both sites had been used to cultivate rice continually for at least 10 years the crop residues were commonly left at a height of about 10 cm after harvest and immersed at a depth of 10 cm upon soil ploughing before the next season both sites are at an elevation of approximately 40 m above sea level and the average annual mean air temperature is 30 c with annual precipitation of 1503 2170 mm the daily max min air temperature and precipitation during the experiment at each site were presented in figs 2 and 3 2 2 experimental design and treatments the field experiment was laid out in a two factor split plot design with three replications water management act as the main plot and biochar compost amendment as the sub plot the plots sized 5 5 m the water management systems tested were continuous flooding cf and awd plastics covers were inserted around the cf plots to a depth of 40 cm to prevent water leakage the water level for the cf plots was maintained at 3 5 cm above the soil surface from 3 to 5 days after sowing until it was drained for 7 10 days during harvest the awd method implemented was a safe awd system as described by sander et al 2015 the plots were flooded to 5 cm whenever the water level dropped to 15 cm below the soil surface we use 1 m long perforated pvc pipes inserted into each plot to monitored the water level every day these cycles started 10 days after sowing and continued until a week before harvest each plot was independently irrigated by pumping water from a reservoir at jakenan and from groundwater at wedarijaksa for the addition of biocharand compost we used a mixture of compost and rice husk biochar in the ratio of 4 1 at different dosages e g 0 t ha 1 bc0 5 t ha 1 bc5 and 10 t ha 1 bc10 the biochar compost bc contained organic carbon 14 97 nitrogen 0 36 phosphorus 1 5 and potassium 7 2 rice husk biochar was produced by pyrolysis at a temperature of 300 c bc was applied after soil puddling at five days before transplanting 2 3 initial soil properties and analysis soil samples were collected before bc application in each plot the samples were taken three points randomly and then mixed it into one soil sample the soil was analyzed for ph 1 5 soil water suspension electrical conductivity 1 5 soil water suspension total n kjeldahl distillation method c organic walkey black method texture pipette method total p olsen bray method and total k morgan wolf method the total iron and manganese contents of air dried soil were tested by atomic absorption spectrophotometer a240fs varian australia the detection limits were determined to be 0 0083 and 0 0021 mg l respectively core sampler with 5 4 cm diameter was use to collect the soil samples for determining soil bulk density the soil physical and chemical properties in both sites before rice transplantation for the experiment are shown in table 1 2 4 crop management we used rice cultivar inpari 32 the most popular rice cultivar among farmers in the area rice seedlings was transplanted into each plot at 20 cm 20 cm planting space a week before transplanting the soil was plowed and puddled thoroughly the main crop management practices used at the two sites were the same to minimize any effects beyond those of the treatments all plots at each site received the same amount of inorganic fertilizer following government recommendations at the study area the addition of inorganic fertilizer remained the same as that used by the farmer previously because fertilizer is essential to maintain rice yield the rates of fertilizer were 120 kg n ha 1 urea 60 kg p2o5 ha 1 super phosphate and 90 kg k2o ha 1 potassium chloride super phosphate was applied as a basal fertilizer at two days before transplanting the rice the urea and potassium chloride were each split into three equal amounts for application at different times the first was at seven days after transplanting dat the timing of the second and third fertilizations were determined using a leaf color chart this is a device designed to determine rice plant nitrogen status based on the greenness of the leaves witt et al 2005 a summary of all the important activities in crop management is presented in table 2 pests diseases and weeds were monitored and controlled continuously throughout the entire rice growing season 2 5 agronomics parameters water productivity soil ph and redox potential soil ph and eh were measured in situ using ph and eh meter hi014 hanna usa at the same time of gas sampling plant height and tiller number were recorded weekly grain straw and root biomass were taken at harvest time from 3 m x 2 m in the middle of each plot to minimize any border effects the grain yield was calculated at 14 moisture content while straw and root yield were estimated based on oven dried biomass the total irrigation water use was measured using a flow meter installed in the irrigation pipeline whereas rainfall data were collected from the indonesian agricultural environment research institute the physical water productivity is defined as the mass of product per unit consumption of water the wp was determined according to following formula wp rice yield kg ha 1 total water input rainfall irrigation used m3 ha 1 2 6 gas sampling and calculation gas fluxes were measured using the manual static chamber method as described by minamikawa et al 2015 the static chambers used have length 0 5 m width 0 5 m height 1 m and are made of pvc plastic with 3 mm thickness the chamber has a cover and a base the cover is also made of pvc plastic and bases made of stainless steel two ports were made on the chamber cover to connect a thermometer and a gas sampling port a mini fan was installed inside the chamber cover to ensure the gas inside the chamber mixed thoroughly upon sample collection to avoid soil disturbance during sampling a chamber base was installed at each plot a day before the first gas sampling and cover 4 rice hills the chamber base remained installed 10 cm below the soil surface for the entire rice growing season but the chamber was only installed during gas sample collection gas fluxes were measured on a weekly basis from 7 dat until a week before harvest so we have 24 measurements in total from two sites we collected the samples between 6 00 and 8 00 am on given sample dates the gas were taken every 10 min starting at 10 min until 40 min after the chamber closure i e 10 20 30 40 min with a 20 ml syringe and then immediately transferred into a 10 ml pre evacuated gas vial the concentrations of ch4 and n2o were analyzed in the laboratory no more than 24 h after sample collection we used a gas chromatograph shimadzu 14 a shimadzu corp japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid for ch4 analysis and an electron capture detector ecd for n2o analysis with the following temperature settings 50 c column 81 c ecd injector 25 c fid injector 150 c ecd detector and 300 c fid detector the gas fluxes were calculated using the following equation liao et al 2020 minamikawa et al 2015 f c t x v a x ρ x 273 273 t x 60 x 24 where f is the daily flux for ch4 or n2o mg m 2 d 1 c t is the rate of concentration over time interval minute v is the chamber volume m3 a is the chamber area m2 ρ is gas density 0 714 kg m 3 for ch4 and 1 964 for n2o at gas standard state t is the mean air temperature inside the chamber during gas collection c 60 is conversion to hourly and 24 is conversion to daily flux a flux is accepted if the linear regression value of r 2 between four gas samples and the corresponding collection time was 0 815 p 0 1 otherwise we made disregard outliers of the gas concentration data based on experience and judgment of past performance of the site instrument function or chamber efficacy minamikawa et al 2015 parkin and venterea 2010 the seasonal cumulative gas emissions for the entire rice growth were calculated from the area of the adjacent measurement days using trapezoidal integration rule islam et al 2020 minamikawa et al 2015 qi et al 2018 the gas emissions were then converted into co2 equivalents to calculate the global warming potential gwp following the equation as described by ipcc 2014 gwp kg co 2 e ha 1 28 xch 4 kg ch 4 ha 1 265 xn 2 o kg n 2 o ha 1 yield scaled gwp or greenhouse gas intensity ghgi was calculated as the ratio between gwp and rice yield liao et al 2020 2 7 statistical analysis data were analyzed using minitab v 16 minitab llc usa statistical software the general linear model was used to perform a two way analysis of variance anova for the split plot design the anova evaluated the effect of different water management application of bio compost amendments soil texture and their interaction on seasonal ch4 and n2o emissions biomass straw root yield gwp ghg intensity ghgi ph and redox potential when the anova demonstrated a significant difference tukey s test was used to determine the significant differences at 95 p 0 05 3 result 3 1 weather condition and water level during experiment the daily weather data rainfall and max min air temperature and the irrigation water level during the rice field experiment are shown in fig 2 silt loam soil and fig 3 silty clay soil throughout the rice growing season the daily average rainfall was 2 33 mm and air temperature was 29 8 c at jakenan silt loam while at wedarijaksa silty clay soil these were 1 95 mm and 30 2 c respectively during the dry season for rice at both sites awd was achieved in several cycles however the addition of irrigation water at both sites became very frequent 3 2 soil ph and eh water management and application of biochar compost did not affect soil ph for both soil textures fig 4 table 3 soil ph did not change much from that recorded in the initial soil properties table 1 however awd water management had the significant p 0 05 effect of reducing the soil redox potential eh of both soil textures no interactions were detected between treatments or between treatments and soil texture affecting soil ph and eh the value of eh in silty clay soils is in the range 253 mv to 38 mv and in silt loam soils is in the range 336 7 mv 3 3 dynamics of ch4 daily fluxes water management systems showed different effects on ch4 fluxes while the addition of biochar compost did not fig 5 under cf silt loam ch4 was low for the first two weeks and then started to increase peaking at the maximum tillering stage 48 dat the fluxes declined rapidly at two weeks before harvest when the plots were drained conversely in awd silt loam for the first two weeks the ch4 flux pattern was the same as for cf but after a peak at 27 dat it declined slowly until harvest the daily fluxes ranged from 7 8 to 261 7 mg m 2 d 1 and 4 2 185 1 mg m 2 d 1 under cf silt loam and awd silt loam respectively in contrast ch4 fluxes from silty clay soil were 10 times lower and showed the same pattern under cf and awd the recorded flux was high one week after transplanting declined slowly between 13 and 20 dat peaked at 28 dat declined sharply at 42 dat and remained low until harvest the daily fluxes ranged from 5 4 to 28 7 mg m 2 d 1 and 4 8 19 7 mg m 2 d 1 under cf silty clay and awd silty clay respectively 3 4 dynamics of n2o daily fluxes the water management system and the application of bio compost did not affect the range of n2o daily flux measurements from silt loam soil figs 6a c and 6e the daily n2o fluxes ranged from 1 0 to 1 7 mg n m 2 d 1 irrespective of water management and the application of bio compost the measured of n2o flux from silty clay soil under cf was lower than that under awd at bc0 fig 6b but when bc was applied at 5 and 10 t ha 1 the fluxes were in the same range figs 6d and 6f peak fluxes were recorded about 7 10 days after topdressing events in awd plots the cf showed different patterns between plots the peak n2o fluxes that were observed after topdressing awd plots ranged from 1 9 to 2 4 mg n m 2 d 1 3 5 cumulative seasonal ch4 and n2o emissions water management had a significant p 0 05 effect on ch4 cumulative seasonal emission at both sites but application of bc did not table 3 on both silt loam and silty clay ch4 emissions under cf irrigation were significantly higher than those under awd irrigation awd irrigation reduced ch4 emissions by 27 6 and 17 3 from silt loam and silty clay soil textures respectively therefore the interaction between the water management system and the soil texture had a significant effect on ch4 emissions however interaction between treatments i e water management and the application of biochar compost had no significant effect on ch4 emissions the cumulative n2o emissions were significantly different between water management systems and the application of biochar compost on silty clay soil table 3 but no significant difference was found on silt loam soil a trade off effect was observed between ch4 and n2o as a result of water management practice on silty clay soil cumulative ch4 emissions were significantly decreased by awd but n2o cumulative emissions increased by 8 1 which was significant p 0 05 compared to cf application of bc increased the cumulative n2o emission by 8 9 compared to no application of bc seasonal n2o emissions were significantly higher from silty clay than from silt loam soil irrespective of the treatments 3 6 rice yield agronomics properties gwp wp and ghgi rice yield was not affected by water management or biochar compost application but a significant effect of soil texture was recorded table 3 however water management and the application of biochar compost affected agronomic properties including i e plant biomass straw and root and tiller number on silty clay soil plant biomass was reduced by awd by an average of 26 2 on both soil textures the number of tillers was significantly reduced by awd irrigation on silty clay soil without bc application and it was increased by 6 when bc were added interactive effects between treatments were only seen on silty clay soil across soil textures no interactive effects were detected the gwp was significantly p 0 05 reduced by 39 6 using the awd water management system on silt loam soil the gwp from silty clay soil was not affected by the treatments table 3 significant interaction effect was detected between water management and soil texture on gwp emission of ch4 was responsible for about 87 and 37 of the total gwp from silt loam and silty clay soil respectively emission of n2o was the main contributor to the total gwp from silty clay soil the addition of bc did not affect the ghgi for either soil texture but water management significantly p 0 05 affected the ghgi from silt loam soil ghgi ranged from 0 62 to 1 14 kg co2 eq kg 1 grain yield in silt loam soil and from 0 13 to 0 20 kg co2 eq kg 1 grain yield in silty clay soil ghgi from silty clay soil was about 5 5 times lower than that from silt loam soil irrespective of water management and biochar compost application the total gwp and ghgi were much lower from silty clay soil compared to silt loam soil table 3 the water use from irrigation and rainfall was significantly different p 0 05 between continuous flooding and awd on the two soil textures table 9 awd reduces water use by 18 and 12 on silt loam and silty clay soil respectively the reduction of water use on silt loam soil is equivalent to the results of previous studies at the same location setyanto et al 2018 the water use index or commonly referred to as water productivity is how much water is needed to produce 1 ton of rice yield in silt loam soil the water productivity of awd was significantly higher than the cf this indicates that awd was more efficient in terms of water use meanwhile in silty clay soil the efficiency of water use was not significantly different between water managements the addition of bc has a significant effect on reducing water use in silt loam and silty clay soils this is in accordance with the common knowledge that the addition of organic matter to the soil will increase the water holding capacity of the soil the addition of bc reduces water use by 6 7 in both soil textures and the percentage increases along with the increase in the bc dose 4 discussion 4 1 ch4 fluxes the results showed that the dynamics of ch4 flux were different between soil texture and that ch4 emissions were significantly decreased by the awd water management system in both soil textures the ch4 flux from silt loam soil under cf followed the typical pattern which increases as the rice grows until the maximum tillering stage and then decreases slowly until harvest these findings align with previous studies using the same water management system and soil textures brye et al 2016 maneepitak et al 2019 satpathy et al 1997 setyanto et al 2000 conversely the awd plots showed a different pattern the peak flux occurred soon after transplanting 20 and 27 dat and declined afterwards this could be explained that at early transplanting the field is still in an anaerobic condition with abundant straw residue from the previous season to act as a substrate for methanogenesis by 27 dat the ch4 fluxes on the awd plot declined this could be due to the wetting and drying cycles which started at 10 dat the drying period inhibits ch4 production and leads to an increase in the o2 concentration in the soil due to the shorter duration of the anaerobic environment linquist et al 2015 maneepitak et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 under these conditions the ch4 degrading bacteria activity represses the growth and activity of ch4 forming bacteria adhya et al 2014 the effect of bc applications showed the same magnitude on both soil textures fig 4 however the highest daily ch4 flux from silt loam soil was recorded following the addition of 10 t ha 1 bc under cf the addition of organic material enriched the soil nutrients especially in readily available forms of carbon and nitrogen therefore this triggered an increase in the production of ch4 and n2o humphreys et al 2018 janz et al 2019 le mer and roger 2001 the ch4 daily flux from silty clay soil was high at the first week we expect this was due to the increased carbon content of the soil and the anaerobic conditions the slow decrease seen at 13 and 20 dat is probably due to the early drying period on the awd plot and the fact that the slow decrease of the soil redox potential on both the awd and cf plots impedes methanogenesis however there are peaks at 28 and 34 dat which were probably influenced by the presence of high levels of root exudates during the maximum tillering stage gogoi et al 2005 that caused the sharp decrease of soil redox potential as seen in fig 3 to the range of 158 to 253 mv as was already stated in previous studies wassman et al 1998 yagi and minami 1990 4 2 n2o fluxes soil n2o flux was similar between cf and awd from silt loam soil this aligns with previous studies using the same soil texture in indonesia setyanto et al 2018 and in vietnam tran et al 2018 application of bc also did not result in different n2o daily fluxes this could be explained by its relatively low nitrogen content which leads to low nitrification and denitrification processes as the main activities which determine the magnitude of n2o fluxes butterbach bahl et al 2013 stehfest and bouwman 2006 in silty clay soil the magnitude and dynamics between treatments were quite variable and different to those seen in the silt loam soil these sporadic fluxes could be associated with the higher clay content in some cases the high clay content in the soil leads to slower o2 diffusion rates causing lower soil o2 concentrations that favor denitrification pelster et al 2012 meanwhile in other cases studies have shown lower n2o emission from high clay soils as low gas diffusivity allowed much time for more complete reduction of n2o to n2 weitz et al 2001 cf water management resulted in lower n2o daily fluxes when no bc was added nevertheless it became higher when bc was applied under awd without the application of bc the fluxes were higher than under cf this was in close agreement with a previous study in the philippines sibayan et al 2018 4 3 seasonal ch4 emission there is no significant interaction effect between water management and biochar compost applications for either soil texture in our study ch4 emissions were significantly p 0 05 reduced by implementing awd table 3 these findings align with the previous studies using silt loam soil in indonesia setyanto et al 2018 and in vietnam tran et al 2018 and using clay soil in thailand and the philippines chidthaisong et al 2018 sibayan et al 2018 this substantial reduction in the emission of ch4 was achieved by the efficiency of irrigation water control in awd figs 2 and 3 the low precipitation in the dry season facilitates this degree of control a more aerobic environment is created by awd which inhibit methanogens to produced ch4 resulted in decreasing ch4 emissions islam et al 2020 conversely cf makes the rice field anaerobic reducing the soil redox potential 150 mv which favors methanogenesis minamikawa and sakai 2006 a significant p 0 05 interaction effect was detected between water management and soil texture the results demonstrated that silt loam soil had 91 2 higher ch4 emission p 0 05 under cf than silty clay soil these results are in close agreement with previous experiments in arkansas brye et al 2016 2013 spain martínez eixarch et al 2021 and indonesia susilawati et al 2015 these findings confirmed the previous experiments which found that soil texture was an essential factor influencing ch4 emissions from rice fields soil with finer texture in this study emitted less ch4 as is consistent with previous research brye et al 2016 2013 martínez eixarch et al 2021 susilawati et al 2015 coarse textured soil emits more ch4 than finer textured soil for several reasons the presence of strong oxidizing agents such as ferric and manganese oxides in the silty clay soil table 1 impedes the sequence of reactions to form ch4 because the activity of iron reducing bacteria outcompetes that of methanogenic bacteria inubushi et al 2018 van bodegom et al 2001 clay soil facilitated a delayed and slower decline of soil eh to the range of 150 to 200 mv and in our study it was only shortly after transplanting that the soil eh in clay soil reached the range of 150 to 200 mv this led to a delay in reaching the reducing conditions necessary for the activation of methanogenesis brye et al 2013 the differences in their physical structure the macroporosity and microporosity distribution between the two soil textures was inversely proportional the large number of micropores in clay soil makes it harder for ch4 molecules to escape from the soil or move toward the rice plants the microaggregates in clay particles also reduce the accessibility of organic matter to microbial decomposition six et al 2002 soil with a coarser texture facilitates ch4 diffusion through the macropores brye et al 2013 so the gas stays in the soil for a limited time to stimulate the activity of methanotrophs or ch4 degrading bacteria brye et al 2016 sass and fisher 1997 smartt et al 2016a previous studies indicate that dry period of awd in the rice field could hamper ch4 formation by decreasing the duration of anaerobic condition and thus increases the availability of o2 in the soil zhang et al 2009 linquist et al 2015 this condition depresses the growth and activity of ch4 forming bacteria and stimulates methanotrophs as ch4 degrading bacteria adhya et al 2014 in the presence of biochar compost oxygen availability in awd system were maintained in the soil which may promote ch4 oxidation by ch4 degrading bacteria even after the field is re irrigated 4 4 seasonal n2o emission a significant p 0 05 interaction effect was found between water management practices and the application of biochar compost on n2o emissions from silty clay soil but not from silt loam soil awd irrigation significantly increased n2o emissions from silty clay soil this result was in line with previous studies in the philippines sibayan et al 2018 but was contrary to the study in thailand chidthaisong et al 2018 this could be explained by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer topdressing and the drying period coordinated activity of water management and n top dressing timing is essential to prevent high n2o emissions from offsetting reductions in gwp in our study and research by sibayan et al 2018 nitrogen topdressing was followed by the drying period contrary to the procedure followed in thailand chidthaisong et al 2018 where nitrogen topdressing was followed by flooded conditions nitrification of ammonium ions is relatively low under flooded conditions therefore the production of n2o is inhibited butterbach bahl et al 2013 cai et al 2007 possibly after the application of nitrogen fertilizer the awd plot should kept under flooding conditions to minimize n2o emissions chidthaisong et al 2018 nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously when conditions switched between anaerobic and aerobic in awd pathak et al 2002 therefore the presence of o2 in soil pores during aerobic conditions facilitates the escape of a considerable amount of n2o to the atmosphere before it is reduced to n2 davidson et al 2000 the bc application significantly increased the emission of n2o from silty clay soil the inorganic nitrogen from urea was the larger contributor of nitrogen from external input to the soil rather than nitrogen from organic matter the higher n2o emissions following bc applications table 3 are probably because compared to fresh organic matter biochar compost has a relatively low carbon to nitrogen ratio corton et al 2000 which reduces the intensity of nitrogen immobilization enhances nitrogen substrate availability and leads to higher n2o emissions a study in china reported that awd increased n2o fluxes by 9 xu et al 2015 moreover tirol padre et al 2018 reported that the occurrence of increases and no increases in n2o emissions under awd were site specific the effect of water management and biochar compost application on n2o emission from silt loam soil was marginal as found in previous studies setyanto et al 2018 tran et al 2018 this could be explained by several factors first n2o emissions from rice fields that are kept under anaerobic conditions for the whole growing season are known to be minor linquist et al 2015 wang et al 2016 second n2o emission were affected by several soil related factors including its carbon and nitrogen content texture moisture ph temperature and water filled pore space brentrup et al 2000 snyder et al 2009 coarse textured soil tends to emit lower n2o than finer textured soil a study found that n2o emissions were highest in soils with a combination of a fine texture i e the clay loam soils an ample amount of available carbon i e high soil organic matter content and a water filled pore space 0 60 cm3 cm 3 at field capacity harrison kirk et al 2013 the coarser soil texture with a larger number of macropores decreased the anaerobic conditions of microsites therefore decreasing the emission of n2o brentrup et al 2000 a trade off relationship between ch4 and n2o emissions was recorded from silty clay soil in rice fields awd has occasionally increased n2o emission while also decreasing ch4 emissions hou et al 2000a 2000b during awd the drainage events lead to more aerobic conditions around the rice roots which promote n2o production zheng et al 2000 4 5 rice yield gwp ghgi and wp studies have linked awd to improved root growth facilitating access to water and nutrients at soil depth yang et al 2009 organic matter application is known to increase soil fertility thereby increasing yield but in our study there is no significant interaction effect between water management and biochar compost application on rice yield or agronomic properties table 3 yield was significantly different between soil textures awd was significantly p 0 05 decreased straw root biomass and the number of tillers on silty clay soil which showed slight water stress under awd this water stress was exacerbated by the high clay content which occasionally caused soil cracks during the drying period the occurrence of soil cracks makes water and nutrients infiltrate the soil faster and deeper making it harder for the shallow rice roots to access them greve et al 2010 hao et al 2021 stewart et al 2015 the grain yield however was not significantly reduced the significant p 0 05 increase of tiller number due to the application of biochar compost could be the reason for this an interaction effect of water management and soil texture on the total gwp was detected the gwp from silt loam soil was five times greater than that from silty clay soil the main contributor to this was ch4 emissions 50 while n2o emission was the main contributor to gwp from silty clay soil since ch4 is known to be the largest contributor to global ghg emissions from rice fields maintaining lower ch4 emission from coarse textured soil is important the ghgi or the ratio between the total ghg emissions and grain yield was used to measure the efficiency and sustainability of a rice management system in this study the ratio of the total ghg emissions to grain yield from silt loam soil was five to six times higher than that from silty clay soil rice cultivation on a finer textured soil i e silty clay as in this experiment which resulted in low gwp and high yield is already efficient without any mitigating options to mitigate ghg emissions on silt loam textured soil awd irrigation is an essential option tobe applied whereas on silty clay soil the option is less essential brye et al 2013 reported a similar result where the ghgi was five times higher for a silt loam than a clay soil for rice grown in a drill seeded delayed flood production system in arkansas even when grain yields did not differ significantly between soil textures the water use on silty clay soils is significantly smaller than water use on silt loam soils this is due to the lower percolation rate and also the porosity of the silt clay soil regardless of the water management and biochar compost application water productivity in silty clay soils is significantly higher than that of silt loam soils this is because the nature of silty clay soil already result in higher grain yield and smaller water use this condition is inline with the results of previous research in thailand on clay soils chidthaisong et al 2018 and loamy sandy soils sriphirom et al 2019 4 6 ph and soil redox potential no interaction effect was found between water management and biochar compost application on soil ph or redox potential however awd irrigation significantly p 0 05 increased soil eh for both soil textures although the values were lower for silt loam soil than for silty clay soil soil redox value is one of the indicating factors for ch4 production methanogenic bacteria are obligate anaerobes and require highly reducing conditions for growth cicerone and oremland 1988 when the soil redox potential goes below a certain level these methanogens can produce large amounts of methane commonly methanogenic bacteria will actively produce ch4 when the soil eh 150 mv liang et al 2016 soil reduction oxidation reactions consist of several soil oxidants that act as electron acceptors o2 no3 permanganate mno4 ferric iron fe3 sulphate so4 2 and co2 the reduction process of these electron acceptors occurs sequentially at the appropriate eh value the reductive condition in this experiment was achieved more slowly in silty clay soil than in silt loam soil as seen in previous experiments rogers et al 2014 smartt et al 2016a the higher manganese content in silty clay soil could be the reason for the slower reduction lower soil eh in cf induces reduction of methanogens and soil oxidants xiao et al 2015 more soil oxidants to reduce leads to a longer time of methanogens to be active and slower reduction conditions to achieved during the rewetting period in awd the soil eh decreased immediately due to o2 deprivation soil textures play an important role in the reduction oxidation process the redox value in silty clay soil was higher than in silt loam soil finer textured soil has lower gas diffusivity than coarser textured soils this condition makes it more difficult for ch4 molecules to escape to the atmosphere from finer textured soil therefore ch4 molecules tend to stay longer in these soils trapped in soil pores and this allows more time for methanotrophs to reoxidize them into co2 livingston and hutchinson 1995 nazaroff 1992 brye et al 2013 smartt et al 2016b in coarser textured soils ch4 also diffuses more easily from the rhizosphere into the atmosphere through plant mediated transport philippot and hallin 2011 5 feasibility and limitations in our study combining awd with the mixture of bc did not result in any interaction effect that would reduce ghg emission and increase grain yield however awd itself had a significant effect to reduce ghg emissions especially in the case of ch4 also bc addition tended to increase grain yield as the dosage applied increased the single cropping season in this study might be the reason for this no significant interaction effect further studies across multiple seasons should be conducted to gain a better understanding on the effect of bc addition on grain yield and ghg emissions the gwp could be significantly reduced by awd when implemented on silt loam soil but the result was not significant when this was implemented on silty clay soil our study and several previous studies confirmed that rice cultivation on silty clay soil already results in lower ch4 emissions than that on silt loam soil because of the nature of the soil texture physical dan chemical factors since n2o emissions remained in the same range implementation of awd was not significant on silty clay soil in terms of the gwp the silty clay soil in our study contains higher soil nutrients carbon nitrogen phosphorus and potassium resulting in higher grain yield than the silt loam soil this leads to a much lower ratio of gwp to grain yield for the silty clay soil when choosing to implement awd as a mitigation option to reduce ghg emissions from rice fields several factors should be considered regarding the effectiveness of this option ariani et al 2021 including how much emissions will be reduced the saving of water and production s cost and the condition of the surrounding area in terms of land slope water resources including rainfall and water movement maintenance of the field under flooding conditions after nitrogen topdressing to avoid a spike in n2o emission should be considered learning from our study it is important to consider the condition of the surrounding area when awd is about to be implemented our study on silty clay soil was not ideal for water saving the decrease in water level on the awd plots was as fast as on the silt loam soil in which the finer textured soil should hold water much longer than coarser textured soil this was mainly due to maize cultivation on the adjacent field which was managed with raised beds and created water channels these channels made the water level in our plots decrease sharply from our study it can be concluded that awd with our current settings is more beneficial if implement on a coarser textured soil than a finer textured soil and it would be better if implemented during the dry season so that the wetting drying cycle will not be interrupted by high rainfall to reach the target of emission reductions the implementation of awd should also consider soil texture as ghg emissions were also affected by edaphic factor such as soil texture 6 conclusion the implementation of awd on silty clay and silt loam soil reduced water use by 12 and 18 awd also significantly p 0 05 reduced the total gwp by 39 6 without yield loss and ghgi by 38 4 compared to cf on silt loam soil conversely on silty clay soil the gwp and ghgi reduction was marginal only about 4 significant interaction effects between the treatments water management and biochar compost application were only found for n2o emission and the number of tillers on silty clay soil the implementation of awd significantly reduced ch4 emissions by 27 6 and 17 3 from silt loam and silty clay soil respectively compared to cf irrigation implementation of awd and bc application on silty clay soil increased n2o emissions by 8 1 compared to cf bc addition was significantly reduced water use in both soil textures we found that the implementation of awd on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and gwp therefore it will be more beneficial than that on silty clay soil though this study only took into account one growing season dry season 2020 the field measurements generated and results obtained add to the limited research of combining awd and biochar compost on a different soil texture in term of ch4 and n2o emissions gwp water use and rice yield in the third largest world rice producing country i e indonesia expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice systems in terms of ghg mitigation and saving irrigation water declaration of competing

corresponding author handling editor enrique fernández alternate wetting drying awd is known to reduced water use and at the same time also reduced greenhouse gas ghg emissions from rice fields the research aimed at comparing awd on contrast soil textures field experiments were conducted at two sites representing coarse texture soil silt loam and finer texture soil silty clay to study the efficiency of awd on water use methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emission grain yield global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi the experiments were conducted during the 2020 dry season in central java province indonesia evaluating continuous flooding cf and awd as the main plot and biochar compost bc mixture at a rate of 0 5 and 10 t ha 1as the sub plot the results unveiled that awd on silty clay and silt loam soil reduced water use by 12 and 18 respectively the implementation of awd on silt loam soil significantly p 0 05 reduced the total gwp by 39 6 without yield loss and ghgi by 38 4 compared to cf conversely on silty clay soil the gwp and ghgi reduction was marginal only about 4 biochar compost addition was significantly reduced water use in both soil textures we found that the implementation of awd on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and gwp expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice system in terms of ghg mitigation action and saving irrigation water keywords agriculture water management water productivity biochar compost soil factors greenhouse gases ghg emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s population has grown rapidly to almost 8 billion people more than half of whom depend on rice as their staple food haque et al 2014 to meet demand as the population continues to grow rice farmers will need to increase production by 114 mt by the year 2035 despite several threats including declining arable land labor and water for agriculture increased costs for all the inputs and worsened impacts of climate change redfern et al 2012 climate change is caused by a substantial increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions into the atmosphere the anthropogenic ghg emissions was estimated for about 59 6 6 gt co2 eq in 2019 pudcha et al 2022 agriculture is one of the most significant sources producing 13 of the global ghg emissions during the 55 year time period between 1961 and 2016 ghg emissions from anthropogenic sources related to agricultural activities increased from 3 1 gt co2 e yr 1 to 5 8 gt co2 e yr 1 ipcc 2018a methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o from activities related to agriculture contributed about 60 and 38 respectively to the total ghg emissions globally ipcc 2018b zhao et al 2019 these ghg have a large impact on global warming because respectively they have warming potentials that are 28 and 265 times greater than that of co2 ipcc 2013 globally irrigated rice fields which are typically maintained under continuous flooded conditions occupy about 60 of the total 158 m ha world rice area rao et al 2017 this irrigated rice field are considered as the main contributor to the methane emission from agriculture rice consumes an estimated 40 1 of the total world s irrigation water which represent 24 30 of the total developed fresh water resources the demand of freshwater for human needs as the population grows will out competes the water supply for irrigation besides continuously flooded rice also has been widely shown to emit large amounts of ch4 flooded rice fields contribute about 493 723 mt co2e year 1 to the global ch4 emissions eickemeier et al 2014 thus many rice producing countries face the challenge of reducing ch4 emissions and water use from rice cultivation while maintaining or even increasing yield study by yagi et al 2019 stated that alternate wetting and drying awd is a promising option to mitigate ch4 emission and also save water in asia this would be an ideal option to mitigate the challenge of water scarcity and ghg emission over 90 of the world s rice is produced and consumed in asia in order to save water and simultaneously reduce ch4 emissions many rice producing countries across south east asia and china have implemented awd as an irrigation management system for rice lampayan et al 2015 under awd practices the rice field are not always in continuously flooded condition the irrigation water is allowed to dry out for a certain number of days ye et al 2013 before re irrigated and so the soil water regime is in alternately aerobic and anaerobic condition tan et al 2013 safe awd is when re irrigation was applying whenever the water level fall below the soil surface of 15 cm and kept the field in flooded condition during flowering stage setyanto et al 2018 methane emission was suppressed due to the availability of oxygen during dry period of the field on the other hand this condition leads to triggering n2o emission lagomarsino et al 2016 awd was reported could suppress ch4 emission by 25 80 compare to continuously flooding irrigation chidthaisong et al 2018 islam et al 2020 setyanto et al 2018 sriphirom et al 2019 tran et al 2018 but there are also studies that show an increase in n2o emission with the implementation of awd islam et al 2020 sibayan et al 2018 sriphirom et al 2019 during the aerobic conditions of the drying period the abundance of oxygen o2 leads to the production of n2o by the nitrification process sriphirom et al 2019 in addition the rice yield from awd is variable some studies show an increasing of rice yield as compared to continuously flooding irrigation system song et al 2021 2019 other studies show a decrease of yield lagomarsino et al 2016 sriphirom et al 2019 and others show no effect of awd implementation on yield compare to continuously flooding irrigation chidthaisong et al 2018 islam et al 2020 setyanto et al 2018 however due to repeated changes between wetting and drying of the soil in this irrigation system cracks in the soil may occured which result in loss of nutrients from the topsoil hamoud et al 2018 this soil cracks are worsened on a fine soil texture which rich in clay soil also loses surface moisture during dry conditions under these alternating between aerobic and anaerobic ecosystems organic carbon and soil nitrogen may be lost due to heterotrophic microbial activity hamoud et al 2019 this negative impact of awd irrigation may not be seen in the short term study but in the long term it is likely to reduce soil productivity soil organic carbon enrichment plays an important role in soil physical and chemical properties to increase crop productivity the addition of organic matter is known to increase soil fertility by increasing nutrients and improving soil structure thereby increasing crop productivity and increasing crop yields chen et al 2021 previous research suggested the application of organic matter mixture in a stable form such as compost and biochar into rice cultivation systems kim et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 other studies have also indicated that the simultaneous application of biochar and compost resulted in enhanced soil fertility by increasing soil organic matter content water holding capacity crop yield carbon sequestration nutrient concentration increasing nutrient uptake and retention in the soil agegnehu et al 2015 mensah and frimpong 2018 therefore combining the addition of biochar compost with awd irrigation is expected to effectively enhanced field productivity in a longer term in addition to field management practices ghg emissions from rice fields are also influenced by edaphic factor such as soil texture brye et al 2016 2013 ishfaq et al 2020 ideally rice is cultivated in finely textured soil rich in nutrients lal 1985 but rice is actually grown in soil with various textures brye et al 2013 a 20 year field experiment 1990 2010 on rice cultivation in a field in northeast china confirmed the significantly higher ch4 emissions from sandy loam soil textures compared with finer textured soil due to the differences in soil porosity zhang et al 2012 studies in us stated the importance to consider soil texture to quantify ch4 emission from rice field brye et al 2013 numerous studies in south east asia have reported ch4 emissions from clay and silty clay soils to generally not exceed 200 kg ch4 ha 1 season 1 chidthaisong et al 2018 sibayan et al 2018 whereas others have reported ch4 emissions from silt loam and coarser textured soils in excess of 500 kg ch4 ha 1 season 1 setyanto et al 2018 tran et al 2018 when applying awd the number of non flooded days of soil between irrigations can vary from 1 to more than 10 days depending on the number of factors such as soil texture evaporation transpiration rainfall and crop growth stage rice in indonesia as the third larger rice producer in the world is mostly growing on loam or clay soil researchers have documented that ch4 emissions are lower in clay soils than silt loam soils in indonesia susilawati et al 2015 many studies on awd have been conducted but they mainly focused on the effect on grain yield the efficiency of water and nitrogen use and ch4 emissions however studies concerning the effect of awd irrigation on contrasting soil textures i e coarse texture and finer texture in terms of water use ch4 as well as n2o emission and gwp are still lacking this study aimed to demonstrate the influence of awd and biochar compost amendment as well as their interaction to water use ch4 emission n2o emission and gwp on different soil textures to provide new insight into the mitigation actions in the rice systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites field experiments were conducted on a silt loam soil representing coarse soil texture aeric endoaquepts at the research station of the indonesian agricultural environment research institute iaeri jakenan 6 46 44 south and 1110 11 54 east and on a silty clay soil representing finer soil texture ustic endoaquerts at wedarijaksa s farmers field 6 40 10 south and 1110 05 29 east during the 2020 dry season march june the location of the experimental sites is shown in fig 1 the timing of the study during the dry season was based on previous studies which demonstrated that awd worked best when implemented during the dry season sriphirom et al 2019 yagi et al 2019 the study areas at both sites had been used to cultivate rice continually for at least 10 years the crop residues were commonly left at a height of about 10 cm after harvest and immersed at a depth of 10 cm upon soil ploughing before the next season both sites are at an elevation of approximately 40 m above sea level and the average annual mean air temperature is 30 c with annual precipitation of 1503 2170 mm the daily max min air temperature and precipitation during the experiment at each site were presented in figs 2 and 3 2 2 experimental design and treatments the field experiment was laid out in a two factor split plot design with three replications water management act as the main plot and biochar compost amendment as the sub plot the plots sized 5 5 m the water management systems tested were continuous flooding cf and awd plastics covers were inserted around the cf plots to a depth of 40 cm to prevent water leakage the water level for the cf plots was maintained at 3 5 cm above the soil surface from 3 to 5 days after sowing until it was drained for 7 10 days during harvest the awd method implemented was a safe awd system as described by sander et al 2015 the plots were flooded to 5 cm whenever the water level dropped to 15 cm below the soil surface we use 1 m long perforated pvc pipes inserted into each plot to monitored the water level every day these cycles started 10 days after sowing and continued until a week before harvest each plot was independently irrigated by pumping water from a reservoir at jakenan and from groundwater at wedarijaksa for the addition of biocharand compost we used a mixture of compost and rice husk biochar in the ratio of 4 1 at different dosages e g 0 t ha 1 bc0 5 t ha 1 bc5 and 10 t ha 1 bc10 the biochar compost bc contained organic carbon 14 97 nitrogen 0 36 phosphorus 1 5 and potassium 7 2 rice husk biochar was produced by pyrolysis at a temperature of 300 c bc was applied after soil puddling at five days before transplanting 2 3 initial soil properties and analysis soil samples were collected before bc application in each plot the samples were taken three points randomly and then mixed it into one soil sample the soil was analyzed for ph 1 5 soil water suspension electrical conductivity 1 5 soil water suspension total n kjeldahl distillation method c organic walkey black method texture pipette method total p olsen bray method and total k morgan wolf method the total iron and manganese contents of air dried soil were tested by atomic absorption spectrophotometer a240fs varian australia the detection limits were determined to be 0 0083 and 0 0021 mg l respectively core sampler with 5 4 cm diameter was use to collect the soil samples for determining soil bulk density the soil physical and chemical properties in both sites before rice transplantation for the experiment are shown in table 1 2 4 crop management we used rice cultivar inpari 32 the most popular rice cultivar among farmers in the area rice seedlings was transplanted into each plot at 20 cm 20 cm planting space a week before transplanting the soil was plowed and puddled thoroughly the main crop management practices used at the two sites were the same to minimize any effects beyond those of the treatments all plots at each site received the same amount of inorganic fertilizer following government recommendations at the study area the addition of inorganic fertilizer remained the same as that used by the farmer previously because fertilizer is essential to maintain rice yield the rates of fertilizer were 120 kg n ha 1 urea 60 kg p2o5 ha 1 super phosphate and 90 kg k2o ha 1 potassium chloride super phosphate was applied as a basal fertilizer at two days before transplanting the rice the urea and potassium chloride were each split into three equal amounts for application at different times the first was at seven days after transplanting dat the timing of the second and third fertilizations were determined using a leaf color chart this is a device designed to determine rice plant nitrogen status based on the greenness of the leaves witt et al 2005 a summary of all the important activities in crop management is presented in table 2 pests diseases and weeds were monitored and controlled continuously throughout the entire rice growing season 2 5 agronomics parameters water productivity soil ph and redox potential soil ph and eh were measured in situ using ph and eh meter hi014 hanna usa at the same time of gas sampling plant height and tiller number were recorded weekly grain straw and root biomass were taken at harvest time from 3 m x 2 m in the middle of each plot to minimize any border effects the grain yield was calculated at 14 moisture content while straw and root yield were estimated based on oven dried biomass the total irrigation water use was measured using a flow meter installed in the irrigation pipeline whereas rainfall data were collected from the indonesian agricultural environment research institute the physical water productivity is defined as the mass of product per unit consumption of water the wp was determined according to following formula wp rice yield kg ha 1 total water input rainfall irrigation used m3 ha 1 2 6 gas sampling and calculation gas fluxes were measured using the manual static chamber method as described by minamikawa et al 2015 the static chambers used have length 0 5 m width 0 5 m height 1 m and are made of pvc plastic with 3 mm thickness the chamber has a cover and a base the cover is also made of pvc plastic and bases made of stainless steel two ports were made on the chamber cover to connect a thermometer and a gas sampling port a mini fan was installed inside the chamber cover to ensure the gas inside the chamber mixed thoroughly upon sample collection to avoid soil disturbance during sampling a chamber base was installed at each plot a day before the first gas sampling and cover 4 rice hills the chamber base remained installed 10 cm below the soil surface for the entire rice growing season but the chamber was only installed during gas sample collection gas fluxes were measured on a weekly basis from 7 dat until a week before harvest so we have 24 measurements in total from two sites we collected the samples between 6 00 and 8 00 am on given sample dates the gas were taken every 10 min starting at 10 min until 40 min after the chamber closure i e 10 20 30 40 min with a 20 ml syringe and then immediately transferred into a 10 ml pre evacuated gas vial the concentrations of ch4 and n2o were analyzed in the laboratory no more than 24 h after sample collection we used a gas chromatograph shimadzu 14 a shimadzu corp japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid for ch4 analysis and an electron capture detector ecd for n2o analysis with the following temperature settings 50 c column 81 c ecd injector 25 c fid injector 150 c ecd detector and 300 c fid detector the gas fluxes were calculated using the following equation liao et al 2020 minamikawa et al 2015 f c t x v a x ρ x 273 273 t x 60 x 24 where f is the daily flux for ch4 or n2o mg m 2 d 1 c t is the rate of concentration over time interval minute v is the chamber volume m3 a is the chamber area m2 ρ is gas density 0 714 kg m 3 for ch4 and 1 964 for n2o at gas standard state t is the mean air temperature inside the chamber during gas collection c 60 is conversion to hourly and 24 is conversion to daily flux a flux is accepted if the linear regression value of r 2 between four gas samples and the corresponding collection time was 0 815 p 0 1 otherwise we made disregard outliers of the gas concentration data based on experience and judgment of past performance of the site instrument function or chamber efficacy minamikawa et al 2015 parkin and venterea 2010 the seasonal cumulative gas emissions for the entire rice growth were calculated from the area of the adjacent measurement days using trapezoidal integration rule islam et al 2020 minamikawa et al 2015 qi et al 2018 the gas emissions were then converted into co2 equivalents to calculate the global warming potential gwp following the equation as described by ipcc 2014 gwp kg co 2 e ha 1 28 xch 4 kg ch 4 ha 1 265 xn 2 o kg n 2 o ha 1 yield scaled gwp or greenhouse gas intensity ghgi was calculated as the ratio between gwp and rice yield liao et al 2020 2 7 statistical analysis data were analyzed using minitab v 16 minitab llc usa statistical software the general linear model was used to perform a two way analysis of variance anova for the split plot design the anova evaluated the effect of different water management application of bio compost amendments soil texture and their interaction on seasonal ch4 and n2o emissions biomass straw root yield gwp ghg intensity ghgi ph and redox potential when the anova demonstrated a significant difference tukey s test was used to determine the significant differences at 95 p 0 05 3 result 3 1 weather condition and water level during experiment the daily weather data rainfall and max min air temperature and the irrigation water level during the rice field experiment are shown in fig 2 silt loam soil and fig 3 silty clay soil throughout the rice growing season the daily average rainfall was 2 33 mm and air temperature was 29 8 c at jakenan silt loam while at wedarijaksa silty clay soil these were 1 95 mm and 30 2 c respectively during the dry season for rice at both sites awd was achieved in several cycles however the addition of irrigation water at both sites became very frequent 3 2 soil ph and eh water management and application of biochar compost did not affect soil ph for both soil textures fig 4 table 3 soil ph did not change much from that recorded in the initial soil properties table 1 however awd water management had the significant p 0 05 effect of reducing the soil redox potential eh of both soil textures no interactions were detected between treatments or between treatments and soil texture affecting soil ph and eh the value of eh in silty clay soils is in the range 253 mv to 38 mv and in silt loam soils is in the range 336 7 mv 3 3 dynamics of ch4 daily fluxes water management systems showed different effects on ch4 fluxes while the addition of biochar compost did not fig 5 under cf silt loam ch4 was low for the first two weeks and then started to increase peaking at the maximum tillering stage 48 dat the fluxes declined rapidly at two weeks before harvest when the plots were drained conversely in awd silt loam for the first two weeks the ch4 flux pattern was the same as for cf but after a peak at 27 dat it declined slowly until harvest the daily fluxes ranged from 7 8 to 261 7 mg m 2 d 1 and 4 2 185 1 mg m 2 d 1 under cf silt loam and awd silt loam respectively in contrast ch4 fluxes from silty clay soil were 10 times lower and showed the same pattern under cf and awd the recorded flux was high one week after transplanting declined slowly between 13 and 20 dat peaked at 28 dat declined sharply at 42 dat and remained low until harvest the daily fluxes ranged from 5 4 to 28 7 mg m 2 d 1 and 4 8 19 7 mg m 2 d 1 under cf silty clay and awd silty clay respectively 3 4 dynamics of n2o daily fluxes the water management system and the application of bio compost did not affect the range of n2o daily flux measurements from silt loam soil figs 6a c and 6e the daily n2o fluxes ranged from 1 0 to 1 7 mg n m 2 d 1 irrespective of water management and the application of bio compost the measured of n2o flux from silty clay soil under cf was lower than that under awd at bc0 fig 6b but when bc was applied at 5 and 10 t ha 1 the fluxes were in the same range figs 6d and 6f peak fluxes were recorded about 7 10 days after topdressing events in awd plots the cf showed different patterns between plots the peak n2o fluxes that were observed after topdressing awd plots ranged from 1 9 to 2 4 mg n m 2 d 1 3 5 cumulative seasonal ch4 and n2o emissions water management had a significant p 0 05 effect on ch4 cumulative seasonal emission at both sites but application of bc did not table 3 on both silt loam and silty clay ch4 emissions under cf irrigation were significantly higher than those under awd irrigation awd irrigation reduced ch4 emissions by 27 6 and 17 3 from silt loam and silty clay soil textures respectively therefore the interaction between the water management system and the soil texture had a significant effect on ch4 emissions however interaction between treatments i e water management and the application of biochar compost had no significant effect on ch4 emissions the cumulative n2o emissions were significantly different between water management systems and the application of biochar compost on silty clay soil table 3 but no significant difference was found on silt loam soil a trade off effect was observed between ch4 and n2o as a result of water management practice on silty clay soil cumulative ch4 emissions were significantly decreased by awd but n2o cumulative emissions increased by 8 1 which was significant p 0 05 compared to cf application of bc increased the cumulative n2o emission by 8 9 compared to no application of bc seasonal n2o emissions were significantly higher from silty clay than from silt loam soil irrespective of the treatments 3 6 rice yield agronomics properties gwp wp and ghgi rice yield was not affected by water management or biochar compost application but a significant effect of soil texture was recorded table 3 however water management and the application of biochar compost affected agronomic properties including i e plant biomass straw and root and tiller number on silty clay soil plant biomass was reduced by awd by an average of 26 2 on both soil textures the number of tillers was significantly reduced by awd irrigation on silty clay soil without bc application and it was increased by 6 when bc were added interactive effects between treatments were only seen on silty clay soil across soil textures no interactive effects were detected the gwp was significantly p 0 05 reduced by 39 6 using the awd water management system on silt loam soil the gwp from silty clay soil was not affected by the treatments table 3 significant interaction effect was detected between water management and soil texture on gwp emission of ch4 was responsible for about 87 and 37 of the total gwp from silt loam and silty clay soil respectively emission of n2o was the main contributor to the total gwp from silty clay soil the addition of bc did not affect the ghgi for either soil texture but water management significantly p 0 05 affected the ghgi from silt loam soil ghgi ranged from 0 62 to 1 14 kg co2 eq kg 1 grain yield in silt loam soil and from 0 13 to 0 20 kg co2 eq kg 1 grain yield in silty clay soil ghgi from silty clay soil was about 5 5 times lower than that from silt loam soil irrespective of water management and biochar compost application the total gwp and ghgi were much lower from silty clay soil compared to silt loam soil table 3 the water use from irrigation and rainfall was significantly different p 0 05 between continuous flooding and awd on the two soil textures table 9 awd reduces water use by 18 and 12 on silt loam and silty clay soil respectively the reduction of water use on silt loam soil is equivalent to the results of previous studies at the same location setyanto et al 2018 the water use index or commonly referred to as water productivity is how much water is needed to produce 1 ton of rice yield in silt loam soil the water productivity of awd was significantly higher than the cf this indicates that awd was more efficient in terms of water use meanwhile in silty clay soil the efficiency of water use was not significantly different between water managements the addition of bc has a significant effect on reducing water use in silt loam and silty clay soils this is in accordance with the common knowledge that the addition of organic matter to the soil will increase the water holding capacity of the soil the addition of bc reduces water use by 6 7 in both soil textures and the percentage increases along with the increase in the bc dose 4 discussion 4 1 ch4 fluxes the results showed that the dynamics of ch4 flux were different between soil texture and that ch4 emissions were significantly decreased by the awd water management system in both soil textures the ch4 flux from silt loam soil under cf followed the typical pattern which increases as the rice grows until the maximum tillering stage and then decreases slowly until harvest these findings align with previous studies using the same water management system and soil textures brye et al 2016 maneepitak et al 2019 satpathy et al 1997 setyanto et al 2000 conversely the awd plots showed a different pattern the peak flux occurred soon after transplanting 20 and 27 dat and declined afterwards this could be explained that at early transplanting the field is still in an anaerobic condition with abundant straw residue from the previous season to act as a substrate for methanogenesis by 27 dat the ch4 fluxes on the awd plot declined this could be due to the wetting and drying cycles which started at 10 dat the drying period inhibits ch4 production and leads to an increase in the o2 concentration in the soil due to the shorter duration of the anaerobic environment linquist et al 2015 maneepitak et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 under these conditions the ch4 degrading bacteria activity represses the growth and activity of ch4 forming bacteria adhya et al 2014 the effect of bc applications showed the same magnitude on both soil textures fig 4 however the highest daily ch4 flux from silt loam soil was recorded following the addition of 10 t ha 1 bc under cf the addition of organic material enriched the soil nutrients especially in readily available forms of carbon and nitrogen therefore this triggered an increase in the production of ch4 and n2o humphreys et al 2018 janz et al 2019 le mer and roger 2001 the ch4 daily flux from silty clay soil was high at the first week we expect this was due to the increased carbon content of the soil and the anaerobic conditions the slow decrease seen at 13 and 20 dat is probably due to the early drying period on the awd plot and the fact that the slow decrease of the soil redox potential on both the awd and cf plots impedes methanogenesis however there are peaks at 28 and 34 dat which were probably influenced by the presence of high levels of root exudates during the maximum tillering stage gogoi et al 2005 that caused the sharp decrease of soil redox potential as seen in fig 3 to the range of 158 to 253 mv as was already stated in previous studies wassman et al 1998 yagi and minami 1990 4 2 n2o fluxes soil n2o flux was similar between cf and awd from silt loam soil this aligns with previous studies using the same soil texture in indonesia setyanto et al 2018 and in vietnam tran et al 2018 application of bc also did not result in different n2o daily fluxes this could be explained by its relatively low nitrogen content which leads to low nitrification and denitrification processes as the main activities which determine the magnitude of n2o fluxes butterbach bahl et al 2013 stehfest and bouwman 2006 in silty clay soil the magnitude and dynamics between treatments were quite variable and different to those seen in the silt loam soil these sporadic fluxes could be associated with the higher clay content in some cases the high clay content in the soil leads to slower o2 diffusion rates causing lower soil o2 concentrations that favor denitrification pelster et al 2012 meanwhile in other cases studies have shown lower n2o emission from high clay soils as low gas diffusivity allowed much time for more complete reduction of n2o to n2 weitz et al 2001 cf water management resulted in lower n2o daily fluxes when no bc was added nevertheless it became higher when bc was applied under awd without the application of bc the fluxes were higher than under cf this was in close agreement with a previous study in the philippines sibayan et al 2018 4 3 seasonal ch4 emission there is no significant interaction effect between water management and biochar compost applications for either soil texture in our study ch4 emissions were significantly p 0 05 reduced by implementing awd table 3 these findings align with the previous studies using silt loam soil in indonesia setyanto et al 2018 and in vietnam tran et al 2018 and using clay soil in thailand and the philippines chidthaisong et al 2018 sibayan et al 2018 this substantial reduction in the emission of ch4 was achieved by the efficiency of irrigation water control in awd figs 2 and 3 the low precipitation in the dry season facilitates this degree of control a more aerobic environment is created by awd which inhibit methanogens to produced ch4 resulted in decreasing ch4 emissions islam et al 2020 conversely cf makes the rice field anaerobic reducing the soil redox potential 150 mv which favors methanogenesis minamikawa and sakai 2006 a significant p 0 05 interaction effect was detected between water management and soil texture the results demonstrated that silt loam soil had 91 2 higher ch4 emission p 0 05 under cf than silty clay soil these results are in close agreement with previous experiments in arkansas brye et al 2016 2013 spain martínez eixarch et al 2021 and indonesia susilawati et al 2015 these findings confirmed the previous experiments which found that soil texture was an essential factor influencing ch4 emissions from rice fields soil with finer texture in this study emitted less ch4 as is consistent with previous research brye et al 2016 2013 martínez eixarch et al 2021 susilawati et al 2015 coarse textured soil emits more ch4 than finer textured soil for several reasons the presence of strong oxidizing agents such as ferric and manganese oxides in the silty clay soil table 1 impedes the sequence of reactions to form ch4 because the activity of iron reducing bacteria outcompetes that of methanogenic bacteria inubushi et al 2018 van bodegom et al 2001 clay soil facilitated a delayed and slower decline of soil eh to the range of 150 to 200 mv and in our study it was only shortly after transplanting that the soil eh in clay soil reached the range of 150 to 200 mv this led to a delay in reaching the reducing conditions necessary for the activation of methanogenesis brye et al 2013 the differences in their physical structure the macroporosity and microporosity distribution between the two soil textures was inversely proportional the large number of micropores in clay soil makes it harder for ch4 molecules to escape from the soil or move toward the rice plants the microaggregates in clay particles also reduce the accessibility of organic matter to microbial decomposition six et al 2002 soil with a coarser texture facilitates ch4 diffusion through the macropores brye et al 2013 so the gas stays in the soil for a limited time to stimulate the activity of methanotrophs or ch4 degrading bacteria brye et al 2016 sass and fisher 1997 smartt et al 2016a previous studies indicate that dry period of awd in the rice field could hamper ch4 formation by decreasing the duration of anaerobic condition and thus increases the availability of o2 in the soil zhang et al 2009 linquist et al 2015 this condition depresses the growth and activity of ch4 forming bacteria and stimulates methanotrophs as ch4 degrading bacteria adhya et al 2014 in the presence of biochar compost oxygen availability in awd system were maintained in the soil which may promote ch4 oxidation by ch4 degrading bacteria even after the field is re irrigated 4 4 seasonal n2o emission a significant p 0 05 interaction effect was found between water management practices and the application of biochar compost on n2o emissions from silty clay soil but not from silt loam soil awd irrigation significantly increased n2o emissions from silty clay soil this result was in line with previous studies in the philippines sibayan et al 2018 but was contrary to the study in thailand chidthaisong et al 2018 this could be explained by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer topdressing and the drying period coordinated activity of water management and n top dressing timing is essential to prevent high n2o emissions from offsetting reductions in gwp in our study and research by sibayan et al 2018 nitrogen topdressing was followed by the drying period contrary to the procedure followed in thailand chidthaisong et al 2018 where nitrogen topdressing was followed by flooded conditions nitrification of ammonium ions is relatively low under flooded conditions therefore the production of n2o is inhibited butterbach bahl et al 2013 cai et al 2007 possibly after the application of nitrogen fertilizer the awd plot should kept under flooding conditions to minimize n2o emissions chidthaisong et al 2018 nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously when conditions switched between anaerobic and aerobic in awd pathak et al 2002 therefore the presence of o2 in soil pores during aerobic conditions facilitates the escape of a considerable amount of n2o to the atmosphere before it is reduced to n2 davidson et al 2000 the bc application significantly increased the emission of n2o from silty clay soil the inorganic nitrogen from urea was the larger contributor of nitrogen from external input to the soil rather than nitrogen from organic matter the higher n2o emissions following bc applications table 3 are probably because compared to fresh organic matter biochar compost has a relatively low carbon to nitrogen ratio corton et al 2000 which reduces the intensity of nitrogen immobilization enhances nitrogen substrate availability and leads to higher n2o emissions a study in china reported that awd increased n2o fluxes by 9 xu et al 2015 moreover tirol padre et al 2018 reported that the occurrence of increases and no increases in n2o emissions under awd were site specific the effect of water management and biochar compost application on n2o emission from silt loam soil was marginal as found in previous studies setyanto et al 2018 tran et al 2018 this could be explained by several factors first n2o emissions from rice fields that are kept under anaerobic conditions for the whole growing season are known to be minor linquist et al 2015 wang et al 2016 second n2o emission were affected by several soil related factors including its carbon and nitrogen content texture moisture ph temperature and water filled pore space brentrup et al 2000 snyder et al 2009 coarse textured soil tends to emit lower n2o than finer textured soil a study found that n2o emissions were highest in soils with a combination of a fine texture i e the clay loam soils an ample amount of available carbon i e high soil organic matter content and a water filled pore space 0 60 cm3 cm 3 at field capacity harrison kirk et al 2013 the coarser soil texture with a larger number of macropores decreased the anaerobic conditions of microsites therefore decreasing the emission of n2o brentrup et al 2000 a trade off relationship between ch4 and n2o emissions was recorded from silty clay soil in rice fields awd has occasionally increased n2o emission while also decreasing ch4 emissions hou et al 2000a 2000b during awd the drainage events lead to more aerobic conditions around the rice roots which promote n2o production zheng et al 2000 4 5 rice yield gwp ghgi and wp studies have linked awd to improved root growth facilitating access to water and nutrients at soil depth yang et al 2009 organic matter application is known to increase soil fertility thereby increasing yield but in our study there is no significant interaction effect between water management and biochar compost application on rice yield or agronomic properties table 3 yield was significantly different between soil textures awd was significantly p 0 05 decreased straw root biomass and the number of tillers on silty clay soil which showed slight water stress under awd this water stress was exacerbated by the high clay content which occasionally caused soil cracks during the drying period the occurrence of soil cracks makes water and nutrients infiltrate the soil faster and deeper making it harder for the shallow rice roots to access them greve et al 2010 hao et al 2021 stewart et al 2015 the grain yield however was not significantly reduced the significant p 0 05 increase of tiller number due to the application of biochar compost could be the reason for this an interaction effect of water management and soil texture on the total gwp was detected the gwp from silt loam soil was five times greater than that from silty clay soil the main contributor to this was ch4 emissions 50 while n2o emission was the main contributor to gwp from silty clay soil since ch4 is known to be the largest contributor to global ghg emissions from rice fields maintaining lower ch4 emission from coarse textured soil is important the ghgi or the ratio between the total ghg emissions and grain yield was used to measure the efficiency and sustainability of a rice management system in this study the ratio of the total ghg emissions to grain yield from silt loam soil was five to six times higher than that from silty clay soil rice cultivation on a finer textured soil i e silty clay as in this experiment which resulted in low gwp and high yield is already efficient without any mitigating options to mitigate ghg emissions on silt loam textured soil awd irrigation is an essential option tobe applied whereas on silty clay soil the option is less essential brye et al 2013 reported a similar result where the ghgi was five times higher for a silt loam than a clay soil for rice grown in a drill seeded delayed flood production system in arkansas even when grain yields did not differ significantly between soil textures the water use on silty clay soils is significantly smaller than water use on silt loam soils this is due to the lower percolation rate and also the porosity of the silt clay soil regardless of the water management and biochar compost application water productivity in silty clay soils is significantly higher than that of silt loam soils this is because the nature of silty clay soil already result in higher grain yield and smaller water use this condition is inline with the results of previous research in thailand on clay soils chidthaisong et al 2018 and loamy sandy soils sriphirom et al 2019 4 6 ph and soil redox potential no interaction effect was found between water management and biochar compost application on soil ph or redox potential however awd irrigation significantly p 0 05 increased soil eh for both soil textures although the values were lower for silt loam soil than for silty clay soil soil redox value is one of the indicating factors for ch4 production methanogenic bacteria are obligate anaerobes and require highly reducing conditions for growth cicerone and oremland 1988 when the soil redox potential goes below a certain level these methanogens can produce large amounts of methane commonly methanogenic bacteria will actively produce ch4 when the soil eh 150 mv liang et al 2016 soil reduction oxidation reactions consist of several soil oxidants that act as electron acceptors o2 no3 permanganate mno4 ferric iron fe3 sulphate so4 2 and co2 the reduction process of these electron acceptors occurs sequentially at the appropriate eh value the reductive condition in this experiment was achieved more slowly in silty clay soil than in silt loam soil as seen in previous experiments rogers et al 2014 smartt et al 2016a the higher manganese content in silty clay soil could be the reason for the slower reduction lower soil eh in cf induces reduction of methanogens and soil oxidants xiao et al 2015 more soil oxidants to reduce leads to a longer time of methanogens to be active and slower reduction conditions to achieved during the rewetting period in awd the soil eh decreased immediately due to o2 deprivation soil textures play an important role in the reduction oxidation process the redox value in silty clay soil was higher than in silt loam soil finer textured soil has lower gas diffusivity than coarser textured soils this condition makes it more difficult for ch4 molecules to escape to the atmosphere from finer textured soil therefore ch4 molecules tend to stay longer in these soils trapped in soil pores and this allows more time for methanotrophs to reoxidize them into co2 livingston and hutchinson 1995 nazaroff 1992 brye et al 2013 smartt et al 2016b in coarser textured soils ch4 also diffuses more easily from the rhizosphere into the atmosphere through plant mediated transport philippot and hallin 2011 5 feasibility and limitations in our study combining awd with the mixture of bc did not result in any interaction effect that would reduce ghg emission and increase grain yield however awd itself had a significant effect to reduce ghg emissions especially in the case of ch4 also bc addition tended to increase grain yield as the dosage applied increased the single cropping season in this study might be the reason for this no significant interaction effect further studies across multiple seasons should be conducted to gain a better understanding on the effect of bc addition on grain yield and ghg emissions the gwp could be significantly reduced by awd when implemented on silt loam soil but the result was not significant when this was implemented on silty clay soil our study and several previous studies confirmed that rice cultivation on silty clay soil already results in lower ch4 emissions than that on silt loam soil because of the nature of the soil texture physical dan chemical factors since n2o emissions remained in the same range implementation of awd was not significant on silty clay soil in terms of the gwp the silty clay soil in our study contains higher soil nutrients carbon nitrogen phosphorus and potassium resulting in higher grain yield than the silt loam soil this leads to a much lower ratio of gwp to grain yield for the silty clay soil when choosing to implement awd as a mitigation option to reduce ghg emissions from rice fields several factors should be considered regarding the effectiveness of this option ariani et al 2021 including how much emissions will be reduced the saving of water and production s cost and the condition of the surrounding area in terms of land slope water resources including rainfall and water movement maintenance of the field under flooding conditions after nitrogen topdressing to avoid a spike in n2o emission should be considered learning from our study it is important to consider the condition of the surrounding area when awd is about to be implemented our study on silty clay soil was not ideal for water saving the decrease in water level on the awd plots was as fast as on the silt loam soil in which the finer textured soil should hold water much longer than coarser textured soil this was mainly due to maize cultivation on the adjacent field which was managed with raised beds and created water channels these channels made the water level in our plots decrease sharply from our study it can be concluded that awd with our current settings is more beneficial if implement on a coarser textured soil than a finer textured soil and it would be better if implemented during the dry season so that the wetting drying cycle will not be interrupted by high rainfall to reach the target of emission reductions the implementation of awd should also consider soil texture as ghg emissions were also affected by edaphic factor such as soil texture 6 conclusion the implementation of awd on silty clay and silt loam soil reduced water use by 12 and 18 awd also significantly p 0 05 reduced the total gwp by 39 6 without yield loss and ghgi by 38 4 compared to cf on silt loam soil conversely on silty clay soil the gwp and ghgi reduction was marginal only about 4 significant interaction effects between the treatments water management and biochar compost application were only found for n2o emission and the number of tillers on silty clay soil the implementation of awd significantly reduced ch4 emissions by 27 6 and 17 3 from silt loam and silty clay soil respectively compared to cf irrigation implementation of awd and bc application on silty clay soil increased n2o emissions by 8 1 compared to cf bc addition was significantly reduced water use in both soil textures we found that the implementation of awd on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and gwp therefore it will be more beneficial than that on silty clay soil though this study only took into account one growing season dry season 2020 the field measurements generated and results obtained add to the limited research of combining awd and biochar compost on a different soil texture in term of ch4 and n2o emissions gwp water use and rice yield in the third largest world rice producing country i e indonesia expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice systems in terms of ghg mitigation and saving irrigation water declaration of competing
