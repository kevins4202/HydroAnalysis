15630,the potential threats of shale gas wastewater discharges to receiving waters is of great concern in this study chemical analyses and biomonitoring were performed three times in a small river that received treated wastewater over a two year period the results of chemical analyses showed that the concentrations of chloride conductivity barium and strontium increased at the discharge site but their concentrations decreased considerably farther downstream 500 m the concentrations of toxic organic compounds 16 us epa priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 6 priority phthalates trace metals strontium arsenic zinc copper chromium lead cadmium nickel and neodymium and natural radionuclides 40k 238u 226ra and 232th were comparable to the corresponding background values or did not exhibit obvious accumulation in sediments with continued discharge morphological and environmental dna approaches were used to reveal the potential effects of wastewater discharges on aquatic ecosystems the results showed that the community structure of benthic invertebrates was not altered by the long term discharges of shale gas wastewaters however the biodiversity indices richness and shannon from the two approaches showed inconsistencies which were caused by multiple reasons and that substrates had a strong influence on the morphological biodiversity indices a multimetric index was proposed to further analyze morphological and environmental dna data and the results showed no significant difference between the upstream and downstream sites generally the chemical and biological results both demonstrated that the discharges of shale gas wastewaters had limited impacts on river ecosystems within two years graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shale

treatment of shale gas wastewaters reuse akob et al 2016 geeza et al 2018 jin et al 2022 kondash et al 2018 zhou et al 2022a deep well injection akob et al 2016 2015 jin et al 2022 and discharge after treatment burgos et al 2017 geeza et al 2018 warner et al 2013 zhou et al 2022a at present many operators are forced to reuse the wastewaters onsite for future hydraulic fracturing for multiple reasons i e management strategies costs etc kondash et al 2018 although deep well injection was performed at a few sites in sichuan province this treatment strategy remains controversial due to its potential negative impacts therefore as the opportunities for reuse in mature shale gas fields are diminishing wastewater discharge after treatment is becoming a more prevalent choice however to date there are no specified discharge standards for shale gas wastewaters in china thus the aged integrated wastewater discharge standard i e gb 8978 1996 is implemented currently known technologies for shale gas wastewater treatment including coagulation membrane separation forward osmosis advanced oxidization process and biodegradation jin et al 2022 sun et al 2019 mainly focus on the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total petroleum hydrocarbon tph total suspended solids tss hardness and turbidity sun et al 2019 due to the complexity of the wastewater components and the production of metabolites transformation products during treatment multiple trace toxic pollutants may still be present and potentially toxic to aquatic organisms after being released into aquatic ecosystems a few studies in north america reported that the discharges of oil and gas wastewaters after treatment increased the levels of ammonium harkness et al 2015 chloride harkness et al 2015 warner et al 2013 and bromide warner et al 2013 in surface waters and caused the accumulation of metals in freshwater mussel shells geeza et al 2018 there is no doubt that these studies help us understand the potential impacts of shale gas wastewater discharge however the results of chemical analyses cannot reflect the combined effects of multiple trace components on aquatic organisms which remains a great concern mclaughlin et al 2020a 2020b biological methods such as biomonitoring have been proven effective in assessing the potential risks of complex chemical mixtures zhou et al 2021 whereas conventional morphological methods based on direct observation of changes in organisms are time consuming and labor intensive djurhuus et al 2020 he et al 2019 pawlowski et al 2018 and rely heavily on specialized identification knowledge although environmental dna edna metabarcoding for biomonitoring needs to be improved it is becoming a widely accepted approach in biodiversity surveys and ecosystem health assessments bohmann et al 2014 pawlowski et al 2021 yang et al 2018 2017 zhang 2019 although analysis of the effects of wastewater disposal leaks and spills on aquatic ecosystems have been comprehensively reported in north america agarwal et al 2020 akob et al 2021 2016 2015 i m cozzarelli et al 2017 fahrenfeld et al 2017 maloney et al 2017 orem et al 2017 vengosh et al 2014b a long term tracking analysis of the effects of wastewater discharges after specialized treatment on receiving waters by combining chemical and biological methods is still urgently needed especially in the context of the increasing prevalence of discharges in china in this study we evaluated the effects of 2 years of wastewater discharge on water and sediment geochemistry and aquatic organisms at different trophic levels algae invertebrates and fish furthermore to improve the reliability of biological results both the traditional morphological approach and the novel edna approach were used for biomonitoring we believe that the comprehensive analysis of the potential impacts of wastewater discharge on receiving waters is conducive to formulating specialized shale gas wastewater discharge standards and selecting reasonable wastewater treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and environmental sampling one of the centralized wastewater treatment plants in the sichuan basin has been treating fpw from dozens of well pads since october 2019 zhou et al 2022a using a combined method homogenization a2o mbr fenton oxidation neutralization reaction sedimentation filtration approximately 600 m3 of wastewater was treated daily and then discharged into the river after reaching the discharge standard in china i e gb 8978 1996 water and sediment samples were taken at three sites approximately 50 m upstream from the discharge site and at twelve sites approximately 10 500 1500 and 3000 m downstream from the discharge site fig s1 at each sampling site approximately 2 5 liters of water samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for water quality analysis approximately 5 g of sediment samples were collected from the upper 0 5 cm of the streambed into sterile tubes for environmental dna analysis approximately 3 000 g of sediment samples were collected into plastic containers for chemical analysis there were no tributaries or other discharge sites in the study area the basic characteristics of the river such as width depth and velocity changed significantly between wet and dry seasons table s1 environmental samples in different seasons may differ in chemical characteristics and aquatic community structures which were considered during the sampling samples for the first wet season dry season and second wet season were taken in july 2020 after eight months of discharge february 2021 after fifteen months of discharge and july 2021 after twenty months of discharge respectively all samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory for subsequent analysis or stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction ph and dissolved oxygen do measurements were performed in situ using a hydrolab ds5 multiparameter data sonde hach usa 2 2 geochemical analysis in the laboratory water samples were analyzed for total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do ph conductivity salinity ions and metals and sediment samples were analyzed for ph tp conductivity salinity ions and metals according to previous publications zhou et al 2022b sediment samples were freeze dried and then sieved through a column of 0 85 mm and 0 15 mm mesh size sieves water and sediment samples were subjected to microwave digestion and the contents of metals were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms zhou et al 2022b the water samples were filtered 0 45 Î¼m and the sediment samples were extracted supplementary material s1 for ion analysis ammonia nh 4 chloride cl nitrate no 3 nitrite no 2 and sulfate so 4 2 ions were determined by ic 5000 ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific usa following us epa standard method 4110 the contents of tp in the water samples were determined according to the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method gb 11 893 89 chemical analysis for sixteen us epa priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs zhou et al 2021 and six priority phthalates paes i e dimethyl phthalate diethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate were performed according to us epa standard method 8270d with slight modifications zhou et al 2022b organic compounds in water samples were extracted using a liquid liquid extraction method sediment samples were freeze dried and then sieved through a column of 0 85 mm and 0 15 mm mesh size sieves the natural radionuclides 226ra 238u 40k and 228th concentrations in sediment samples were measured by gamma spectroscopy according to the methods described by jodÅowski et al 2017 2 3 environmental dna metabarcoding eukaryotic biodiversity in sediments was analyzed by edna metabarcoding 0 5 g of sediment samples were used for extracting total genomic dna using a fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s instructions subsequently the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i gene coi was amplified by coi primers m1coiintf and jghco2198 leray et al 2013 according to the methods described by yang and zhang 2020 triplicate pcr reactions were performed on all samples pcr products were checked on a 2 agarose gel pcr negative controls with no dna template were included for all experiments the purified amplicons were pooled together and then sequenced using the illumina miseq sequencing platform illumina miseq pe300 the raw gene sequencing reads were quality filtered by fastp version 0 20 0 chen et al 2018 and merged by flash version 1 2 7 magoc and salzberg 2011 the criteria for quality filtering and merging were given in supplementary material s1 after strictly controlling the quality of sequencing data cleaned sequences were sorted and distinguished by unique sample tags and then were clustered into otus at a 97 similarity cutoff using uparse version 7 1 li et al 2021 each detected otu was assigned against ncbi reference databases 2 4 morphological identification at each sampling site phytoplankton samples were collected by dragging a plankton net 0 064 mm under the water surface in a zigzagged way at an appropriate speed for 3 min concentrated water samples were collected in 100 ml glass vials and immediately fixed with lugo s solution all samples were taken to the laboratory for microscopic identification at the lowest possible taxon genus or species macroinvertebrate samples were collected using a surber type net 0 2 mm mesh size and on site sorting of macroinvertebrates was performed by three persons at each sampling site for two hours macroinvertebrates were placed into sampling bottles filled with 90 alcohol solution and morphological identification was conducted at the genus level using a nikon stereomicroscope fish sampling was conducted by fishing and using nets by the same person for 3 h at each site fish samples were stored on ice in the dark until returned to the lab in the laboratory all fish samples were identified and total length in millimeters and weight in grams were measured 2 5 multimetric indices multimetric indices considering community structure and function and the tolerance sensitivity of organisms to stressors are used to reflect the health of aquatic ecosystems under external disturbances jeanine et al 2021 yang and zhang 2020 zhao et al 2019 hence a multimetric approach based on edna data and morphological data was used to reveal the potential effects of shale gas wastewater discharge on receiving waters initially we identified the parameters that were potentially sensitive to discharges of shale gas wastewaters in this study the concentrations of ions cl no 3 nh 4 and so 4 2 conductivity and trace metals barium strontium lead chromium cadmium nickel and neodymium in water or sediments significantly anova dunnett s test p 0 05 increased at a few downstream sites table s1 which was thought to be caused by wastewater discharge table s2 therefore these 12 parameters were considered potential stressors reflecting the effects of wastewater discharge subsequently 17 biometric candidates table s3 including 5 reflecting community structure and composition and 12 reflecting tolerance sensitivity of benthic invertebrates to stressors were screened at the genus level by analyzing their correlation and discrimination spearman correlation heatmaps were run to screen benthic invertebrates that were significantly p 0 05 positive i e tolerant or negative i e sensitive with stressors for example fig s2 a and s2 b show the stressor sensitive tolerant genera identified by environmental dna and morphology respectively the percentage of sensitive tolerant organisms to a certain stressor was used as a biometric candidate to avoid redundant information pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between candidate metrics e g table s4 for strongly correlated metrics r 0 75 pearson correlation p value 0 05 only one metric with the highest correlation of stressors was retained as a candidate for metrics from different groups i e community structure and tolerance sensitivity to stressors at least one metric was retained to maintain heterogeneity to improve discriminatory power metric values showing a small range 0 05 between the 5th and 95th percentiles were excluded finally the remaining metrics table s5 were employed to calculate the multimetric index by using a ratio method zhao et al 2019 for decreased metric values as the disturbance increases the 5th and 95th percentiles were used as the worst and best unexpected values respectively the metric values were normalized according to eq 1 for increased metric values as the disturbance increases the 5th and 95th percentiles were used as the best and worst unexpected values respectively the metric values were normalized according to eq 2 thus higher normalized metric values indicate worse biological conditions 1 f i j c i 95 c i j c i 95 c i 5 2 f i j c i j c i 5 c i 95 c i 5 where c i j was the measured value of the i th index i 1 m at the j th sampling site j 1 k c i 95 and c i 5 were the 95th and 5th percentiles at all sampling sites respectively the average value for all metrics at j th site was taken as the target value p j eq 3 3 p j i 1 m f i j m to reveal the sensitivity of multimetric indices at different taxonomic levels the 17 biometric candidates were also screened at the phylum order and family levels following the above steps and the candidate metrics for index calculation were given in tables s6 s8 values were calculated using the ratio method 2 6 statistical analysis statistical tests based on analysis of variance anova were used to determine the differences of geochemical data between the upstream sites and downstream sites after discharge biological indices including richness shannon index simpson index pielou s evenness index and margalef s richness index were calculated for edna and morphological data detailed information was given in supplementary material s2 the radium equivalent activity raeq a weighted sum of the activity concentrations of 40k 238u 226ra and 232th botwe et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 was calculated to characterize the potential radiological risks in sediments the r software packages version 3 3 1 were used to perform principal co ordinates analysis pcoa distance based redundancy analysis db rda and spearman correlation heatmaps pcoa based on bray curtis was performed with the anosim test to investigate the similarities and differences in biological communities between samples co network analysis based on spearman correlation was performed using networkx version 2 5 hagberg et al 2008 a taxonomic phylogenetic tree based on maximum parsimony was built using fasttree version 2 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental parameters 3 1 1 general quality parameters of the receiving waters and sediments shale gas wastewater disposal through centralized wastewater treatment plants is rapidly developing in china shale gas wastewater is known to have high conductivity and salinity as well as high concentrations of ions metals and organic pollutants bonetti et al 2021 ni et al 2018 zhou et al 2022b inevitably treated wastewater still contains some chemicals table s2 especially considering that there is no specific discharge standard for shale gas wastewaters but rather a comprehensive standard i e gb 8978 1996 and therefore wastewater discharges may result in elevated concentrations in streams therefore general quality parameters including ph tp do cod conductivity and ions of samples in the river were considered to reveal the effects of 2 year wastewater discharge since many mountain rivers such as this one serve as irrigation water in china the results showed that the concentrations of cl and conductivity were significantly increased anova dunnett s test p 0 001 in water at downstream sites s2 s3 s4 s5 with the highest cl and conductivity at site s2 adjacent to the outfall and decreasing at sites s3 s4 and s5 fig 1 previous studies burgos et al 2017 harkness et al 2015 warner et al 2013 also reported increased concentrations of cl and conductivity in the receiving waters since there was a strong correlation between cl and conductivity spearman r 0 945 p 0 001 in water fig s3 we assume that cl is a dominant contributor to conductivity although the concentrations of cl greatly increased at the downstream discharge site s2 the concentrations at other sites still meet irrigation water quality standards gb 5084 2021 in china 350 mg l no significant variations between upstream and downstream sites were observed for cod nh 4 tp do and ph during the three seasons peak concentrations of so 4 2 in the sediments occurred downstream at site s5 table s1 where a small dam constructed reduced the flow velocity 0 02 0 13 m s and facilitated the sedimentation of chemicals 3 1 2 trace metals trace metals including the alkaline earth metals barium ba and strontium sr were increased in concentrations in the water downstream of discharge site s2 fig 1 indicating the potential effects of any chemical in the effluents lauer et al 2016 olmstead et al 2013 however these effects might be rather limited because the concentrations of ba and sr decreased substantially at the distal downstream site s3 500 m fig 1 and ba concentrations are at least 85 times lower than its toxic concentration for macroinvertebrates 68 mg l leblanc 1980 the concentrations of copper cu lead pb chromium cr cadmium cd and neodymium nd in effluents were 2 50 times higher than those in the background waters resulting in erratic increases in concentrations at downstream sites the levels of arsenic as mercury hg and zinc zn in the effluents table s2 and ba cu pb cr and cd table s1 in the receiving waters were below the guideline values in the who 2011 drinking water guidelines thus the health risks of these metals to people were low increased concentrations of metals ni nd ba cu sr cd and pb were found in sediments at discharge site s2 or at the most distant downstream site s5 but no metals exhibited significant accumulation with long lasting discharge 3 1 3 natural radionuclides natural radionuclides 40k 238u 226ra and 232th have been detected in fpw and sludge zhou et al 2022b but no specific treatment and management strategies have been employed a previous study proved that 226ra concentrations in the river sediments at the discharge site dominated by shale gas wastewaters were 200 times higher than in upstream sediments in the marcellus shale area warner et al 2013 however in this study there was no significant increase in 226ra concentration at discharge site s2 after 2 years of discharge compared to the background value at upstream site s1 table s9 the possible reason was that 226ra could be absorbed and retained in a solid phase during the storage and treatment processes zhou et al 2022b reducing its concentrations entering surface waters furthermore no accumulation in 40k 238u and 232th concentrations was observed in the downstream sediments the radium equivalent activities raeq did not show a great increase in sediments at the downstream sites 3 1 4 organic compounds similar to shale gas wastewaters in other areas butkovskyi et al 2017 mumford et al 2020 wastewaters in the sichuan basin are known to contain trace organic chemicals such as paes and pahs zhou et al 2022b in this study three paes namely dimethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate and bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate were detected in the effluents at low concentrations not detected nd 21 5 Î¼g l table s10 but their concentrations were comparable with those in surface waters in china nd 148 8 Î¼g l sun et al 2021 no us epa priority pahs were detected at concentrations above the limits of detection pahs as persistent organic pollutants pops tend to accumulate in the solid phase but they were not detected in sediments at all sampling sites in the three seasons table s11 although three paes namely dimethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate and bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate were detected in the sediments their concentrations were still in the range of concentrations detected in other river sediments nd 78 56 mg kg 1 dw sirivithayapakorn and thuyviang 2010 wang et al 2014 3 1 5 early geochemical indicators of shale gas wastewaters into surface waters shale gas wastewaters usually contain high concentrations of cl conductivity ba and sr and the reliability of these parameters as geochemical indicators has been broadly studied agarwal et al 2020 bonetti et al 2021 i m cozzarelli et al 2017 lauer et al 2016 mumford et al 2020 vidic et al 2013 wen et al 2018 in this study increased concentrations of cl conductivity ba and sr were observed in the receiving waters conductivity was positively correlated with cl in water and sediments spearman r 0 505 p 0 001 fig s3 and was easily detectable in situ therefore we believe that an early warning system for potential wastewater spills or leaks can be established based on conductivity however it should be prudent to only use conductivity as an indicator for tracing shale gas wastewaters entering surface waters since there are many reasons such as printing and dyeing paper making chemical industries and food processing which may lead to an increase in conductivity in surface waters ba and sr had a positive correlation in water spearman r 0 899 p 0 001 and sediments spearman r 0 632 p 0 001 but there was no correlation between these two trace metals and conductivity spearman p 0 05 sr had high background values and the effects of wastewater discharge on sr concentrations in the receiving waters were not easily detected while ba had low background values and the effects of wastewater discharge on ba concentrations were obvious thus ba is more suitable than sr as an indicator for further identification of shale gas wastewater contamination the changes in conductivity and ba in sediment samples lagged and thus these parameters in sediments were not suitable as early indicators of shale gas wastewaters entering surface waters 3 2 aquatic community structure changes in river water and sediment quality may pose a threat to aquatic organisms at multiple trophic levels because different taxa may respond differently to external disturbances therefore spatial and temporal changes in the community structure and biodiversity of algae macroinvertebrates and fish in the receiving waters were examined 3 2 1 biodiversity of algae and fish derived from morphology algae as producers in aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and changes in the environment maznah et al 2010 twenty three species were observed in the river of which synedra fragilaria tabellaria and navicula belonging to diatoms are common species in all three seasons species richness did not show a steady increase or decrease at sites downstream of the effluents fig s4 probably because the study area is hilly and rivers have high flow velocities and thus phytoplankton can disperse from upstream to downstream nine fish species were found in the river table s12 among them three species namely carassius auratus opsariichthys bidens and zacco platypus carassius were frequently observed at all sampling sites while other species including pseudorasbora parva monopterus albus cyprinus carpio misgurnus anguillicaudatus ctenopharyngodon idellus and pelteobagrus vachelli were observed at only a few sampling sites table s12 no fish species were found at either the upstream or the downstream sites only 3 2 2 biodiversity and community structure of benthic invertebrates derived from morphology a total of 16 genera of macroinvertebrates belonging to 3 phyla arthropoda annelida and molluska 11 orders and 13 families were identified during the study period using morphological methods caenis and acroneuria belonging to the phylum arthropoda bellamya belonging to the phylum molluska and tubifex and limnodrilus belonging to the phylum annelida were common species in the river the results of pcoa analysis from morphology showed no significant difference at the five sampling sites in all three seasons fig 2 but showed seasonal differences at the genus level fig s5 indicating that even though the community structure was distinct in different seasons long term discharge of shale gas wastewater did not alter the community structure of benthic invertebrates in the receiving waters ecological status was assessed based on three widely used ecological indices i e richness simpson index and shannon index fig 3 we observed significant variations anova dunnett s test p 0 05 in biodiversity at downstream sites s2 and s5 during the first wet and dry seasons whereas no significant decrease in diversity was observed at site s2 during the second wet season biodiversity changes among benthic invertebrates can reflect the effects of wastewater discharge in shale gas exploration areas but cannot provide all information substrate type is an important variable affecting benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity arunachalam et al 1991 in this study changes in benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity were correlated with substrate types fig 3 and sand substrates led to a significant reduction in diversity anova dunnett s test p 0 001 samples at discharge site s2 and the farthest downstream site s5 were collected in sandy substrates particles 2 mm rather than in pebbles particles 16 mm at the other sites during the first wet and dry seasons the biodiversity of samples collected in pebble substrate at discharge site s2 did not decrease in the second wet season while the biodiversity at site s5 collected in sandy substrates remained at low levels 3 2 3 biodiversity and community structure derived from environmental dna the amplicon sequencing of dna derived from environmental samples often termed environmental dna provides a novel method for potentially monitoring environmental changes in aquatic ecosystems fan et al 2020 hering et al 2018 a total of 4633 operational taxonomic units otus were observed in sediment samples with more than 37 of taxa annotated as benthic invertebrates fig s6 confirming that benthic invertebrates can be indicated by sequencing of the coi gene in this study the edna approach performed well for arthropoda annelida and molluska identified by morphology while other taxa including fungi bacteria algae and other eukaryota were also found by edna fig 4 furthermore tubifex and limnodrilus as determined by morphological data were the keystone species identified by environmental dna through conetwork analysis fig s7 and their changes in relative abundance between different sites were generally consistent with those observed in the morphological results meanwhile pcoa analysis based on edna data showed similar results to morphology based analysis fig 2 and fig s5 further confirming that the community structure of benthic invertebrates in the receiving waters was not altered by the long term discharge of shale gas wastewater the shannon and simpson indices derived from edna data did not show a large variation in all three seasons fig 3 which was different from those indices derived from morphological data these inconsistencies among biodiversity were also reported in previous studies elbrecht et al 2017 emilson et al 2017 harper et al 2020 which could be due to multiple reasons first edna metabarcoding can provide more taxon information that is difficult to identify by morphology especially at lower taxonomic levels fig 4 for example morphologically identified taxa at the genus level accounted for only 22 of invertebrate sequence reads from edna in this study fig 4 thus the richness and shannon indices obtained from edna metabarcoding were greater than those from morphology second dna fragments originating from organisms may exist in rivers for up to one month after removing dna sources li et al 2018 and dna at the sampling sites may be derived from a larger spatial scale due to the migration and dispersal of biological debris however morphological data reveal biological information from the sampled areas under similar substrates therefore direct application of edna based and morphology based diversity indices to evaluate the effects of external disturbances on aquatic ecosystems may yield inconsistent results 3 3 multimetric indices derived from environmental dna and morphological approaches we developed a multimetric index on which both environmental dna data and morphological data could be used to evaluate whether aquatic ecosystems were disturbed by human activities such as the discharges of shale gas wastewaters in this study the ecological indices most affected by shale gas wastewater discharges were applied to the final score calculations at different taxonomic levels multimetric index values derived from morphological data and those from edna metabarcoding data generally showed similar trends at most sampling sites fig 5 a recent study also proved that edna based multimetric indices gave comparable results to morphology based indices jeanine et al 2021 furthermore by comparing the multimetric indices at different taxonomic levels we found that the taxonomic level might be an important factor influencing the reproducibility of the two methods with stronger reproducibility occurring at lower taxonomic levels fig 5 both morphological and edna derived indices showed no significant difference between the upstream control site and the downstream discharge sites anova dunnett s test p 0 05 although the concentrations of geochemical indicators i e cl sr ba and conductivity of shale gas wastewaters increased in water at the downstream discharge site they decreased rapidly at other sites further downstream 500 m and toxic compounds did not exhibit obvious accumulation in sediments thus discharge has limited impacts on surface water environmental quality by combining the results of chemical and biological analyses we tend to assume that the effects of a small volume of shale gas wastewater discharge on aquatic ecosystems are limited within two years however with the rapid expansion of shale gas exploitation in china the potential effects of a large amount of wastewater discharge for a longer period on the receiving waters remain unclear and further research is needed 4 conclusions this study comprehensively evaluated the geochemical and biological status of a small river receiving treated shale gas wastewaters over a 2 year period the results showed that the cl conductivity sr and ba levels in the water increased at the discharge site but their levels were greatly decreased at other downstream sites inconsistencies between biodiversity indices obtained from morphological identifications and those from environmental dna were observed for various reasons we developed a multimetric index including metrics on community structure and functions and tolerance sensitivity of biotics to stressors to reflect the effects of external disturbances on aquatic organisms the results of chemical and biological analyses showed that the treated wastewater discharge had limited negative effects on the receiving waters over a 2 year period author contributions s b z s c p p l l and d j z designed research s b z s c p w c l m y h x q l and j h y performed research s b z and s c p analyzed data s b z

reasons i e management strategies costs etc kondash et al 2018 although deep well injection was performed at a few sites in sichuan province this treatment strategy remains controversial due to its potential negative impacts therefore as the opportunities for reuse in mature shale gas fields are diminishing wastewater discharge after treatment is becoming a more prevalent choice however to date there are no specified discharge standards for shale gas wastewaters in china thus the aged integrated wastewater discharge standard i e gb 8978 1996 is implemented currently known technologies for shale gas wastewater treatment including coagulation membrane separation forward osmosis advanced oxidization process and biodegradation jin et al 2022 sun et al 2019 mainly focus on the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total petroleum hydrocarbon tph total suspended solids tss hardness and turbidity sun et al 2019 due to the complexity of the wastewater components and the production of metabolites transformation products during treatment multiple trace toxic pollutants may still be present and potentially toxic to aquatic organisms after being released into aquatic ecosystems a few studies in north america reported that the discharges of oil and gas wastewaters after treatment increased the levels of ammonium harkness et al 2015 chloride harkness et al 2015 warner et al 2013 and bromide warner et al 2013 in surface waters and caused the accumulation of metals in freshwater mussel shells geeza et al 2018 there is no doubt that these studies help us understand the potential impacts of shale gas wastewater discharge however the results of chemical analyses cannot reflect the combined effects of multiple trace components on aquatic organisms which remains a great concern mclaughlin et al 2020a 2020b biological methods such as biomonitoring have been proven effective in assessing the potential risks of complex chemical mixtures zhou et al 2021 whereas conventional morphological methods based on direct observation of changes in organisms are time consuming and labor intensive djurhuus et al 2020 he et al 2019 pawlowski et al 2018 and rely heavily on specialized identification knowledge although environmental dna edna metabarcoding for biomonitoring needs to be improved it is becoming a widely accepted approach in biodiversity surveys and ecosystem health assessments bohmann et al 2014 pawlowski et al 2021 yang et al 2018 2017 zhang 2019 although analysis of the effects of wastewater disposal leaks and spills on aquatic ecosystems have been comprehensively reported in north america agarwal et al 2020 akob et al 2021 2016 2015 i m cozzarelli et al 2017 fahrenfeld et al 2017 maloney et al 2017 orem et al 2017 vengosh et al 2014b a long term tracking analysis of the effects of wastewater discharges after specialized treatment on receiving waters by combining chemical and biological methods is still urgently needed especially in the context of the increasing prevalence of discharges in china in this study we evaluated the effects of 2 years of wastewater discharge on water and sediment geochemistry and aquatic organisms at different trophic levels algae invertebrates and fish furthermore to improve the reliability of biological results both the traditional morphological approach and the novel edna approach were used for biomonitoring we believe that the comprehensive analysis of the potential impacts of wastewater discharge on receiving waters is conducive to formulating specialized shale gas wastewater discharge standards and selecting reasonable wastewater treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and environmental sampling one of the centralized wastewater treatment plants in the sichuan basin has been treating fpw from dozens of well pads since october 2019 zhou et al 2022a using a combined method homogenization a2o mbr fenton oxidation neutralization reaction sedimentation filtration approximately 600 m3 of wastewater was treated daily and then discharged into the river after reaching the discharge standard in china i e gb 8978 1996 water and sediment samples were taken at three sites approximately 50 m upstream from the discharge site and at twelve sites approximately 10 500 1500 and 3000 m downstream from the discharge site fig s1 at each sampling site approximately 2 5 liters of water samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for water quality analysis approximately 5 g of sediment samples were collected from the upper 0 5 cm of the streambed into sterile tubes for environmental dna analysis approximately 3 000 g of sediment samples were collected into plastic containers for chemical analysis there were no tributaries or other discharge sites in the study area the basic characteristics of the river such as width depth and velocity changed significantly between wet and dry seasons table s1 environmental samples in different seasons may differ in chemical characteristics and aquatic community structures which were considered during the sampling samples for the first wet season dry season and second wet season were taken in july 2020 after eight months of discharge february 2021 after fifteen months of discharge and july 2021 after twenty months of discharge respectively all samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory for subsequent analysis or stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction ph and dissolved oxygen do measurements were performed in situ using a hydrolab ds5 multiparameter data sonde hach usa 2 2 geochemical analysis in the laboratory water samples were analyzed for total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do ph conductivity salinity ions and metals and sediment samples were analyzed for ph tp conductivity salinity ions and metals according to previous publications zhou et al 2022b sediment samples were freeze dried and then sieved through a column of 0 85 mm and 0 15 mm mesh size sieves water and sediment samples were subjected to microwave digestion and the contents of metals were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms zhou et al 2022b the water samples were filtered 0 45 Î¼m and the sediment samples were extracted supplementary material s1 for ion analysis ammonia nh 4 chloride cl nitrate no 3 nitrite no 2 and sulfate so 4 2 ions were determined by ic 5000 ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific usa following us epa standard method 4110 the contents of tp in the water

and six priority phthalates paes i e dimethyl phthalate diethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate were performed according to us epa standard method 8270d with slight modifications zhou et al 2022b organic compounds in water samples were extracted using a liquid liquid extraction method sediment samples were freeze dried and then sieved through a column of 0 85 mm and 0 15 mm mesh size sieves the natural radionuclides 226ra 238u 40k and 228th concentrations in sediment samples were measured by gamma spectroscopy according to the methods described by jodÅowski et al 2017 2 3 environmental dna metabarcoding eukaryotic biodiversity in sediments was analyzed by edna metabarcoding 0 5 g of sediment samples were used for extracting total genomic dna using a fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s instructions subsequently the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i gene coi was amplified by coi primers m1coiintf and jghco2198 leray et al 2013 according to the methods described by yang and zhang 2020 triplicate pcr reactions were performed on all samples pcr products were checked on a 2 agarose gel pcr negative controls with no dna template were included for all experiments the purified amplicons were pooled together and then sequenced using the illumina miseq sequencing platform illumina miseq pe300 the raw gene sequencing reads were quality filtered by fastp version 0 20 0 chen et al 2018 and merged by flash version 1 2 7 magoc and salzberg 2011 the criteria for quality filtering and merging were given in supplementary material s1 after strictly controlling the quality of sequencing data cleaned sequences were sorted and distinguished by unique sample tags and then were clustered into otus at a 97 similarity cutoff using uparse version 7 1 li et al 2021 each detected otu was assigned against ncbi reference databases 2 4 morphological identification at each sampling site phytoplankton samples were collected by dragging a plankton net 0 064 mm under the water surface in a zigzagged way at an appropriate speed for 3 min concentrated water samples were collected in 100 ml glass vials and immediately fixed with lugo s solution all samples were taken to the laboratory for microscopic identification at the lowest possible taxon genus or species macroinvertebrate samples were collected using a surber type net 0 2 mm mesh size and on site sorting of macroinvertebrates was performed by three persons at each sampling site for two hours macroinvertebrates were placed into sampling bottles filled with 90 alcohol solution and morphological identification was conducted at the genus level using a nikon stereomicroscope fish sampling was conducted by fishing and using nets by the same person for 3 h at each site fish samples were stored on ice in the dark until returned to the lab in the laboratory all fish samples were identified and total length in millimeters and weight in grams were measured 2 5 multimetric indices multimetric indices considering community structure and function and the tolerance sensitivity of organisms to stressors are used to reflect the health of aquatic ecosystems under external disturbances jeanine et al 2021 yang and zhang 2020 zhao et al 2019 hence a multimetric approach based on edna data and morphological data was used to reveal the potential effects of shale gas wastewater discharge on receiving waters initially we identified the parameters that were potentially sensitive to discharges of shale gas wastewaters in this study the concentrations of ions cl no 3 nh 4 and so 4 2 conductivity and trace metals barium strontium lead chromium cadmium nickel and neodymium in water or sediments significantly anova dunnett s test p 0 05 increased at a few downstream sites table s1 which was thought to be caused by wastewater discharge table s2 therefore these 12 parameters were considered potential stressors reflecting the effects of wastewater discharge subsequently 17 biometric candidates table s3 including 5 reflecting community structure and composition and 12 reflecting tolerance sensitivity of benthic invertebrates to stressors were screened at the genus level by analyzing their correlation and discrimination spearman correlation heatmaps were run to screen benthic invertebrates that were significantly p 0 05 positive i e tolerant or negative i e sensitive with stressors for example fig s2 a and s2 b show the stressor sensitive tolerant genera identified by environmental dna and morphology respectively the percentage of sensitive tolerant organisms to a certain stressor was used as a biometric candidate to avoid redundant information pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between candidate metrics e g table s4 for strongly correlated metrics r 0 75 pearson correlation p value 0 05 only one metric with the highest correlation of stressors was retained as a candidate for metrics from different groups i e community structure and tolerance sensitivity to stressors at least one metric was retained to maintain heterogeneity to improve discriminatory power metric values showing a small range 0 05 between the 5th and 95th percentiles were excluded finally the remaining metrics table s5 were employed to calculate the multimetric index by using a ratio method zhao et al 2019 for decreased metric values as the disturbance increases the 5th and 95th percentiles were used as the worst and best unexpected values respectively the metric values were normalized according to eq 1 for increased metric values as the disturbance increases the 5th and 95th percentiles were used as the best and worst unexpected values respectively the metric values were normalized according to eq 2 thus higher normalized metric values indicate worse biological conditions 1 f i j c i 95 c i j c i 95 c i 5 2 f i j c i j c i 5 c i 95 c i 5 where c i j was the measured value of the i th index i 1 m at the j th sampling site j 1 k c i 95 and c i 5 were the 95th and 5th percentiles at all sampling sites respectively the average value for all metrics at j th site was taken as the target value p j eq 3 3 p j i 1 m f i j m to reveal the sensitivity of multimetric indices at different taxonomic levels the 17 biometric candidates were also screened at the phylum order and family levels following the above steps and the candidate metrics for index calculation were given in tables s6 s8 values were calculated using the ratio method 2 6 statistical analysis statistical tests based on analysis of variance anova were used to determine the differences of geochemical data between the upstream sites and downstream sites after discharge biological indices including richness shannon index simpson index pielou s evenness index and margalef s richness index were calculated for edna and morphological data detailed information was given in supplementary material s2 the radium equivalent activity raeq a weighted sum of the activity concentrations of 40k 238u 226ra and 232th botwe et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 was calculated to characterize the potential radiological risks in sediments the r software packages version 3 3 1 were used to perform principal co ordinates analysis pcoa distance based redundancy analysis db rda and spearman correlation heatmaps pcoa based on bray curtis was performed with the anosim test to investigate the similarities and differences in biological communities between samples co network analysis based on spearman correlation was performed using networkx version 2 5 hagberg et al 2008 a taxonomic phylogenetic tree based on maximum parsimony was built using fasttree version 2 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental parameters 3 1 1 general quality parameters of the receiving waters and sediments shale gas wastewater disposal through centralized wastewater treatment plants is rapidly developing in china shale gas wastewater is known to have high conductivity and salinity as well as high concentrations of ions metals and organic pollutants bonetti et al 2021 ni et al 2018 zhou et al 2022b inevitably treated wastewater still contains some chemicals table s2 especially considering that there is no specific discharge standard for shale gas wastewaters but rather a comprehensive standard i e gb 8978 1996 and therefore wastewater discharges may result in elevated concentrations in streams therefore general quality parameters including ph tp do cod conductivity and ions of samples in the river were considered to reveal the effects of 2 year wastewater discharge since many mountain rivers such as this one serve as irrigation water in china the results showed that the concentrations of cl and conductivity were significantly increased anova dunnett s test p 0 001 in water at downstream sites s2 s3 s4 s5 with the highest cl and conductivity at site s2 adjacent to the outfall and decreasing at sites s3 s4 and s5 fig 1 previous studies burgos et al 2017 harkness et al 2015 warner et al 2013 also reported increased concentrations of cl and conductivity in the receiving waters since there was a strong correlation between cl and conductivity spearman r 0 945 p 0 001 in water fig s3 we assume that cl is a dominant contributor to conductivity although the concentrations of cl greatly increased at the downstream discharge site s2 the concentrations at other sites still meet irrigation water quality standards gb 5084 2021 in china 350 mg l no significant variations between upstream and downstream sites were observed for cod nh 4 tp do and ph during the three seasons peak concentrations of so 4 2 in the sediments occurred downstream at site s5 table s1 where a small dam constructed reduced the flow velocity 0 02 0 13 m s and facilitated the sedimentation of chemicals 3 1 2 trace metals trace metals including the alkaline earth metals barium ba and strontium sr were increased in concentrations in the water downstream of discharge site s2 fig 1 indicating the potential effects of any chemical in the effluents lauer et al 2016 olmstead et al 2013 however these effects might be rather limited because the concentrations of ba and sr decreased substantially at the distal downstream site s3 500 m fig 1 and ba concentrations are at least 85 times lower than its toxic concentration for macroinvertebrates 68 mg l leblanc 1980 the concentrations of copper cu lead pb chromium cr cadmium cd and neodymium nd in effluents were 2 50 times higher than those in the background waters resulting in erratic increases in concentrations at downstream sites the levels of arsenic as mercury hg and zinc zn in the effluents table s2 and ba cu pb cr and cd table s1 in the receiving waters were below the guideline values in the who 2011 drinking water guidelines thus the health risks of these metals to people were low increased concentrations of metals ni nd ba cu sr cd and pb were found in sediments at discharge site s2 or at the most distant downstream site s5 but no metals exhibited significant accumulation with long lasting discharge 3 1 3 natural radionuclides natural radionuclides 40k 238u 226ra and 232th have been detected in fpw and sludge zhou et al 2022b but no specific treatment and management strategies have been employed a previous study proved that 226ra concentrations in the river sediments at the discharge site dominated by shale gas wastewaters were 200 times higher than in upstream sediments in the marcellus shale area warner et al 2013 however in this study there was no significant increase in 226ra concentration at discharge site s2 after 2 years of discharge compared to the background value at upstream site s1 table s9 the possible reason was that 226ra could be absorbed and retained in a solid phase during the storage and treatment processes zhou et al 2022b reducing its concentrations entering surface waters furthermore no accumulation in 40k 238u and 232th concentrations was observed in the downstream sediments the radium equivalent activities raeq did not show a great increase in sediments at the downstream sites 3 1 4 organic compounds similar to shale gas wastewaters in other areas butkovskyi et al 2017 mumford et al 2020 wastewaters in the sichuan basin are known to contain trace organic chemicals such as paes and pahs zhou et al 2022b in this study three paes namely dimethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate and bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate were detected in the effluents at low concentrations not detected nd 21 5 Î¼g l table s10 but their concentrations were comparable with those in surface waters in china nd 148 8 Î¼g l sun et al 2021 no us epa priority pahs were detected at concentrations above the limits of detection pahs as persistent organic pollutants pops tend to accumulate in the solid phase but they were not detected in sediments at all sampling sites in the three seasons table s11 although three paes namely dimethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate and bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate were detected in the sediments their concentrations were still in the range of concentrations detected in other river sediments nd 78 56 mg kg 1 dw sirivithayapakorn and thuyviang 2010 wang et al 2014 3 1 5 early geochemical indicators of shale gas wastewaters into surface waters shale gas wastewaters usually contain high concentrations of cl conductivity ba and sr and the reliability of these parameters as geochemical indicators has been broadly studied agarwal et al 2020 bonetti et al 2021 i m cozzarelli et al 2017 lauer et al 2016 mumford et al 2020 vidic et al 2013 wen et al 2018 in this study increased concentrations of cl conductivity ba and sr were observed in the receiving waters conductivity was positively correlated with cl in water and sediments spearman r 0 505 p 0 001 fig s3 and was easily detectable in situ therefore we believe that an early warning system for potential wastewater spills or leaks can be established based on conductivity however it should be prudent to only use conductivity as an indicator for tracing shale gas wastewaters entering surface waters since there are many reasons such as printing and dyeing paper making chemical industries and food processing which may lead to an increase in conductivity in surface waters ba and sr had a positive correlation in water spearman r 0 899 p 0 001 and sediments spearman r 0 632 p 0 001 but there was no correlation between these two trace metals and conductivity spearman p 0 05 sr had high background values and the effects of wastewater discharge on sr concentrations in the receiving waters were not easily detected while ba had low background values and the effects of wastewater discharge on ba concentrations were obvious thus ba is more suitable than sr as an indicator for further identification of shale gas wastewater contamination the changes in conductivity and ba in sediment samples lagged and thus these parameters in sediments were not suitable as early indicators of shale gas wastewaters entering surface waters 3 2 aquatic community structure changes in river water and sediment quality may pose a threat to aquatic organisms at multiple trophic levels because different taxa may respond differently to external disturbances therefore spatial and temporal changes in the community structure and biodiversity of algae macroinvertebrates and fish in the receiving waters were examined 3 2 1 biodiversity of algae and fish derived from morphology algae as producers in aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and changes in the environment maznah et al 2010 twenty three species were observed in the river of which synedra fragilaria tabellaria and navicula belonging to diatoms are common species in all three seasons species richness did not show a steady increase or decrease at sites downstream of the effluents fig s4 probably because the study area is hilly and rivers have high flow velocities and thus phytoplankton can disperse from upstream to downstream nine fish species were found in the river table s12 among them three species namely carassius auratus opsariichthys bidens and zacco platypus carassius were frequently observed at all sampling sites while other species including pseudorasbora parva monopterus albus cyprinus carpio misgurnus anguillicaudatus ctenopharyngodon idellus and pelteobagrus vachelli were observed at only a few sampling sites table s12 no fish species were found at either the upstream or the downstream sites only 3 2 2 biodiversity and community structure of benthic invertebrates derived from morphology a total of 16 genera of macroinvertebrates belonging to 3 phyla arthropoda annelida and molluska 11 orders and 13 families were identified during the study period using morphological methods caenis and acroneuria belonging to the phylum arthropoda bellamya belonging to the phylum molluska and tubifex and limnodrilus belonging to the phylum annelida were common species in the river the results of pcoa analysis from morphology showed no significant difference at the five sampling sites in all three seasons fig 2 but showed seasonal differences at the genus level fig s5 indicating that even though the community structure was distinct in different seasons long term discharge of shale gas wastewater did not alter the community structure of benthic invertebrates in the receiving waters ecological status was assessed based on three widely used ecological indices i e richness simpson index and shannon index fig 3 we observed significant variations anova dunnett s test p 0 05 in biodiversity at downstream sites s2 and s5 during the first wet and dry seasons whereas no significant decrease in diversity was observed at site s2 during the second wet season biodiversity changes among benthic invertebrates can reflect the effects of wastewater discharge in shale gas exploration areas but cannot provide all information substrate type is an important variable affecting benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity arunachalam et al 1991 in this study changes in benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity were correlated with substrate types fig 3 and sand substrates led to a significant reduction in diversity anova dunnett s test p 0 001 samples at discharge site s2 and the farthest downstream site s5 were collected in sandy substrates particles 2 mm rather than in pebbles particles 16 mm at the other sites during the first wet and dry seasons the biodiversity of samples collected in pebble substrate at discharge site s2 did not decrease in the second wet season while the biodiversity at site s5 collected in sandy substrates remained at low levels 3 2 3 biodiversity and community structure derived from environmental dna the amplicon sequencing of dna derived from environmental samples often termed environmental dna provides a novel method for potentially monitoring environmental changes in aquatic ecosystems fan et al 2020 hering et al 2018 a total of 4633 operational taxonomic units otus were observed in sediment samples with more than 37 of taxa annotated as benthic invertebrates fig s6 confirming that benthic invertebrates can be indicated by sequencing of the coi gene in this study the edna approach performed well for arthropoda annelida and molluska identified by morphology while other taxa including fungi bacteria algae and other eukaryota were also found by edna fig 4 furthermore tubifex and limnodrilus as determined by morphological data were the keystone species identified by environmental dna through conetwork analysis fig s7 and their changes in relative abundance between different sites were generally consistent with those observed in the morphological results meanwhile pcoa analysis based on edna data showed similar results to morphology based analysis fig 2 and fig s5 further confirming that the community structure of benthic invertebrates in the receiving waters was not altered by the long term discharge of shale gas wastewater the shannon and simpson indices derived from edna data did not show a large variation in all three seasons fig 3 which was different from those indices derived from morphological data these inconsistencies among biodiversity were also reported in previous studies elbrecht et al 2017 emilson et al 2017 harper et al 2020 which could be due to multiple reasons first edna metabarcoding can provide more taxon information that is difficult to identify by morphology especially at lower taxonomic levels fig 4 for example morphologically identified taxa at the genus level accounted for only 22 of invertebrate sequence reads from edna in this study fig 4 thus the richness and shannon indices obtained from edna metabarcoding were greater than those from morphology second dna fragments originating from organisms may exist in rivers for up to one month after removing dna sources li et al 2018 and dna at the sampling sites may be derived from a larger spatial scale due to the migration and dispersal of biological debris however morphological data reveal biological information from the sampled areas under similar substrates therefore direct application of edna based and morphology based diversity indices to evaluate the effects of external disturbances on aquatic ecosystems may yield inconsistent results 3 3 multimetric indices derived from environmental dna and morphological approaches we developed a multimetric index on which both environmental dna data and morphological data could be used to evaluate whether aquatic ecosystems were disturbed by human activities such as the discharges of shale gas wastewaters in this study the ecological indices most affected by shale gas wastewater discharges were applied to the final score calculations at different taxonomic levels multimetric index values derived from morphological data and those from edna metabarcoding data generally showed similar trends at most sampling sites fig 5 a recent study also proved that edna based multimetric indices gave comparable results to morphology based indices jeanine et al 2021 furthermore by comparing the multimetric indices at different taxonomic levels we found that the taxonomic level might be an important factor influencing the reproducibility of the two methods with stronger reproducibility occurring at lower taxonomic levels fig 5 both morphological and edna derived indices showed no significant difference between the upstream control site and the downstream discharge sites anova dunnett s test p 0 05 although the concentrations of geochemical indicators i e cl sr ba and conductivity of shale gas wastewaters increased in water at the downstream discharge site they decreased rapidly at other sites further downstream 500 m and toxic compounds did not exhibit obvious accumulation in sediments thus discharge has limited impacts on surface water environmental quality by combining the results of chemical and biological analyses we tend to assume that the effects of a small volume of shale gas wastewater discharge on aquatic ecosystems are limited within two years however with the rapid expansion of shale gas exploitation in china the potential effects of a large amount of wastewater discharge for a longer period on the receiving waters remain unclear and further research is needed 4 conclusions this study comprehensively evaluated the geochemical and biological status of a small river receiving treated shale gas wastewaters over a 2 year period the results showed that the cl conductivity sr and ba levels in the water increased at the discharge site but their levels were greatly decreased at other downstream sites inconsistencies between biodiversity indices obtained from morphological identifications and those from environmental dna were observed for various reasons we developed a multimetric index including metrics on community structure and functions and tolerance sensitivity of biotics to stressors to reflect the effects of external disturbances on aquatic organisms the results of chemical and biological analyses showed that the treated wastewater discharge had limited negative effects on the receiving waters over a 2 year period author contributions s b z s c p p l l and d j z designed research s b z s c p w c l m y h x q l and j h y performed research s b z and s c p analyzed data s b z

15631,the biogeochemical reactions of dimethylarsinic acid dmas v were investigated using simulated wetland systems in a laboratory dmas v was injected into the wetland water and the as concentrations in the water plants and sediments were monitored aqueous and solid phase as speciation was evaluated and the results revealed that the dmas v was completely transported to the sediments and plants x ray absorption spectroscopic measurement of the as in the sediment revealed that approximately 85 95 of as existed as inorganic as species demonstrating the important role of microorganisms in the biogeochemical reaction of dmas v the influences of microbes were further investigated in smaller batches under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the microbial batch results showed that dmas v demethylation reduced the total aqueous as concentration demonstrating that as v has higher affinity to wetland sediment than dmas v the redox conditions were also revealed as an important controlling factor of the as reaction and under anaerobic conditions we observed the presence of the most toxic form of inorganic as iii in the aqueous phase although this study reports one example from a specific wetland the important roles of the redox conditions and microbial influences were identified from the comprehensive analysis of as speciation and mass balance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wetland microcosm dimethylarsinic acid dmas v as demethylation as v reduction biogeochemical reaction x ray absorption spectroscopy xas data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as contamination is caused by geological and anthropogenic sources and the background concentration of as in soil varies globally depending on the geographical area mandal and suzuki 2002 geological sources mainly contribute to the contamination of inorganic as owing to the high toxicity of inorganic as previous studies have focused on the reactions of inorganic as species such as as v or as iii mondal et al 2013 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wang and mulligan 2008 greater research focus has been applied to inorganic as because geochemical reactions of organoarsenicals are complex and their related analytical techniques are not easy moreover inorganic as was regarded to be more important due to its prevalence and higher toxicity compared to organoarsenicals however recent studies have revealed that methylated arsenicals such as monomethylarsenite mmas iii or dimethylarsenite dmas iii are much more toxic than as iii and can naturally occur during natural as cycling yan et al 2015 yoshinaga et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 the most commonly studied organic as species are monomethylarsenate mmas v and dimethylarsenate dmas v mmas v and dmas v have been used as major components of herbicides and pesticides during the past half century and the contamination of farmland and golf course soil by dmas v has been previously reported arao et al 2009 pichler et al 2008 sierra alvarez et al 2006 besides methylated arsenicals occur by biotransformation of inorganic as species early research on organoarsenicals focused on mmas v and dmas v which are closely related to the high mmas v and dmas v contents observed in rice grains several studies have reported that dmas v constitutes 50 of the total as in rice heikens 2006 meharg et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 in addition to grains the proportion of dmas v accumulated in polychaetes bristle worms found in wetland sediments was also measured to be 1 25 of the total as watts et al 2013 therefore increasing attention is being paid to the measurement and control of dmas v in wetland and soil environments kumar and riyazuddin 2010 the behavior and transformation mechanisms of dmas v in soil and plants have been previously studied zeng et al 2018 showed that the as methylation rates by microbial communities depend on the depth of the as contaminated soil and correlations between the dmas v concentration and different environmental parameters lafferty and loeppert 2005 reported that dmas v is adsorbed in ferrihydrite and goethite depending on the ph while it is desorbed in the presence of phosphate some studies have been conducted on the uptake and transport of mmas v and dmas v from the root to the shoot li et al 2009 raab et al 2007 smith et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 the biogeochemical reactions of dmas v in soil or wetlands are particularly complicated due to the occurrence of various chemical and biological reactions that can control the fate and transport of as species within wetland components such as water sediments plants and microbes the reactions in soil or wetlands include adsorption desorption precipitation dissolution oxidation reduction and methylation demethylation di et al 2019 microorganisms are known to be a key player in these transformations research has shown that some microbial species are capable of methylating as from inorganic as species in the soil lomax et al 2012 furthermore as methylation occurs due to arsenite s adenosylmethionine sam methyltransferase enzymes qin et al 2006 arsenic transformation processes such as oxidation reduction and methylation are gene specified they can also provide information on primers that can specifically amplify these processes huang et al 2016 mirza et al 2017 quÃ©mÃ©neur et al 2010 however research on the microbes or enzymes that are involved in the demethylation of dmas v is relatively lacking previously some types of microbes such as montrachet wine yeast and candida humicola have been reported to be capable of as demethylation crecelius 1977 cullen et al 1979 lehr et al 2003 more recently yan et al 2015 proposed the arsenic demethylation mechanism of cyanobacteria and chen et al 2019 revealed the involvement of methanogenic archaea in the demethylation of dmas v it is thought that the biotransformation of as species is an important part of as biogeochemical cycles while taking a role in microbial warfare or detoxification processes chen and rosen 2020 in this study the transformation and speciation of organic and inorganic as were investigated in a dmas v contaminated wetland system considering all the constituents of the system such as the wetland water plants and sediments using a relatively large scale laboratory microcosm microcosm tests were performed to simulate field conditions with a high solid to solution ratio and considerable adsorptive capacity for aqueous as species to observe the aqueous phase change of as speciation additional small scale batch experiments with low solid to solution ratio were conducted the effects of microbial activity on as transformation were investigated using manipulated redox conditions and substrate additions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site the wetland surface waters and sediments used in the experiments were obtained from an artificially constructed ecological wetland located in okcheon chungcheongbuk do korea this wetland is a water purification facility constructed to prevent the inflow of non point source pollutants from the surrounding area into daecheong lake a drinking water source for nearby cities sampling for the experiment was performed in a shallow wetland which was a part of the natural water purification process installed in this facility the chemical properties of the water flowing into the shallow wetland where sampling was performed are shown in supplementary material table s1 the baseline as concentration measured from the wetland sediment is 3 11 1 24 mg as kg the surface water sediment and aquatic plants growing in the field were collected and immediately transferred to the laboratory for setting the microcosms 2 2 installation of microcosms all sediment samples which were collected from the constructed wetland were uniformly mixed and used to construct the microcosms the schematic diagram of the wetland microcosm is presented in fig s1 in supplementary information si the wetland water was used without filtration or pre processing four microcosms were constructed to conduct with plant and without plant experiments in duplicates each microcosm was 40 cm in diameter and height and was constructed using acrylic materials the microcosm was filled with sediment up to a height of approximately 15 cm from the bottom the walls of the microcosm were covered with a black sheet up to the height of the sediment layer to block light thereby simulating the actual sediment environment wetland water was poured on top of the sediment to a depth of approximately 15 cm the total volume of wetland sediment and water in each microcosm was approximately 20 l two or three yellow flag irises collected from the constructed wetland were planted in the sediment of the with plant microcosms no plant was transferred to the without plant microcosms the prepared microcosms were installed inside a growth chamber in the laboratory a fluorescent lamp was used to control light to simulate 16 h of day and 8 h of night and the temperature of the chamber was set to 25 c subsequently the microcosms were conditioned for approximately two months additional wetland water was regularly added to the microcosms to tackle the decrease in water level due to evapotranspiration after the conditioning period dmas v was spiked to 7 5 mg l in the wetland water assuming this concentration of dmas v could cause any kind of disease but is not lethally toxic to microbes and plants a previous study has reported that 5000 mg l of dmas v did not affect the inhibitory effect on methanogenic activity sierra alvarez et al 2004 the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp of the wetland water were monitored in the dmas v contaminated microcosms sensors were installed at 7 5 cm below the sediment surface to measure the ph and orp of porewater porewater was collected using samplers made of 0 15 Î¼m pore size ceramic tubes rhizon css 5 cm rhizosphere research products wageningen netherlands to monitor porewater properties the rhizon sampler was installed inside the sediment layer 7 5 cm below the sediment surface the monitored ph and orp results are provided in fig s2 the wetland water and sediments in the microcosms were kept stable without agitation except during the periodic addition of water and efforts were made to minimize agitation during the addition of water the microcosms were monitored for approximately two months under these conditions 2 3 analysis of as speciation in wetland water surface and porewater were collected once a week during microcosm monitoring the aqueous phase as speciation was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms in the hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent technologies santa clara ca usa part of the apparatus the separation of as species was conducted under anion exchange conditions with a hamilton prp x 100 column 250 mm 4 1 mm i d 10 Âµm and a mobile phase of 5 mm malonic acid ph 5 6 adjusted with 1 aqueous ammonia injected at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the mobile phases were transferred to the icp ms 7800 agilent technologies santa clara ca usa to quantify the amount of as in each species the arsenic species were detected at m z 75 and possible chloride interference was eliminated by the collision of 40ar35cl molecules with helium gas by kinetic energy discrimination the details of hplc and icp ms instrumental conditions are provided in si table s2 with example calibrations curves and a chromatogram fig s3 standard solutions of four different arsenic species sodium arsenite naaso2 sigma aldrich sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o sigma aldrich monomethylarsonic acid ch3asna2o3 6h2o chemservice and dimethylarsinic acid ch3 2aso oh sigma aldrich were purchased as solids and prepared as 1000 mg l stock solutions to obtain calibration curves aqueous mixtures of each of the four as species were prepared at concentrations of 1 5 10 20 50 and 100 Î¼g l using 5 mm malonic acid as a matrix solution the detection of mmas iii and dmas iii were tested using the same hplc icp ms method the tested samples of mmas iii and dmas iii were prepared by the reduction of 0 013 m of mmas v and dmas v standard solutions mixed with the same volumes of 0 067 m l cysteine hydrochloride solution for 1 5 h at 70 suzuki et al 2004 this method successfully identified the presence of mmas iii but not for dmas iii as per the result shown in fig s4 in the si the dmas iii peak seemed to be overlapped with dmas v using this method as species can be distinguished into the following five chemical species uncharged as species representing arsenite as iii mmas iii dmas v mmas v and arsenate as v the quantitative measurements were conducted by four peak positions except mmas iii 2 4 analysis of as concentration and speciation in wetland plants and sediment after completion of the monitoring of as concentration the overlying water was removed and cores of the unstirred sediment were collected using a plastic core tube the cores were frozen at an extremely low temperature 76 c and cut into 5 sections of 3 cm each depending on the depth from the sediment surface part of the sediment sample was dried and subjected to aqua regia hcl hno3 1 3 digestion to determine the total as concentration for aqua regia digestion 1 00 g of well mixed ground soil was digested in 12 ml of aqua regia on a hotplate for 3 h at 110 c after evaporation to near dryness the sample was rinsed and made up to 30 ml with 2 hno3 after filtering through whatman no 42 filter this digestion method was also applied to the dried plant and algal matter collected after microcosm experiments two or three yellow flag irises were transferred only in the with plant microcosms but some water mosses in the with plant microcosms and a large amount of algae and water moss in the without plant microcosms grew naturally during the experimental period therefore the biomass of algae and water moss was collected and dried in a 110 dry oven for the measurement of as concentration the concentration of extracted as was then measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes horiba jobin yvon kyoto japan the digestion tests were duplicated for all samples and the instrumental and metrological parameters of icp oes are provided in si table s3 the other part of the sediment sample remained frozen until further use in the measurement of solid phase as speciation using x ray absorption spectroscopy xas the xas measurement was conducted at beamline 8c in the pohang accelerator laboratory south korea this method is highly advantageous as it allows for direct analysis of solid state as speciation without leaching of sediments the sediment was ground in an anaerobic glovebox without drying before being packed to a thickness of 2 mm in an aluminum holder all xas measurement procedures were conducted in a he flow chamber where contact with oxygen was prevented a double crystal si 1 1 1 monochromator was used to obtain the x ray energies the maximum energy was detuned by 30 to reduce the glitches from the higher order harmonic frequencies the as k edge xas was measured in both the transmittance and fluorescence modes using au foil at the l 3 edge of 11 918 7 ev the fractions of as species present in the sediment samples were estimated through linear combination fitting lcf analysis using model compounds representing the as v as iii dmas v mmas v and as2s3 spectra associated with the solid surface the model compounds representing as v as iii dmas v and mmas v were prepared with various amounts of na2haso4 7h2o naaso2 c2h6aso2 na 3h2o and ch4asnao3 1 5h2o powder respectively the model compound for as2s3 was an orpiment powder purchased from sigma aldrich the ifeffit software ravel and newville 2005 was implemented for all the necessary analyzes of the xas peaks the edge energy positions of dmas v and mmas v are too close the difference of edge position less than 1 ev to make a good fit of linear combination fitting of xanes parts of the spectra so that as v as iii dmas v mmas v and as2s3 the comparison of edge positions of the five as species can be found in si fig s5 2 5 calculation of the mass balance of as in microcosms to calculate the total mass balance of as in the microcosms we assumed that the entire amount of as was contained in the wetland water soil plants and algae the quantity and as concentration of wetland water as well as the total dry masses of plants and algae are parameters indicating the quantity and as concentrations of the microcosm components although it was possible to measure the as concentration in the sediment the total quantity of as in the sediment was difficult to measure owing to the large amount of sediment and varying concentrations of as based on the sediment depth the amount of volatilized as could not be measured because the microcosms were kept open to the atmosphere while being operated hence the quantity of as in the sediment and as volatilized was calculated by subtracting the quantity of as in the measurable components from the total quantity of injected as in order to calculate the mass balance of as the formula for calculating the mass balance of as is as follows a s sediment a s volatilized a s injected v w c w m plant c plant m algae c algae where a s sediment total quantity of as in sediment mg a s volatilized total quantity of injected as disappeared by volatilization a s injected total quantity of as v w quantity of wetland water l c w as concentration of wetland water mg l m p l a n t dry biomass of plants kg c p l a n t as concentration of plant biomass mg kg m a l g a e dry biomass of algae kg c a l g a e as concentration of algae mg kg to measure the as concentrations in the sediment plants and algae as was extracted using the aqua regia digestion method and the obtained as concentrations of the solutions were measured using icp oes analysis 2 6 microbial community analysis to analyze the microbial community the extracted dna from the collected topsoil of each with plant and without plant microcosm was amplified based on the 16s rrna genes the primer sets 515fb and 806rb covering both archaea and bacteria v4 region were used walters et al 2016 sequencing was performed using the illumina miseq platform at macrogen inc republic of korea the sequencing protocol was based on the miseq system user guide 15027617 v01 low quality reads were filtered using sickle ver 1 33 the sequenced reads were analyzed using qiime2 bolyen et al 2019 sequences of representative operational taxonomic units otus were grouped a blastn search of representative otus was performed against the gtdbtk and national center for biotechnology information ncbi rrna databases to identify the taxonomies of representative otus the selected sequences were aligned with bioedit and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using mega7 based on the neighbor joining method kumar et al 2016 the data were deposited in ncbi as srr16229788 and srr16229789 2 7 small scale batch for microbial experiment homogenous wetland sediment 0 8 g and wetland water 40 ml were placed in a 160 ml serum vial and mixed the wetland water was filtered through a 0 22 Âµm pore size filter to remove microorganisms all serum vials and other experimental apparatus coming into contact with the samples were autoclaved to prevent microbial contamination the 0 1 mg l resazurin indicator solution was added to each batch to identify the redox condition of the batch by color to facilitate microbiological activity 0 01 yeast extract as a microbial substrate was injected into the substrate amended batch but not into the other batch one set of the above described batches was prepared under ambient air aerobic batches and the other set was prepared under n2 purged gas anaerobic batches an abiotic control sample was prepared by adding substrate under aerobic conditions and autoclaved to inhibit microbial activity autoclaving was performed three times at 121 c for 20 min the prepared batches were capped with a butyl rubber septum to block gas exchange during the experiment they were cultured under dark conditions at 25 c for approximately one week of conditioning to create the desired mode after the conditioning period the batches were spiked with a concentrated dmas v stock solution so that the as concentration of the solutions in the batch reached 7 5 mg l to monitor the aqueous as concentration in test batches solutions were sampled at certain intervals during 42 days of incubation period through the septum using a syringe needle particularly during the sampling of the anaerobic batches extra caution was taken by removing air from the syringe needle through purging it with nitrogen gas to avoid oxygen contamination the collected solution samples were filtered using a 0 45 Âµm pore size filter and stored in a freezer until further analysis the concentrations of aqueous phase as speciations were determined using hplc icp ms 3 results and discussion 3 1 as concentration in surface water and porewater of microcosms fig 1 shows the as speciation and concentration in the aqueous phase for the initially injected dmas v 7 5 mg l during the observation period more than 50 days even though four different as species as iii as v dmas v and mmas v were separated and measured using hplc icp ms only dmas v was detected in the surface water and pore water and the as concentration was just displayed as dmas v concentration in fig 1 none of the chromatograms of analyzed samples showed any peaks in the position of mmas iii retention time demonstrating that there is no evidence of the generation of demethylated intermediate byproduct mmas v or its reduced species mmas iii the possible transformation of dmas v to dmas iii was presumed to be minimal because no active microbial activity was expected in undisturbed wetland water as shown in fig 1a the dmas v concentration in surface water decreased over time and had dropped below the detection limit in the water collected after 50 days the decreasing rates of dmas v in the surface water were largely similar but not identical to those in the with plant and without plant microcosms the abiotic degradation and the diffusion due to concentration gradient are partly responsible for the decrease in dmas v concentration of dmas v because the surface water remained still no intentional agitation during the test period the dmas v concentration decrease rate during the 20 30 day time period was relatively higher in the with plant microcosm than that in the without plant microcosm possibly due to the faster surface water infiltration into the sediment layer with the development of plant roots this interpretation is supported by the higher dmas v concentration in the sediment porewater in the with plant microcosm compared to that of the without plant microcosm as shown in fig 1b the dmas v concentration in the porewater of the with plant microcosm peaked between 10 and 20 days and subsequently decreased possibly due to the rapid adsorption of as by the sediment and plant in addition some amount of dmas v may have been absorbed by plants and transported to plant tissues the immobilization of dmas v by the sediment and plants has been reported by previous studies huang et al 2020 liu et al 2018 shyleshchandran et al 2018 3 2 as concentration and speciation depending on sediment depth the measured total as concentration and estimated as speciation obtained from the lcf results of the xanes spectrum for the sediment samples by the sediment depth are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively large fluctuations of as concentration in the duplicated microcosm revealed in fig 2 can be attributed to the general characteristics of low representability of the soil and sediment samples particularly in this relatively large experimental setup the sediment samples used in aqua regia digestion were a small amount 3 g compared to the total sediment weight 20 l in volume which is possibly heavier than 3000 g in mass therefore it is reasonable to focus on the overall trend of as uptake throughout the sediment layer rather than on individual values from the measured results the total as concentration in the sediment showed a decreasing trend with increasing sediment depth and it dropped below the detectable level when the depth of the sediment exceeded 6 cm the lcf results indicated conversion of most of the dmas v to inorganic arsenic forms i e as iii or as v in the sediment moreover there was a clear trend of further transformation of as v to as iii with increasing sediment depth indicating that the reducing conditions of deeper sediment layers resulted in the reduction of as v these results may suggest that the transformation of as speciation actively occurred due to the various soil microorganisms present in the sediment here it needs to be noted that the xas analysis only shows an overall trend of as behavior not a precise quantitative change of each as species as only a small fraction of the total soil mass was used for one xas measurement also other methylated arsenic such as mmas iii dmas iii mmas v were not included in the reference spectrum of lcf analysis this is because the detection of mmas iii and dmas iii is difficult due to their rapid oxidation and high volatilization stÃ½blo et al 2021 furthermore the similar edge energies of mmas v and dmas v approximately 0 7 ev may lead to falsely fitting results while the volatilized as fraction cannot be overlooked fig 3 confirms that the predominant as species in the soil are inorganic as v and as iii demonstrating that the active demethylation is being carried out by soil microorganisms 3 3 mass balance of as in microcosm the mass balance of as in the microcosms needs to be calculated to understand the geochemical behavior of dmas v in the whole wetland system the total amount of as in biomass was determined from floating water mosses iris stems and iris roots in the with plant microcosms and algae in the without plant microcosms based on the total dry mass of each biomass type and their as concentrations table 1 in the with plant microcosms a higher amount of as was present in the water mosses salvinia minima and iris roots than in the iris stems salvinia minima is known to be a water moss with a high adsorption capacity for heavy metals such as as ni cr and cd olguÃ­n et al 2002 sooknah 2000 furthermore several studies have reported that a larger proportion of as uptake occurs in the roots than in the stems or grains of rice plants raab et al 2007 smith et al 2008 in the without plant microcosm a considerable mass of algae was present the amount of as from the harvested algae measured 26 56 mg as kg dry mass of algae which equated to 0 3 0 4 of total as added in both plant and algae the total amount of as transferred to biomass is less than 1 based on the mass balance calculation and on the assumption that all other as are associated with the wetland sediment the proportion of as transported to the sediment including possible loss by as volatilization can be expected to be approximately 99 of the total as in the microcosm system the volatilization of as is an important part of the natural as cycle but the contribution of volatilization in as mass balance cannot be accounted for in this study due to the open air design of the experiment based on previous findings highly volatile as species are methyl arsines that typically occur in anaerobic environments and the typical volatilization accounts for only less than 1 3 5 of the soil as budget mestrot et al 2011 zhang and reid 2022 therefore the experiment setup of this large scale microcosm is not sufficient to account for the as volatilization in this study although the amount of arsenic transferred from the soil to the plants was small these results clearly show that as present in the soil caused the as contamination of plants the absorption of as from soil to plants especially the accumulation of dmas v in rice grains under anoxic paddy soil conditions is considered to be a serious problem in many regions ma et al 2014 williams et al 2005 zavala et al 2008 3 4 microbial communities of microcosm sediments information regarding the microbial communities was obtained using miseq sequencing the assigned sequences showed similar microbial communities in both the with plant and without plant microcosms table 2 the majority of the microbial groups were identified to be bacteria approximately 99 8 while archaea accounted for a proportion of less than 0 2 the dominant phyla in the batches were proteobacteria class deltaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes major otus were classified in the genera geobacter dechloromonas and anaeromyxobacter in particular geobacter like reads were high 15 7 and 12 3 in the with plant and without plant microcosms respectively fig s6 in otu3 the proportions of dechloromonas denitrificans atcc baa 841 betaproteobacteria 98 87 similarity were 3 6 and 4 0 in the with and without plant microcosms respectively otu8 identified as anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans 2cp 1 deltaproteobacteria 94 12 similarity accounted for proportions of 2 3 and 4 7 in the with and without plant microcosms respectively these bacteria are well known iron reducing bacteria hori et al 2010 weber et al 2006 zhou et al 2016 furthermore they play a major role in microbial mediated as release from the environment giloteaux et al 2013 kudo et al 2013 suhadolnik et al 2017 in this study as was not released into the surface water of the microcosm even though iron reducing bacteria geobacter and anaeromyxobacter related to as elution were dominant the probable cause for this result was a relatively high solid to solution ratio applied in the microbial test conditions indicating the presence of enough adsorptive sites even for the relatively mobile as iii additionally the redox conditions within the tested microcosm were not considered to be extreme in the presence of abundant organic matter or stronger anaerobic conditions in a microcosm the possibility of as release along with the reductive dissolution of iron cannot be overlooked stuckey et al 2016 demonstrated that arsenic release can be limited or reactive depending on the amount of organic carbon or redox conditions applied to the mekong delta sediment that was naturally polluted with as in general the increased concentration of inorganic as iii in the porewater released from the soil solids can be attributed to the enhanced activity of fe and as reducers wang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 according to kudo et al 2013 anaeromyxobacter sp strain psr 1 reduced as v to as iii and increased the amount of as iii in the solid phase of soil the microbial community results indicate that iron reducing bacteria play a major role in the as cycle in the soil phase 3 5 results of the small scale batch experiment to investigate the influence of microbial activities on the behavior of as a small scale microbial batch experiment was performed and the transformation of dmas v with time was observed by measuring the amounts of different as species i e dmas v mmas v inorganic as v and inorganic as iii in the aqueous phase the presence of mmas iii in all samples was confirmed by checking a peak appearing at the retention time of mmas iii in the hplc icp ms chromatogram if no peak was identified it indicated that the generation reaction of mmas iii did not occur under aerobic conditions the reduction of dmas v concentration was observed in both biotic systems with and without yeast extract addition fig 4 a b however the aqueous phase dmas v decrease did not occur in the abiotic system that was autoclaved to inhibit microbial activity fig 4c in this small scale microbial batch we applied a low solid to solution ratio to minimize the abiotic adsorption process of as on the sediment surface and to maximize the impact of microbial reactions as it was intended a mostly constant dmas v concentration over time was seen in fig 4c in the biotic batch under aerobic conditions fig 4a b two weeks after dmas v addition the dmas v concentration started to decrease and gradually reduced over a period of 42 days post which dmas v was no longer detectable the amount of inorganic as v started to increase in the aqueous phase with the decrease in dmas v demonstrating that the dmas v was transformed into an inorganic form via microbial demethylation reaction here the amount of measured as v was smaller than the amount of dmas v that disappeared implying that a portion of the as v was adsorbed in the sediment after demethylation from dmas v inorganic as v generally has higher adsorption affinity to soil or sediment than dmas v does huang and matzner 2007 lafferty and loeppert 2005 turpeinen et al 1999 which can also be confirmed by the concentration of dmas v over time under the abiotic batch conditions shown in fig 4c the results of the abiotic batch experiment show that little dmas v adsorption occurred implying that the adsorption capacity of dmas v was very low in the batch and the abiotic degradation is not noticeable contrary to the expectation of a more active demethylation in the substrate added batch under aerobic conditions the addition of substrate did not accelerate microbial mediated as demethylation rather a slightly higher amount of inorganic as v was measured in the batch without substrate addition from this result it could be assumed that dmas v demethylation occurred due to the microorganisms consuming indigenous organic matter in the sediment as a substrate or that the added yeast extract may have acted as a chelating agent for dmas v adsorption a similar chelating effect of yeast extract was reported by woolson et al 1982 suggesting that dmas v is adsorbed by organic matter leading to reduced bioavailability in this study the main demethylated as species of dmas v was inorganic as v whereas an absence of measurable concentration of inorganic as v in the surface water across the experimental period was indicated by the result of the large scale microcosm data in section 3 1 this difference was possibly due to the higher loading of sediment in the microcosm against the relatively lower total amount of dmas v instead the solid phase as speciation that occurred in the microcosm sediment verified that the majority of as species in the sediment were inorganic as v and as iii due to dmas v demethylation after dmas v demethylation to inorganic as v sequential as v reduction to as iii occurred in the sediment layer with anaerobic conditions formed over time in the small scale batches under anaerobic conditions dmas v demethylation also occurred however the transformation rate in the anaerobic systems was less effective than that in the aerobic systems as shown in fig 4d e the further transformation of as v to as iii although in a small amount was observed in both anaerobic batches in general the oxidation of as iii occurs due to abiotic or biotic reactions but the reduction of as v is known to occur mainly due to biotic reactions many studies have been conducted on the microbial reduction of as v to as iii in soil and sediments hamamura et al 2014 kudo et al 2013 suhadolnik et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 of note slightly higher demethylation of dmas v was observed in the no substrate batch than in the substrate added batch in anaerobic soil systems methanogenic archaea are reported as the cause of as demethylation under sulfate reducing and methane generating processes chen et al 2019 sierra alvarez et al 2006 a few isolates related to demethylation of organic as were reported yoshinaga et al 2011 suggested the two step pathway of mmas v reduction to mmas iii by a burkholderia species and further mineralization of mmas iii to as iii by a streptomyces species more recently demethylation of mmas v to as iii by cyanobacterium nostoc sp pcc 7120 has been reported in that study c as lyase was suggested as enzyme of demethylation of mmas v yan et al 2015 however except the study no studied have identified genes related to demethylation of organic as therefore culture based study is need to identify microorganisms related to demethylation of organic as 4 conclusion dmas v has attracted concern due to its well known toxicity caused by the high uptake and translocation in plants and soil our study provides a comprehensive observation of dmas v reactions and its transformation in a laboratory simulated wetland system set up using real wetland constituents in the wetland condition of this study the aqueous dmas v was immobilized in the sediment as a form of as v leading to the conclusion that without dmas v demethylation dmas v could not be expected to be efficiently removed however the as species produced from dmas v demethylation include the more toxic inorganic forms as v or as iii if the amount of sediment is sufficiently large compared to total arsenic loading as immobilization in the sediment may be expected as indicated by our microcosm experiments however the re mobilization of arsenic may be likely under different biogeochemical conditions the results of this study need further confirmation in its reaction mechanism because this study did not analyze some possible as species that could be generated under similar conditions and did not consider the volatilized as species in mass balance calculations recently several studies have suggested the microbiological mechanism of the geochemical cycle of as at the molecular level however most studies have limitations in including all possible as species due to the difficulties in analyzing complex as species and more comprehensive analyzes of complex reaction pathways moreover the prediction of fate and transport of as remains a challenge due to the variations in the conditions and microbial communities in different environments

15631,the biogeochemical reactions of dimethylarsinic acid dmas v were investigated using simulated wetland systems in a laboratory dmas v was injected into the wetland water and the as concentrations in the water plants and sediments were monitored aqueous and solid phase as speciation was evaluated and the results revealed that the dmas v was completely transported to the sediments and plants x ray absorption spectroscopic measurement of the as in the sediment revealed that approximately 85 95 of as existed as inorganic as species demonstrating the important role of microorganisms in the biogeochemical reaction of dmas v the influences of microbes were further investigated in smaller batches under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the microbial batch results showed that dmas v demethylation reduced the total aqueous as concentration demonstrating that as v has higher affinity to wetland sediment than dmas v the redox conditions were also revealed as an important controlling factor of the as reaction and under anaerobic conditions we observed the presence of the most toxic form of inorganic as iii in the aqueous phase although this study reports one example from a specific wetland the important roles of the redox conditions and microbial influences were identified from the comprehensive analysis of as speciation and mass balance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wetland microcosm dimethylarsinic acid dmas v as demethylation as v reduction biogeochemical reaction x ray absorption spectroscopy xas data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as contamination is caused by geological and anthropogenic sources and the background concentration of as in soil varies globally depending on the geographical area mandal and suzuki 2002 geological sources mainly contribute to the contamination of inorganic as owing to the high toxicity of inorganic as previous studies have focused on the reactions of inorganic as species such as as v or as iii mondal et al 2013 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wang and mulligan 2008 greater research focus has been applied to inorganic as because geochemical reactions of organoarsenicals are complex and their related analytical techniques are not easy moreover inorganic as was regarded to be more important due to its prevalence and higher toxicity compared to organoarsenicals however recent studies have revealed that methylated arsenicals such as monomethylarsenite mmas iii or dimethylarsenite dmas iii are much more toxic than as iii and can naturally occur during natural as cycling yan et al 2015 yoshinaga et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 the most commonly studied organic as species are monomethylarsenate mmas v and dimethylarsenate dmas v mmas v and dmas v have been used as major components of herbicides and pesticides during the past half century and the contamination of farmland and golf course soil by dmas v has been previously reported arao et al 2009 pichler et al 2008 sierra alvarez et al 2006 besides methylated arsenicals occur by biotransformation of inorganic as species early research on organoarsenicals focused on mmas v and dmas v which are closely related to the high mmas v and dmas v contents observed in rice grains several studies have reported that dmas v constitutes 50 of the total as in rice heikens 2006 meharg et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 in addition to grains the proportion of dmas v accumulated in polychaetes bristle worms found in wetland sediments was also measured to be 1 25 of the total as watts et al 2013 therefore increasing attention is being paid to the measurement and control of dmas v in wetland and soil environments kumar and riyazuddin 2010 the behavior and transformation mechanisms of dmas v in soil and plants have been previously studied zeng et al 2018 showed that the as methylation rates by microbial communities depend on the depth of the as contaminated soil and correlations between the dmas v concentration and different environmental parameters lafferty and loeppert 2005 reported that dmas v is adsorbed in ferrihydrite and goethite depending on the ph while it is desorbed in the presence of phosphate some studies have been conducted on the uptake and transport of mmas v and dmas v from the root to the shoot li et al 2009 raab et al 2007 smith et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 the biogeochemical reactions of dmas v in soil or wetlands are particularly complicated due to the occurrence of various chemical and biological reactions that can control the fate and transport of as species within wetland components such as water sediments plants and microbes the reactions in soil or wetlands include adsorption desorption precipitation dissolution oxidation reduction and methylation demethylation di et al 2019 microorganisms are known to be a key player in these transformations research has shown that some microbial species are capable of methylating as from inorganic as species in the soil lomax et al 2012 furthermore as methylation occurs due to arsenite s adenosylmethionine sam methyltransferase enzymes qin et al 2006 arsenic transformation processes such as oxidation reduction and methylation are gene specified they can also provide information on primers that can specifically amplify these processes huang et al 2016 mirza et al 2017 quÃ©mÃ©neur et al 2010 however research on the microbes or enzymes that are involved in the demethylation of dmas v is relatively lacking previously some types of microbes such as montrachet wine yeast and candida humicola have been reported to be capable of as demethylation crecelius 1977 cullen et al 1979 lehr et al 2003 more recently yan et al 2015 proposed the arsenic demethylation mechanism of cyanobacteria and chen et al 2019 revealed the involvement of methanogenic archaea in the demethylation of dmas v it is thought that the biotransformation of as species is an important part of as biogeochemical cycles while taking a role in microbial warfare or detoxification processes chen and rosen 2020 in this study the transformation and speciation of organic and inorganic as were investigated in a dmas v contaminated wetland system considering all the constituents of the system such as the wetland water plants and sediments using a relatively large scale laboratory microcosm microcosm tests were performed to simulate field conditions with a high solid to solution ratio and considerable adsorptive capacity for aqueous as species to observe the aqueous phase change of as speciation additional small scale batch experiments with low solid to solution ratio were conducted the effects of microbial activity on as transformation were investigated using manipulated redox conditions and substrate additions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site the wetland surface waters and sediments used in the experiments were obtained from an artificially constructed ecological wetland located in okcheon chungcheongbuk do korea this wetland is a water purification facility constructed to prevent the inflow of non point source pollutants from the surrounding area into daecheong lake a drinking water source for nearby cities sampling for the experiment was performed in a shallow wetland which was a part of the natural water purification process installed in this facility the chemical properties of the water flowing into the shallow wetland where sampling was performed are shown in supplementary material table s1 the baseline as concentration measured from the wetland sediment is 3 11 1 24 mg as kg the surface water sediment and aquatic plants growing in the field were collected and immediately transferred to the laboratory for setting the microcosms 2 2 installation of microcosms all sediment samples which were collected from the constructed wetland were uniformly mixed and used to construct the microcosms the schematic diagram of the wetland microcosm is presented in fig s1 in supplementary information si the wetland water was used without filtration or pre processing four microcosms were constructed to conduct with plant and without plant experiments in duplicates each microcosm was 40 cm in diameter and height and was constructed using acrylic materials the microcosm was filled with sediment up to a height of approximately 15 cm from the bottom the walls of the microcosm were covered with a black sheet up to the height of the sediment layer to block light thereby simulating the actual sediment environment wetland water was poured on top of the sediment to a depth of approximately 15 cm the total volume of wetland sediment and water in each microcosm was approximately 20 l two or three yellow flag irises collected from the constructed wetland were planted in the sediment of the with plant microcosms no plant was transferred to the without plant microcosms the prepared microcosms were installed inside a growth chamber in the laboratory a fluorescent lamp was used to control light to simulate 16 h of day and 8 h of night and the temperature of the chamber was set to 25 c subsequently the microcosms were conditioned for approximately two months additional wetland water was regularly added to the microcosms to tackle the decrease in water level due to evapotranspiration after the conditioning period dmas v was spiked to 7 5 mg l in the wetland water assuming this concentration of dmas v could cause any kind of disease but is not lethally toxic to microbes and plants a previous study has reported that 5000 mg l of dmas v did not affect the inhibitory effect on methanogenic activity sierra alvarez et al 2004 the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp of the wetland water were monitored in the dmas v contaminated microcosms sensors were installed at 7 5 cm below the sediment surface to measure the ph and orp of porewater porewater was collected using samplers made of 0 15 Î¼m pore size ceramic tubes rhizon css 5 cm rhizosphere research products wageningen netherlands to monitor porewater properties the rhizon sampler was installed inside the sediment layer 7 5 cm below the sediment surface the monitored ph and orp results are provided in fig s2 the wetland water and sediments in the microcosms were kept stable without agitation except during the periodic addition of water and efforts were made to minimize agitation during the addition of water the microcosms were monitored for approximately two months under these conditions 2 3 analysis of as speciation in wetland water surface and porewater were collected once a week during microcosm monitoring the aqueous phase as speciation was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms in the hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent technologies santa clara ca usa part of the apparatus the separation of as species was conducted under anion exchange conditions with a hamilton prp x 100 column 250 mm 4 1 mm i d 10 Âµm and a mobile phase of 5 mm malonic acid ph 5 6 adjusted with 1 aqueous ammonia injected at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the mobile phases were transferred to the icp ms 7800 agilent technologies santa clara ca usa to quantify the amount of as in each species the arsenic species were detected at m z 75 and possible chloride interference was eliminated by the collision of 40ar35cl molecules with helium gas by kinetic energy discrimination the details of hplc and icp ms instrumental conditions are provided in si table s2 with example calibrations curves and a chromatogram fig s3 standard solutions of four different arsenic species sodium arsenite naaso2 sigma aldrich sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o sigma aldrich monomethylarsonic acid ch3asna2o3 6h2o chemservice and dimethylarsinic acid ch3 2aso oh sigma aldrich were purchased as solids and prepared as 1000 mg l stock solutions to obtain calibration curves aqueous mixtures of each of the four as species were prepared at concentrations of 1 5 10 20 50 and 100 Î¼g l using 5 mm malonic acid as a matrix solution the detection of mmas iii and dmas iii were tested using the same hplc icp ms method the tested samples of mmas iii and dmas iii were prepared by the reduction of 0 013 m of mmas v and dmas v standard solutions mixed with the same volumes of 0 067 m l cysteine hydrochloride solution for 1 5 h at 70 suzuki et al 2004 this method successfully identified the presence of mmas iii but not for dmas iii as per the result shown in fig s4 in the si the dmas iii peak seemed to be overlapped with dmas v using this method as species can be distinguished into the following five chemical species uncharged as species representing arsenite as iii mmas iii dmas v mmas v and arsenate as v the quantitative measurements were conducted by four peak positions except mmas iii 2 4 analysis of as concentration and speciation in wetland plants and sediment after completion of the monitoring of as concentration the overlying water was removed and cores of the unstirred sediment were collected using a plastic core tube the cores were frozen at an extremely low temperature 76 c and cut into 5 sections of 3 cm each depending on the depth from the sediment surface part of the sediment sample was dried and subjected to aqua regia hcl hno3 1 3 digestion to determine the total as concentration for aqua regia digestion 1 00 g of well mixed ground soil was digested in 12 ml of aqua regia on a hotplate for 3 h at 110 c after evaporation to near dryness the sample was rinsed and made up to 30 ml with 2 hno3 after filtering through whatman no 42 filter this digestion method was also applied to the dried plant and algal matter collected after microcosm experiments two or three yellow flag irises were transferred only in the with plant microcosms but some water mosses in the with plant microcosms and a large amount of algae and water moss in the without plant microcosms grew naturally during the experimental period therefore the biomass of algae and water moss was collected and dried in a 110 dry oven for the measurement of as concentration the concentration of extracted as was then measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes horiba jobin yvon kyoto japan the digestion tests were duplicated for all samples and the instrumental and metrological parameters of icp oes are provided in si table s3 the other part of the sediment sample remained frozen until further use in the measurement of solid phase as speciation using x ray absorption spectroscopy xas the xas measurement was conducted at beamline 8c in the pohang accelerator laboratory south korea this method is highly advantageous as it allows for direct analysis of solid state as speciation without leaching of sediments the sediment was ground in an anaerobic glovebox without drying before being packed to a thickness of 2 mm in an aluminum holder all xas measurement procedures were conducted in a he flow chamber where contact with oxygen was prevented a double crystal si 1 1 1 monochromator was used to obtain the x ray energies the maximum energy was detuned by 30 to reduce the glitches from the higher order harmonic frequencies the as k edge xas was measured in both the transmittance and fluorescence modes using au foil at the l 3 edge of 11 918 7 ev the fractions of as species present in the sediment samples were estimated through linear combination fitting lcf analysis using model compounds representing the as v as iii dmas v mmas v and as2s3 spectra associated with the solid surface the model compounds representing as v as iii dmas v and mmas v were prepared with various amounts of na2haso4 7h2o naaso2 c2h6aso2 na 3h2o and ch4asnao3 1 5h2o powder respectively the model compound for as2s3 was an orpiment powder purchased from sigma aldrich the ifeffit software ravel and newville 2005 was implemented for all the necessary analyzes of the xas peaks the edge energy positions of dmas v and mmas v are too close the difference of edge position less than 1 ev to make a good fit of linear combination fitting of xanes parts of the spectra so that as v as iii dmas v mmas v and as2s3 the comparison of edge positions of the five as species can be found in si fig s5 2 5 calculation of the mass balance of as in microcosms to calculate the total mass balance of as in the microcosms we assumed that the entire amount of as was contained in the wetland water soil plants and algae the quantity and as concentration of wetland water as well as the total dry masses of plants and algae are parameters indicating the quantity and as concentrations of the microcosm components although it was possible to measure the as concentration in the sediment the total quantity of as in the sediment was difficult to measure owing to the large amount of sediment and varying concentrations of as based on the sediment depth the amount of volatilized as could not be measured because the microcosms were kept open to the atmosphere while being operated hence the quantity of as in the sediment and as volatilized was calculated by subtracting the quantity of as in the measurable components from the total quantity of injected as in order to calculate the mass balance of as the formula for calculating the mass balance of as is as follows a s sediment a s volatilized a s injected v w c w m plant c plant m algae c algae where a s sediment total quantity of as in sediment mg a s volatilized total quantity of injected as disappeared by volatilization a s injected total quantity of as v w quantity of wetland water l c w as concentration of wetland water mg l m p l a n t dry biomass of plants kg c p l a n t as concentration of plant biomass mg kg m a l g a e dry biomass of algae kg c a l g a e as concentration of algae mg kg to measure the as concentrations in the sediment plants and algae as was extracted using the aqua regia digestion method and the obtained as concentrations of the solutions were measured using icp oes analysis 2 6 microbial community analysis to analyze the microbial community the extracted dna from the collected topsoil of each with plant and without plant microcosm was amplified based on the 16s rrna genes the primer sets 515fb and 806rb covering both archaea and bacteria v4 region were used walters et al 2016 sequencing was performed using the illumina miseq platform at macrogen inc republic of korea the sequencing protocol was based on the miseq system user guide 15027617 v01 low quality reads were filtered using sickle ver 1 33 the sequenced reads were analyzed using qiime2 bolyen et al 2019 sequences of representative operational taxonomic units otus were grouped a blastn search of representative otus was performed against the gtdbtk and national center for biotechnology information ncbi rrna databases to identify the taxonomies of representative otus the selected sequences were aligned with bioedit and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using mega7 based on the neighbor joining method kumar et al 2016 the data were deposited in ncbi as srr16229788 and srr16229789 2 7 small scale batch for microbial experiment homogenous wetland sediment 0 8 g and wetland water 40 ml were placed in a 160 ml serum vial and mixed the wetland water was filtered through a 0 22 Âµm pore size filter to remove microorganisms all serum vials and other experimental apparatus coming into contact with the samples were autoclaved to prevent microbial contamination the 0 1 mg l resazurin indicator solution was added to each batch to identify the redox condition of the batch by color to facilitate microbiological activity 0 01 yeast extract as a microbial substrate was injected into the substrate amended batch but not into the other batch one set of the above described batches was prepared under ambient air aerobic batches and the other set was prepared under n2 purged gas anaerobic batches an abiotic control sample was prepared by adding substrate under aerobic conditions and autoclaved to inhibit microbial activity autoclaving was performed three times at 121 c for 20 min the prepared batches were capped with a butyl rubber septum to block gas exchange during the experiment they were cultured under dark conditions at 25 c for approximately one week of conditioning to create the desired mode after the conditioning period the batches were spiked with a concentrated dmas v stock solution so that the as concentration of the solutions in the batch reached 7 5 mg l to monitor the aqueous as concentration in test batches solutions were sampled at certain intervals during 42 days of incubation period through the septum using a syringe needle particularly during the sampling of the anaerobic batches extra caution was taken by removing air from the syringe needle through purging it with nitrogen gas to avoid oxygen contamination the collected solution samples were filtered using a 0 45 Âµm pore size filter and stored in a freezer until further analysis the concentrations of aqueous phase as speciations were determined using hplc icp ms 3 results and discussion 3 1 as concentration in surface water and porewater of microcosms fig 1 shows the as speciation and concentration in the aqueous phase for the initially injected dmas v 7 5 mg l during the observation period more than 50 days even though four different as species as iii as v dmas v and mmas v were separated and measured using hplc icp ms only dmas v was detected in the surface water and pore water and the as concentration was just displayed as dmas v concentration in fig 1 none of the chromatograms of analyzed samples showed any peaks in the position of mmas iii retention time demonstrating that there is no evidence of the generation of demethylated intermediate byproduct mmas v or its reduced species mmas iii the possible transformation of dmas v to dmas iii was presumed to be minimal because no active microbial activity was expected in undisturbed wetland water as shown in fig 1a the dmas v concentration in surface water decreased over time and had dropped below the detection limit in the water collected after 50 days the decreasing rates of dmas v in the surface water were largely similar but not identical to those in the with plant and without plant microcosms the abiotic degradation and the diffusion due to concentration gradient are partly responsible for the decrease in dmas v concentration of dmas v because the surface water remained still no intentional agitation during the test period the dmas v concentration decrease rate during the 20 30 day time period was relatively higher in the with plant microcosm than that in the without plant microcosm possibly due to the faster surface water infiltration into the sediment layer with the development of plant roots this interpretation is supported by the higher dmas v concentration in the sediment porewater in the with plant microcosm compared to that of the without plant microcosm as shown in fig 1b the dmas v concentration in the porewater of the with plant microcosm peaked between 10 and 20 days and subsequently decreased possibly due to the rapid adsorption of as by the sediment and plant in addition some amount of dmas v may have been absorbed by plants and transported to plant tissues the immobilization of dmas v by the sediment and plants has been reported by previous studies huang et al 2020 liu et al 2018 shyleshchandran et al 2018 3 2 as concentration and speciation depending on sediment depth the measured total as concentration and estimated as speciation obtained from the lcf results of the xanes spectrum for the sediment samples by the sediment depth are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively large fluctuations of as concentration in the duplicated microcosm revealed in fig 2 can be attributed to the general characteristics of low representability of the soil and sediment samples particularly in this relatively large experimental setup the sediment samples used in aqua regia digestion were a small amount 3 g compared to the total sediment weight 20 l in volume which is possibly heavier than 3000 g in mass therefore it is reasonable to focus on the overall trend of as uptake throughout the sediment layer rather than on individual values from the measured results the total as concentration in the sediment showed a decreasing trend with increasing sediment depth and it dropped below the detectable level when the depth of the sediment exceeded 6 cm the lcf results indicated conversion of most of the dmas v to inorganic arsenic forms i e as iii or as v in the sediment moreover there was a clear trend of further transformation of as v to as iii with increasing sediment depth indicating that the reducing conditions of deeper sediment layers resulted in the reduction of as v these results may suggest that the transformation of as speciation actively occurred due to the various soil microorganisms present in the sediment here it needs to be noted that the xas analysis only shows an overall trend of as behavior not a precise quantitative change of each as species as only a small fraction of the total soil mass was used for one xas measurement also other methylated arsenic such as mmas iii dmas iii mmas v were not included in the reference spectrum of lcf analysis this is because the detection of mmas iii and dmas iii is difficult due to their rapid oxidation and high volatilization stÃ½blo et al 2021 furthermore the similar edge energies of mmas v and dmas v approximately 0 7 ev may lead to falsely fitting results while the volatilized as fraction cannot be overlooked fig 3 confirms that the predominant as species in the soil are inorganic as v and as iii demonstrating that the active demethylation is being carried out by soil microorganisms 3 3 mass balance of as in microcosm the mass balance of as in the microcosms needs to be calculated to understand the geochemical behavior of dmas v in the whole wetland system the total amount of as in biomass was determined from floating water mosses iris stems and iris roots in the with plant microcosms and algae in the without plant microcosms based on the total dry mass of each biomass type and their as concentrations table 1 in the with plant microcosms a higher amount of as was present in the water mosses salvinia minima and iris roots than in the iris stems salvinia minima is known to be a water moss with a high adsorption capacity for heavy metals such as as ni cr and cd olguÃ­n et al 2002 sooknah 2000 furthermore several studies have reported that a larger proportion of as uptake occurs in the roots than in the stems or grains of rice plants raab et al 2007 smith et al 2008 in the without plant microcosm a considerable mass of algae was present the amount of as from the harvested algae measured 26 56 mg as kg dry mass of algae which equated to 0 3 0 4 of total as added in both plant and algae the total amount of as transferred to biomass is less than 1 based on the mass balance calculation and on the assumption that all other as are associated with the wetland sediment the proportion of as transported to the sediment including possible loss by as volatilization can be expected to be approximately 99 of the total as in the microcosm system the volatilization of as is an important part of the natural as cycle but the contribution of volatilization in as mass balance cannot be accounted for in this study due to the open air design of the experiment based on previous findings highly volatile as species are methyl arsines that typically occur in anaerobic environments and the typical volatilization accounts for only less than 1 3 5 of the soil as budget mestrot et al 2011 zhang and reid 2022 therefore the experiment setup of this large scale microcosm is not sufficient to account for the as volatilization in this study although the amount of arsenic transferred from the soil to the plants was small these results clearly show that as present in the soil caused the as contamination of plants the absorption of as from soil to plants especially the accumulation of dmas v in rice grains under anoxic paddy soil conditions is considered to be a serious problem in many regions ma et al 2014 williams et al 2005 zavala et al 2008 3 4 microbial communities of microcosm sediments information regarding the microbial communities was obtained using miseq sequencing the assigned sequences showed similar microbial communities in both the with plant and without plant microcosms table 2 the majority of the microbial groups were identified to be bacteria approximately 99 8 while archaea accounted for a proportion of less than 0 2 the dominant phyla in the batches were proteobacteria class deltaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes major otus were classified in the genera geobacter dechloromonas and anaeromyxobacter in particular geobacter like reads were high 15 7 and 12 3 in the with plant and without plant microcosms respectively fig s6 in otu3 the proportions of dechloromonas denitrificans atcc baa 841 betaproteobacteria 98 87 similarity were 3 6 and 4 0 in the with and without plant microcosms respectively otu8 identified as anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans 2cp 1 deltaproteobacteria 94 12 similarity accounted for proportions of 2 3 and 4 7 in the with and without plant microcosms respectively these bacteria are well known iron reducing bacteria hori et al 2010 weber et al 2006 zhou et al 2016 furthermore they play a major role in microbial mediated as release from the environment giloteaux et al 2013 kudo et al 2013 suhadolnik et al 2017 in this study as was not released into the surface water of the microcosm even though iron reducing bacteria geobacter and anaeromyxobacter related to as elution were dominant the probable cause for this result was a relatively high solid to solution ratio applied in the microbial test conditions indicating the presence of enough adsorptive sites even for the relatively mobile as iii additionally the redox conditions within the tested microcosm were not considered to be extreme in the presence of abundant organic matter or stronger anaerobic conditions in a microcosm the possibility of as release along with the reductive dissolution of iron cannot be overlooked stuckey et al 2016 demonstrated that arsenic release can be limited or reactive depending on the amount of organic carbon or redox conditions applied to the mekong delta sediment that was naturally polluted with as in general the increased concentration of inorganic as iii in the porewater released from the soil solids can be attributed to the enhanced activity of fe and as reducers wang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 according to kudo et al 2013 anaeromyxobacter sp strain psr 1 reduced as v to as iii and increased the amount of as iii in the solid phase of soil the microbial community results indicate that iron reducing bacteria play a major role in the as cycle in the soil phase 3 5 results of the small scale batch experiment to investigate the influence of microbial activities on the behavior of as a small scale microbial batch experiment was performed and the transformation of dmas v with time was observed by measuring the amounts of different as species i e dmas v mmas v inorganic as v and inorganic as iii in the aqueous phase the presence of mmas iii in all samples was confirmed by checking a peak appearing at the retention time of mmas iii in the hplc icp ms chromatogram if no peak was identified it indicated that the generation reaction of mmas iii did not occur under aerobic conditions the reduction of dmas v concentration was observed in both biotic systems with and without yeast extract addition fig 4 a b however the aqueous phase dmas v decrease did not occur in the abiotic system that was autoclaved to inhibit microbial activity fig 4c in this small scale microbial batch we applied a low solid to solution ratio to minimize the abiotic adsorption process of as on the sediment surface and to maximize the impact of microbial reactions as it was intended a mostly constant dmas v concentration over time was seen in fig 4c in the biotic batch under aerobic conditions fig 4a b two weeks after dmas v addition the dmas v concentration started to decrease and gradually reduced over a period of 42 days post which dmas v was no longer detectable the amount of inorganic as v started to increase in the aqueous phase with the decrease in dmas v demonstrating that the dmas v was transformed into an inorganic form via microbial demethylation reaction here the amount of measured as v was smaller than the amount of dmas v that disappeared implying that a portion of the as v was adsorbed in the sediment after demethylation from dmas v inorganic as v generally has higher adsorption affinity to soil or sediment than dmas v does huang and matzner 2007 lafferty and loeppert 2005 turpeinen et al 1999 which can also be confirmed by the concentration of dmas v over time under the abiotic batch conditions shown in fig 4c the results of the abiotic batch experiment show that little dmas v adsorption occurred implying that the adsorption capacity of dmas v was very low in the batch and the abiotic degradation is not noticeable contrary to the expectation of a more active demethylation in the substrate added batch under aerobic conditions the addition of substrate did not accelerate microbial mediated as demethylation rather a slightly higher amount of inorganic as v was measured in the batch without substrate addition from this result it could be assumed that dmas v demethylation occurred due to the microorganisms consuming indigenous organic matter in the sediment as a substrate or that the added yeast extract may have acted as a chelating agent for dmas v adsorption a similar chelating effect of yeast extract was reported by woolson et al 1982 suggesting that dmas v is adsorbed by organic matter leading to reduced bioavailability in this study the main demethylated as species of dmas v was inorganic as v whereas an absence of measurable concentration of inorganic as v in the surface water across the experimental period was indicated by the result of the large scale microcosm data in section 3 1 this difference was possibly due to the higher loading of sediment in the microcosm against the relatively lower total amount of dmas v instead the solid phase as speciation that occurred in the microcosm sediment verified that the majority of as species in the sediment were inorganic as v and as iii due to dmas v demethylation after dmas v demethylation to inorganic as v sequential as v reduction to as iii occurred in the sediment layer with anaerobic conditions formed over time in the small scale batches under anaerobic conditions dmas v demethylation also occurred however the transformation rate in the anaerobic systems was less effective than that in the aerobic systems as shown in fig 4d e the further transformation of as v to as iii although in a small amount was observed in both anaerobic batches in general the oxidation of as iii occurs due to abiotic or biotic reactions but the reduction of as v is known to occur mainly due to biotic reactions many studies have been conducted on the microbial reduction of as v to as iii in soil and sediments hamamura et al 2014 kudo et al 2013 suhadolnik et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 of note slightly higher demethylation of dmas v was observed in the no substrate batch than in the substrate added batch in anaerobic soil systems methanogenic archaea are reported as the cause of as demethylation under sulfate reducing and methane generating processes chen et al 2019 sierra alvarez et al 2006 a few isolates related to demethylation of organic as were reported yoshinaga et al 2011 suggested the two step pathway of mmas v reduction to mmas iii by a burkholderia species and further mineralization of mmas iii to as iii by a streptomyces species more recently demethylation of mmas v to as iii by cyanobacterium nostoc sp pcc 7120 has been reported in that study c as lyase was suggested as enzyme of demethylation of mmas v yan et al 2015 however except the study no studied have identified genes related to demethylation of organic as therefore culture based study is need to identify microorganisms related to demethylation of organic as 4 conclusion dmas v has attracted concern due to its well known toxicity caused by the high uptake and translocation in plants and soil our study provides a comprehensive observation of dmas v reactions and its transformation in a laboratory simulated wetland system set up using real wetland constituents in the wetland condition of this study the aqueous dmas v was immobilized in the sediment as a form of as v leading to the conclusion that without dmas v demethylation dmas v could not be expected to be efficiently removed however the as species produced from dmas v demethylation include the more toxic inorganic forms as v or as iii if the amount of sediment is sufficiently large compared to total arsenic loading as immobilization in the sediment may be expected as indicated by our microcosm experiments however the re mobilization of arsenic may be likely under different biogeochemical conditions the results of this study need further confirmation in its reaction mechanism because this study did not analyze some possible as species that could be generated under similar conditions and did not consider the volatilized as species in mass balance calculations recently several studies have suggested the microbiological mechanism of the geochemical cycle of as at the molecular level however most studies have limitations in including all possible as species due to the difficulties in analyzing complex as species and more comprehensive analyzes of complex reaction pathways moreover the prediction of fate and transport of as remains a challenge due to the variations in the conditions and microbial communities in different environments

al 2019 marti et al 2014 michael et al 2013 nappier et al 2020 nnadozie and odume 2019 the risk of resistant infections in humans is often related to the abundance and diversity of environmental args indicating links between the environment and the clinic bueno et al 2017 cho et al 2020d finley et al 2013 nappier et al 2020 though exact dissemination pathways largely remain unclear fecal pollution from both animal and human waste are important sources of arb and args to surface waters determining sources of args is particularly critical in mixed use watersheds which contain both urban and agricultural land and could thus receive args from human and or animal sources considerable amounts of antibiotics args and arb enter the environment from manure topdressing runoff or agricultural wastewater effluent he et al 2020 nappier et al 2020 thanner et al 2016 with wastewater from chicken and cattle farms often having arg abundances comparable to hospital and municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent and sometimes orders of magnitude greater he et al 2020 human fecal contamination to surface waters includes both raw and treated waste raw sewage containing antibiotics args and arb often including pathogens can enter surface waters through aging or inadequate wastewater infrastructure eramo et al 2017 gallert et al 2005 ikhimiukor et al 2022 mclellan and roguet 2019 nappier et al 2020 typically considered non point source contamination due to its distributed nature furthermore treated sewage typically contains detectable arb args and human fecal indicators amos et al 2018 wÃ©ry et al 2010 wu et al 2020 leading to release of arb and args into the environment via effluent discharge a common point source of these contaminants worldwide berglund et al 2015 buelow et al 2020 cacace et al 2019 karkman et al 2018 osiÅska et al 2020 in some cases sewage effluent even becomes enriched in args through the treatment process amos et al 2018 bengtsson palme et al 2019 di cesare et al 2016 osiÅska et al 2019 while numerous studies have reported on either agricultural waste or sewage effluent as an arg source to surface waters few studies have assessed their relative impact or quantified the relative importance of point source and non point source fecal contamination to arg dissemination we collected a multi year seasonal time series of fecal marker and arg abundance at high spatial resolution throughout the upper oconee watershed northeast georgia usa figs s1 s2 fisher et al 2000 combined with data on geospatial land use land change and wastewater infrastructure in the watershed the oconee river is the primary source of drinking water for athens clarke county and is widely used for recreation its mixed use watershed is analogous to other similarly sized watersheds around the world containing forested agricultural industrial and residential areas subject to increasing urbanization many tributaries in the watershed begin as relatively undeveloped headwater streams then flow through areas impacted by agricultural runoff from farmland and poultry processing before entering suburban regions and a central urban area athens where they receive effluent from multiple wwtps figs s1 s2 previous studies have documented pathogenic and potential epidemic strains of arb in the upper oconee watershed cho et al 2020a 2020b 2022 2018 2020c 2019 meinersmann et al 2008 2013 suggesting its surface waters are a significant reservoir and source of amr however the origins of anthropogenic args in these waters remain unknown to examine relationships between fecal contamination and args in surface waters across this watershed quantitative pcr qpcr for fecal source tracking genes and args was conducted on samples from 5 years of quarterly water quality monitoring 2013 2018 n 992 as well as on samples of influent and treated effluent from 3 wwtps n 17 fig s2 to pinpoint specific sources of fecal and arg contamination we used correlation analyses and ordinations to evaluate spatial relationships between fecal indicators args and geospatial estimates of wastewater infrastructure and land use land cover across the watershed this unique synthesis of data on arg abundance fecal source tracking land use land cover and wastewater infrastructure allows for unprecedented determination of surface water fecal and arg contamination sources throughout a mixed use watershed highlighting non point source contamination from sewers and septic systems as important sources of fecal and arg contamination to the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the 115 sites sampled throughout the upper oconee watershed fig s3 were established by the upper oconee watershed network uown a local water quality monitoring organization quarterly samples were collected in collaboration with trained uown citizen scientists from spring 2013 april 20th to summer 2018 july 8th resulting in collections across 22 total seasons the number of sites collected each season range 16 90 mean 45 standard deviation 22 was dependent on the number of volunteers filters for planktonic dna were collected as previously described hassell et al 2018 briefly water samples were stored on ice prior to filtration within 5 hours of collection water was filtered by peristaltic pumping through a 5 0 Î¼m durapore svpp pre

per sample to maximize total volume filtered due to high particulate matter loads all filters were stored dry at 80 c prior to dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and gene abundances dna extraction from the 0 22 Î¼m filters was completed as previously outlined hassell et al 2018 briefly on filter lysis proceeded using lysozyme then a proteinase k sds digestion resulting lysate was extracted using phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 ph 8 0 precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in 400 Î¼l of elution buffer omega biotek norcross ga usa and purified with the e z n a water dna kit omega biotek may 2013 version starting with the chtr buffer treatment step all samples were eluted in 50 Î¼l of elution buffer dna concentrations and quality were measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer hs assay thermo fisher waltham ma usa and a nanodrop lite spectrophotomer thermo fisher respectively given the large number of samples it was not feasible to quantify a broad diversity of args via shotgun metagenomics or high throughput qpcr arrays an initial set of 15 dna samples 13 from streams 1 wwtp influent and 1 wwtp effluent were used with antibiotic resistance genes microbial

obtained in standard curves an outlier was removed the sample was rerun if the spread remained 0 55 ct gene abundances were reported as gene copies ml 1 site water total arg abundance represents the sum of the abundance of all 6 individual args for some samples dna was depleted prior to running all qpcr assays assays not run for this reason were marked as na whereas those run but below the detection limit were recorded as 0 2 3 geospatial analyses geospatial data were calculated using arcmap 10 x esri redlands ca watersheds for each sampling location were delineated using the hydrology toolbox the national elevation dataset s 10m digital elevation model was used to calculate geomorphic characteristics of each sample point s watershed e g slope total stream length ruggedness mcdonald et al 2018 land use land cover for the watershed draining to each sample point were extracted from the 2016 national land cover dataset homer et al 2020 high quality geospatial data on septic and wastewater infrastructure in athens clarke county was accessed through a partnership with the athens clarke county public utilities department and were extracted from the athens clarke county public works datasets as previously described capps et al 2020 site linked sewer and septic data are withheld due to potential privacy concerns road lengths densities and relations to sample sites were calculated using the us census tiger lines streets dataset 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted in r r core team 2019 with most plots made using ggplot2 wickham 2016 histograms and violin plots were used to assess the co occurrence of args and source tracking genes samples were split into groups based on the detectability of each source tracking gene between these groups histograms compared the number of detectable args and violin plots compared the aggregate abundance of args differences in the sum of args between samples with and without detectable source tracking genes were determined using the mann whitney u test due to non normal distributions of some data correlations spearman s Ï between source tracking gene abundance and the sum of arg abundances were calculated using the hmisc r package harrell 2019 for all correlation analyses benjamini hochberg corrected p values are reported to correct for multiple comparisons site averaged data were compared using scatterplots regressions and correlation analyses the qpcr data genes per ml 1 water were log10 x 1 transformed then averaged by site model ii regressions of site averaged data were calculated using the lmodel2 r package legendre 2018 as previously described damashek et al 2019 pairwise correlations spearman s Ï between site averaged qpcr land use land cover road sewer and septic variables were calculated using hmisc correlations with corrected p 0 05 were considered significant hierarchical clustering was conducted using the hclust r command with complete linkage heatmaps were drawn using ggcorrplot kassambara 2019 with insignificant correlations crossed out an initial analysis including all environmental variables identified clusters of geomorphic variables highly correlated with one another which largely differentiated small versus large basins fig s4 guided by these groupings geomorphic variables other than ruggedness melton ruggedness ratio and mean total stream length were removed and correlations analyses were rerun similarly given their high level of correlation land use land change variables estimating developed land open low medium or high were combined into one aggregate developed estimate variables estimating forest cover deciduous evergreen or mixed were combined into one forest estimate and grassland and pasture variables were combined into one grassland estimate to determine whether watershed scale correlations primarily reflected extreme values at specific sites we reran correlation analyses with samples from brooklyn creek excluded brooklyn creek has been considered a critically impaired creek with consistently high e coli counts for over a decade leading to its listing as a 303 d threatened waterway by the us epa this stream could also be impacted by compromised sewage infrastructure from the two main hospitals in the region furthermore brooklyn creek samples consistently had the highest abundance of args and human fecal markers in our data a principal component analysis pca was calculated with the pca function from factominer lÃª et al 2008 using log10 x 1 transformed gene abundances as input pca results were visualized using the fviz pca biplot function from factoextra kassambara and mundt 2017 with scaling 1 3 results most sites across the watershed were sampled repeatedly fig s3 and approximately half of the 992 resulting samples had detectable human 48 or ruminant 55 fecal genes while only 19 had detectable poultry genes table s3 of the args tested ermb was detected most frequently 73 8 of samples bla ctx m 1 was rarest 2 6 and the other four genes were found in 24 9 49 9 of samples table s3 when the data were split by the presence of each source tracking gene args were always enriched in samples where the source tracking gene was detected mann whitney u test p 0 001 fig 1 a furthermore human and ruminant fecal contamination were associated with a higher likelihood of detecting one or more args and all samples where all 6 targeted args were detected n 33 also had detectable human fecal contamination fig 1b args and human fecal genes were highly correlated in both surface water spearman s Ï 0 632 p 0 001 and wwtp influent effluent spearman s Ï 0 931 p 0 001 fig 2 table s4 correlations between human fecal genes and args for samples collected during each sampling year were all highly significant all spearman s Ï 0 466 p 0 001 fig s5 args were less strongly correlated with ruminant and poultry genes spearman s Ï 0 308 and 0 372 respectively fig 2 table s4 while still detectable abundance of args and human fecal genes in wwtp effluent was lower than untreated sewage influent fig 2 though samples collected downstream from wwtp outfalls had somewhat high human fecal and arg abundance the greatest abundances for both 107 genes ml 1 were in samples collected from locations upstream of wwtp outfalls fig 2 when gene abundance was averaged across all time points at each site human fecal genes and args remained linearly correlated f 1 110 214 p 0 001 r2 0 658 fig 3 similar to single samples the highest site averaged arg and human fecal gene abundance 103 genes ml 1 were at sites that were not downstream of wwtp outfalls to further analyze the relationships between source tracking genes and args we conducted a pca to group samples by gene abundance pc1 explained 73 0 of variation and primarily consisted of effects from aggregate arg human fecal and most individual arg abundances whereas pc2 11 3 of variation explained primarily represented ruminant fecal gene abundance fig 4 therefore pc1 appears to largely reflect human fecal contamination and associated genes whereas pc2 reflects the influence of livestock production particularly cattle loadings of all args were positively correlated with pc1 suggesting all args generally increased as human fecal markers increased while their loadings on pc2 were both positive and negative with tet b having the highest positive correlation to pc2 notably the pca did not show distinct clusters between sites located upstream or downstream of wwtp outfalls we tested the impact of removal of brooklyn creek samples from the dataset to ensure these relationships were not the result of a few outlying samples the brooklyn creek watershed contains two large hospitals fig s6 and was the most highly contaminated single stream in terms of human fecal genes fig s7 which were highly correlated with all measured args in brooklyn creek samples fig s6 however when brooklyn creek samples were removed from the dataset and correlations recalculated the strong correlation between args and human fecal genes remained fig s8 to evaluate possible sources of contamination we examined correlations between human fecal genes or args and measures of land use land cover and urban infrastructure in the watershed of each sampling location all variables significantly correlated to args were also significantly correlated with human fecal genes figs 5 s9 s10 the strongest correlations were between human fecal genes or args and markers of urban infrastructure in particular site averaged human fecal genes total args and many individual args were correlated to estimates of road and sewer length road and sewer density and road crossings within sample watersheds figs 5 6 s9 s10 of the measured args bla shv and bla kpc had strong correlations with these variables nearly the same as human fecal genes fig s9 s10 additionally there were significant correlations of average septic system age within sample watersheds with site averaged human fecal genes spearman s Ï 0 376 p 0 001 and args spearman s Ï 0 349 p 0 003 figs 5 6 s10 when brooklyn creek samples were removed both correlations with average septic age were no longer significant fig s11 4 discussion 4 1 human fecal contamination as a source of args aquatic ecosystems can harbor human and animal pathogens with fecal pollution being a major contaminant source in rivers worldwide amarasiri et al 2020 bueno et al 2017 marti et al 2014 furthermore freshwater systems are considered active bacterial genetic reactors ideal for horizontal transfer of args between autochthonous microorganisms and pathogens baquero et al 2008 marti et al 2014 though multiple sources of fecal pollution exist at the watershed level most can be generalized into two categories 1 agricultural primarily runoff from livestock waste he et al 2020 and 2 human waste from sewage systems septic systems and wwtps gonzalez et al 2020 rizzo et al 2013 sowah et al 2017 pinpointing sources of fecal pollution and args in mixed use watersheds containing both urban and agricultural land is a critical global challenge to guide natural resource policy and stem the environmental spread of amr a striking observation from the upper oconee data is that human fecal contamination found in nearly half of the samples was highly correlated with arg abundance throughout the watershed fig 2 in contrast correlations between args and either ruminant or poultry fecal markers were much weaker indicating human fecal contamination as the primary source of arg contamination to surface waters throughout the watershed though agricultural sources likely contribute some args their impacts appear minimal relative to human waste this observation is supported by a recent meta analysis of shotgun metagenomes which also found an association between human fecal and arg contamination in environments with high anthropogenic impacts karkman et al 2019 as well as similar relationships found in other aquatic ecosystems sala comorera et al 2021 stachler et al 2019 thongsamer et al 2021 young et al 2013 human fecal contamination of surface waters is widespread across the globe and is often linked to gastrointestinal disease boehm et al 2015 chen et al 2019 eramo et al 2017 jennings et al 2020 sauer et al 2011 the strong association between human fecal contamination and amr in our data suggests this contamination might represent an underappreciated public health risk and adds urgency to calls for improved risk models for environmental amr exposure e g leonard et al 2022 nappier et al 2020 and more precise quantification of the epidemiology of infections acquired from environmental amr e g finley et al 2013 stanton et al 2022 another important trend to notice is that the abundances of all 6 selected args were highly correlated with one another and all showed similar relationships to the three fecal markers and environmental factors figs 4 5 s9 s10 this suggests common sources and or selective pressures despite the fact that we selected args targeting three different antibiotic classes Ã lactams tetracyclines and quinolones in selecting markers we focused primarily on genes associated with human pathogenesis for example 4 of the 6 targeted args are designated as type i threats zhang et al 2021 being associated with human pathogenesis mobile genetic elements and environments with high human influence of the exceptions tet b is also human associated but not typically mobile the other exception bla ctx m l was not included in that framework but we note that other bla ctx m groups are listed as type i and bla ctx m 1 has become a widespread esbl e g amos et al 2014 d andrea et al 2013 zurfluh et al 2014 and is transferred via plasmids so we consider bla ctx m 1 as high risk as well while this selection process may in part explain the tight correlation with human fecal contamination rather than agricultural sources this relationship is nonetheless important to note given the public health importance of these args previous work has demonstrated that arg diversity and abundance can differ between surface waters and associated flocs or suspended sediments with surface sediments and flocs originating from wwtp effluent often hosting enriched and distinct args compared to bulk water brown et al 2019 calero cÃ¡ceres et al 2017 luo et al 2010 since this study targeted the free living microbial fraction 5 0 Âµm we are unable to speculate on differences between free living and particle associated args in this system therefore it remains unknown whether differences exist between size fractions or whether stream sediments represent an enriched reservoir of args throughout this watershed 4 2 relative contributions of point and non point sources of human fecal contamination to effectively mitigate arg pollution sources of human fecal contamination to surface waters must be identified as is typical for mixed use watersheds there are numerous possible sources of human fecal contamination to upper oconee waters including wwtp effluent leaking sewer pipes and failing septic systems we initially hypothesized that wwtp effluent would be the primary source of args as wwtps are generally considered hotspots for amr guo et al 2017 marti et al 2014 rizzo et al 2013 and the release of wwtp effluent into receiving waters is often an important point source of arb and arg release into the environment nappier et al 2020 rizzo et al 2013 while treatment at wwtps in our watershed reduced molecular markers for human fecal markers and args both remained present at varying levels in treated effluent fig 2 suggesting a potential source to nearby waters however human fecal and arg contamination were not restricted to wwtp outfalls and surprisingly many sites with the highest contamination levels were not downstream of wwtp outfalls and included headwater streams figs 2 3 furthermore the pca showed no distinct clustering of downstream compared to upstream sites fig 4 this suggests that wwtp effluent a common point source of fecal and arg contamination globally e g brown et al 2019 munir et al 2011 murphy et al 2021 is not a primary driver of amr or human fecal contamination in much of this watershed where then is the fecal and arg contamination in the upper oconee coming from using a unique combination of landscape level qpcr collected over time from numerous sites across the watershed land use land cover and sewer septic density data we found this pollution was most closely associated with sewage infrastructure both human fecal genes and args were highly correlated to the sewer density the density of sewer crossings and road density within sample watersheds fig 5 the correlations of fecal genes with sewer density and sewer crossings indicate failures in the sewer transport system may be a major source of fecal and arg contamination to the environment the association of road density to human fecal and arg detection figs 5 6 can be explained by modern sewerage systems constructed under or in close proximity to roadways as well as links between road density and general population infrastructure density more specifically there were strong positive correlations between numerous measures of roads and sewers associated with a site road length road density sewer density sewer length and sewer crossings and the site averaged abundance of the Ã lactam resistance genes bla kpc and bla shv suggesting sewers are a significant source of these args furthermore all measured args except the tetracycline resistance gene tet b were positively correlated with at least one variable related to sewer infrastructure fig 5 suggesting sewerage as a widespread source of arg contamination to upper oconee surface waters this complements the growing literature documenting the association of arb and args with sewers auguet et al 2017 fahrenfeld and bisceglia 2016 medina et al 2021 suggesting the high levels of amr present in sewer systems can increase amr in nearby environments it is unclear why tet b alone is uncorrelated from measures of sewer infrastructure tetracycline is highly used in livestock production and tet genes are often associated with agricultural sources e g luo et al 2011 singer et al 2016 he et al 2020 this is reflected in our pca analyses where tet b had the strongest positive contribution of any args to pc2 an axis largely representative of agricultural influence fig 4 this may suggest difference sources of tet b sources than the other targeted args throughout the watershed potentially reflecting a greater influence of agriculture and livestock production on tet b in this environment decentralized wastewater systems such as septic tanks can also have a large impact on surface water fecal contamination especially seasonally sowah et al 2014 2017 these systems are a critical part of wastewater treatment infrastructure throughout the globe including in the upper oconee watershed where 42 of developed parcels use decentralized wastewater treatment systems capps et al 2020 we leveraged the unique data on septic density and septic age in the upper oconee watershed capps et al 2020 to investigate the relationship between septic systems with human fecal and arg contamination while neither human fecal genes nor args were significantly correlated with overall septic density site averages of both were significantly correlated with the average septic age within sampling watersheds figs 5 6 suggesting aging septic systems contribute to surface water fecal and arg contamination across the upper oconee watershed like sewer variables septic age was significantly correlated with bla kpc and bla shv abundance most 70 septic systems within the upper oconee watershed are potential environmental hazards due to their age 25 years with 28 of systems at 45 years old capps et al 2020 with our data indicating these aging septic systems are a source of fecal and arg contamination specifically studies of drain field effluent acceptance rates suggest septic systems can remain hydraulically operational for approximately 11 to 30 years siegrist et al 2000 but half of septic systems 19 to 27 years old are expected to show evidence of failure clayton 1974 winneberger 1975 furthermore these failures may be clustered in space and time since septic systems are typically installed in clusters brooklyn creek see fig s6 is a representative example of a headwater stream in this watershed that has no wwtp effluent impact yet had high human fecal and arg contamination fig s7 numerous samples collected from brooklyn creek even had comparable or greater numbers of human fecal markers and args than untreated sewage from wwtp influent suggesting failing wastewater infrastructure is a significant issue along this particular waterway when brooklyn creek samples were removed from analyses correlations between average septic age and args or human fecal genes were weaker and no longer statistically significant fig s11 however human fecal markers and args as well as sewer density and both args and human fecal genes remained highly correlated figs s8 s11 this indicates septic systems within the brooklyn creek sub watershed were an important driver of these patterns across the upper oconee watershed 4 3 agricultural sources of args in the watershed prior work has demonstrated that manure can be an important propagation pathway of amr in the environment including studies demonstrating livestock waste as a potential source for args and arbs to a variety of surface water ecosystems around the globe chee sanford et al 2009 hagedorn et al 1999 he et al 2020 keenum et al 2021 thanner et al 2016 given the preponderance of agricultural production areas throughout the upper oconee watershed including cattle pastures and a high density of poultry production facilities we sought to determine the relationship between arg abundance and ruminant or poultry waste throughout this watershed however ruminant fecal and poultry genes were only weakly correlated with args at the watershed scale fig 2 indicating a relatively minor role for agricultural waste as a source of args throughout the upper oconee the poultry mitochondrial dna marker gene used in this study is highly specific to chicken as compared to other avian primers boehm et al 2013 ryu et al 2014 schill and mathes 2008 however since it targets mitochondrial dna it is not specific to poultry feces and could potentially be associated with non fecal dna sources such as industrial poultry processing or residential restaurant drain disposal of meat associated with food preparation or consumption this is supported by weak but significant correlations of the poultry marker with the human fecal marker and with sewer density fig s4 indicating a correlation between human population density and poultry marker abundance in surface waters yet despite the abundance of poultry production in the area this marker was detected in only 19 of the samples and was not strongly correlated with args suggesting industrial poultry processing was not a significant source of surface water args within the watershed 4 4 consequences for amr mitigation quantifying antibiotic resistance transmission risk from the environment to humans is critical for stemming clinical risk associated with amr ikhimiukor et al 2022 manaia 2017 arg presence and diversity in clinical settings is often similar to that of nearby environments and or wwtp effluent suggesting rapid transmission routes from the environment to medical settings ekwanzala et al 2018 pÃ¤rnÃ¤nen et al 2019 furthermore analysis of historical amr data found spikes in environmental detection of many args 1 2 years prior to their detection in clinical settings suggesting high environmental arg abundance may portend increased clinical risk hua et al 2020 determining the factors driving arg prevalence in the environment is therefore critical for understanding and mitigating amr exposure to human populations the risk of amr transmission from the environment to humans must be assessed on whether there are arbs capable of colonizing the human body rather than args alone manaia 2017 although this study quantified args irrespective of their genomic context we note that a series of studies carried out in the same watershed using concurrently collected water samples for culture based characterization of isolates showed widespread presence of antibiotic resistant salmonella escherichia coli and enterococcus cho et al 2020c 2020a 2022 2019 2018 the e coli isolates from the upper oconee included the epidemic strain st131 known to pose serious global health risks johnson et al 2010 and included an isolate from the brooklyn creek watershed exhibiting the dangerous extended spectrum Ã lactamase phenotype cho et al 2020b this body of research indicates the surface water args documented here may indeed be associated with arb including some that pose a significant public health risk our findings highlight human fecal and arg contamination of surface waters as a direct hazard of aging or failing infrastructure such as sewage and septic systems this problem is not unique to this watershed as aging and failing wastewater infrastructure is a chronic problem across the united states asce 2021 selvakumar and tafuri 2012 and similar infrastructure failures are emerging as a major pathway of surface water contamination for a variety of pollutants fork et al 2021 gallert and winter 2005 gonzalez et al 2020 the u s is in a nationwide infrastructure crisis with wastewater infrastructure nationally earning an extremely low d on the american society of civil engineers infrastructure report asce 2021 a critical corollary of our findings is that the modernization of wwtps alone will not be sufficient to eliminate surface water fecal contamination and arg contamination to this end there is an urgent need for capital investment in sewage conveyance and septic infrastructure to protect public health and the environment many existing amr action plans lack any significant focus on the environment potentially due to the difficulty of satisfactorily answering fundamental questions about the sources and dynamics of environmental amr singer et al 2016 most studies assessing sources of args to surface waters have focused on wwtps or agricultural inputs amarasiri et al 2020 ben et al 2019 bueno et al 2017 he et al 2020 marti et al 2014 michael et al 2013 nappier et al 2020 nnadozie and odume 2019 likely leading to sampling bias toward locations near these point sources by studying an entire watershed over time instead of primarily focusing on waters directly downstream of known wwtp or agricultural inputs we demonstrate human fecal pollution from non point sources such as aging sewage and septic infrastructure plays an important role in amr dissemination to surface waters these systems should therefore be considered and potentially prioritized in public health efforts addressing the rise in amr and programs studying arg sources to the environment should include a diversity of sites across the ecosystem to ensure against missing this potentially important source of contamination 5 conclusion fecal contamination from human and agricultural waste is a major contributor of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes args into the environment however tracking the origin of environmental args is challenging we found that widespread human fecal contamination was strongly correlated with args in surface waters across a multi use watershed remarkably our novel synthesis of qpcr and geospatial data showed human fecal and arg contamination were highly disseminated and associated with sewer network density and septic system age non point sources of contaminants rather than wastewater reclamation outfalls or other point sources these data suggest aging wastewater transmission networks and septic systems are an important contamination source and

agriculture has made antimicrobial resistance amr an ongoing global crisis antimicrobial resistance collaborators 2022 o neill 2016 world health organization 2021 resistance has been reported for nearly all known antibiotics ventola 2015 and annual deaths from resistant infections are projected to reach 10 million by 2050 o neill 2016 to address amr and develop mitigation strategies it is critical to understand reservoirs and dissemination pathways of amr a growing body of research identifies the environment as both a recipient and source of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in particular surface waters such as streams and rivers are an ideal setting for amr dissemination as they are not only impacted by anthropogenic activities but are also dynamic environments with a high potential for exchange of mobile genetic elements and args allowing for rapid spread of amr throughout resident microbial populations amarasiri et al 2020 ben et al 2019 marti et al 2014 michael et al 2013 nappier et al 2020 nnadozie and odume 2019 the risk of resistant infections in humans is often related to the abundance and diversity of environmental args indicating links between the environment and the clinic bueno et al 2017 cho et al 2020d finley et al 2013 nappier et al 2020 though exact dissemination pathways largely remain unclear fecal pollution from both animal and human waste are important sources of arb and args to surface waters determining sources of args is particularly critical in mixed use watersheds which contain both urban and agricultural land and could thus receive args from human and or animal sources considerable amounts of antibiotics args and arb enter the environment from manure topdressing runoff or agricultural wastewater effluent he et al 2020 nappier et al 2020 thanner et al 2016 with wastewater from chicken and cattle farms often having arg abundances comparable to hospital and municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent and sometimes orders of magnitude greater he et al 2020 human fecal contamination to surface waters includes both raw and treated waste raw sewage containing antibiotics args and arb often including pathogens can enter surface waters through aging or inadequate wastewater infrastructure eramo et al 2017 gallert et al 2005 ikhimiukor et al 2022 mclellan and roguet 2019 nappier et al 2020 typically considered non point source contamination due to its distributed nature furthermore treated sewage typically contains detectable arb args and human fecal indicators amos et al 2018 wÃ©ry et al 2010 wu et al 2020 leading to release of arb and args into the environment via effluent discharge a common point source of these contaminants worldwide berglund et al 2015 buelow et al 2020 cacace et al 2019 karkman et al 2018 osiÅska et al 2020 in some cases sewage effluent even becomes enriched in args through the treatment process amos et al 2018 bengtsson palme et al 2019 di cesare et al 2016 osiÅska et al 2019 while numerous studies have reported on either agricultural waste or sewage effluent as an arg source to surface waters few studies have assessed their relative impact or quantified the relative importance of point source and non point source fecal contamination to arg dissemination we collected a multi year seasonal time series of fecal marker and arg abundance at high spatial resolution throughout the upper oconee watershed northeast georgia usa figs s1 s2 fisher et al 2000 combined with data on geospatial land use land change and wastewater infrastructure in the watershed the oconee river is the primary source of drinking water for athens clarke county and is widely used for recreation its mixed use watershed is analogous to other similarly sized watersheds around the world containing forested agricultural industrial and residential areas subject to increasing urbanization many tributaries in the watershed begin as relatively undeveloped headwater streams then flow through areas impacted by agricultural runoff from farmland and poultry processing before entering suburban regions and a central urban area athens where they receive effluent from multiple wwtps figs s1 s2 previous studies have documented pathogenic and potential epidemic strains of arb in the upper oconee watershed cho et al 2020a 2020b 2022 2018 2020c 2019 meinersmann et al 2008 2013 suggesting its surface waters are a significant reservoir and source of amr however the origins of anthropogenic args in these waters remain unknown to examine relationships between fecal contamination and args in surface waters across this watershed quantitative pcr qpcr for fecal source tracking genes and args was conducted on samples from 5 years of quarterly water quality monitoring 2013 2018 n 992 as well as on samples of influent and treated effluent from 3 wwtps n 17 fig s2 to pinpoint specific sources of fecal and arg contamination we used correlation analyses and ordinations to evaluate spatial relationships between fecal indicators args and geospatial estimates of wastewater infrastructure and land use land cover across the watershed this unique synthesis of data on arg abundance fecal source tracking land use land cover and wastewater infrastructure allows for unprecedented determination of surface water fecal and arg contamination sources throughout a mixed use watershed highlighting non point source contamination from sewers and septic systems as important sources of fecal and arg contamination to the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the 115 sites sampled throughout the upper oconee watershed fig s3 were established by the upper oconee watershed network uown a local water quality monitoring organization quarterly samples were collected in collaboration with trained uown citizen scientists from spring 2013 april 20th to summer 2018 july 8th resulting in collections across 22 total seasons the number of sites collected each season range 16 90 mean 45 standard deviation 22 was dependent on the number of volunteers filters for planktonic dna were collected as previously described hassell et al 2018 briefly water samples were stored on ice prior to filtration within 5 hours of collection water was filtered by peristaltic pumping through a 5 0 Î¼m durapore svpp pre

per sample to maximize total volume filtered due to high particulate matter loads all filters were stored dry at 80 c prior to dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and gene abundances dna extraction from the 0 22 Î¼m filters was completed as previously outlined hassell et al 2018 briefly on filter lysis proceeded using lysozyme then a proteinase k sds digestion resulting lysate was extracted using phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 ph 8 0 precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in 400 Î¼l of elution buffer omega biotek norcross ga usa and purified with the e z n a water dna kit omega biotek may 2013 version starting with the chtr buffer treatment step all samples were eluted in 50 Î¼l of elution buffer dna concentrations and quality were measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer hs assay thermo fisher waltham ma usa and a nanodrop lite spectrophotomer thermo fisher respectively given the large number of samples it was not feasible to quantify a broad diversity of args via shotgun metagenomics or high throughput qpcr arrays an initial set of 15 dna samples 13 from streams 1 wwtp influent and 1 wwtp effluent were used with antibiotic resistance genes microbial

triplicate with the taqmantm environmental master mix 2 0 thermo fisher and were run on a quantstudio 6 flex real time pcr system thermo fisher standard curves consisting of a dilution series of linearized plasmids or gblock fragments were run on every plate an internal taqmantm exogenous internal positive control thermo fisher was used to monitor inter assay variability a gene was considered detectable if at least two technical replicates had ct values greater than those of the lowest standard see table s2 if standard deviation between technical triplicates was 0 55 ct the lowest value obtained in standard curves an outlier was removed the sample was rerun if the spread remained 0 55 ct gene abundances were reported as gene copies ml 1 site water total arg abundance represents the sum of the abundance of all 6 individual args for some samples dna was depleted prior to running all qpcr assays assays not run for this reason were marked as na whereas those run but below the detection limit were recorded as 0 2 3 geospatial analyses geospatial data were calculated using arcmap 10 x esri redlands ca watersheds for each sampling location were delineated using the hydrology toolbox the national elevation dataset s 10m digital elevation model was used to calculate geomorphic characteristics of each sample point s watershed e g slope total stream length ruggedness mcdonald et al 2018 land use land cover for the watershed draining to each sample point were extracted from the 2016 national land cover dataset homer et al 2020 high quality geospatial data on septic and wastewater infrastructure in athens clarke county was accessed through a partnership with the athens clarke county public utilities department and were extracted from the athens clarke county public works datasets as previously described capps et al 2020 site linked sewer and septic data are withheld due to potential privacy concerns road lengths densities and relations to sample sites were calculated using the us census tiger lines streets dataset 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted in r r core team 2019 with most plots made using ggplot2 wickham 2016 histograms and violin plots were used to assess the co occurrence of args and source tracking genes samples were split into groups based on the detectability of each source tracking gene between these groups histograms compared the number of detectable args and violin plots compared the aggregate abundance of args differences in the sum of args between samples with and without detectable source tracking genes were determined using the mann whitney u test due to non normal distributions of some data correlations spearman s Ï between source tracking gene abundance and the sum of arg abundances were calculated using the hmisc r package harrell 2019 for all correlation analyses benjamini hochberg corrected p values are reported to correct for multiple comparisons site averaged data were compared using scatterplots regressions and correlation analyses the qpcr data genes per ml 1 water were log10 x 1 transformed then averaged by site model ii regressions of site averaged data were calculated using the lmodel2 r package legendre 2018 as previously described damashek et al 2019 pairwise correlations spearman s Ï between site averaged qpcr land use land cover road sewer and septic variables were calculated using hmisc correlations with corrected p 0 05 were considered significant hierarchical clustering was conducted using the hclust r command with complete linkage heatmaps were drawn using ggcorrplot kassambara 2019 with insignificant correlations crossed out an initial analysis including all environmental variables identified clusters of geomorphic variables highly correlated with one another which largely differentiated small versus large basins fig s4 guided by these groupings geomorphic variables other than ruggedness melton ruggedness ratio and mean total stream length were removed and correlations analyses were rerun similarly given their high level of correlation land use land change variables estimating developed land open low medium or high were combined into one aggregate developed estimate variables estimating forest cover deciduous evergreen or mixed were combined into one forest estimate and grassland and pasture variables were combined into one grassland estimate to determine whether watershed scale correlations primarily reflected extreme values at specific sites we reran correlation analyses with samples from brooklyn creek excluded brooklyn creek has been considered a critically impaired creek with consistently high e coli counts for over a decade leading to its listing as a 303 d threatened waterway by the us epa this stream could also be impacted by compromised sewage infrastructure from the two main hospitals in the region furthermore brooklyn creek samples consistently had the highest abundance of args and human fecal markers in our data a principal component analysis pca was calculated with the pca function from factominer lÃª et al 2008 using log10 x 1 transformed gene abundances as input pca results were visualized using the fviz pca biplot function from factoextra kassambara and mundt 2017 with scaling 1 3 results most sites across the watershed were sampled repeatedly fig s3 and approximately half of the 992 resulting samples had detectable human 48 or ruminant 55 fecal genes while only 19 had detectable poultry genes table s3 of the args tested ermb was detected most frequently 73 8 of samples bla ctx m 1 was rarest 2 6 and the other four genes were found in 24 9 49 9 of samples table s3 when the data were split by the presence of each source tracking gene args were always enriched in samples where the source tracking gene was detected mann whitney u test p 0 001 fig 1 a furthermore human and ruminant fecal contamination were associated with a higher likelihood of detecting one or more args and all samples where all 6 targeted args were detected n 33 also had detectable human fecal contamination fig 1b args and human fecal genes were highly correlated in both surface water spearman s Ï 0 632 p 0 001 and wwtp influent effluent spearman s Ï 0 931 p 0 001 fig 2 table s4 correlations between human fecal genes and args for samples collected during each sampling year were all highly significant all spearman s Ï 0 466 p 0 001 fig s5 args were less strongly correlated with ruminant and poultry genes spearman s Ï 0 308 and 0 372 respectively fig 2 table s4 while still detectable abundance of args and human fecal genes in wwtp effluent was lower than untreated sewage influent fig 2 though samples collected downstream from wwtp outfalls had somewhat high human fecal and arg abundance the greatest abundances for both 107 genes ml 1 were in samples collected from locations upstream of wwtp outfalls fig 2 when gene abundance was averaged across all time points at each site human fecal genes and args remained linearly correlated f 1 110 214 p 0 001 r2 0 658 fig 3 similar to single samples the highest site averaged arg and human fecal gene abundance 103 genes ml 1 were at sites that were not downstream of wwtp outfalls to further analyze the relationships between source tracking genes and args we conducted a pca to group samples by gene abundance pc1 explained 73 0 of variation and primarily consisted of effects from aggregate arg human fecal and most individual arg abundances whereas pc2 11 3 of variation explained primarily represented ruminant fecal gene abundance fig 4 therefore pc1 appears to largely reflect human fecal contamination and associated genes whereas pc2 reflects the influence of livestock production particularly cattle loadings of all args were positively correlated with pc1 suggesting all args generally increased as human fecal markers increased while their loadings on pc2 were both positive and negative with tet b having the highest positive correlation to pc2 notably the pca did not show distinct clusters between sites located upstream or downstream of wwtp outfalls we tested the impact of removal of brooklyn creek samples from the dataset to ensure these relationships were not the result of a few outlying samples the brooklyn creek watershed contains two large hospitals fig s6 and was the most highly contaminated single stream in terms of human fecal genes fig s7 which were highly correlated with all measured args in brooklyn creek samples fig s6 however when brooklyn creek samples were removed from the dataset and correlations recalculated the strong correlation between args and human fecal genes remained fig s8 to evaluate possible sources of contamination we examined correlations between human fecal genes or args and measures of land use land cover and urban infrastructure in the watershed of each sampling location all variables significantly correlated to args were also significantly correlated with human fecal genes figs 5 s9 s10 the strongest correlations were between human fecal genes or args and markers of urban infrastructure in particular site averaged human fecal genes total args and many individual args were correlated to estimates of road and sewer length road and sewer density and road crossings within sample watersheds figs 5 6 s9 s10 of the measured args bla shv and bla kpc had strong correlations with these variables nearly the same as human fecal genes fig s9 s10 additionally there were significant correlations of average septic system age within sample watersheds with site averaged human fecal genes spearman s Ï 0 376 p 0 001 and args spearman s Ï 0 349 p 0 003 figs 5 6 s10 when brooklyn creek samples were removed both correlations with average septic age were no longer significant fig s11 4 discussion 4 1 human fecal contamination as a source of args aquatic ecosystems can harbor human and animal pathogens with fecal pollution being a major contaminant source in rivers worldwide amarasiri et al 2020 bueno et al 2017 marti et al 2014 furthermore freshwater systems are considered active bacterial genetic reactors ideal for horizontal transfer of args between autochthonous microorganisms and pathogens baquero et al 2008 marti et al 2014 though multiple sources of fecal pollution exist at the watershed level most can be generalized into two categories 1 agricultural primarily runoff from livestock waste he et al 2020 and 2 human waste from sewage systems septic systems and wwtps gonzalez et al 2020 rizzo et al 2013 sowah et al 2017 pinpointing sources of fecal pollution and args in mixed use watersheds containing both urban and agricultural land is a critical global challenge to guide natural resource policy and stem the environmental spread of amr a striking observation from the upper oconee data is that human fecal contamination found in nearly half of the samples was highly correlated with arg abundance throughout the watershed fig 2 in contrast correlations between args and either ruminant or poultry fecal markers were much weaker indicating human fecal contamination as the primary source of arg contamination to surface waters throughout the watershed though agricultural sources likely contribute some args their impacts appear minimal relative to human waste this observation is supported by a recent meta analysis of shotgun metagenomes which also found an association between human fecal and arg contamination in environments with high anthropogenic impacts karkman et al 2019 as well as similar relationships found in other aquatic ecosystems sala comorera et al 2021 stachler et al 2019 thongsamer et al 2021 young et al 2013 human fecal contamination of surface waters is widespread across the globe and is often linked to gastrointestinal disease boehm et al 2015 chen et al 2019 eramo et al 2017 jennings et al 2020 sauer et al 2011 the strong association between human fecal contamination and amr in our data suggests this contamination might represent an underappreciated public health risk and adds urgency to calls for improved risk models for environmental amr exposure e g leonard et al 2022 nappier et al 2020 and more precise quantification of the epidemiology of infections acquired from environmental amr e g finley et al 2013 stanton et al 2022 another important trend to notice is that the abundances of all 6 selected args were highly correlated with one another and all showed similar relationships to the three fecal markers and environmental factors figs 4 5 s9 s10 this suggests common sources and or selective pressures despite the fact that we selected args targeting three different antibiotic classes Ã lactams tetracyclines and quinolones in selecting markers we focused primarily on genes associated with human pathogenesis for example 4 of the 6 targeted args are designated as type i threats zhang et al 2021 being associated with human pathogenesis mobile genetic elements and environments with high human influence of the exceptions tet b is also human associated but not typically mobile the other exception bla ctx m l was not included in that framework but we note that other bla ctx m groups are listed as type i and bla ctx m 1 has become a widespread esbl e g amos et al 2014 d andrea et al 2013 zurfluh et al 2014 and is transferred via plasmids so we consider bla ctx m 1 as high risk as well while this selection process may in part explain the tight correlation with human fecal contamination rather than agricultural sources this relationship is nonetheless important to note given the public health importance of these args previous work has demonstrated that arg diversity and abundance can differ between surface waters and associated flocs or suspended sediments with surface sediments and flocs originating from wwtp effluent often hosting enriched and distinct args compared to bulk water brown et al 2019 calero cÃ¡ceres et al 2017 luo et al 2010 since this study targeted the free living microbial fraction 5 0 Âµm we are unable to speculate on differences between free living and particle associated args in this system therefore it remains unknown whether differences exist between size fractions or whether stream sediments represent an enriched reservoir of args throughout this watershed 4 2 relative contributions of point and non point sources of human fecal contamination to effectively mitigate arg pollution sources of human fecal contamination to surface waters must be identified as is typical for mixed use watersheds there are numerous possible sources of human fecal contamination to upper oconee waters including wwtp effluent leaking sewer pipes and failing septic systems we initially hypothesized that wwtp effluent would be the primary source of args as wwtps are generally considered hotspots for amr guo et al 2017 marti et al 2014 rizzo et al 2013 and the release of wwtp effluent into receiving waters is often an important point source of arb and arg release into the environment nappier et al 2020 rizzo et al 2013 while treatment at wwtps in our watershed reduced molecular markers for human fecal markers and args both remained present at varying levels in treated effluent fig 2 suggesting a potential source to nearby waters however human fecal and arg contamination were not restricted to wwtp outfalls and surprisingly many sites with the highest contamination levels were not downstream of wwtp outfalls and included headwater streams figs 2 3 furthermore the pca showed no distinct clustering of downstream compared to upstream sites fig 4 this suggests that wwtp effluent a common point source of fecal and arg contamination globally e g brown et al 2019 munir et al 2011 murphy et al 2021 is not a primary driver of amr or human fecal contamination in much of this watershed where then is the fecal and arg contamination in the upper oconee coming from using a unique combination of landscape level qpcr collected over time from numerous sites across the watershed land use land cover and sewer septic density data we found this pollution was most closely associated with sewage infrastructure both human fecal genes and args were highly correlated to the sewer density the density of sewer crossings and road density within sample watersheds fig 5 the correlations of fecal genes with sewer density and sewer crossings indicate failures in the sewer transport system may be a major source of fecal and arg contamination to the environment the association of road density to human fecal and arg detection figs 5 6 can be explained by modern sewerage systems constructed under or in close proximity to roadways as well as links between road density and general population infrastructure density more specifically there were strong positive correlations between numerous measures of roads and sewers associated with a site road length road density sewer density sewer length and sewer crossings and the site averaged abundance of the Ã lactam resistance genes bla kpc and bla shv suggesting sewers are a significant source of these args furthermore all measured args except the tetracycline resistance gene tet b were positively correlated with at least one variable related to sewer infrastructure fig 5 suggesting sewerage as a widespread source of arg contamination to upper oconee surface waters this complements the growing literature documenting the association of arb and args with sewers auguet et al 2017 fahrenfeld and bisceglia 2016 medina et al 2021 suggesting the high levels of amr present in sewer systems can increase amr in nearby environments it is unclear why tet b alone is uncorrelated from measures of sewer infrastructure tetracycline is highly used in livestock production and tet genes are often associated with agricultural sources e g luo et al 2011 singer et al 2016 he et al 2020 this is reflected in our pca analyses where tet b had the strongest positive contribution of any args to pc2 an axis largely representative of agricultural influence fig 4 this may suggest difference sources of tet b sources than the other targeted args throughout the watershed potentially reflecting a greater influence of agriculture and livestock production on tet b in this environment decentralized wastewater systems such as septic tanks can also have a large impact on surface water fecal contamination especially seasonally sowah et al 2014 2017 these systems are a critical part of wastewater treatment infrastructure throughout the globe including in the upper oconee watershed where 42 of developed parcels use decentralized wastewater treatment systems capps et al 2020 we leveraged the unique data on septic density and septic age in the upper oconee watershed capps et al 2020 to investigate the relationship between septic systems with human fecal and arg contamination while neither human fecal genes nor args were significantly correlated with overall septic density site averages of both were significantly correlated with the average septic age within sampling watersheds figs 5 6 suggesting aging septic systems contribute to surface water fecal and arg contamination across the upper oconee watershed like sewer variables septic age was significantly correlated with bla kpc and bla shv abundance most 70 septic systems within the upper oconee watershed are potential environmental hazards due to their age 25 years with 28 of systems at 45 years old capps et al 2020 with our data indicating these aging septic systems are a source of fecal and arg contamination specifically studies of drain field effluent acceptance rates suggest septic systems can remain hydraulically operational for approximately 11 to 30 years siegrist et al 2000 but half of septic systems 19 to 27 years old are expected to show evidence of failure clayton 1974 winneberger 1975 furthermore these failures may be clustered in space and time since septic systems are typically installed in clusters brooklyn creek see fig s6 is a representative example of a headwater stream in this watershed that has no wwtp effluent impact yet had high human fecal and arg contamination fig s7 numerous samples collected from brooklyn creek even had comparable or greater numbers of human fecal markers and args than untreated sewage from wwtp influent suggesting failing wastewater infrastructure is a significant issue along this particular waterway when brooklyn creek samples were removed from analyses correlations between average septic age and args or human fecal genes were weaker and no longer statistically significant fig s11 however human fecal markers and args as well as sewer density and both args and human fecal genes remained highly correlated figs s8 s11 this indicates septic systems within the brooklyn creek sub watershed were an important driver of these patterns across the upper oconee watershed 4 3 agricultural sources of args in the watershed prior work has demonstrated that manure can be an important propagation pathway of amr in the environment including studies demonstrating livestock waste as a potential source for args and arbs to a variety of surface water ecosystems around the globe chee sanford et al 2009 hagedorn et al 1999 he et al 2020 keenum et al 2021 thanner et al 2016 given the preponderance of agricultural production areas throughout the upper oconee watershed including cattle pastures and a high density of poultry production facilities we sought to determine the relationship between arg abundance and ruminant or poultry waste throughout this watershed however ruminant fecal and poultry genes were only weakly correlated with args at the watershed scale fig 2 indicating a relatively minor role for agricultural waste as a source of args throughout the upper oconee the poultry mitochondrial dna marker gene used in this study is highly specific to chicken as compared to other avian primers boehm et al 2013 ryu et al 2014 schill and mathes 2008 however since it targets mitochondrial dna it is not specific to poultry feces and could potentially be associated with non fecal dna sources such as industrial poultry processing or residential restaurant drain disposal of meat associated with food preparation or consumption this is supported by weak but significant correlations of the poultry marker with the human fecal marker and with sewer density fig s4 indicating a correlation between human population density and poultry marker abundance in surface waters yet despite the abundance of poultry production in the area this marker was detected in only 19 of the samples and was not strongly correlated with args suggesting industrial poultry processing was not a significant source of surface water args within the watershed 4 4 consequences for amr mitigation quantifying antibiotic resistance transmission risk from the environment to humans is critical for stemming clinical risk associated with amr ikhimiukor et al 2022 manaia 2017 arg presence and diversity in clinical settings is often similar to that of nearby environments and or wwtp effluent suggesting rapid transmission routes from the environment to medical settings ekwanzala et al 2018 pÃ¤rnÃ¤nen et al 2019 furthermore analysis of historical amr data found spikes in environmental detection of many args 1 2 years prior to their detection in clinical settings suggesting high environmental arg abundance may portend increased clinical risk hua et al 2020 determining the factors driving arg prevalence in the environment is therefore critical for understanding and mitigating amr exposure to human populations the risk of amr transmission from the environment to humans must be assessed on whether there are arbs capable of colonizing the human body rather than args alone manaia 2017 although this study quantified args irrespective of their genomic context we note that a series of studies carried out in the same watershed using concurrently collected water samples for culture based characterization of isolates showed widespread presence of antibiotic resistant salmonella escherichia coli and enterococcus cho et al 2020c 2020a 2022 2019 2018 the e coli isolates from the upper oconee included the epidemic strain st131 known to pose serious global health risks johnson et al 2010 and included an isolate from the brooklyn creek watershed exhibiting the dangerous extended spectrum Ã lactamase phenotype cho et al 2020b this body of research indicates the surface water args documented here may indeed be associated with arb including some that pose a significant public health risk our findings highlight human fecal and arg contamination of surface waters as a direct hazard of aging or failing infrastructure such as sewage and septic systems this problem is not unique to this watershed as aging and failing wastewater infrastructure is a chronic problem across the united states asce 2021 selvakumar and tafuri 2012 and similar infrastructure failures are emerging as a major pathway of surface water contamination for a variety of pollutants fork et al 2021 gallert and winter 2005 gonzalez et al 2020 the u s is in a nationwide infrastructure crisis with wastewater infrastructure nationally earning an extremely low d on the american society of civil engineers infrastructure report asce 2021 a critical corollary of our findings is that the modernization of wwtps alone will not be sufficient to eliminate surface water fecal contamination and arg contamination to this end there is an urgent need for capital investment in sewage conveyance and septic infrastructure to protect public health and the environment many existing amr action plans lack any significant focus on the environment potentially due to the difficulty of satisfactorily answering fundamental questions about the sources and dynamics of environmental amr singer et al 2016 most studies assessing sources of args to surface waters have focused on wwtps or agricultural inputs amarasiri et al 2020 ben et al 2019 bueno et al 2017 he et al 2020 marti et al 2014 michael et al 2013 nappier et al 2020 nnadozie and odume 2019 likely leading to sampling bias toward locations near these point sources by studying an entire watershed over time instead of primarily focusing on waters directly downstream of known wwtp or agricultural inputs we demonstrate human fecal pollution from non point sources such as aging sewage and septic infrastructure plays an important role in amr dissemination to surface waters these systems should therefore be considered and potentially prioritized in public health efforts addressing the rise in amr and programs studying arg sources to the environment should include a diversity of sites across the ecosystem to ensure against missing this potentially important source of contamination 5 conclusion fecal contamination from human and agricultural waste is a major contributor of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes args into the environment however tracking the origin of environmental args is challenging we found that widespread human fecal contamination was strongly correlated with args in surface waters across a multi use watershed remarkably our novel synthesis of qpcr and geospatial data showed human fecal and arg contamination were highly disseminated and associated with sewer network density and septic system age non point sources of contaminants rather than wastewater reclamation outfalls or other point sources these data suggest aging wastewater transmission networks and septic systems are an important contamination source and that aggressive investment to repair or replace aging and obsolete wastewater infrastructure is critical for mitigating environmental antibiotic resistance dissemination author contributions eao jrw

essentially the radioactivity level of the wastewater should decrease below the limit before it can be discharged into the ocean burnie 2019 morton et al 2021 o leary 2021 radioactive iodine species have attracted the greatest attention in this regard due to its widespread prevalence and the dangerous effect on human lives kÃ¼pper et al 2011 metso et al 2007 ten hoeve and jacobson 2012 xie et al 2022 iodine exists mainly as the radioactive isotopes of 131i half life t1 2 8 days and 129i t1 2 11 57 107 years in spent nuclear fuels 131i with a short half life is the most fatal and most radioactive species in the fallout from a nuclear explosion or from a severe accident in a nuclear power plant the long half life of 129i also makes its radiotoxicity particularly problematic for human health and for the environment over its long period of decay iodine form various chemical species e g hi hio3 i2 and ch3i due to their high chemical reactivity hou et al 2009 saiz lopez et al 2012 over the last few decades several nuclear disasters have demonstrated that iodine species are too volatile to remain completely confined to specific sites the infinite solubility of iodine implies that radioactive iodine isotopes released into nature via oceans can possibly contaminate marine life such as seaweeds and eventually re enter the human body through the food chain banach et al 2020 mouritsen et al 2021 intake of the radioactive iodines leads to chemical interactions specifically with the thyroid and salivary glands sunavala dossabhoy 2018 and may cause cancer sato and lyamzina 2018 further radioactive iodine isotope is also used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and subsequently released as wastewater from medical research institutions there are no doubts why radioactive iodine removal has been the central focus of scientific and public attention huve et al 2018 kÃ¼pper et al 2011 liu et al 2014 extensive efforts have been devoted to removing radioactive iodine species from various media chapman et al 2010 choi et al 2016 dai et al 2021 gao et al 2017 luo et al 2022 mao et al 2017 mushtaq et al 2017 wang et al 2018 yao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 most researchers have proposed the trapping of radioactive iodine species in aqueous solutions ikari et al 2015 lin et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 notably once radioactive iodines are dissolved in complex liquid media such as seawater and groundwater the selective removal undoubtedly becomes even more problematic kaplan et al 2022 kosaka et al 2012 it is because various anions especially halide species inhibit the iodine adsorption onto adsorbents moreover the used adsorbents must be disposed of due to radioactive pollution zia et al 2021 this entails a serious waste of material costs because most of the adsorbents employ expensive noble metals in this study we achieved a groundbreaking solution to these issues by developing reusable adsorbents showing excellent functionality for the selective separation of radioactive iodine species from a liquid complex matrix noble metals such as ag au and pt exhibit remarkable chemical affinity to iodine and good structural integrity which are the desired properties of promising adsorbents ateia et al 2019 choi et al 2016 forstmann et al 1973 mebrahtu et al 1987b mushtaq et al 2017 rodriguez and soriaga 1988 theoretical studies on the adsorption of iodine on the 111 surfaces of the three noble metals revealed that ag is the most outstanding adsorbent for iodine removal followed by pt and au chun et al 2018 however owing to the formation of agi from ag at high iodine chemical potential recycling ag after adsorptive removal is not feasible therefore we chose pt as the adsorbent for iodine although iodine atoms particularly prefer the pt 111 plane its commercial application for radioactive waste removal have been impeded by high cost and lack of reusability soriaga and hubbard 1982 stickney et al 1985 herein we report that iron nanoparticles coated with thin pt atomic layers are extremely efficient adsorbents for the selective removal of iodine species notably the proposed nanoparticles are easily synthesized using a simple chemical process and can be repeatedly reused for the purpose it is clearly shown that the adsorbent nanoparticles can successfully isolate iodine species with very high selectivity in both seawater and groundwater over repetitive applications more than 100 cycles we essentially developed a standard protocol for designing reusable adsorbents for the adsorptive removal of radioactive iodine ions via a simple two step chemical and electrochemical process in a liquid medium in brief we i selectively capture iodine species in liquid complex media and ii effectively release them in a separate step physicochemical properties of the adsorbents were fully characterized based on selective iodine adsorption using first principles density functional theory calculations to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the selective adsorptive removal of iodine species dissolved in liquid media using reusable adsorbents the procedure can be easily scaled up for the quick and safe removal of large amounts of radioactive iodine species in wastewater media which is of importance environmental remedy and secure our healthy lives from serious nuclear disasters 2 material and

preparation of fe pt as the adsorbent pt coated fe nanoparticles fe pt were prepared as adsorbents by the galvanic replacement reaction grr whereby the fe nanoparticles were thinly surrounded with pt for iodine adsorption bae et al 2012 schardt et al 1989 the fe nanoparticles 0 5 g dispersed in 50 ml distilled water under sonication were added to a 100 ml aqueous solution containing 0 5 g k2ptcl6 and 0 75 g polyethylene glycol and then violently shaken at room temperature for 1 h in this process pt was spontaneously deposited on the surface of the fe core due to differences in their standard reduction potentials ptcl6 2 4e pt 6cl e0 0 799 v vs she fe3 3e fe e0 0 040 v vs she fe2 2e fe e0 0 440 v vs she after the grr fe pt was gathered with a magnet and washed several times with acetone and distilled water to select the adsorbents that were completely surrounded by pt the synthesised fe pt was immersed in 5 m hno3 for 1 h finally to improve the stability of the pt shell for reuse the fe pt nanoparticles were thermally treated at 200 c for 30 min under pure hydrogen gas inside a tube furnace ah jeon industrial co ltd 2 2 2 characterisation and instrumentation to analyse the morphology of the fe pt nanoparticles transmission electron microscopy tem measurements were performed using a jeol jem 2100f microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv the surface area of the fe pt nanoparticels was measured using a micromeritics 3flex surface area analyser and it was calculated from a linear langmuir plot obtained via bet analysis at 78 k using n2 gas powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained to confirm the structural information using a bruker d8 advance diffractometer using cu kÎ± radiation at room temperature with 40 kv and 40 ma the polycrystalline samples were mounted on sample holders and scanned in the 2Î¸ range of 20 60 with a step size of 0 02 and a step time of 0 1 s to investigate the sorption behaviour of iodine species i i2 and ch3i on the fe pt nanoparticles uv vis absorbance studies were performed using a biochrom model wpa lightwave ii spectrometer quantitiave information of iodine on the sorption behaviour was further investigated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms spectro ms kleve germany and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms perkinelmer clarus 680 sq 8t concentrations of

diametrically opposite photomultiplier tubes and a multichannel analyser with an effective resolution of 1 10 kev ultimagold llt was used as the liquid scintillation cocktail 2 2 3 electrochemical characterization a chi 660 d workstation ch instruments was employed in all electrochemical measurements ag agcl 3 m nacl and a graphite rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes respectively a glassy carbon gc 3 mm in diameter disk or gc crucible was used as working electrodes for cyclic voltammetry cv measurements an aqueous dispersion of fe pt was dropped onto the gc disk electrode after drying under air for 2 h the electrode was covered with 5 Î¼l of 0 05 wt nafion solution prior to the electrochemical measurement the gc crucible was used for the electrochemical desorption of iodine from the adsorbents the iodine adsorbed fe pt adsorbents were added to the gc crucible containing a small volume of electrolyte after which an nd magnet was placed at the bottom of the gc crucible so that the fe pt adsorbents in the gc crucible would be attracted to the bottom here the gc crucible provides an electrical contact for fe pt to be used as the working electrode 2 2 4 computational methods all dft calculations in this study were carried out using the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe generalised gradient approximation gga exchange correlation functional perdew et al 1996 and projector augmented wave basis sets blÃ¶chl 1994 as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulations package vasp kresse and furthmÃ¼ller 1996 the total force and energy of all the systems were optimised until they converged within 0 02 ev Ã¥ and 10 4 ev respectively the van der waals interaction was corrected using the dft d3 method of grimme et al grimme 2006 for slab model systems a gamma centred k point scheme of 5 5 1 was employed 3 results and discussion 3 1 iodine removal and recovery process scheme 1 shows the schematic for the iodine removal and adsorbent recovery process that we developed the adsorbents consisting of iron nanoparticles coated with platinum atomic layers fe pt a are added to an aqueous solution containing iodine species i i2 and ch3i b subsequently mixing of the combined solution is performed to adsorb iodine species on the pt surface of fe pt c fe pt with adsorbed iodine species is then magnetically gathered using a nd magnet d after the iodine free solution is decanted e fe pt with adsorbed iodine species is immersed in a small volume of electrolyte solution f and electrochemically treated to detach the iodine species from the pt surface g finally a magnet separates fe pt h from the solution containing the desorbed iodine species i enabling the fe pt adsorbents to be reused this is a cost effective approach that can greatly reduce the volume of radioactive waste through repetitive use of the adsorbents 3 2 characterization of adsorbents in fe pt the pt acts as a sorbent material for iodine species present in the media soriaga and hubbard 1982 while the magnetic fe nanoparticle core facilitates magnetic recovery of the adsorbents dispersed in the solution hyeon 2003 we applied the galvanic replacement reaction to produce fe pt as the adsorbent bae et al 2012 oh et al 2013 a transmission electron microscopy tem image of the as synthesised fe pt nanoparticles shows that pt particles of size 5 nm were deposited on the fe surface in the layer plus island structure resulting in nanoclusters of pt as shells fig 1 a we observed that irregular and incomplete pt nanocluster shells were not stable because they were exfoliated from the adsorbent surface during electrochemical desorption of the iodine species to solve this issue we reinforced the structural stability of the pt shells with additional thermal treatments for multiple uses of the fe pt nanoparticles the tem image of fe pt thermally treated at 200 c for 30 min under a reducing atmosphere fig 1b showed that the pt particles on the surface of the fe nanoparticles aggregate with each other to form a relatively dense pt layer eds mapping analyses before and after thermal treatment confirmed the homogeneous distribution of pt onto the fe core fig s2 according to the brunauer emmett teller bet analyses the surface area of the pt shell was reduced from 14 m2 g to 9 m2 g indicating that the initial morphology of the pt shells was changed by the thermal treatment it was also confirmed that the thermally treated pt shell remains stable over the electrochemical process the xrd analysis was used to precisely understand the effect of temperature and the xrd patterns of fe pt treated at different temperatures are shown in fig 1c before heating the fe pt exhibits xrd peaks at 40 04 and 46 54 which are attributed to surface pt layers and an fe core peak at 44 7 although the xrd pattern did not change after the heat treatment at 200 c the magnetic properties of the particles disappeared as fe and pt form alloys above 400 c therefore the fe pt adsorbents were prepared using thermal treatment at 200 c we recorded the cyclic voltammogram cv of the prepared fe pt in 0 1 m h2so4 to further investigate the electrochemical properties of the fe pt fig 1d shows redox waves corresponding to hydrogen adsorption desorption on the pt surface and pt oxide formation dissolution since no oxidative dissolution current of fe was observed in the potential region the fe core is considered to be completely protected by the pt shells moreover when fe and fe pt were tentatively immersed in 5 m hno3 fe nanoparticles dissolved whereas fe pt did not which means that the pt shells surrounded the fe core without any defect fig 1d inset 3 3 removal and recovery of iodine species sorption behaviour of iodine species i i2 ch3i and io3 on the fe pt nanoparticles was investigated using uv vis absorption spectroscopy fig 2 a shows the uv vis absorption spectra obtained from 0 1 mm ki solutions the solutions exhibit a clear absorption band for i at 226 nm which disappears after adding fe pt it confirms that i was removed from the aqueous solutions via spontaneous adsorption on the pt shells of fe pt the fe pt adsorbents were then magnetically separated and included in a new electrolyte solution where the adsorbate iodine species were electrochemically detached after the desorption of iodine we once again observed the band at 226 nm implying that i reappeared notably the spectrum is the same as that recorded before the addition of the fe pt adsorbents we also recorded the uv vis absorption spectra after we separated the fe pt from the 0 1 mm i2 and ch3i solutions and then desorbed the iodine fig s3 in both cases we observed that the peak corresponding to i and the concentration estimated from its absorbance intensity were consistent with the initial concentration of iodine additionally we tested the adsorption behaviour of io3 on the fe pt adsorbents however the adsorption phenomenon of the io3 did not occur on the adsorbents therefore it turned out that not only can fe pt completely remove representative three iodine species dissolved in aqueous solutions i e i i2 and ch3i but the iodine adsorbed on fe pt can also be completely desorbed by electrochemical treatment the results presented here provide considerable insight regarding the adsorption of iodine species on the pt surface the iodine species i i2 and ch3i are spontaneously adsorbed on the pt surface it is well known that thermodynamically spontaneous chemisorption of i occurs on the pt surface to form a neutral iodine atom accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction eq 1 mebrahtu et al 1987a soriaga and hubbard 1982 1 p t 111 i h 2 o p t i a d s o h 1 2 h 2 in order to further identify underlying adsorption and dissociation mechanisms of i2 and ch3i on the pt surface the relative energies of each reaction step with reference to the reactants were calculated using density functional theory dft the results indicated that thermodynamically i2 prefers chemical dissociation into two neutral i atoms as described in eq 2 and fig 2b 2 p t 111 i 2 2 p t i a d s for ch3i the iodine atom is proposed to adsorb on pt surface via direct dissociation into ch3 and i karp et al 2013 or the reaction between the adsorbed ch3i and a water molecule producing ch3oh and a hydrogen atom on pt as described in eq 3 figs 2c and s4 3 p t c h 3 i a d s h 2 o p t i a d s p t 1 2 h 2 a d s c h 3 o h the adsorption of a single i atom and the formation of ch3oh through hydrolysis are found to be thermodynamically more stable than adsorbed ch3i and h2o molecules which aligns with the previously proposed ch3i dissociation mechanism under solvation ho et al 2019 this implies that i2 and ch3i are dissociated chemically and the iodine atoms are spontaneously adsorbed in the pt shell of the fe pt nanoparticle adsorbent to experimentally confirm the adsorbed state of iodine on the pt surface we recorded the x ray absorption spectra for the i coated fe pt surface fig 2d shows the i 3d spectra of the iodine adsorbed on the pt surface by immersion in ki i2 and ch3i respectively the binding energy 619 3 ev of i 3d was the same in the cases of the three solutions indicating that the adsorbed iodine is in the zero valent state berry et al 1989 both the experimental results and computational prediction consistently suggest that the iodine adsorbed on the pt surface from the three solutions exists in a neutral atomic state subsequently we investigated the electrochemical desorption of adsorbed iodine iads on pt surfaces fig 2e shows the linear sweep voltammograms of fe pt coated gc electrodes that were initially immersed in solutions containing ki i2 or ch3i for 20 min and then washed with distilled water the fe pt electrode which was not immersed in the iodine solution fig 2e a shows no conspicuous cathodic current except for the one due to the hydrogen evolution reaction regime whereas all electrodes that were immersed in iodine solution exhibit similar cathodic currents at the electrode potential window between 0 60 v and 0 85 v the cathodic currents were attributed to the reduction of iodine at the pt surface and a potential of 0 9 v was applied to completely desorb the iodine adsorbates on pt surfaces in this work to test the structural and functional stability of fe pt nanoparticles over repetitive application for the adsorptive removal and recovery of iodine species we repeated the sorption experiment for 100 cycles fig 2f shows the recovery efficiency of i for selected cycles of the repeated sorption process monitored by uv vis absorption spectroscopy the recovery efficiencies of i were calculated to be 98 3 and 97 5 after reusing the fe pt adsorbents 50 and 100 times respectively thus the thermally treated fe pt adsorbents maintained high recovery efficiency for iodine species removal and had substantial electrochemical recyclability of at least 100 times as shown in the inset of fig 2f clear x ray absorption spectra for the fe core surrounded by protective pt layers additionally confirm that the core fe nanoparticles are intact and stable without oxidation during the iodine species removal process in addition we visually confirmed that the pt shells remained stable without structural degradation using tem observation of the electrode after 100 cycles fig s5 fig 3 a shows the adsorption isotherms for the three iodine species onto the fe pt adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity for the iodine atom of all three iodine species was determined to be approximately 25 mg g the classic langmuir adsorption model wang and guo 2020a 2020b was used to describe the adsorption equilibrium related fitting results are displayed when plotted as ce qe vs ce all of the langmuir isotherms remain linear over the entire concentration range with high coefficients using the surface area 9 m2 g of the thermally treated fe pt adsorbent and the maximum adsorption capacity 25 mg g obtained from the adsorption isotherm the number of moles of adsorbed iodide per unit area of fe pt was calculated to be 2 2 nmol cm2 this result is well consistent with the moles of iodide adsorbed on a pt surface hubbard et al 1966 to investigate the adsorption kinetics we further investigated the time dependence of the iodide adsorption on fe pt adsorbents fig 3b shows the adsorption efficiency according to the immersion time of the adsorbent 1 120 min as a result it was found that equilibrium was reached in 20 min we also investigated the effect of solution ph on the adsorption efficeincy of i anions on fe pt the adsorption efficiency of i according to ph was measured in the range from 1 to 14 and is shown in fig 3c the removal efficiency of the iodide on fe pt is 99 87 0 11 at ph values 11 but rapidly decreased at ph 12 this decrease in adsorption efficiency may be due to a decrease in the number of adsorption sites available on the fe pt surface because more oh adsorbs on the pt surface at high oh concentrations braker et al 2002 pinto et al 2014 therefore in order to use the fe pt for removing the iodine from high ph solution such as a scrubber where alkali solution is used to capture gaseous iodine bollinger et al 2022 it is required to lower the ph of the aqueous solution to 11 or less prior to add the adsorbents 3 4 application tests of fe pt adsorbents hou et al reported that the radioactive iodine recently discharged from a nuclear power plant accident exists as an iodide form in the seawater hou et al 2013 for example the iodide was found as the dominant species of 129i in the seawater of the offshore fukushima japan even a few year later after the fukushima nuclear power plant npp accident while stable 127i was mainly in iodate form hou et al 2013 therefore we investigated the adsorption behaviour of the iodide onto fe pt adsorbents in the natural seawater fig 4 a displays the concentrations of various ionic species in the seawater solution recorded by ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms before and after the addition of fe pt to seawater spiked with 0 1 mm 13 mg kg ki note that the presence of anions especially halogen anions at concentrations greater than that of i may interfere with i adsorption the addition of fe pt to seawater with ki resulted in no detectable level of i remaining in the seawater with almost no change in the concentration of other ions uv vis spectra of the seawater showed the same features as the icp ms spectra fig s6a the adsorbents were also tested to remove the iodide from seawater at a very low concentration of 0 5 Î¼m 65 Î¼g kg an approximate concentration of iodine found in seawater ito and hirokawa 2009 it was seen that the iodides were completely removed from the seawater in 3 h fig s6b which means that our adsorbents are effective for the very low concentrations of the iodide in seawater this selective interaction is ascribed to a unique adsorption behaviour of i on the pt fig 4b shows the adsorption energies of various anions on the pt surface calculated with dft iodine adsorbs strongly on pt 111 surface compared to the others showing the distinct effect of electronegativity on the selective adsorption the charge density difference plot also shows substantially different charge transfer of iodine relatively large charge depletion on the adsorbate the high removal and recovery efficiencies of our adsorbents from seawater sufficiently corroborate its excellent selectivity toward iodine species it has been found that the fe pt particles cannot adsorb the iodate the dominant form of natural iodine 127i in the seawater this limitation can be used as an advantage that our adsorbents can selectively remove recently released radioactive 129i which is predominantly in a iodide form hou et al 2013 in the presence of the natural iodate 127i in the seawater the radioactive iodide gradually oxidizes in seawater over time to form its iodate in this case in order to remove the radioactive iodate using the fe pt adsorbent it is necessary to reduce the iodate to iodine or iodide using an electrochemical method or a reducing agent such as thiosulfate or ascorbic acid we also confirmed the selective removal of i dissolved in groundwater containing various ions using the fe pt nanoparticles fig s6c these results consistently demonstrate that the synthesized nanoparticle adsorbents fe pt can completely and selectively remove iodide from both groundwater and seawater furthermore we tested whether the fe pt adsorbent is also applicable to a radioactive element 129i by measuring Î² rays using liquid scintillation counting lsc we conducted adsorption and electrochemical desorption experiments with samples of 470 bq of 129i fig 4c shows the Î² spectra recorded before and after the adsorption of 129i on fe pt and sequentially after its electrochemical desorption it was found that 99 0 of 129i was removed from the solution and adsorbed onto fe pt after 129i was electrochemically desorbed the radioactivity of 129i returned to 99 1 of the initial strength consistent with the initial Î² spectrum these results indicate that the fe pt adsorbents in our system successfully remove and recover radioactive iodine species as well lastly we performed the removal and recovery of iodine dissolved in a large volume of water 20 l we constructed a lab made system for iodine removal from water it comprises an electrochemical system reactor magnets and tanks for wastewater and separated solutions as shown in fig 4d and fig s7 a 3 30 min video clip has been provided in supporting information to elucidate the working of the system to visually distinguish the iodine removed solution from the iodide recovered one we added 25 ml of conc hydrogen peroxide and 25 ml of conc hydrochloric acid to each of the two solutions the inset of fig 4d shows that only the iodide dissolved solution turned yellow indicating that the iodine was removed from the 20 l of water and recovered into 0 5 l of the remaining water icp ms analysis confirmed that 99 8 of the iodine was removed from the 20 l of water 4 conclusions fe pt nanoparticles were synthesised as adsorbents for the selective removal of radioactive iodine species dissolved in aqueous solutions through a galvanic replacement reaction and subsequent thermal treatment process the adsorbent showed a clear core fe shell pt structure in which pt atomic layers tightly encapsulated the fe nanoparticles the sorption behaviours of the prepared adsorbents for various iodine species i2 i and ch3i were examined in aqueous solutions with a removal efficiency above 99 8 we demonstrated that the fe pt nanoparticles were not only stable over 100 cycles of electrochemical processes without oxidation or structural disintegration but can also separate iodine species from complex liquid media such as seawater and groundwater notably this adsorbent was also used to remove radioactive iodine the radioactive iodine removal system involved a series of steps adsorption separation desorption disposal and fe pt reuse we have therefore developed and demonstrated reusable adsorbent to repetitively and simply separate iodine species dissolved in liquid solutions

desired properties of promising adsorbents ateia et al 2019 choi et al 2016 forstmann et al 1973 mebrahtu et al 1987b mushtaq et al 2017 rodriguez and soriaga 1988 theoretical studies on the adsorption of iodine on the 111 surfaces of the three noble metals revealed that ag is the most outstanding adsorbent for iodine removal followed by pt and au chun et al 2018 however owing to the formation of agi from ag at high iodine chemical potential recycling ag after adsorptive removal is not feasible therefore we chose pt as the adsorbent for iodine although iodine atoms particularly prefer the pt 111 plane its commercial application for radioactive waste removal have been impeded by high cost and lack of reusability soriaga and hubbard 1982 stickney et al 1985 herein we report that iron nanoparticles coated with thin pt atomic layers are extremely efficient adsorbents for the selective removal of iodine species notably the proposed nanoparticles are easily synthesized using a simple chemical process and can be repeatedly reused for the purpose it is clearly shown that the adsorbent nanoparticles can successfully isolate iodine species with very high selectivity in both seawater and groundwater over repetitive applications more than 100 cycles we essentially developed a standard protocol for designing reusable adsorbents for the adsorptive removal of radioactive iodine ions via a simple two step chemical and electrochemical process in a liquid medium in brief we i selectively capture iodine species in liquid complex media and ii effectively release them in a separate step physicochemical properties of the adsorbents were fully characterized based on selective iodine adsorption using first principles density functional theory calculations to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the selective adsorptive removal of iodine species dissolved in liquid media using reusable adsorbents the procedure can be easily scaled up for the quick and safe removal of large amounts of radioactive iodine species in wastewater media which is of importance environmental remedy and secure our healthy lives from serious nuclear disasters 2 material and

preparation of fe pt as the adsorbent pt coated fe nanoparticles fe pt were prepared as adsorbents by the galvanic replacement reaction grr whereby the fe nanoparticles were thinly surrounded with pt for iodine adsorption bae et al 2012 schardt et al 1989 the fe nanoparticles 0 5 g dispersed in 50 ml distilled water under sonication were added to a 100 ml aqueous solution containing 0 5 g k2ptcl6 and 0 75 g polyethylene glycol and then violently shaken at room temperature for 1 h in this process pt was spontaneously deposited on the surface of the fe core due to differences in their standard reduction potentials ptcl6 2 4e pt 6cl e0 0 799 v vs she fe3 3e fe e0 0 040 v vs she fe2 2e fe e0 0 440 v vs she after the grr fe pt was gathered with a magnet and washed several times with acetone and distilled water to select the adsorbents that were completely surrounded by pt the synthesised fe pt was immersed in 5 m hno3 for 1 h finally to improve the stability of the pt shell for reuse the fe pt nanoparticles were thermally treated at 200 c for 30 min under pure hydrogen gas inside a tube furnace ah jeon industrial co ltd 2 2 2 characterisation and instrumentation to analyse the morphology of the fe pt nanoparticles transmission electron microscopy tem measurements were performed using a jeol jem 2100f microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv the surface area of the fe pt nanoparticels was measured using a micromeritics 3flex surface area analyser and it was calculated from a linear langmuir plot obtained via bet analysis at 78 k using n2 gas powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained to confirm the structural information using a bruker d8 advance diffractometer using cu kÎ± radiation at room temperature with 40 kv and 40 ma the polycrystalline samples were mounted on sample holders and scanned in the 2Î¸ range of 20 60 with a step size of 0 02 and a step time of 0 1 s to investigate the sorption behaviour of iodine species i i2 and ch3i on the fe pt nanoparticles uv vis absorbance studies were performed using a biochrom model wpa lightwave ii spectrometer quantitiave information of iodine on the sorption behaviour was further investigated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms spectro ms kleve germany and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms perkinelmer clarus 680 sq 8t concentrations of

diametrically opposite photomultiplier tubes and a multichannel analyser with an effective resolution of 1 10 kev ultimagold llt was used as the liquid scintillation cocktail 2 2 3 electrochemical characterization a chi 660 d workstation ch instruments was employed in all electrochemical measurements ag agcl 3 m nacl and a graphite rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes respectively a glassy carbon gc 3 mm in diameter disk or gc crucible was used as working electrodes for cyclic voltammetry cv measurements an aqueous dispersion of fe pt was dropped onto the gc disk electrode after drying under air for 2 h the electrode was covered with 5 Î¼l of 0 05 wt nafion solution prior to the electrochemical measurement the gc crucible was used for the electrochemical desorption of iodine from the adsorbents the iodine adsorbed fe pt adsorbents were added to the gc crucible containing a small volume of electrolyte after which an nd magnet was placed at the bottom of the gc crucible so that the fe pt adsorbents in the gc crucible would be attracted to the bottom here the gc crucible provides an electrical contact for fe pt to be used as the working electrode 2 2 4 computational methods all dft calculations in this study were carried out using the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe generalised gradient approximation gga exchange correlation functional perdew et al 1996 and projector augmented wave basis sets blÃ¶chl 1994 as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulations package vasp kresse and furthmÃ¼ller 1996 the total force and energy of all the systems were optimised until they converged within 0 02 ev Ã¥ and 10 4 ev respectively the van der waals interaction was corrected using the dft d3 method of grimme et al grimme 2006 for slab model systems a gamma centred k point scheme of 5 5 1 was employed 3 results and discussion 3 1 iodine removal and recovery process scheme 1 shows the schematic for the iodine removal and adsorbent recovery process that we developed the adsorbents consisting of iron nanoparticles coated with platinum atomic layers fe pt a are added to an aqueous solution containing iodine species i i2 and ch3i b subsequently mixing of the combined solution is performed to adsorb iodine species on the pt surface of fe pt c fe pt with adsorbed iodine species is then magnetically gathered using a nd magnet d after the iodine free solution is decanted e fe pt with adsorbed iodine species is immersed in a small volume of electrolyte solution f and electrochemically treated to detach the iodine species from the pt surface g finally a magnet separates fe pt h from the solution containing the desorbed iodine species i enabling the fe pt adsorbents to be reused this is a cost effective approach that can greatly reduce the volume of radioactive waste through repetitive use of the adsorbents 3 2 characterization of adsorbents in fe pt the pt acts as a sorbent material for iodine species present in the media soriaga and hubbard 1982 while the magnetic fe nanoparticle core facilitates magnetic recovery of the adsorbents dispersed in the solution hyeon 2003 we applied the galvanic replacement reaction to produce fe pt as the adsorbent bae et al 2012 oh et al 2013 a transmission electron microscopy tem image of the as synthesised fe pt nanoparticles shows that pt particles of size 5 nm were deposited on the fe surface in the layer plus island structure resulting in nanoclusters of pt as shells fig 1 a we observed that irregular and incomplete pt nanocluster shells were not stable because they were exfoliated from the adsorbent surface during electrochemical desorption of the iodine species to solve this issue we reinforced the structural stability of the pt shells with additional thermal treatments for multiple uses of the fe pt nanoparticles the tem image of fe pt thermally treated at 200 c for 30 min under a reducing atmosphere fig 1b showed that the pt particles on the surface of the fe nanoparticles aggregate with each other to form a relatively dense pt layer eds mapping analyses before and after thermal treatment confirmed the homogeneous distribution of pt onto the fe core fig s2 according to the brunauer emmett teller bet analyses the surface area of the pt shell was reduced from 14 m2 g to 9 m2 g indicating that the initial morphology of the pt shells was changed by the thermal treatment it was also confirmed that the thermally treated pt shell remains stable over the electrochemical process the xrd analysis was used to precisely understand the effect of temperature and the xrd patterns of fe pt treated at different temperatures are shown in fig 1c before heating the fe pt exhibits xrd peaks at 40 04 and 46 54 which are attributed to surface pt layers and an fe core peak at 44 7 although the xrd pattern did not change after the heat treatment at 200 c the magnetic properties of the particles disappeared as fe and pt form alloys above 400 c therefore the fe pt adsorbents were prepared using thermal treatment at 200 c we recorded the cyclic voltammogram cv of the prepared fe pt in 0 1 m h2so4 to further investigate the electrochemical properties of the fe pt fig 1d shows redox waves corresponding to hydrogen adsorption desorption on the pt surface and pt oxide formation dissolution since no oxidative dissolution current of fe was observed in the potential region the fe core is considered to be completely protected by the pt shells moreover when fe and fe pt were tentatively immersed in 5 m hno3 fe nanoparticles dissolved whereas fe pt did not which means that the pt shells surrounded the fe core without any defect fig 1d inset 3 3 removal and recovery of iodine species sorption behaviour of iodine species i i2 ch3i and io3 on the fe pt nanoparticles was investigated using uv vis absorption spectroscopy fig 2 a shows the uv vis absorption spectra obtained from 0 1 mm ki solutions the solutions exhibit a clear absorption band for i at 226 nm which disappears after adding fe pt it confirms that i was removed from the aqueous solutions via spontaneous adsorption on the pt shells of fe pt the fe pt adsorbents were then magnetically separated and included in a new electrolyte solution where the adsorbate iodine species were electrochemically detached after the desorption of iodine we once again observed the band at 226 nm implying that i reappeared notably the spectrum is the same as that recorded before the addition of the fe pt adsorbents we also recorded the uv vis absorption spectra after we separated the fe pt from the 0 1 mm i2 and ch3i solutions and then desorbed the iodine fig s3 in both cases we observed that the peak corresponding to i and the concentration estimated from its absorbance intensity were consistent with the initial concentration of iodine additionally we tested the adsorption behaviour of io3 on the fe pt adsorbents however the adsorption phenomenon of the io3 did not occur on the adsorbents therefore it turned out that not only can fe pt completely remove representative three iodine species dissolved in aqueous solutions i e i i2 and ch3i but the iodine adsorbed on fe pt can also be completely desorbed by electrochemical treatment the results presented here provide considerable insight regarding the adsorption of iodine species on the pt surface the iodine species i i2 and ch3i are spontaneously adsorbed on the pt surface it is well known that thermodynamically spontaneous chemisorption of i occurs on the pt surface to form a neutral iodine atom accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction eq 1 mebrahtu et al 1987a soriaga and hubbard 1982 1 p t 111 i h 2 o p t i a d s o h 1 2 h 2 in order to further identify underlying adsorption and dissociation mechanisms of i2 and ch3i on the pt surface the relative energies of each reaction step with reference to the reactants were calculated using density functional theory dft the results indicated that thermodynamically i2 prefers chemical dissociation into two neutral i atoms as described in eq 2 and fig 2b 2 p t 111 i 2 2 p t i a d s for ch3i the iodine atom is proposed to adsorb on pt surface via direct dissociation into ch3 and i karp et al 2013 or the reaction between the adsorbed ch3i and a water molecule producing ch3oh and a hydrogen atom on pt as described in eq 3 figs 2c and s4 3 p t c h 3 i a d s h 2 o p t i a d s p t 1 2 h 2 a d s c h 3 o h the adsorption of a single i atom and the formation of ch3oh through hydrolysis are found to be thermodynamically more stable than adsorbed ch3i and h2o molecules which aligns with the previously proposed ch3i dissociation mechanism under solvation ho et al 2019 this implies that i2 and ch3i are dissociated chemically and the iodine atoms are spontaneously adsorbed in the pt shell of the fe pt nanoparticle adsorbent to experimentally confirm the adsorbed state of iodine on the pt surface we recorded the x ray absorption spectra for the i coated fe pt surface fig 2d shows the i 3d spectra of the iodine adsorbed on the pt surface by immersion in ki i2 and ch3i respectively the binding energy 619 3 ev of i 3d was the same in the cases of the three solutions indicating that the adsorbed iodine is in the zero valent state berry et al 1989 both the experimental results and computational prediction consistently suggest that the iodine adsorbed on the pt surface from the three solutions exists in a neutral atomic state subsequently we investigated the electrochemical desorption of adsorbed iodine iads on pt surfaces fig 2e shows the linear sweep voltammograms of fe pt coated gc electrodes that were initially immersed in solutions containing ki i2 or ch3i for 20 min and then washed with distilled water the fe pt electrode which was not immersed in the iodine solution fig 2e a shows no conspicuous cathodic current except for the one due to the hydrogen evolution reaction regime whereas all electrodes that were immersed in iodine solution exhibit similar cathodic currents at the electrode potential window between 0 60 v and 0 85 v the cathodic currents were attributed to the reduction of iodine at the pt surface and a potential of 0 9 v was applied to completely desorb the iodine adsorbates on pt surfaces in this work to test the structural and functional stability of fe pt nanoparticles over repetitive application for the adsorptive removal and recovery of iodine species we repeated the sorption experiment for 100 cycles fig 2f shows the recovery efficiency of i for selected cycles of the repeated sorption process monitored by uv vis absorption spectroscopy the recovery efficiencies of i were calculated to be 98 3 and 97 5 after reusing the fe pt adsorbents 50 and 100 times respectively thus the thermally treated fe pt adsorbents maintained high recovery efficiency for iodine species removal and had substantial electrochemical recyclability of at least 100 times as shown in the inset of fig 2f clear x ray absorption spectra for the fe core surrounded by protective pt layers additionally confirm that the core fe nanoparticles are intact and stable without oxidation during the iodine species removal process in addition we visually confirmed that the pt shells remained stable without structural degradation using tem observation of the electrode after 100 cycles fig s5 fig 3 a shows the adsorption isotherms for the three iodine species onto the fe pt adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity for the iodine atom of all three iodine species was determined to be approximately 25 mg g the classic langmuir adsorption model wang and guo 2020a 2020b was used to describe the adsorption equilibrium related fitting results are displayed when plotted as ce qe vs ce all of the langmuir isotherms remain linear over the entire concentration range with high coefficients using the surface area 9 m2 g of the thermally treated fe pt adsorbent and the maximum adsorption capacity 25 mg g obtained from the adsorption isotherm the number of moles of adsorbed iodide per unit area of fe pt was calculated to be 2 2 nmol cm2 this result is well consistent with the moles of iodide adsorbed on a pt surface hubbard et al 1966 to investigate the adsorption kinetics we further investigated the time dependence of the iodide adsorption on fe pt adsorbents fig 3b shows the adsorption efficiency according to the immersion time of the adsorbent 1 120 min as a result it was found that equilibrium was reached in 20 min we also investigated the effect of solution ph on the adsorption efficeincy of i anions on fe pt the adsorption efficiency of i according to ph was measured in the range from 1 to 14 and is shown in fig 3c the removal efficiency of the iodide on fe pt is 99 87 0 11 at ph values 11 but rapidly decreased at ph 12 this decrease in adsorption efficiency may be due to a decrease in the number of adsorption sites available on the fe pt surface because more oh adsorbs on the pt surface at high oh concentrations braker et al 2002 pinto et al 2014 therefore in order to use the fe pt for removing the iodine from high ph solution such as a scrubber where alkali solution is used to capture gaseous iodine bollinger et al 2022 it is required to lower the ph of the aqueous solution to 11 or less prior to add the adsorbents 3 4 application tests of fe pt adsorbents hou et al reported that the radioactive iodine recently discharged from a nuclear power plant accident exists as an iodide form in the seawater hou et al 2013 for example the iodide was found as the dominant species of 129i in the seawater of the offshore fukushima japan even a few year later after the fukushima nuclear power plant npp accident while stable 127i was mainly in iodate form hou et al 2013 therefore we investigated the adsorption behaviour of the iodide onto fe pt adsorbents in the natural seawater fig 4 a displays the concentrations of various ionic species in the seawater solution recorded by ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms before and after the addition of fe pt to seawater spiked with 0 1 mm 13 mg kg ki note that the presence of anions especially halogen anions at concentrations greater than that of i may interfere with i adsorption the addition of fe pt to seawater with ki resulted in no detectable level of i remaining in the seawater with almost no change in the concentration of other ions uv vis spectra of the seawater showed the same features as the icp ms spectra fig s6a the adsorbents were also tested to remove the iodide from seawater at a very low concentration of 0 5 Î¼m 65 Î¼g kg an approximate concentration of iodine found in seawater ito and hirokawa 2009 it was seen that the iodides were completely removed from the seawater in 3 h fig s6b which means that our adsorbents are effective for the very low concentrations of the iodide in seawater this selective interaction is ascribed to a unique adsorption behaviour of i on the pt fig 4b shows the adsorption energies of various anions on the pt surface calculated with dft iodine adsorbs strongly on pt 111 surface compared to the others showing the distinct effect of electronegativity on the selective adsorption the charge density difference plot also shows substantially different charge transfer of iodine relatively large charge depletion on the adsorbate the high removal and recovery efficiencies of our adsorbents from seawater sufficiently corroborate its excellent selectivity toward iodine species it has been found that the fe pt particles cannot adsorb the iodate the dominant form of natural iodine 127i in the seawater this limitation can be used as an advantage that our adsorbents can selectively remove recently released radioactive 129i which is predominantly in a iodide form hou et al 2013 in the presence of the natural iodate 127i in the seawater the radioactive iodide gradually oxidizes in seawater over time to form its iodate in this case in order to remove the radioactive iodate using the fe pt adsorbent it is necessary to reduce the iodate to iodine or iodide using an electrochemical method or a reducing agent such as thiosulfate or ascorbic acid we also confirmed the selective removal of i dissolved in groundwater containing various ions using the fe pt nanoparticles fig s6c these results consistently demonstrate that the synthesized nanoparticle adsorbents fe pt can completely and selectively remove iodide from both groundwater and seawater furthermore we tested whether the fe pt adsorbent is also applicable to a radioactive element 129i by measuring Î² rays using liquid scintillation counting lsc we conducted adsorption and electrochemical desorption experiments with samples of 470 bq of 129i fig 4c shows the Î² spectra recorded before and after the adsorption of 129i on fe pt and sequentially after its electrochemical desorption it was found that 99 0 of 129i was removed from the solution and adsorbed onto fe pt after 129i was electrochemically desorbed the radioactivity of 129i returned to 99 1 of the initial strength consistent with the initial Î² spectrum these results indicate that the fe pt adsorbents in our system successfully remove and recover radioactive iodine species as well lastly we performed the removal and recovery of iodine dissolved in a large volume of water 20 l we constructed a lab made system for iodine removal from water it comprises an electrochemical system reactor magnets and tanks for wastewater and separated solutions as shown in fig 4d and fig s7 a 3 30 min video clip has been provided in supporting information to elucidate the working of the system to visually distinguish the iodine removed solution from the iodide recovered one we added 25 ml of conc hydrogen peroxide and 25 ml of conc hydrochloric acid to each of the two solutions the inset of fig 4d shows that only the iodide dissolved solution turned yellow indicating that the iodine was removed from the 20 l of water and recovered into 0 5 l of the remaining water icp ms analysis confirmed that 99 8 of the iodine was removed from the 20 l of water 4 conclusions fe pt nanoparticles were synthesised as adsorbents for the selective removal of radioactive iodine species dissolved in aqueous solutions through a galvanic replacement reaction and subsequent thermal treatment process the adsorbent showed a clear core fe shell pt structure in which pt atomic layers tightly encapsulated the fe nanoparticles the sorption behaviours of the prepared adsorbents for various iodine species i2 i and ch3i were examined in aqueous solutions with a removal efficiency above 99 8 we demonstrated that the fe pt nanoparticles were not only stable over 100 cycles of electrochemical processes without oxidation or structural disintegration but can also separate iodine species from complex liquid media such as seawater and groundwater notably this adsorbent was also used to remove radioactive iodine the radioactive iodine removal system involved a series of steps adsorption separation desorption disposal and fe pt reuse we have therefore developed and demonstrated reusable adsorbent to repetitively and simply separate iodine species dissolved in liquid solutions

so far the most widely used process for wastewater disinfection for the non nitrified secondary wastewater effluent chloramines are usually formed from the transformation of chlorine by ammonia

westerhoff and mash 2002 the microbial derived don in efom is enriched in amines peptides and amino acids leenheer et al 2007 which can be transformed into n dbps during chlor am ination choe et al 2021 shao et al 2020 due to the different properties the yields of n dbps from reclaimed water are anticipated to be higher than those from surface water in cases of wastewater reuse in addition efom is an important source of n dbp precursors in drinking water supplies impacted by wastewater discharges bond et al 2011 therefore n dbp formation from efom has recently gained more and more attention efom comprises the degradation products of influent substrates and soluble microbial products smp barker and stuckey 1999 which are produced from the microbe mediated reactions during biological

2012 michael kordatou et al 2015 therefore the efom properties and the formation of n dbps in post chlor am ination can be impacted by operational conditions and vary with biological treatment processes the changes in dom properties during biological wastewater treatment and the effects of temperature on them have been studied based on both molecular size distribution and fluorescence components komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 nonetheless the changes were not compared among various biotreatment processes with different operational conditions previous studies have found that efom from biological treatment processes with different nitrifying conditions show different han and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation during chlor am ination krasner et al 2009b mamo et al 2016 however the relationship between the variation of n dbp formation and the dom transformation in different biological treatment processes e g processes with different nitrifying conditions remains largely unknown the objectives of this study are to characterize the changes of dom during biological wastewater treatment with different nitrifying conditions and to probe the formation of n dbps from wastewater dom firstly the influent and effluent of biological treatment facilities from eight wastewater treatment plants wwtps were collected the properties of dom were characterized and the changes of dom properties were compared secondly the formation of n dbps i e hans hnms and nas from wastewater dom during chloramination was evaluated and correlated with dom properties total n nitrosamine tono as a parameter to reflect the total concentrations of n nitrosamines was also measured thirdly the changes of n dbp formation in different types of biological treatment were compared the results of this study offer insights into the transformation of n dbp precursors in different biological treatments and provide information for the better prediction and control of n dbp

the t test and pearson correlation analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of dom in wastewater and before and after biological treatment 3 1 1 characteristics of dom in wastewater the properties of dom in the influent a1 h1 and effluent a2 h2 and h3 samples of the biological treatment facilities are presented in table 1 the doc concentrations of influent and effluent samples were in the range of 9 5 28 1 and 5 5 11 9 mg c l 1 respectively the suva values of the influent 0 9 2 6 l mg 1 m 1 and effluent samples 0 7 1 2 l mg 1 m 1 were lower than those of natural water 1 3 4 9 l mg 1 m 1 rosario ortiz et al 2007 which is consistent with the low hydrophobicity of wastewater dom reported in a previous study jarusutthirak and amy 2007 the ratio of don to doc in influent and effluent of the biological treatment facilities was 0 07 0 51 and 0 09 0 35 mg n mg c 1 except for those not available respectively which were generally higher than those of natural water 0 03 mg n mg c 1 mash et al 2004 the results confirm that dom in wastewater comprised more nitrogen containing substances e g proteins than nom in surface water nam and amy 2008 the mw distribution of doc and specific components i e aromatic humic like fulvic humic like and protein like substances of dom was evaluated from the corresponding hpsec chromatograms and fig 1 presents influent and effluent of biological treatment in wwtp a as examples four fractions were artificially defined which included f1 30 kda f2 3 30 kda f3 0 3 3 kda and f4 0 3 kda in both the influent and effluent more than 70 of doc was distributed in f3 and f4 figs 1a and s3a the f3 and f4 fractions were enriched with aromatic humic like fulvic humic like and protein like substances as indicated by the uv absorbance and fluorescence signals fig 1b e which contributed over 80 to the total uva254 and the corresponding fluorescence of wastewater fig s3b e unlike nom in drinking water sources e g river and lake that comprises most fractions within intermediate molecular size 0 3 30 kda fabris et al 2008 nam and amy 2008 dom in wastewater has a more wide spread mw distribution in terms of both doc and specific component detections for example the doc fraction in f1 30 kda contributed to 2 23 median of 9 except for those not detected in samples a2 c2 and h3 of the total doc of wastewater dom fig s3a moreover a shoulder pinnacle in f4 0 3 kda was always detected in wastewater dom by uva254 and fluorescence detections fig 1b e these fractions in wastewater dom with either large or low molecular size were also reported in previous studies komatsu et al 2020 nam and amy 2008 which might be derived from other sources e g anthropogenic and microbial sources besides terrestrial sources 3 1 2 changes of dom characteristics in wastewater by biological treatment the removal percentages of the total abundance and specific mw fractions in wastewater dom by biological treatment were calculated using the area of peaks in the corresponding fraction fig 2 the amount of the overall doc and protein like substances in wastewater significantly decreased after biological treatments in 8 wwtps p 0 05 median removal 30 fig 2a and e nevertheless the overall fulvic humic like and humic like substances in wastewater were relatively recalcitrant to biological treatment median removal 10 fig 2c and d as their biodegradability is generally lower than that of protein like substances komatsu et al 2020 the removal of specific dom fractions by biological treatment varied with molecular size and species most dom distributing in f1 and f2 was effectively removed by biological treatment median removal 80 fig 2 the doc aromatics and protein like substances in f4 were removed by 6 55 13 41 and 15 58 respectively during biological treatment fig 2a b and e on the other hand the doc aromatics and protein like substances in f3 as well as the fulvic humic like and humic like substances in f3 and f4 were generally more recalcitrant to biological treatment than other components median removal 21 the low and negative removal 36 33 of the lower intermediate molecular size fluorescent components 0 3 3 kda could be attributed to the degradation and diversification of the liable high molecular size dom by microbes resulting in the production of lignin polyphenol analogs and nitrogen containing molecules komatsu et al 2020 wang et al 2021a in addition the microbial transformation of protein like substances in smp to humic and fulvic like substances was suggested in a previous study maqbool et al 2017 which might also contribute to the low and negative removal of humic and fulvic humic like fluorescence the results indicated that biological treatment processes could selectively remove the high molecular size and upper intermediate molecular size dom 3 kda as well as the low molecular size 0 3 kda doc aromatics and protein like substances while the fulvic humic like and humic like substances with mw lower than 3 kda were bio refractory based on the concentrations of nh4 and no2 in the influent and effluent samples table s2 the biological treatment processes in wwtp a h were classified into two types according to the different nitrifying conditions which are complete nitrification and incomplete nitrification details of classification are provided in text s5 and table s2 liao et al 2022 the removal of dom and its fractions by biological treatment were compared among treatment processes with different nitrifying conditions fig 3 there was no significant difference among biological treatment processes under different nitrifying conditions in reducing the overall doc uva254 and humic and fulvic humic like fluorescence of wastewater dom p 0 05 fig 3a on the other hand the removal of total protein like substances in the biological treatment processes with complete nitrification was significantly higher than those with incomplete nitrification p 0 05 and the removal percentages generally increased as nitrifying conditions became greater fig 3a in the previous characterization of wastewater dom the removal of the protein like components in a o and a a o processes was mainly attributed to the aerobic process cheng et al 2018 where the nitrification of wastewater takes place the higher removal of protein like substances by biological treatment processes with complete nitrification might thus be caused by the greater extent of nitrification which indicates stronger activities of nitrifying bacteria in the aerobic process kim et al 2011 interestingly the reduction of uva254 and protein like fluorescence of low molecular size dom 0 3 kda in biological treatment was also nitrification dependent fig 3b low molecular size dom with high uva254 indicated low molecular size amino acids and simple sugars jarusutthirak and amy 2007 these molecules along with low molecular size protein like substances were reported to be the primary molecules removed in the a a o and a o processes and the removal was related to microbe mediated activities wang et al 2021a moreover biological treatment with low dissolved oxygen conditions 0 3 mgo2 l 1 was also reported to produce molecules with high protein amino sugar like characteristics liao et al 2022 the results suggested that complete nitrification during biological treatment may favor the removal of protein like substances especially for those with low molecular size 3 2 n dbp formation from wastewater dom and relationship with dom characteristics 3 2 1 formation of hans hnms nas and tono from wastewater dom the formation of n dbps from the dom in wastewater samples was investigated by conducting formation potential tests using monochloramine as shown in fig 4 a the formation of hans was in the range of 57 1 172 7 nmol l 1 and 55 1 100 3 nmol l 1 after the chloramination of influent and effluent samples respectively which was dominated by dcan formation with the br concentrations ranging from 22 to 62 Î¼g l 1 in the wastewater samples except for 196 Î¼g l 1 in sample b1 the formation of the brominated species bcan and dban was detected at low concentrations 1 4 6 1 nmol l 1 except for 16 1 nmol l 1 in sample b1 accounting for 2 6 of the total han formation tcnm was the dominant hnm specie identified and hnm concentrations formed from chloramination of the influent and effluent samples were in the range of 7 3 58 4 nmol l 1 and 4 5 11 1 nmol l 1 respectively fig 4b the concentrations of tono after chloramination ranged from 6 5 to 44 8 nmol l 1 in the influent samples and from 3 6 to 8 9 nmol l 1 in the effluent samples fig 4c the formation of the selected nas from chloramination contributed more than 50 of the corresponding tono formation within the range of 5 6 38 2 nmol l 1 and 2 9 6 6 nmol l 1 respectively in the chloraminated influent and effluent samples fig 4d ndma ndea and npyr were the predominant nas formed in the chloraminated wastewater samples 3 2 2 relationships between n dbp formation and dom properties n dbp formation during chloramination of dom in influent and effluent wastewater was compared through pearson correlation analysis with dom properties including doc uva254 and fluorescence characteristics of the whole dom and main mw fractions fig 5 as the bulk properties of wastewater dom the total doc and the doc of the low molecular size fraction 0 3 kda were strongly correlated with n dbp formation r 0 55 0 71 p 0 05 on the other hand the correlations of n dbp formation except for hnm formation to the uva254 fulvic humic like fluorescence and humic like fluorescence of the whole dom and main mw fractions were insignificant r 0 30 0 50 p 0 05 which suggested the small contribution of these fractions to han and na precursors in wastewater dom weak correlations were observed between han formation from wastewater dom and the fractions indicating protein like substances i e protein f3 protein f4 and protein total r 0 17 0 40 and 0 43 respectively p 0 05 being consistent with a previous study that dcan formation during chloramination was not correlated with the don of nom isolates lee et al 2007 this was probably because the nitrogen in hans can be incorporated both from monochloramine and from the nitrogenous moieties present in dom shah and mitch 2012 yang et al 2010 the weak correlations might also be attributed to the lack of the interpretation of don in biopolymers and humic substances in the protein like fluorescence detection don in biopolymers and humic substances analyzed using hpsec coupled with online nitrogen detection hpsec ond was reported to have a significant correlation with han formation from nom chlorination r 0 87 p 0 05 wang et al 2021b the formation of hnms from wastewater dom showed significant correlations with the abundance of the total and low molecular size protein like substances indicated by protein total and protein f4 r 0 79 and 0 81 respectively p 0 01 because the oxidation followed by halogenation of amine groups is one of the formation pathways of hnms during chloramination shah and mitch 2012 additionally hnm formation was significantly correlated with low molecular size and total aromatics indicated by uva254 f4 and uva254 total r 0 75 and 0 71 respectively p 0 01 the strong correlation was expected because the shoulder pinnacle in uva254 f4 fraction in wastewater dom can be associated with low molecular size amino acids jarusutthirak and amy 2007 which reacted with monochloramine to produce hnm shah and mitch 2012 it should be noted that the correlations of hnm formation with protein f4 and uva254 f4 abundance r 0 81 and 0 75 respectively were slightly stronger than those with protein total and uva254 total abundance r 0 79 and 0 71 respectively fig 5 this might be attributed to the weak correlations between hnm formation and the abundance of the lower intermediate molecular size aromatics and protein like substances indicated by uva254 f3 and protein f3 r 0 35 and 0 44 respectively p 0 05 the results suggested the important contribution of low molecular size don 0 3 kda in wastewater dom to hnm formation during chloramination on the other hand hnm formation from nom chlorination was reported to have an insignificant correlation r 0 08 with don in biopolymers and humic substances analyzed via hpsec ond wang et al 2021b suggesting that hnm precursors might be better interpreted using protein like fluorescence detection the formation of nas and tono from wastewater dom also had significant positive correlations with the abundance of the total and low molecular size protein like substances indicated by protein total and protein f4 p 0 01 fig 5 the strong correlations were attributed to the close association of na precursors with the amines in protein like substances because the nucleophilic substitution followed by oxidation of secondary amines by monochloramine is an important formation pathway of nas shah and mitch 2012 ndma formation has been reported to be significantly associated with the bulk protein like fluorophore and proteins amino sugars like don in wastewater dom in the literature p 0 01 liao et al 2022 roccaro et al 2020 however the correlation of na and tono formation with the abundance of protein f3 fraction was insignificant r 0 09 and 0 14 respectively p 0 05 consequently the r of na and tono formation with the abundance of protein f4 fraction r 0 62 and 0 68 respectively were higher than those with the abundance of the total protein like substance r 0 58 and 0 64 respectively suggesting that low molecular size protein like substances in wastewater dom may act an important role in na formation from chloramination nonetheless both dom fractions with large mw 10 kda and small mw 1 kda were reported to be the primary contributors to ndma precursors in secondary effluent chen et al 2014 while the protein like fluorescence analysis failed to interpret large molecular size don due to its low protein like fluorescence fig 1e therefore although the analysis of low molecular size protein like substances using hpsec may help to estimate the concentrations of na precursors in wastewater dom a combination of protein like fluorescence detection using hpsec with hpsec ond or analyses of don at the molecular level are recommended for a more accurate prediction of na precursor concentrations 3 2 3 the reduction of n dbp formation potential by biological treatment the reductions of n dbp formation from wastewater dom during chloramination by different biological treatment facilities were compared according to different treatment types complete nitrification and incomplete nitrification fig 6 the reductions of han formation in the biological treatment facilities ranged from 8 to 61 median 17 which were generally smaller than those of hnm and na formation the results might be attributed to the persistence and production of lignin like compounds during biological treatment wang et al 2021a which could serve as han precursors with the combination of nitrogen in monochloramine hua et al 2014 therefore it is no surprise to observe the insignificant correlations between the reduction of han formation and the removal of protein like substances i e protein f3 protein f4 and protein total r 0 36 0 17 and 0 15 respectively p 0 05 fig s4 moreover the difference in the reduction of han formation among different treatment types was insignificant p 0 05 suggesting that the removal of han precursors in wastewater dom by biological treatment was independent of nitrifying conditions oppositely a previous study reported that the han formation from chlorination of wastewater effluents was lower after biological processes with better nitrifying conditions krasner et al 2009b this could be due to the different reaction mechanisms in chlorination and chloramination as aldehydes also generate hans by reacting with chloramines do et al 2015 the reductions in hnm formation potential varied in the range of 53 88 the reductions by biological treatment processes with complete nitrification 37 88 excluding wwtp h were higher than those by biotreatment processes with incomplete nitrification 53 47 p 0 05 fig 6 the reduction of hnm formation was not correlated with the removal of protein f4 fraction r 0 46 p 0 05 fig s4 nonetheless the biological treatment facilities that had higher removal of the low molecular size protein like substance indicated by protein f4 tended to perform better in reducing hnm formation fig 3b except that the hnm formation reduction by the a a o processes in wwtps h and d deviated from the corresponding protein f4 removal the deviation might be attributed to the effect of no2 on hnm formation it should be noted that besides amines aromatics can also be transformed to hnm via nitration followed by ring cleavage in the presence of no2 shah and mitch 2012 because no2 can be oxidized into nitrating agents e g nitrogen tetroxide by monochloramine margerum et al 1994 in the influent samples of wwtps h and d i e samples h1 and d1 amines in wastewater dom were the predominant precursors of hnm during chloramination as no2 concentration was below the detection limit 0 01 mg n l 1 table s2 shah and mitch 2012 in the chloraminated effluent samples of wwtps h and d i e samples h2 and d2 both amines and aromatics could contribute to hnm formation due to the presence of no2 0 07 and 0 11 mg n l 1 respectively table s2 resulting in the relatively small reductions of hnm formation in the two wwtps the reductions of na and tono formation by biological treatment processes with complete nitrification 63 92 and 49 88 respectively excluding wwtp e were significantly higher than those by biotreatment processes with incomplete nitrification 5 48 and 18 45 respectively p 0 01 and the reductions tended to be more prominent in those processes with more complete nitrification fig 6 the results could be attributed to the higher removal of low molecular size protein like substances indicated by protein f4 in biological treatment processes with more complete nitrification fig 3b the strong relationship between the reduction of na and tono formation and the removal of protein f4 fraction was validated by the results of pearson correlation analysis r 0 78 and 0 72 respectively p 0 05 fig s4 indicating that the reduction of na formation by biological treatment might be mainly dependent on the removal of low molecular size protein like substances in wastewater dom noted that the relatively small reductions of na and tono formation in wwtp e 39 and 1 respectively were excluded from the t test as the biological treatment tank of the cast also served as the sedimentation tank and the na and tono formation from efom was affected by the addition of polyacrylamide as a coagulant during sedimentation park et al 2009 the reductions of n dbp formation from wastewater dom by biological treatment were also calculated on a toxicity weighted basis and compared based on the types of biological treatment fig s5 the overall changes of toxicity weighted n dbp formation were mainly attributed to the reduction of toxicity weighted na formation by biological treatment fig s5a consequently the decreases in the sum of toxicity weighted n dbp formation in biological treatment processes with complete nitrification 37 78 were larger than those in biological treatment processes with incomplete nitrification 10 41 fig s5b due to the larger reductions of na formation by biological treatment processes with more complete nitrification fig 6 the results demonstrated that in the practices of biological wastewater treatment the removal of low molecular size protein like substances as well as hnm and na precursors was dependent on the performance of nitrification processes controlling the operational parameters for example prolonging srt decreasing internal recycling ratio and improving aeration condition to achieve complete nitrification could effectively reduce the hnm and na formation in post chloramination partial nitrification processes that are applied for higher tn removal might lead to relatively low removal of low molecular size protein like substances in biotreatment and thus discourage the removal of hnm and na precursors besides the reduction of hnm formation could be inhibited by no2 produced from the incomplete nitrification in biological treatment the weak association between the removal of han precursors and nitrifying conditions indicated the nonnegligible role of other organics besides amines e g lignins aldehydes and don in biopolymers and humic substances in wastewater dom as han precursors in post chloramination considering that hans are the primary forcing agents in the dbp associated toxicity of disinfected water wei et al 2020 further investigation on indicators of han precursors e g don fractions characterized using hpsec ond or analyzed at the molecular level for better control of han formation is recommended in the future studies 4 conclusions this study has characterized the changes of wastewater dom during biological treatment and probed the formation potential of n dbps comparisons were conducted among nine biological treatment facilities with different nitrifying conditions in eight wwtps biological treatment processes could selectively remove high molecular size and upper intermediate molecular size dom 3 kda as well as low molecular size doc aromatics and protein like substances 0 3 kda the removal of these low molecular size moieties and hnm and na precursors upon biological treatment processes depended on the nitrifying conditions complete nitrification played a key role in removing hnm and na precursors which was significantly correlated with the removal of low molecular size protein like substances incomplete nitrification tended to have adverse effects on the removal of low molecular size protein like substances as well as the removal of hnm and na precursors on the other hand han precursors were relatively recalcitrant to biological treatment and their removal was independent of the nitrifying conditions compared to the overall protein like fluorescence the low molecular size protein like fluorescence 0 3 kda can better reflect the concentrations of hnm and na precursors in wastewater dom suggesting the important contributions of low molecular size protein like substances and amino acids to hnm and na precursors therefore the abundance of low molecular size protein like substances determined by hpsec analysis may be a promising reference to estimate the

always employed as the final barrier in wastewater treatment to control the spread of pathogenic organisms and viruses and to reduce public health risks li et al 2021 zhong et al 2019 chlorination is so far the most widely used process for wastewater disinfection for the non nitrified secondary wastewater effluent chloramines are usually formed from the transformation of chlorine by ammonia leading to chloramination schreiber and mitch 2006 the reactions between chlor am ine and dissolved organic matter dom in secondary effluent generate disinfection byproducts dbps including

trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas plewa et al 2002 richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 n dbps thus are compounds of interest especially during chloramination because chloramines

higher formation of hans and nas than the hydrophobic and transphilic ones fang et al 2021 wang et al 2013 while the hydrophobic fractions contribute more to hnm formation during chlor am ination than

molecular size distribution and has higher concentrations of don i e 0 7 1 9 mg n l 1 in efom vs a median value of 0 3 mg n l 1 in nom chow et al 2008 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 liu et al 2012 westerhoff and mash 2002 the microbial derived don in efom is enriched in amines peptides and amino acids leenheer et al 2007 which can be transformed into n dbps during chlor am ination choe et al 2021 shao et al 2020 due to the different properties the yields of n dbps from reclaimed water are anticipated to be higher than those from surface water in cases of wastewater reuse in addition efom is an important source of n dbp precursors in drinking water supplies impacted by wastewater discharges bond et al 2011 therefore n dbp formation from efom has recently gained more and more attention efom comprises the degradation products of influent substrates and soluble microbial products smp barker and stuckey 1999 which are produced from the microbe mediated reactions during biological treatment wang et al 2021a unlike other wastewater treatment processes e g primary clarification coagulation and sand filtration during which the dom transformation is relatively subtle dom

treatment processes with different operational conditions the alteration of doc don values the biodegradation of influent substrate and smp generation are different barker and stuckey 1999 liu et al 2012 michael kordatou et al 2015 therefore the efom properties and the formation of n dbps in post chlor am ination can be impacted by operational conditions and vary with biological treatment processes the changes in dom properties during biological wastewater treatment and the effects of temperature on them have been studied based on both molecular size distribution and fluorescence components komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 nonetheless the changes were not compared among various biotreatment processes with different operational conditions previous studies have found that efom from biological treatment processes with different nitrifying conditions show different han and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation during chlor am ination krasner et al 2009b mamo et al 2016 however the relationship between the variation of n dbp formation and the dom transformation in different biological treatment processes e g processes with different nitrifying conditions remains largely unknown the objectives of this study are to characterize the changes of dom during biological wastewater treatment with different nitrifying conditions and to probe the formation of n dbps from wastewater dom firstly the influent and effluent of biological treatment facilities from eight wastewater treatment plants wwtps were collected the properties of dom were characterized and the changes of dom properties were compared secondly the formation of n dbps i e hans hnms and nas from wastewater dom during chloramination was evaluated and correlated with dom properties total n nitrosamine tono as a parameter to reflect the total concentrations of n nitrosamines was also measured thirdly the changes of n dbp formation in different types of biological treatment were compared the results of this study offer insights into the transformation of n dbp precursors in different biological treatments and provide information for the better prediction and control of n dbp

the t test and pearson correlation analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of dom in wastewater and before and after biological treatment 3 1 1 characteristics of dom in wastewater the properties of dom in the influent a1 h1 and effluent a2 h2 and h3 samples of the biological treatment facilities are presented in table 1 the doc concentrations of influent and effluent samples were in the range of 9 5 28 1 and 5 5 11 9 mg c l 1 respectively the suva values of the influent 0 9 2 6 l mg 1 m 1 and effluent samples 0 7 1 2 l mg 1 m 1 were lower than those of natural water 1 3 4 9 l mg 1 m 1 rosario ortiz et al 2007 which is consistent with the low hydrophobicity of wastewater dom reported in a previous study jarusutthirak and amy 2007 the ratio of don to doc in influent and effluent of the biological treatment facilities was 0 07 0 51 and 0 09 0 35 mg n mg c 1 except for those not available respectively which were generally higher than those of natural water 0 03 mg n mg c 1 mash et al 2004 the results confirm that dom in wastewater comprised more nitrogen containing substances e g proteins than nom in surface water nam and amy 2008 the mw distribution of doc and specific components i e aromatic humic like fulvic humic like and protein like substances of dom was evaluated from the corresponding hpsec chromatograms and fig 1 presents influent and effluent of biological treatment in wwtp a as examples four fractions were artificially defined which included f1 30 kda f2 3 30 kda f3 0 3 3 kda and f4 0 3 kda in both the influent and effluent more than 70 of doc was distributed in f3 and f4 figs 1a and s3a the f3 and f4 fractions were enriched with aromatic humic like fulvic humic like and protein like substances as indicated by the uv absorbance and fluorescence signals fig 1b e which contributed over 80 to the total uva254 and the corresponding fluorescence of wastewater fig s3b e unlike nom in drinking water sources e g river and lake that comprises most fractions within intermediate molecular size 0 3 30 kda fabris et al 2008 nam and amy 2008 dom in wastewater has a more wide spread mw distribution in terms of both doc and specific component detections for example the doc fraction in f1 30 kda contributed to 2 23 median of 9 except for those not detected in samples a2 c2 and h3 of the total doc of wastewater dom fig s3a moreover a shoulder pinnacle in f4 0 3 kda was always detected in wastewater dom by uva254 and fluorescence detections fig 1b e these fractions in wastewater dom with either large or low molecular size were also reported in previous studies komatsu et al 2020 nam and amy 2008 which might be derived from other sources e g anthropogenic and microbial sources besides terrestrial sources 3 1 2 changes of dom characteristics in wastewater by biological treatment the removal percentages of the total abundance and specific mw fractions in wastewater dom by biological treatment were calculated using the area of peaks in the corresponding fraction fig 2 the amount of the overall doc and protein like substances in wastewater significantly decreased after biological treatments in 8 wwtps p 0 05 median removal 30 fig 2a and e nevertheless the overall fulvic humic like and humic like substances in wastewater were relatively recalcitrant to biological treatment median removal 10 fig 2c and d as their biodegradability is generally lower than that of protein like substances komatsu et al 2020 the removal of specific dom fractions by biological treatment varied with molecular size and species most dom distributing in f1 and f2 was effectively removed by biological treatment median removal 80 fig 2 the doc aromatics and protein like substances in f4 were removed by 6 55 13 41 and 15 58 respectively during biological treatment fig 2a b and e on the other hand the doc aromatics and protein like substances in f3 as well as the fulvic humic like and humic like substances in f3 and f4 were generally more recalcitrant to biological treatment than other components median removal 21 the low and negative removal 36 33 of the lower intermediate molecular size fluorescent components 0 3 3 kda could be attributed to the degradation and diversification of the liable high molecular size dom by microbes resulting in the production of lignin polyphenol analogs and nitrogen containing molecules komatsu et al 2020 wang et al 2021a in addition the microbial transformation of protein like substances in smp to humic and fulvic like substances was suggested in a previous study maqbool et al 2017 which might also contribute to the low and negative removal of humic and fulvic humic like fluorescence the results indicated that biological treatment processes could selectively remove the high molecular size and upper intermediate molecular size dom 3 kda as well as the low molecular size 0 3 kda doc aromatics and protein like substances while the fulvic humic like and humic like substances with mw lower than 3 kda were bio refractory based on the concentrations of nh4 and no2 in the influent and effluent samples table s2 the biological treatment processes in wwtp a h were classified into two types according to the different nitrifying conditions which are complete nitrification and incomplete nitrification details of classification are provided in text s5 and table s2 liao et al 2022 the removal of dom and its fractions by biological treatment were compared among treatment processes with different nitrifying conditions fig 3 there was no significant difference among biological treatment processes under different nitrifying conditions in reducing the overall doc uva254 and humic and fulvic humic like fluorescence of wastewater dom p 0 05 fig 3a on the other hand the removal of total protein like substances in the biological treatment processes with complete nitrification was significantly higher than those with incomplete nitrification p 0 05 and the removal percentages generally increased as nitrifying conditions became greater fig 3a in the previous characterization of wastewater dom the removal of the protein like components in a o and a a o processes was mainly attributed to the aerobic process cheng et al 2018 where the nitrification of wastewater takes place the higher removal of protein like substances by biological treatment processes with complete nitrification might thus be caused by the greater extent of nitrification which indicates stronger activities of nitrifying bacteria in the aerobic process kim et al 2011 interestingly the reduction of uva254 and protein like fluorescence of low molecular size dom 0 3 kda in biological treatment was also nitrification dependent fig 3b low molecular size dom with high uva254 indicated low molecular size amino acids and simple sugars jarusutthirak and amy 2007 these molecules along with low molecular size protein like substances were reported to be the primary molecules removed in the a a o and a o processes and the removal was related to microbe mediated activities wang et al 2021a moreover biological treatment with low dissolved oxygen conditions 0 3 mgo2 l 1 was also reported to produce molecules with high protein amino sugar like characteristics liao et al 2022 the results suggested that complete nitrification during biological treatment may favor the removal of protein like substances especially for those with low molecular size 3 2 n dbp formation from wastewater dom and relationship with dom characteristics 3 2 1 formation of hans hnms nas and tono from wastewater dom the formation of n dbps from the dom in wastewater samples was investigated by conducting formation potential tests using monochloramine as shown in fig 4 a the formation of hans was in the range of 57 1 172 7 nmol l 1 and 55 1 100 3 nmol l 1 after the chloramination of influent and effluent samples respectively which was dominated by dcan formation with the br concentrations ranging from 22 to 62 Î¼g l 1 in the wastewater samples except for 196 Î¼g l 1 in sample b1 the formation of the brominated species bcan and dban was detected at low concentrations 1 4 6 1 nmol l 1 except for 16 1 nmol l 1 in sample b1 accounting for 2 6 of the total han formation tcnm was the dominant hnm specie identified and hnm concentrations formed from chloramination of the influent and effluent samples were in the range of 7 3 58 4 nmol l 1 and 4 5 11 1 nmol l 1 respectively fig 4b the concentrations of tono after chloramination ranged from 6 5 to 44 8 nmol l 1 in the influent samples and from 3 6 to 8 9 nmol l 1 in the effluent samples fig 4c the formation of the selected nas from chloramination contributed more than 50 of the corresponding tono formation within the range of 5 6 38 2 nmol l 1 and 2 9 6 6 nmol l 1 respectively in the chloraminated influent and effluent samples fig 4d ndma ndea and npyr were the predominant nas formed in the chloraminated wastewater samples 3 2 2 relationships between n dbp formation and dom properties n dbp formation during chloramination of dom in influent and effluent wastewater was compared through pearson correlation analysis with dom properties including doc uva254 and fluorescence characteristics of the whole dom and main mw fractions fig 5 as the bulk properties of wastewater dom the total doc and the doc of the low molecular size fraction 0 3 kda were strongly correlated with n dbp formation r 0 55 0 71 p 0 05 on the other hand the correlations of n dbp formation except for hnm formation to the uva254 fulvic humic like fluorescence and humic like fluorescence of the whole dom and main mw fractions were insignificant r 0 30 0 50 p 0 05 which suggested the small contribution of these fractions to han and na precursors in wastewater dom weak correlations were observed between han formation from wastewater dom and the fractions indicating protein like substances i e protein f3 protein f4 and protein total r 0 17 0 40 and 0 43 respectively p 0 05 being consistent with a previous study that dcan formation during chloramination was not correlated with the don of nom isolates lee et al 2007 this was probably because the nitrogen in hans can be incorporated both from monochloramine and from the nitrogenous moieties present in dom shah and mitch 2012 yang et al 2010 the weak correlations might also be attributed to the lack of the interpretation of don in biopolymers and humic substances in the protein like fluorescence detection don in biopolymers and humic substances analyzed using hpsec coupled with online nitrogen detection hpsec ond was reported to have a significant correlation with han formation from nom chlorination r 0 87 p 0 05 wang et al 2021b the formation of hnms from wastewater dom showed significant correlations with the abundance of the total and low molecular size protein like substances indicated by protein total and protein f4 r 0 79 and 0 81 respectively p 0 01 because the oxidation followed by halogenation of amine groups is one of the formation pathways of hnms during chloramination shah and mitch 2012 additionally hnm formation was significantly correlated with low molecular size and total aromatics indicated by uva254 f4 and uva254 total r 0 75 and 0 71 respectively p 0 01 the strong correlation was expected because the shoulder pinnacle in uva254 f4 fraction in wastewater dom can be associated with low molecular size amino acids jarusutthirak and amy 2007 which reacted with monochloramine to produce hnm shah and mitch 2012 it should be noted that the correlations of hnm formation with protein f4 and uva254 f4 abundance r 0 81 and 0 75 respectively were slightly stronger than those with protein total and uva254 total abundance r 0 79 and 0 71 respectively fig 5 this might be attributed to the weak correlations between hnm formation and the abundance of the lower intermediate molecular size aromatics and protein like substances indicated by uva254 f3 and protein f3 r 0 35 and 0 44 respectively p 0 05 the results suggested the important contribution of low molecular size don 0 3 kda in wastewater dom to hnm formation during chloramination on the other hand hnm formation from nom chlorination was reported to have an insignificant correlation r 0 08 with don in biopolymers and humic substances analyzed via hpsec ond wang et al 2021b suggesting that hnm precursors might be better interpreted using protein like fluorescence detection the formation of nas and tono from wastewater dom also had significant positive correlations with the abundance of the total and low molecular size protein like substances indicated by protein total and protein f4 p 0 01 fig 5 the strong correlations were attributed to the close association of na precursors with the amines in protein like substances because the nucleophilic substitution followed by oxidation of secondary amines by monochloramine is an important formation pathway of nas shah and mitch 2012 ndma formation has been reported to be significantly associated with the bulk protein like fluorophore and proteins amino sugars like don in wastewater dom in the literature p 0 01 liao et al 2022 roccaro et al 2020 however the correlation of na and tono formation with the abundance of protein f3 fraction was insignificant r 0 09 and 0 14 respectively p 0 05 consequently the r of na and tono formation with the abundance of protein f4 fraction r 0 62 and 0 68 respectively were higher than those with the abundance of the total protein like substance r 0 58 and 0 64 respectively suggesting that low molecular size protein like substances in wastewater dom may act an important role in na formation from chloramination nonetheless both dom fractions with large mw 10 kda and small mw 1 kda were reported to be the primary contributors to ndma precursors in secondary effluent chen et al 2014 while the protein like fluorescence analysis failed to interpret large molecular size don due to its low protein like fluorescence fig 1e therefore although the analysis of low molecular size protein like substances using hpsec may help to estimate the concentrations of na precursors in wastewater dom a combination of protein like fluorescence detection using hpsec with hpsec ond or analyses of don at the molecular level are recommended for a more accurate prediction of na precursor concentrations 3 2 3 the reduction of n dbp formation potential by biological treatment the reductions of n dbp formation from wastewater dom during chloramination by different biological treatment facilities were compared according to different treatment types complete nitrification and incomplete nitrification fig 6 the reductions of han formation in the biological treatment facilities ranged from 8 to 61 median 17 which were generally smaller than those of hnm and na formation the results might be attributed to the persistence and production of lignin like compounds during biological treatment wang et al 2021a which could serve as han precursors with the combination of nitrogen in monochloramine hua et al 2014 therefore it is no surprise to observe the insignificant correlations between the reduction of han formation and the removal of protein like substances i e protein f3 protein f4 and protein total r 0 36 0 17 and 0 15 respectively p 0 05 fig s4 moreover the difference in the reduction of han formation among different treatment types was insignificant p 0 05 suggesting that the removal of han precursors in wastewater dom by biological treatment was independent of nitrifying conditions oppositely a previous study reported that the han formation from chlorination of wastewater effluents was lower after biological processes with better nitrifying conditions krasner et al 2009b this could be due to the different reaction mechanisms in chlorination and chloramination as aldehydes also generate hans by reacting with chloramines do et al 2015 the reductions in hnm formation potential varied in the range of 53 88 the reductions by biological treatment processes with complete nitrification 37 88 excluding wwtp h were higher than those by biotreatment processes with incomplete nitrification 53 47 p 0 05 fig 6 the reduction of hnm formation was not correlated with the removal of protein f4 fraction r 0 46 p 0 05 fig s4 nonetheless the biological treatment facilities that had higher removal of the low molecular size protein like substance indicated by protein f4 tended to perform better in reducing hnm formation fig 3b except that the hnm formation reduction by the a a o processes in wwtps h and d deviated from the corresponding protein f4 removal the deviation might be attributed to the effect of no2 on hnm formation it should be noted that besides amines aromatics can also be transformed to hnm via nitration followed by ring cleavage in the presence of no2 shah and mitch 2012 because no2 can be oxidized into nitrating agents e g nitrogen tetroxide by monochloramine margerum et al 1994 in the influent samples of wwtps h and d i e samples h1 and d1 amines in wastewater dom were the predominant precursors of hnm during chloramination as no2 concentration was below the detection limit 0 01 mg n l 1 table s2 shah and mitch 2012 in the chloraminated effluent samples of wwtps h and d i e samples h2 and d2 both amines and aromatics could contribute to hnm formation due to the presence of no2 0 07 and 0 11 mg n l 1 respectively table s2 resulting in the relatively small reductions of hnm formation in the two wwtps the reductions of na and tono formation by biological treatment processes with complete nitrification 63 92 and 49 88 respectively excluding wwtp e were significantly higher than those by biotreatment processes with incomplete nitrification 5 48 and 18 45 respectively p 0 01 and the reductions tended to be more prominent in those processes with more complete nitrification fig 6 the results could be attributed to the higher removal of low molecular size protein like substances indicated by protein f4 in biological treatment processes with more complete nitrification fig 3b the strong relationship between the reduction of na and tono formation and the removal of protein f4 fraction was validated by the results of pearson correlation analysis r 0 78 and 0 72 respectively p 0 05 fig s4 indicating that the reduction of na formation by biological treatment might be mainly dependent on the removal of low molecular size protein like substances in wastewater dom noted that the relatively small reductions of na and tono formation in wwtp e 39 and 1 respectively were excluded from the t test as the biological treatment tank of the cast also served as the sedimentation tank and the na and tono formation from efom was affected by the addition of polyacrylamide as a coagulant during sedimentation park et al 2009 the reductions of n dbp formation from wastewater dom by biological treatment were also calculated on a toxicity weighted basis and compared based on the types of biological treatment fig s5 the overall changes of toxicity weighted n dbp formation were mainly attributed to the reduction of toxicity weighted na formation by biological treatment fig s5a consequently the decreases in the sum of toxicity weighted n dbp formation in biological treatment processes with complete nitrification 37 78 were larger than those in biological treatment processes with incomplete nitrification 10 41 fig s5b due to the larger reductions of na formation by biological treatment processes with more complete nitrification fig 6 the results demonstrated that in the practices of biological wastewater treatment the removal of low molecular size protein like substances as well as hnm and na precursors was dependent on the performance of nitrification processes controlling the operational parameters for example prolonging srt decreasing internal recycling ratio and improving aeration condition to achieve complete nitrification could effectively reduce the hnm and na formation in post chloramination partial nitrification processes that are applied for higher tn removal might lead to relatively low removal of low molecular size protein like substances in biotreatment and thus discourage the removal of hnm and na precursors besides the reduction of hnm formation could be inhibited by no2 produced from the incomplete nitrification in biological treatment the weak association between the removal of han precursors and nitrifying conditions indicated the nonnegligible role of other organics besides amines e g lignins aldehydes and don in biopolymers and humic substances in wastewater dom as han precursors in post chloramination considering that hans are the primary forcing agents in the dbp associated toxicity of disinfected water wei et al 2020 further investigation on indicators of han precursors e g don fractions characterized using hpsec ond or analyzed at the molecular level for better control of han formation is recommended in the future studies 4 conclusions this study has characterized the changes of wastewater dom during biological treatment and probed the formation potential of n dbps comparisons were conducted among nine biological treatment facilities with different nitrifying conditions in eight wwtps biological treatment processes could selectively remove high molecular size and upper intermediate molecular size dom 3 kda as well as low molecular size doc aromatics and protein like substances 0 3 kda the removal of these low molecular size moieties and hnm and na precursors upon biological treatment processes depended on the nitrifying conditions complete nitrification played a key role in removing hnm and na precursors which was significantly correlated with the removal of low molecular size protein like substances incomplete nitrification tended to have adverse effects on the removal of low molecular size protein like substances as well as the removal of hnm and na precursors on the other hand han precursors were relatively recalcitrant to biological treatment and their removal was independent of the nitrifying conditions compared to the overall protein like fluorescence the low molecular size protein like fluorescence 0 3 kda can better reflect the concentrations of hnm and na precursors in wastewater dom suggesting the important contributions of low molecular size protein like substances and amino acids to hnm and na precursors therefore the abundance of low molecular size protein like substances determined by hpsec analysis may be a promising reference to estimate the concentrations of na and hnm precursors and their removal upon biological wastewater treatment associated content supplementary data associated with this article are available in the online version
