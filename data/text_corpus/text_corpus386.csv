1930,precipitation occurs in the form of discrete events and the event characteristics event duration depth peak intensity start end time significantly influence the hydrologic response of a basin despite this importance event based performance of satellite precipitation products has still not been fully investigated to assess limitations in the retrieval algorithms guide future improvements and inform hydrologic applications in this study we evaluate the precipitation event performance of the gpm imerg product using as reference the high resolution ground gauge radar dataset gv mrms in the continental united states conus at the native imerg resolution 0 1 0 1 0 5 h with a primary focus on the detectability and timing of events our results show that imerg generally overestimates the event duration but underestimates the mean event precipitation intensity in the summer while the opposite is true for winter this discrepancy is mostly attributed to the under representation of short duration intense events in the summer and long duration moderate events in the winter in imerg in terms of the detection of individual events about 50 of the reference events are properly detected by imerg and conversely 50 of imerg events do not match a reference event however nearly 40 of the missed or false events result from temporal mismatching of less than 3 h between the retrieved and the reference event the remaining 60 comes from imerg not detecting an existing event or inventing a nonexistent event when imerg successfully detects an event the average temporal overlap with the reference event is about 70 of its total duration which mostly stems from the mistiming of imerg derived events imerg events tend to start peak and end earlier than gv mrms events with national mean shifts of 26 min 17 min and 7min respectively for about only 20 of all situations the starting time of the event is correctly reproduced by imerg and the same applies to the peak time and end time our results provide guidance for applications of imerg at sub daily scales as well as new insights for the improvement of satellite retrieval algorithms keywords precipitation satellite precipitation

global variability is essential to water resource management food security and ecological sustainability with important economic social and political implications hsiang et al 2013 kotz et al 2022 lobell et al 2011 siepielski et al 2017 sinha et al 2017 an important feature that makes precipitation different from most other environmental variables e g temperature soil moisture humidity is that it occurs discretely in space and time in the form of coherent and continuous objects which we call events haile et al 2011 hanel and maca 2014 lochbihler et al 2017 the occurrence and characteristics of precipitation events are directly linked to multi scale multi type dynamic thermodynamic and microphysical atmospheric processes berg et al 2013 lamjiri et al 2017 lochbihler et al 2017 wasko et al 2015 and depending on the characteristics of these events land surface processes like runoff infiltration and soil erosion are affected dunkerley 2017 dunkerley 2021 dunkerley 2019 guan et al 2016 therefore studying the properties of precipitation events is important for deepening our understanding of precipitation physics and accurately modeling precipitation driven processes high resolution multi satellite precipitation products have become indispensable in recent decades for providing quantitative precipitation estimates globally mccabe et al 2017 skofronick jackson et al 2017 consequently knowing how well they capture the characteristics of precipitation events is crucial to assess their reliability for hydrological applications and provide insight for future improvement of precipitation retrieval algorithms freitas et al 2020 tadesse and anagnostou 2009 however most published studies assess satellite precipitation products by lumping together all hourly or daily data and computing statistical indicators asong et al 2017 huang et al 2016 smith et al 2006 tang et al 2016 an approach that largely erases the crucial information in the properties of individual precipitation events li et al 2021 conversely the existing event based evaluations are still limited freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 maranan et al 2020 resulting in an insufficient understanding of the event related performance of satellite precipitation products a series of works by nikolopoulos et al 2013 mei et al 2014 and mei et al 2016 assessed the event based performance of satellite products at the basin scale in europe since they aimed to assess the satellites ability to simulate flood events they focused on basin average statistics more recently maranan et al 2020 compared imerg derived events with gauge derived events in africa concentrating on event duration differences to the authors knowledge freitas et al 2020 and li et al 2021 are the only evaluation studies that analyzed in detail not only event duration but also further event characteristics such as depth mean rate etc these studies still did not cover all the facets of precipitation events and many other aspects of satellite derived precipitation events remain to be investigated for example precipitation event characteristics are closely related to the type of precipitation systems which significantly varies among different seasons mao et al 2022 but the seasonal factor has not been analyzed in previous studies freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 additionally the potential timing errors in the start peak and end time of satellite derived events have not been investigated despite the fact that such inaccuracies can result in significant biases in flood event simulations dunkerley 2012 mei et al 2016 assessing event s timing in satellite products can also provide quantitative insight for improving retrieval algorithms guilloteau et al 2018 previous event based evaluations have used gauge observations freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 mei et al 2014 mei et al 2016 nikolopoulos et al 2013 as ground reference however the fundamental difference between point measurements by gauges and the area integrated satellite estimates makes the comparison between the two equivocal unless each satellite pixel is homogeneously covered by several gauges which is rarely the case in contrast the sampling geometry of ground based weather radars is more consistent with that of satellite estimates making radars generally more suitable for the evaluation of satellite products provided that the radars are properly calibrated and bias corrected with gauge data in this study we present an event based evaluation of the state of the art integrated multisatellite retrieval for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg product over the continental united states conus using as reference the ground validation multi radar multi sensor gv mrms product which combines ground radar and gauge measurements we focus on assessing the performance of imerg in retrieving the following three progressive event attributes 1 the spatial variability and statistical distribution of event characteristics depth duration mean event precipitation rate peak intensity etc 2 the detection rate and false detection rate of precipitation events and 3 the timing start peak and end time of the detected events thanks to the dense ground radar network in the u s this study is not only the first systematic event based evaluation in the u s but also the first event based evaluation with the ground radar based data as reference our analysis reveals seasonal and regional differences in the performance of imerg and points out to systematic biases that could be addressed in future algorithm developments 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 imerg precipitation dataset imerg is the level 3 research quality gridded global multi satellite merged precipitation product developed by the u s gpm team hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2020 the version we use is imerg v06b final run at a resolution of 0 1 30 min huffman et al 2019b the v06 of imerg is available both in the trmm era june 2000 may 2014 and the gpm era june 2014 present imerg integrates multiple sensor sources including all available passive microwave pmw sensors in the gpm constellation of low earth orbit satellites and infrared ir sensors on geostationary orbits among them all pmw estimates are globally calibrated against the combined radar radiometer algorithm corra product which relies on the combined measurements of the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and the gpm microwave radiometer gmi both onboard the gpm core observatory all ir estimates are then calibrated by the pmw sensors huffman et al 2020 such intercalibrations efficiently enforce the uniformity of the multi source merged imerg product across space and time for constructing continuous gridded estimates the calibrated pmw estimates and the ir estimates produced by persiann ccs precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system are interpolated using a quasi lagrangian time interpolation scheme similar to that of the climate prediction center cpc morphing kalman filter cmorph kf algorithm huffman et al 2019a finally the gridded estimates are calibrated by the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc gauge monthly analysis imerg is among the most accurate state of the art high resolution satellite precipitation datasets guilloteau et al 2021 pradhan et al 2022 tang et al 2020 and has been used in a wide range of applications orland et al 2022 yin et al 2022 zhang and wang 2023 2 1 2 gv mrms gauge radar data the high quality mrms quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is used here as the ground reference dataset it integrates precipitation observations from 180 weather surveillance radar 88 doppler wsr 88d and canadian c band radar data and approximately 7 000 hourly rain gauges and also incorporates model analyses as ancillary data zhang et al 2016 based on mrms the further quality controlled and adjusted gv mrms product forms a standardized reference for gpm ground validation kirstetter et al 2014 kirstetter et al 2012 kirstetter et al 2018 the gridded gv mrms qpe used in this study matches the imerg resolution of 0 1 and 30 minutes and a spatial domain from 20 to 55 n and 60 to 130 w a radar quality index rqi 0 100 which accounts for the distance to the radar beam blockage and environmental parameters such as the altitude of the freezing level is applied to filter out lower quality estimates rqi less than 60 petersen et al 2020 the gridboxes with an average rqi less than 60 during the study period were entirely eliminated from our analyses the study period is 2018 2020 2 2 methods 2 2 1 precipitation event definition in this study the definition of a precipitation event is based on an eulerian approach that is at each pixel in space events are defined as continuous periods of half hourly rain rates of no less than 0 1 mm h li et al 2021 this simple definition allows an easy to implement analysis as compared with the lagrangian approach which requires tracking the space time evolution of precipitation features that can reveal important information relevant to the hydrologic response of a basin ignaccolo and de michele 2010 moreover the revealed biases in the retrieval could be more directly linked to the local surface type climate zone and latitude which could be helpful in attributing errors and improving retrieval algorithms 2 2 2 event properties following li et al 2021 for each event we depict a set of event properties namely event duration t h event depth d mm and mean event precipitation rate r mm h relative peak position p and peak to mean intensity ratio o specifically p is the relative position of the peak time of an event which is expressed as see li et al 2021 for details 1 p t p 0 5 t 0 5 where t p h is the time to peak note that here 0 5 replaces 1 in the accordant formula in li et al 2021 considering the temporal resolution of 0 5 h used in this study o is the ratio of peak precipitation rate r p mm h to the mean event precipitation rate r 2 o r p r in this work we analyze the number of events n events year or events season and the statistical distributions of the above mentioned event properties and their spatial and seasonal variability as compared between gv mrms and imerg 2 2 3 event detectability even if imerg has the same number of events with gv mrms it would not be guaranteed that every imerg derived event temporally matches with a reference event to assess this we introduce the metrics of event detectability which describe the hit false and miss events based on the temporal overlap or non overlap and eventually on the temporal delays between the events across the two datasets we classify all the events into three categories which are diagramed in fig 1 the first category is the hit event which represents an event in a dataset that overlaps with at least one time step here 0 5 h with an event in the other dataset this situation indicates that imerg successfully detects a reference event and the overlapped events in gv mrms and imerg are named as hit mrms event and hit imerg event respectively the second category is the mismatched event which is defined as an event in a dataset that does not overlap with any event in the other dataset but there is at least one event in the other dataset occurring within 3 h of its start or end time this situation indicates that imerg actually senses the existence of an event but narrowly misses it and the two adjacent but non overlapping events in gv mrms and imerg are termed as miss mismatched event and false mismatched event respectively the third category is the isolated event which represents an event in a dataset that does not overlap with any event in the other dataset and there is also no event in the other dataset occurring within 3 h of its start or end time this situation indicates that imerg is completely unaware of the existence of an event or makes up an utterly nonexistent event accordingly such events are named respectively as miss isolated events and false isolated events the 3 hour threshold is chosen because we consider that timing errors due in particular to the vertical variability of the precipitation process and to the dynamical interpolation based on motion vectors in imerg are unlikely to be more than 3 h in magnitude guilloteau et al 2018 utsumi et al 2019 you et al 2019 we apply the traditional detectability error metrics namely probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far to the event detectability of the satellite product ebert et al 2007 and define event probability of detection epod and event false alarm ratio efar specifically 3 e p o d n h m n h m n m m n m i 4 e f a r n f m n f i n h i n f m n f i where n h m n m m and n m i are the number of hit mrms miss mismatched and miss isolated events from gv mrms respectively and n h i n f m and n f i are the numbers of hit imerg false mismatched and false isolated events from imerg respectively 2 2 4 timing of the detected events moreover even if imerg correctly detects an event present in the gv mrms dataset this pair of hit events is still likely not to match perfectly in terms of the starting time ending time and peak intensity time to assess this we take the hit mrms events as the reference and investigate the start time shift d t s peak time shift d t p and end time shift d t e of the corresponding hit imerg events 3 results 3 1 event properties we analyze the statistical distribution of event properties in each pixel for gv mrms and imerg fig 2 shows maps of the number of events per year along with maps of the mean value for each one of the event properties to reduce sampling noise the metrics are exhibited as the average values over 1 1 gridboxes from this map regional differences in the event properties between imerg and gv mrms are salient in terms of the number of events event depth and peak mean ratio a spatial consistency between gv mrms and imerg is observed with cross correlation coefficients of 0 88 0 93 and 0 87 respectively figs 2a1 2 d1 2 and f1 2 although there are still biases in their quantitative values fig 2a3 d3 and f3 for example imerg overestimates the number of events in most regions of conus where the mean event duration revealed by gv mrms is also relatively high fig 2a3 and b1 this may be due to imerg intermittently missing precipitation during the events which causes long duration events to be split into several parts the exception is over the rocky mountains where the lower number of events in imerg as compared to gv mrms might be related to the documented low detection rate of satellites for orography induced rainfall and over arid semiarid areas with hot background surfaces derin and kirstetter 2022 derin and yilmaz 2014 dinku et al 2010 maggioni et al 2016 in contrast to the duration the mean event depth showed a nationwide underestimation by imerg fig 2d3 which might also be owing to the event split mentioned above considering that the average event depth multiplied by the number of events in a year is the total annual precipitation which is constrained by the gpcc annual values huffman et al 2019a an overestimated number of events is almost certainly accompanied by an underestimated event depth as a compensation the spatial distribution of the mean event duration of imerg is significantly different compared to that of gv mrms fig 2b1 3 for gv mrms events last longer in all the midwest and the northeast u s but are shorter in the rocky mountain gulf coast and florida fig 2b1 while the duration of imerg derived events inversely increases from the north to the south fig 2b2 attributing a cause to such a difference in the patterns is not easy when simply examining these two distribution maps we note however that the bias shows an evident regularity with an apparent meridional gradient pattern from negative in the north to positive in the south fig 2b3 this pattern might be related to the gradually reduced frequency of pmw overpasses as the latitude decreases eventually leading to the increased influence of the morphing scheme in imerg tan et al 2021 which tends to increase the event duration ayat et al 2021 for the relative peak position the peaks of the reference events are skewed to the early part of the event and have a clearer regional variation than imerg derived events while the relative peak position of the imerg derived events is closer to the event center with less regional differences fig 2e1 2 such bias may arise from the interpolation procedures in imerg that weaken the asymmetry li et al 2021 for the mean event precipitation rate imerg generally reproduces the spatial pattern shown by gv mrms with higher values in the southeast u s compared to other regions however such contrast between different regions is not as strong as that in gv mrms fig 2d1 2 leading to a clearly underestimated mean event precipitation rate in the southeast u s fig 2d3 since the mean event precipitation rate is the result of event depth divided by event duration such a pattern is explainable considering the overestimated duration and underestimated depth in the south u s fig 2b3 as a result imerg tends to have more long duration light to moderate events in the south u s more short duration heavy events in the northeast u s rocky mountain and west coast but more short duration light to moderate events in the great plain since different types of precipitation systems dominate in different seasons further analysis by season is necessary for bias attribution fig 3 and fig s1 for example the overestimation of event duration is most severe in winter when the long duration frontal precipitation dominates fig 3b4 and fig s1b7 during the cold season the interpretation of the passive microwave signal is more ambiguous as frozen or snow covered land surfaces can have spectral signatures similar to those of ice clouds ferraro et al 1998 to counterbalance this during the cold season the imerg algorithm relies more on the ir information huffman et al 2020 which is generally less accurate in terms of precipitation detection derin et al 2021 tan et al 2016 such deficiency tends to split the long lasting events causing the overestimated number of events but underestimated duration fig 3 a4 and b4 the missed precipitation which is more likely to occur for low intensity precipitation further elevates the mean event precipitation rate fig 3d4 in contrast the short duration but still overestimated number of events in the summer indicates the existence of false events in imerg fig 3a2 fig s1b3 such phenomenon could also be owing to the fact that the deep convective precipitation predominant in the summer is reasonably well detected by passive space borne instruments chen et al 2011 young et al 2014 exceptionally the more pronounced underestimation of the number of events around the rocky mountains relative to the annual counterpart fig 2a3 can presumably be attributed to the elevated air temperature favoring the generation of warm rain coupled uytwith the increased surface temperature neutralizing the cold signals of hydrometeors derin and kirstetter 2022 dinku et al 2010 maggioni et al 2016 indeed intermittent satellite observations missing the short duration precipitation prevalent in the summer could be another important contributor due to the interpolation procedures in imerg a pmw estimate usually with a high precipitation rate in the summer is likely to fill their adjacent dry gaps with non zero values thus prolonging the duration but consequently reducing the mean precipitation rate fig 3b2 d2 and s1d3 besides the relative peak position has a delaying bias not least in summer when afternoon convective precipitation dominates fig 3e2 and s2e3 this type of precipitation generally has an early peak since the evaporative cooling suppresses the surface heating shortly after the rainfall starts dunkerley 2021 but this feature fails to be reproduced by imerg due to the weakening of rainfall asymmetry induced by the interpolation procedures in the merging algorithms to go further than analyzing the mean values of the different event properties fig 4 depicts the joint distribution of the annual and seasonal total precipitation amount contributed by events with different durations and mean event precipitation rates from which we can see more detail about the event related performance of the satellites as shown imerg and gv mrms display dissimilar patterns at all times specifically the distributions for gv mrms are more dispersed while those for imerg are more concentrated around the diagonals fig 4a1 a5 and b1 b5 in other words imerg underestimates the occurrence of short duration high intensity events and long duration low intensity precipitation events but overestimates the occurrence of the medium duration moderate intensity events as compensation fig 4c1 c5 such bias is evident in the summer and winter fig 4a3 c3 and a5 c5 when brief strong thunderstorms and long lasting steady frontal precipitation are known to occur respectively as analyzed above the smoothing effect of the interpolation leads to imerg s underestimation of the occurrence of short duration heavy events while the ir only sources with high missing rates that frequently occur in late autumn winter and early spring make imerg hard to reflect long lasting events especially for the high impact short duration extreme events that might cause flash floods and debris flows their underrepresentation could largely affect the prediction or retrospective attribution of these natural hazards when employing the imerg data 3 2 event detectability after analyzing the difference in the mean event properties events from gv mrms and imerg are further matched in time to investigate whether imerg can successfully capture the reference events depicted by gv mrms as stated in the methods section events in gv mrms and imerg are classified into three categories hit events mismatched events and isolated events whose proportions are displayed by their durations fig 5 for the events with all durations the two datasets possess a similar composition with the hit events mismatched events and isolated events making up 49 20 and 31 in gv mrms and 45 19 and 36 in imerg the proportion of hit events in each dataset gradually increases with the lengthening of event duration from below 25 to above 95 such a phenomenon is understandable since a longer duration event has a higher chance of being overlapped with any other event in the other dataset we further apply the event probability of detection epod and event false alarm ratio efar to quantify imerg s detectability of precipitation events fig 6 overall imerg does not have a high level of detectability the mean epod equals 0 49 and efar equals 0 55 across the conus and at the annual time scale fig 6a1 and b1 which might be largely contributed by the misdetection of short lived events lasting 0 5 3 h as analyzed above fig 5 the epod and efar show differential spatial patterns compared to the bias of the annual and seasonal average number of events figs 62a and 3a1 a4 which indicates that the similarity in the number of events between imerg and gv mrms does not necessarily demonstrate imerg s good event detectability further bearing out the necessity of the comparison based on event matching for example although imerg derived events have a consistent overestimation in the number of events in both the northeast and southeast u s at the annual time scale fig 2a3 the southeast exhibits a relatively high epod and low efar while the opposite is true for the northeast fig 6a1 and b1 more missed and false events in the northeast at the same time cancel out each other and lead to a comparable performance in the number of events compared with that in the southeast additionally the summer exhibits the best detectability among all seasons with epod over 0 7 and efar below 0 3 in some regions fig 6a3 and b3 while the winter performs worst and the epod and efar could be below 0 2 and above 0 8 respectively fig 6a5 and b5 as analyzed above the miss isolated and false isolated events not only comprise a significant proportion of the bias but are also not easy to address in the retrieval thus worthy of further investigation fig 7 looks in more detail into the characteristics of these events involving the contributions to the total number of events total amount and total frequency as well as their mean duration and intensity overall the regions with severe miss or false isolated events are still in the western u s where arid semiarid and mountainous areas characterized by generally poor satellite performance dominate derin and kirstetter 2022 dinku et al 2010 maggioni et al 2016 the isolated events account for a large proportion of events both in gv mrms and imerg with their national mean values equaling 31 and 36 respectively fig 7a1 and a2 however their contributions to the total frequency are smaller 19 for gv mrms and 18 for imerg nationally fig 7b1 and b2 compared with the miss isolated events those false isolated events are marked by a larger number but shorter durations fig 7a1 a2 and d1 d2 although their contribution to the total amount during the study period is even less 7 for both gv mrms and imerg nationally than to the total frequency the percentages in the total amount could still exceed 20 in the mountain west areas fig 7c1 and c2 in terms of intensity the miss isolated events are comparatively high in the south u s but progressively decrease with higher latitude while the false isolated events are higher especially in the northeast and northwest u s the fundamental causes for these biases need to be further investigated for possible improvements in the retrieval algorithms 3 3 timing of the detected events even if imerg successfully detects a precipitation event it does not warrant that imerg can exactly reproduce the whole event in terms of its timing duration and depth that is the retrieved events may mistime the beginning and end preventing them from wholly matching the reference events fig 8 displays the matching percentage of the hit events from imerg and gv mrms in terms of duration and depth as a function of event duration results show that the pairs of hit events from the two datasets can only match about 70 of the total durations on average but the percentages can rise up to about 80 on average for the total depth due to the relatively small intensity of the unmatched rainy hours besides it is easily explainable that the matching percentage of the 0 5 h events always equals 100 and the values naturally drop with the longer duration for the brief events 3h however the percentages of gv mrms derived events keep decreasing e g from 70 to 60 for the matching percentages of event duration but those of imerg derived events inversely increase with longer duration e g from 60 to 80 for the matching percentages of event duration such a phenomenon indicates that the hit imerg events tend to have fewer false time steps but more miss time steps with increasing event duration this further implies imerg s more significant underestimation of the event duration for longer actual events these results are consistent with those revealed in figs 1 3 fig 9 further looks into the start peak and end time shifts of the hit imerg events compared with their corresponding hit mrms events in the form of the probability density functions pdfs from the graphs all three pdfs are negatively skewed which means that imerg tends to start peak and end all earlier than the reference events among the three event properties the time shift is most severe for the start time with an average of 0 44 h 26 min which is followed by peak time and end time with averages of 0 29 h 17 min and 0 12 h 7 min such a difference is also reflected in the cumulative probabilities with the contrast between the percent of total events with advances time shift 0 5 h and delays time shift 0 5 h at 57 versus 19 respectively for the start time but 44 versus 38 for the end time events with unbiased start peak and end times time shifts of 0 h only account for about 20 in each pdf and the chance of a 0 5 h shift even exceeds that of no shift for the peak and end times fig 9b and c such results further demonstrate the systematic time shifts of the imerg derived events fig 10 further examines the consistency of the revealed mistiming issue of imerg derived events over conus in the form of mean time shifts among the three properties start peak and end time the peak time shift is most consistent with an advanced shift among almost all the regions and seasons fig 10a2 e2 imerg derived events have advanced start times in most areas for spring summer and winter fig 10b1 d3 while the time shifts in the event ending time could be both positive and negative for the same periods fig 10b3 d3 such facts align with the more negatively skewed pdf for the start time than the end time fig 9a and c further indicating the satellites asymmetric performance during the events li et al 2021 however significantly different patterns are shown in the winter for both the start and end time shifts fig 10e1 and e3 while the moderate shifts displayed in the south u s are in agreement with those in the other seasons the north suffers from substantially delayed start times and advanced end times at the same time fig 10e1 and e3 the mean delays in the north in the winter could exceed 1 h while the advances could be even more severe and surpass 2 h which may well be due to the inaccurate ir sources in the retrieval process as discussed before next we further examine the time shifts of imerg when detecting the events of different durations as shown in fig 11 the curves of the start peak and end time shifts all exhibit smooth and monotonic variations with increasing duration which indicates the significant dependency of the mistiming on the event duration specifically imerg derived events tend to start earlier for short duration events but later for long duration events while they end later for short duration events but earlier for long duration events however the tipping point of the start time shift is 8h while that of the end time shift is 2h which suggests a negatively skewed tendency of the timing of imerg derived events in accordance with the results in fig 9 such patterns indicate that the causes of mistiming might involve both symmetric and asymmetric factors that contribute to the biases in the retrieval the curve of the peak time shifts further confirms this inference as its values keep being negative and decreasing with longer durations but the shape of the curve highly dovetails with that of the mean value of the start and end time shifts this means that the start and end time shifts of imerg derived events might be attributed to a symmetric extension or contraction centered around the event peak time as well as an overall systematic advance of the events the former might result from the inherent deficiencies of the data sources e g the lengthening effects of morphing sources and the high missing rate of ir sources which generally exert a comparable impact on the event start and end times tan et al 2021 the latter might be caused by a consistent time difference between the satellite receiving the ice scattering signal from the sky and the precipitation falling on the ground due to instrumental effects such as the incidence angle guilloteau et al 2018 the actual situation might be more complex also influenced by the different retrieval capabilities in response to the inherent asymmetry of the cloud physical properties during the storm evolution imaoka and nakamura 2012 4 discussion compared with the traditional evaluation methods of satellite precipitation products that treat precipitation values at each time step as independent and calculate the mean error statistics e g mean absolute error root mean square error amjad et al 2020 beck et al 2019 beck et al 2017 our study examines the inherent temporal information of precipitation that is properties of individual events the event based evaluation is expected to provide additional insight into the use of satellite products for hydrological applications and also lead to targeted improvements in the retrieval algorithms moreover in contrast to the previous few event based evaluations freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 we go one step further to investigate the mismatching and mistiming issues of satellite derived events in addition to the comparison of the mean event properties several insights are gained through these analyses as discussed below for example fig 11 shows an advanced start time and a slightly delayed peak time for the short duration events but a delayed start time and a more strongly delayed peak time for the longer duration events in imerg compared with those in gv mrms this indicates that the time from the start to the peak is overestimated in imerg for short duration events but underestimated for long duration events previous studies have found that an event with a later peak could generate substantially more runoff than an event with an earlier peak dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2017 mostly because the later peak events tend to wet the dry soil before the arrival of the most intense precipitation thus reducing infiltration and generating more surface runoff dunkerley 2021 therefore such systematic bias could influence the results of hydrological models when using imerg as the input wu et al 2012 wu et al 2014 added to that although the comparisons of the mean annual event properties calculated from the events of imerg and the reference data separately in this study and in a previous studies indicate a later relative peak position of the satellites fig 2e1 e3 li et al 2021 further results from matching the events from the two datasets show that the absolute peak times of imerg derived events tend to be earlier than the real events fig 9b this result highlights the importance of the one to one comparison between the gv mrms and imerg derived events which has not been performed before li et al 2021 in terms of intensity imerg underestimates the mean event precipitation rate of short intense events which is of high impact notably in the summer fig 4 an underestimated peak to mean ratio is simultaneously revealed for the summer short duration events figure s2e3 this characteristic could also influence the hydrological applications of imerg e g underestimating the surface influence of heavy flash events such findings could not be easily drawn from the traditional evaluations without considering the event based characteristics although our results show that the mean start and end time shifts are less than 0 5 h fig 9 the pdfs tell us that there are only 20 of the start and end times of the real events that are accurately reflected by imerg in comparison the time shifts with absolute values no less than 2 h could also account for over 20 which is nonnegligible for fine scale hydrological applications like flood predictions wu et al 2012 wu et al 2014 seasonal spatial distribution analysis further suggests that such bias could be worse in specific regions and seasons fig 10 moreover from the error perspective even if imerg duplicates an event profile identical to the real case but has an overall 1 h advance the intensities during the event could be biased in all time steps on top of that if a large proportion of events all have a small shift they could altogether contribute significantly to the total absolute error this is the case in our results where about 60 of the imerg derived events have an advanced start time fig 9a these findings imply that the mistiming issue of precipitation events detected in the satellite product should be given focused attention in future algorithm development as mentioned above although the lengthening effect of the interpolation procedures in the merging algorithm on event duration could contribute to the start and end time shifts they theoretically exert symmetric influences on both the start and end sides of the events therefore other reasons should be responsible for the generally advanced event time shifts of imerg for example the precipitation might fall on the ground tens of minutes after the ice scattering signal aloft is captured by the satellites guilloteau et al 2018 thus leading to the advanced timing of events the possible mislocation of precipitation systems caused by the uncorrected parallax shifts of pmw and geostationary sensors is likely to cause a skewing in the event timing as well li et al 2022 if these conjectures are further substantiated in future work the mistiming issue might be substantially mitigated by additional adjustment procedures moreover precipitating clouds could undergo substantial thermodynamical and microphysical changes in their lifetime which might give rise to different levels of fidelity in the course of events petkovic and kummerow 2017 future analysis should be made by combining the variation of cloud properties and environmental variables to further understand the asymmetric performance of satellite products during the events on the other hand the inhomogeneity of the sensor sources could bring about irregular event time shifts li et al 2018 which needs to be further investigated in future work in addition the bias of event duration shows significant latitude dependent values fig 3b1 which is suspected to be related to the data source composition in imerg that is also latitude dependent passive microwave algorithm team facility 2017 gebregiorgis et al 2017 to verify this conjuncture fig s4 compares the curves of zonal mean event duration bias and the morph source proportions as a function of latitude the basically monotonically increasing trend of the two curves as the latitude decreases as well as their high correlation coefficients 0 85 for all situations bears out their strong connection the polar orbit and low orbit satellites revolve around the earth with the same swath width at different latitudes this always leads to the undersampling of high quality pmw observations at low latitudes passive microwave algorithm team facility 2017 complementarily as shown the proportion of the morph sources increases to fill the gap spanning from 45 to 75 across conus fig s4a the pmw sources are suggested to miss light precipitation likely to occur both near the beginning and end of the events thus shortening the event duration ayat et al 2021 as the replacement of pmw in the ice snow surfaces ir sources with a high missing rate could exert a more substantial shortening effect on the duration tan et al 2016 in contrast the morph data inversely tend to prolong the event duration due to the high chance of assigning non zero values to dry grids through the interpolation process li et al 2022 at the same time the lengthening and shortening of the duration could result in a decrease and increase of the mean event precipitation rate respectively which is also reflected in our results although the intensity bias is affected by more factors fig 2d3 and 2d1 d4 the underestimation of long moderate events at high latitudes but the underestimation of short intense events at low latitudes will be further propagated into hydrological models when using imerg as the inputs in sum the uneven sampling density of the polar and low orbits naturally exerts a region dependent bias which is distinguished from the regional differences stemming from different surface types or cloud regimes ferraro et al 2013 tan et al 2022 therefore efforts to improve and unify satellite retrieval capability under different climate conditions might never minimize the impact of pmw sensor sampling density that results in regional dependent bias a path forward is the improvement of geostationary precipitation estimates kirstetter et al 2012 upadhyaya et al 2022 also this fact further emphasizes that fundamental improvement for the multi satellite merged precipitation products will rely on increasing the spatial temporal coverage of high quality observations by adding more pmw sensors in the gpm constellation kidd et al 2021 although the ability of pmw sensors to detect light rain needs to be further improved in this study we define a precipitation event as a continuous temporal half hourly rainy 0 1 mm h series compared with the commonly used minimum interevent time mit criterion for event definition our definition is equivalent to mit 0 5 h because of the temporal resolution of our data 0 5 h due to the complexity of precipitation processes there is no unified and standard mit values for event definition since the event properties are apparently sensitive to the chosen mit it is necessary to know the robustness of the inferred satellite bias on the selection of mit therefore we have repeated our analysis using mit 3 h the main text is for mit 0 5 h and the results are shown in figures s5 and s6 although the details are unavoidably altered the main bias patterns remain similar these results also coincide with the previous event based evaluations where robust performance is found under different mit values freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 5 conclusions precipitation naturally occurs in the form of discrete events accurate depiction of precipitation events advances our understanding of the multi scale atmospheric dynamic processes and our assessment of the land surface hydrological response to precipitation while satellite precipitation products have been widely evaluated and applied since their inception knowledge about their performance in terms of reproducing precipitation event characteristics and timing remains insufficient in this study we use 3 year gv mrms data to conduct an event based evaluation of the imerg product over conus from three progressive levels 1 the spatial variability and statistical distribution of event characteristics depth duration mean event precipitation rate peak intensity etc 2 the detection rate and false detection rate of precipitation events and 3 the ability to accurately capture the timing start peak and end time of the detected events the main conclusions are as follows 1 the spatial distribution of the number of events event depth and peak to mean intensity ratio is well reproduced by imerg as inferred by comparison to gv mrms over conus however in terms of the spatial pattern of event duration mean event precipitation rate and relative peak position significant discrepancies are found between imerg and gv mrms the event duration bias shows a latitude dependent pattern from negative imerg underestimating mean event duration in the north to positive in the south imerg underestimates the occurrence frequency of short duration high intensity events especially in the summer but overestimates the occurrence frequency of long duration moderate intensity events especially in the winter 2 on average over conus only about 50 of the gv mrms events overlap for at least 30 min with an imerg event and vice versa which are defined as the hit events however nearly half of the missed and false events result from wrong timing of events mostly short events the other half corresponds to isolated missed or false events when imerg simply does not detect any event miss isolated events or invents a nonexistent event false isolated events the event detectability rises with the longer event duration the winter season suffers from the poorest performance in detecting events with epod below 0 2 and contrasting efar above 0 8 in the north central u s 3 when imerg successfully detects a gv mrms event the temporal overlap between the two is about 70 on average which reflects the imperfect timing of imerg derived events as compared to gv mrms events specifically imerg events tend to start peak and end all earlier than gv mrms events with national mean shifts of 0 44 h 26 min 0 29 h 17 min and 0 12 h 7 min respectively for about only 20 of all situations the starting time of the event is correctly reproduced by imerg and the same applies to the peak time and end time imerg derived events suffer from the most severe mistiming in the northern u s in winter with their mean start time 1 5 hour earlier and end time 2 hour later than the real events duration dependent time shifts are revealed the event start time transits from advanced to delayed with the longer duration while the opposite is true for the event end time compared with the previous event based evaluations of satellite precipitation products that mainly focused on the mean event property differences freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 this study goes one step further to investigate satellite derived event mismatching and mistiming issues providing more detailed knowledge and insight on their applications and improvements moreover the seasonal analyses also disentangle the markedly different features and error sources in summer and winter these contrasting seasonal errors largely canceled out each other in the annual results presented in previous studies thus hiding crucial information in addition this study is also the first systematic event based evaluation of satellite precipitation products in the u s and the first to use the comparable gauge radar merged reference dataset for comparison many points encountered during the present analysis could be further explored in future works for example based on the mismatching and mistiming issues of satellite derived events revealed in the study future studies should further quantify their impact on the total precipitation amount and frequency bias to make targeted improvements in retrieval since the temporal mismatches between gv mrms and imerg are likely to relate to the spatial inconsistency of precipitation features e g size location and propagation speed and direction further analysis of the spatial temporal evolution characteristics of precipitation events is promising and expected to provide more insight into the cause of this error li et al 2020 besides while the detected events with mistiming issues might be ameliorated with additional adjustments the completely missed or false events which have been suggested to make up a nonnegligible proportion of the total error could not be tackled easily in this way therefore more effort should be made to understand how these entirely ignored or fabricated events come into being for the asymmetric satellite performances in the course of events analysis that combines additional environmental variables and thermodynamical and microphysical factors is expected to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms and reveal approaches to improve the retrieval last but not least the method proposed here could be applied to other satellite precipitation products or even to an event based evaluation of the outputs of weather and climate models credit authorship contribution statement runze li

1930,precipitation occurs in the form of discrete events and the event characteristics event duration depth peak intensity start end time significantly influence the hydrologic response of a basin despite this importance event based performance of satellite precipitation products has still not been fully investigated to assess limitations in the retrieval algorithms guide future improvements and inform hydrologic applications in this study we evaluate the precipitation event performance of the gpm imerg product using as reference the high resolution ground gauge radar dataset gv mrms in the continental united states conus at the native imerg resolution 0 1 0 1 0 5 h with a primary focus on the detectability and timing of events our results show that imerg generally overestimates the event duration but underestimates the mean event precipitation intensity in the summer while the opposite is true for winter this discrepancy is mostly attributed to the under representation of short duration intense events in the summer and long duration moderate events in the winter in imerg in terms of the detection of individual events about 50 of the reference events are properly detected by imerg and conversely 50 of imerg events do not match a reference event however nearly 40 of the missed or false events result from temporal mismatching of less than 3 h between the retrieved and the reference event the remaining 60 comes from imerg not detecting an existing event or inventing a nonexistent event when imerg successfully detects an event the average temporal overlap with the reference event is about 70 of its total duration which mostly stems from the mistiming of imerg derived events imerg events tend to start peak and end earlier than gv mrms events with national mean shifts of 26 min 17 min and 7min respectively for about only 20 of all situations the starting time of the event is correctly reproduced by imerg and the same applies to the peak time and end time our results provide guidance for applications of imerg at sub daily scales as well as new insights for the improvement of satellite retrieval algorithms keywords precipitation satellite precipitation

global variability is essential to water resource management food security and ecological sustainability with important economic social and political implications hsiang et al 2013 kotz et al 2022 lobell et al 2011 siepielski et al 2017 sinha et al 2017 an important feature that makes precipitation different from most other environmental variables e g temperature soil moisture humidity is that it occurs discretely in space and time in the form of coherent and continuous objects which we call events haile et al 2011 hanel and maca 2014 lochbihler et al 2017 the occurrence and characteristics of precipitation events are directly linked to multi scale multi type dynamic thermodynamic and microphysical atmospheric processes berg et al 2013 lamjiri et al 2017 lochbihler et al 2017 wasko et al 2015 and depending on the characteristics of these events land surface processes like runoff infiltration and soil erosion are affected dunkerley 2017 dunkerley 2021 dunkerley 2019 guan et al 2016 therefore studying the properties of precipitation events is important for deepening our understanding of precipitation physics and accurately modeling precipitation driven processes high resolution multi satellite precipitation products have become indispensable in recent decades for providing quantitative precipitation estimates globally mccabe et al 2017 skofronick jackson et al 2017 consequently knowing how well they capture the characteristics of precipitation events is crucial to assess their reliability for hydrological applications and provide insight for future improvement of precipitation retrieval algorithms freitas et al 2020 tadesse and anagnostou 2009 however most published studies assess satellite precipitation products by lumping together all hourly or daily data and computing statistical indicators asong et al 2017 huang et al 2016 smith et al 2006 tang et al 2016 an approach that largely erases the crucial information in the properties of individual precipitation events li et al 2021 conversely the existing event based evaluations are still limited freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 maranan et al 2020 resulting in an insufficient understanding of the event related performance of satellite precipitation products a series of works by nikolopoulos et al 2013 mei et al 2014 and mei et al 2016 assessed the event based performance of satellite products at the basin scale in europe since they aimed to assess the satellites ability to simulate flood events they focused on basin average statistics more recently maranan et al 2020 compared imerg derived events with gauge derived events in africa concentrating on event duration differences to the authors knowledge freitas et al 2020 and li et al 2021 are the only evaluation studies that analyzed in detail not only event duration but also further event characteristics such as depth mean rate etc these studies still did not cover all the facets of precipitation events and many other aspects of satellite derived precipitation events remain to be investigated for example precipitation event characteristics are closely related to the type of precipitation systems which significantly varies among different seasons mao et al 2022 but the seasonal factor has not been analyzed in previous studies freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 additionally the potential timing errors in the start peak and end time of satellite derived events have not been investigated despite the fact that such inaccuracies can result in significant biases in flood event simulations dunkerley 2012 mei et al 2016 assessing event s timing in satellite products can also provide quantitative insight for improving retrieval algorithms guilloteau et al 2018 previous event based evaluations have used gauge observations freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 mei et al 2014 mei et al 2016 nikolopoulos et al 2013 as ground reference however the fundamental difference between point measurements by gauges and the area integrated satellite estimates makes the comparison between the two equivocal unless each satellite pixel is homogeneously covered by several gauges which is rarely the case in contrast the sampling geometry of ground based weather radars is more consistent with that of satellite estimates making radars generally more suitable for the evaluation of satellite products provided that the radars are properly calibrated and bias corrected with gauge data in this study we present an event based evaluation of the state of the art integrated multisatellite retrieval for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg product over the continental united states conus using as reference the ground validation multi radar multi sensor gv mrms product which combines ground radar and gauge measurements we focus on assessing the performance of imerg in retrieving the following three progressive event attributes 1 the spatial variability and statistical distribution of event characteristics depth duration mean event precipitation rate peak intensity etc 2 the detection rate and false detection rate of precipitation events and 3 the timing start peak and end time of the detected events thanks to the dense ground radar network in the u s this study is not only the first systematic event based evaluation in the u s but also the first event based evaluation with the ground radar based data as reference our analysis reveals seasonal and regional differences in the performance of imerg and points out to systematic biases that could be addressed in future algorithm developments 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 imerg precipitation dataset imerg is the level 3 research quality gridded global multi satellite merged precipitation product developed by the u s gpm team hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2020 the version we use is imerg v06b final run at a resolution of 0 1 30 min huffman et al 2019b the v06 of imerg is available both in the trmm era june 2000 may 2014 and the gpm era june 2014 present imerg integrates multiple sensor sources including all available passive microwave pmw sensors in the gpm constellation of low earth orbit satellites and infrared ir sensors on geostationary orbits among them all pmw estimates are globally calibrated against the combined radar radiometer algorithm corra product which relies on the combined measurements of the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and the gpm microwave radiometer gmi both onboard the gpm core observatory all ir estimates are then calibrated by the pmw sensors huffman et al 2020 such intercalibrations efficiently enforce the uniformity of the multi source merged imerg product across space and time for constructing continuous gridded estimates the calibrated pmw estimates and the ir estimates produced by persiann ccs precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system are interpolated using a quasi lagrangian time interpolation scheme similar to that of the climate prediction center cpc morphing kalman filter cmorph kf algorithm huffman et al 2019a finally the gridded estimates are calibrated by the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc gauge monthly analysis imerg is among the most accurate state of the art high resolution satellite precipitation datasets guilloteau et al 2021 pradhan et al 2022 tang et al 2020 and has been used in a wide range of applications orland et al 2022 yin et al 2022 zhang and wang 2023 2 1 2 gv mrms gauge radar data the high quality mrms quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is used here as the ground reference dataset it integrates precipitation observations from 180 weather surveillance radar 88 doppler wsr 88d and canadian c band radar data and approximately 7 000 hourly rain gauges and also incorporates model analyses as ancillary data zhang et al 2016 based on mrms the further quality controlled and adjusted gv mrms product forms a standardized reference for gpm ground validation kirstetter et al 2014 kirstetter et al 2012 kirstetter et al 2018 the gridded gv mrms qpe used in this study matches the imerg resolution of 0 1 and 30 minutes and a spatial domain from 20 to 55 n and 60 to 130 w a radar quality index rqi 0 100 which accounts for the distance to the radar beam blockage and environmental parameters such as the altitude of the freezing level is applied to filter out lower quality estimates rqi less than 60 petersen et al 2020 the gridboxes with an average rqi less than 60 during the study period were entirely eliminated from our analyses the study period is 2018 2020 2 2 methods 2 2 1 precipitation event definition in this study the definition of a precipitation event is based on an eulerian approach that is at each pixel in space events are defined as continuous periods of half hourly rain rates of no less than 0 1 mm h li et al 2021 this simple definition allows an easy to implement analysis as compared with the lagrangian approach which requires tracking the space time evolution of precipitation features that can reveal important information relevant to the hydrologic response of a basin ignaccolo and de michele 2010 moreover the revealed biases in the retrieval could be more directly linked to the local surface type climate zone and latitude which could be helpful in attributing errors and improving retrieval algorithms 2 2 2 event properties following li et al 2021 for each event we depict a set of event properties namely event duration t h event depth d mm and mean event precipitation rate r mm h relative peak position p and peak to mean intensity ratio o specifically p is the relative position of the peak time of an event which is expressed as see li et al 2021 for details 1 p t p 0 5 t 0 5 where t p h is the time to peak note that here 0 5 replaces 1 in the accordant formula in li et al 2021 considering the temporal resolution of 0 5 h used in this study o is the ratio of peak precipitation rate r p mm h to the mean event precipitation rate r 2 o r p r in this work we analyze the number of events n events year or events season and the statistical distributions of the above mentioned event properties and their spatial and seasonal variability as compared between gv mrms and imerg 2 2 3 event detectability even if imerg has the same number of events with gv mrms it would not be guaranteed that every imerg derived event temporally matches with a reference event to assess this we introduce the metrics of event detectability which describe the hit false and miss events based on the temporal overlap or non overlap and eventually on the temporal delays between the events across the two datasets we classify all the events into three categories which are diagramed in fig 1 the first category is the hit event which represents an event in a dataset that overlaps with at least one time step here 0 5 h with an event in the other dataset this situation indicates that imerg successfully detects a reference event and the overlapped events in gv mrms and imerg are named as hit mrms event and hit imerg event respectively the second category is the mismatched event which is defined as an event in a dataset that does not overlap with any event in the other dataset but there is at least one event in the other dataset occurring within 3 h of its start or end time this situation indicates that imerg actually senses the existence of an event but narrowly misses it and the two adjacent but non overlapping events in gv mrms and imerg are termed as miss mismatched event and false mismatched event respectively the third category is the isolated event which represents an event in a dataset that does not overlap with any event in the other dataset and there is also no event in the other dataset occurring within 3 h of its start or end time this situation indicates that imerg is completely unaware of the existence of an event or makes up an utterly nonexistent event accordingly such events are named respectively as miss isolated events and false isolated events the 3 hour threshold is chosen because we consider that timing errors due in particular to the vertical variability of the precipitation process and to the dynamical interpolation based on motion vectors in imerg are unlikely to be more than 3 h in magnitude guilloteau et al 2018 utsumi et al 2019 you et al 2019 we apply the traditional detectability error metrics namely probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far to the event detectability of the satellite product ebert et al 2007 and define event probability of detection epod and event false alarm ratio efar specifically 3 e p o d n h m n h m n m m n m i 4 e f a r n f m n f i n h i n f m n f i where n h m n m m and n m i are the number of hit mrms miss mismatched and miss isolated events from gv mrms respectively and n h i n f m and n f i are the numbers of hit imerg false mismatched and false isolated events from imerg respectively 2 2 4 timing of the detected events moreover even if imerg correctly detects an event present in the gv mrms dataset this pair of hit events is still likely not to match perfectly in terms of the starting time ending time and peak intensity time to assess this we take the hit mrms events as the reference and investigate the start time shift d t s peak time shift d t p and end time shift d t e of the corresponding hit imerg events 3 results 3 1 event properties we analyze the statistical distribution of event properties in each pixel for gv mrms and imerg fig 2 shows maps of the number of events per year along with maps of the mean value for each one of the event properties to reduce sampling noise the metrics are exhibited as the average values over 1 1 gridboxes from this map regional differences in the event properties between imerg and gv mrms are salient in terms of the number of events event depth and peak mean ratio a spatial consistency between gv mrms and imerg is observed with cross correlation coefficients of 0 88 0 93 and 0 87 respectively figs 2a1 2 d1 2 and f1 2 although there are still biases in their quantitative values fig 2a3 d3 and f3 for example imerg overestimates the number of events in most regions of conus where the mean event duration revealed by gv mrms is also relatively high fig 2a3 and b1 this may be due to imerg intermittently missing precipitation during the events which causes long duration events to be split into several parts the exception is over the rocky mountains where the lower number of events in imerg as compared to gv mrms might be related to the documented low detection rate of satellites for orography induced rainfall and over arid semiarid areas with hot background surfaces derin and kirstetter 2022 derin and yilmaz 2014 dinku et al 2010 maggioni et al 2016 in contrast to the duration the mean event depth showed a nationwide underestimation by imerg fig 2d3 which might also be owing to the event split mentioned above considering that the average event depth multiplied by the number of events in a year is the total annual precipitation which is constrained by the gpcc annual values huffman et al 2019a an overestimated number of events is almost certainly accompanied by an underestimated event depth as a compensation the spatial distribution of the mean event duration of imerg is significantly different compared to that of gv mrms fig 2b1 3 for gv mrms events last longer in all the midwest and the northeast u s but are shorter in the rocky mountain gulf coast and florida fig 2b1 while the duration of imerg derived events inversely increases from the north to the south fig 2b2 attributing a cause to such a difference in the patterns is not easy when simply examining these two distribution maps we note however that the bias shows an evident regularity with an apparent meridional gradient pattern from negative in the north to positive in the south fig 2b3 this pattern might be related to the gradually reduced frequency of pmw overpasses as the latitude decreases eventually leading to the increased influence of the morphing scheme in imerg tan et al 2021 which tends to increase the event duration ayat et al 2021 for the relative peak position the peaks of the reference events are skewed to the early part of the event and have a clearer regional variation than imerg derived events while the relative peak position of the imerg derived events is closer to the event center with less regional differences fig 2e1 2 such bias may arise from the interpolation procedures in imerg that weaken the asymmetry li et al 2021 for the mean event precipitation rate imerg generally reproduces the spatial pattern shown by gv mrms with higher values in the southeast u s compared to other regions however such contrast between different regions is not as strong as that in gv mrms fig 2d1 2 leading to a clearly underestimated mean event precipitation rate in the southeast u s fig 2d3 since the mean event precipitation rate is the result of event depth divided by event duration such a pattern is explainable considering the overestimated duration and underestimated depth in the south u s fig 2b3 as a result imerg tends to have more long duration light to moderate events in the south u s more short duration heavy events in the northeast u s rocky mountain and west coast but more short duration light to moderate events in the great plain since different types of precipitation systems dominate in different seasons further analysis by season is necessary for bias attribution fig 3 and fig s1 for example the overestimation of event duration is most severe in winter when the long duration frontal precipitation dominates fig 3b4 and fig s1b7 during the cold season the interpretation of the passive microwave signal is more ambiguous as frozen or snow covered land surfaces can have spectral signatures similar to those of ice clouds ferraro et al 1998 to counterbalance this during the cold season the imerg algorithm relies more on the ir information huffman et al 2020 which is generally less accurate in terms of precipitation detection derin et al 2021 tan et al 2016 such deficiency tends to split the long lasting events causing the overestimated number of events but underestimated duration fig 3 a4 and b4 the missed precipitation which is more likely to occur for low intensity precipitation further elevates the mean event precipitation rate fig 3d4 in contrast the short duration but still overestimated number of events in the summer indicates the existence of false events in imerg fig 3a2 fig s1b3 such phenomenon could also be owing to the fact that the deep convective precipitation predominant in the summer is reasonably well detected by passive space borne instruments chen et al 2011 young et al 2014 exceptionally the more pronounced underestimation of the number of events around the rocky mountains relative to the annual counterpart fig 2a3 can presumably be attributed to the elevated air temperature favoring the generation of warm rain coupled uytwith the increased surface temperature neutralizing the cold signals of hydrometeors derin and kirstetter 2022 dinku et al 2010 maggioni et al 2016 indeed intermittent satellite observations missing the short duration precipitation prevalent in the summer could be another important contributor due to the interpolation procedures in imerg a pmw estimate usually with a high precipitation rate in the summer is likely to fill their adjacent dry gaps with non zero values thus prolonging the duration but consequently reducing the mean precipitation rate fig 3b2 d2 and s1d3 besides the relative peak position has a delaying bias not least in summer when afternoon convective precipitation dominates fig 3e2 and s2e3 this type of precipitation generally has an early peak since the evaporative cooling suppresses the surface heating shortly after the rainfall starts dunkerley 2021 but this feature fails to be reproduced by imerg due to the weakening of rainfall asymmetry induced by the interpolation procedures in the merging algorithms to go further than analyzing the mean values of the different event properties fig 4 depicts the joint distribution of the annual and seasonal total precipitation amount contributed by events with different durations and mean event precipitation rates from which we can see more detail about the event related performance of the satellites as shown imerg and gv mrms display dissimilar patterns at all times specifically the distributions for gv mrms are more dispersed while those for imerg are more concentrated around the diagonals fig 4a1 a5 and b1 b5 in other words imerg underestimates the occurrence of short duration high intensity events and long duration low intensity precipitation events but overestimates the occurrence of the medium duration moderate intensity events as compensation fig 4c1 c5 such bias is evident in the summer and winter fig 4a3 c3 and a5 c5 when brief strong thunderstorms and long lasting steady frontal precipitation are known to occur respectively as analyzed above the smoothing effect of the interpolation leads to imerg s underestimation of the occurrence of short duration heavy events while the ir only sources with high missing rates that frequently occur in late autumn winter and early spring make imerg hard to reflect long lasting events especially for the high impact short duration extreme events that might cause flash floods and debris flows their underrepresentation could largely affect the prediction or retrospective attribution of these natural hazards when employing the imerg data 3 2 event detectability after analyzing the difference in the mean event properties events from gv mrms and imerg are further matched in time to investigate whether imerg can successfully capture the reference events depicted by gv mrms as stated in the methods section events in gv mrms and imerg are classified into three categories hit events mismatched events and isolated events whose proportions are displayed by their durations fig 5 for the events with all durations the two datasets possess a similar composition with the hit events mismatched events and isolated events making up 49 20 and 31 in gv mrms and 45 19 and 36 in imerg the proportion of hit events in each dataset gradually increases with the lengthening of event duration from below 25 to above 95 such a phenomenon is understandable since a longer duration event has a higher chance of being overlapped with any other event in the other dataset we further apply the event probability of detection epod and event false alarm ratio efar to quantify imerg s detectability of precipitation events fig 6 overall imerg does not have a high level of detectability the mean epod equals 0 49 and efar equals 0 55 across the conus and at the annual time scale fig 6a1 and b1 which might be largely contributed by the misdetection of short lived events lasting 0 5 3 h as analyzed above fig 5 the epod and efar show differential spatial patterns compared to the bias of the annual and seasonal average number of events figs 62a and 3a1 a4 which indicates that the similarity in the number of events between imerg and gv mrms does not necessarily demonstrate imerg s good event detectability further bearing out the necessity of the comparison based on event matching for example although imerg derived events have a consistent overestimation in the number of events in both the northeast and southeast u s at the annual time scale fig 2a3 the southeast exhibits a relatively high epod and low efar while the opposite is true for the northeast fig 6a1 and b1 more missed and false events in the northeast at the same time cancel out each other and lead to a comparable performance in the number of events compared with that in the southeast additionally the summer exhibits the best detectability among all seasons with epod over 0 7 and efar below 0 3 in some regions fig 6a3 and b3 while the winter performs worst and the epod and efar could be below 0 2 and above 0 8 respectively fig 6a5 and b5 as analyzed above the miss isolated and false isolated events not only comprise a significant proportion of the bias but are also not easy to address in the retrieval thus worthy of further investigation fig 7 looks in more detail into the characteristics of these events involving the contributions to the total number of events total amount and total frequency as well as their mean duration and intensity overall the regions with severe miss or false isolated events are still in the western u s where arid semiarid and mountainous areas characterized by generally poor satellite performance dominate derin and kirstetter 2022 dinku et al 2010 maggioni et al 2016 the isolated events account for a large proportion of events both in gv mrms and imerg with their national mean values equaling 31 and 36 respectively fig 7a1 and a2 however their contributions to the total frequency are smaller 19 for gv mrms and 18 for imerg nationally fig 7b1 and b2 compared with the miss isolated events those false isolated events are marked by a larger number but shorter durations fig 7a1 a2 and d1 d2 although their contribution to the total amount during the study period is even less 7 for both gv mrms and imerg nationally than to the total frequency the percentages in the total amount could still exceed 20 in the mountain west areas fig 7c1 and c2 in terms of intensity the miss isolated events are comparatively high in the south u s but progressively decrease with higher latitude while the false isolated events are higher especially in the northeast and northwest u s the fundamental causes for these biases need to be further investigated for possible improvements in the retrieval algorithms 3 3 timing of the detected events even if imerg successfully detects a precipitation event it does not warrant that imerg can exactly reproduce the whole event in terms of its timing duration and depth that is the retrieved events may mistime the beginning and end preventing them from wholly matching the reference events fig 8 displays the matching percentage of the hit events from imerg and gv mrms in terms of duration and depth as a function of event duration results show that the pairs of hit events from the two datasets can only match about 70 of the total durations on average but the percentages can rise up to about 80 on average for the total depth due to the relatively small intensity of the unmatched rainy hours besides it is easily explainable that the matching percentage of the 0 5 h events always equals 100 and the values naturally drop with the longer duration for the brief events 3h however the percentages of gv mrms derived events keep decreasing e g from 70 to 60 for the matching percentages of event duration but those of imerg derived events inversely increase with longer duration e g from 60 to 80 for the matching percentages of event duration such a phenomenon indicates that the hit imerg events tend to have fewer false time steps but more miss time steps with increasing event duration this further implies imerg s more significant underestimation of the event duration for longer actual events these results are consistent with those revealed in figs 1 3 fig 9 further looks into the start peak and end time shifts of the hit imerg events compared with their corresponding hit mrms events in the form of the probability density functions pdfs from the graphs all three pdfs are negatively skewed which means that imerg tends to start peak and end all earlier than the reference events among the three event properties the time shift is most severe for the start time with an average of 0 44 h 26 min which is followed by peak time and end time with averages of 0 29 h 17 min and 0 12 h 7 min such a difference is also reflected in the cumulative probabilities with the contrast between the percent of total events with advances time shift 0 5 h and delays time shift 0 5 h at 57 versus 19 respectively for the start time but 44 versus 38 for the end time events with unbiased start peak and end times time shifts of 0 h only account for about 20 in each pdf and the chance of a 0 5 h shift even exceeds that of no shift for the peak and end times fig 9b and c such results further demonstrate the systematic time shifts of the imerg derived events fig 10 further examines the consistency of the revealed mistiming issue of imerg derived events over conus in the form of mean time shifts among the three properties start peak and end time the peak time shift is most consistent with an advanced shift among almost all the regions and seasons fig 10a2 e2 imerg derived events have advanced start times in most areas for spring summer and winter fig 10b1 d3 while the time shifts in the event ending time could be both positive and negative for the same periods fig 10b3 d3 such facts align with the more negatively skewed pdf for the start time than the end time fig 9a and c further indicating the satellites asymmetric performance during the events li et al 2021 however significantly different patterns are shown in the winter for both the start and end time shifts fig 10e1 and e3 while the moderate shifts displayed in the south u s are in agreement with those in the other seasons the north suffers from substantially delayed start times and advanced end times at the same time fig 10e1 and e3 the mean delays in the north in the winter could exceed 1 h while the advances could be even more severe and surpass 2 h which may well be due to the inaccurate ir sources in the retrieval process as discussed before next we further examine the time shifts of imerg when detecting the events of different durations as shown in fig 11 the curves of the start peak and end time shifts all exhibit smooth and monotonic variations with increasing duration which indicates the significant dependency of the mistiming on the event duration specifically imerg derived events tend to start earlier for short duration events but later for long duration events while they end later for short duration events but earlier for long duration events however the tipping point of the start time shift is 8h while that of the end time shift is 2h which suggests a negatively skewed tendency of the timing of imerg derived events in accordance with the results in fig 9 such patterns indicate that the causes of mistiming might involve both symmetric and asymmetric factors that contribute to the biases in the retrieval the curve of the peak time shifts further confirms this inference as its values keep being negative and decreasing with longer durations but the shape of the curve highly dovetails with that of the mean value of the start and end time shifts this means that the start and end time shifts of imerg derived events might be attributed to a symmetric extension or contraction centered around the event peak time as well as an overall systematic advance of the events the former might result from the inherent deficiencies of the data sources e g the lengthening effects of morphing sources and the high missing rate of ir sources which generally exert a comparable impact on the event start and end times tan et al 2021 the latter might be caused by a consistent time difference between the satellite receiving the ice scattering signal from the sky and the precipitation falling on the ground due to instrumental effects such as the incidence angle guilloteau et al 2018 the actual situation might be more complex also influenced by the different retrieval capabilities in response to the inherent asymmetry of the cloud physical properties during the storm evolution imaoka and nakamura 2012 4 discussion compared with the traditional evaluation methods of satellite precipitation products that treat precipitation values at each time step as independent and calculate the mean error statistics e g mean absolute error root mean square error amjad et al 2020 beck et al 2019 beck et al 2017 our study examines the inherent temporal information of precipitation that is properties of individual events the event based evaluation is expected to provide additional insight into the use of satellite products for hydrological applications and also lead to targeted improvements in the retrieval algorithms moreover in contrast to the previous few event based evaluations freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 we go one step further to investigate the mismatching and mistiming issues of satellite derived events in addition to the comparison of the mean event properties several insights are gained through these analyses as discussed below for example fig 11 shows an advanced start time and a slightly delayed peak time for the short duration events but a delayed start time and a more strongly delayed peak time for the longer duration events in imerg compared with those in gv mrms this indicates that the time from the start to the peak is overestimated in imerg for short duration events but underestimated for long duration events previous studies have found that an event with a later peak could generate substantially more runoff than an event with an earlier peak dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2017 mostly because the later peak events tend to wet the dry soil before the arrival of the most intense precipitation thus reducing infiltration and generating more surface runoff dunkerley 2021 therefore such systematic bias could influence the results of hydrological models when using imerg as the input wu et al 2012 wu et al 2014 added to that although the comparisons of the mean annual event properties calculated from the events of imerg and the reference data separately in this study and in a previous studies indicate a later relative peak position of the satellites fig 2e1 e3 li et al 2021 further results from matching the events from the two datasets show that the absolute peak times of imerg derived events tend to be earlier than the real events fig 9b this result highlights the importance of the one to one comparison between the gv mrms and imerg derived events which has not been performed before li et al 2021 in terms of intensity imerg underestimates the mean event precipitation rate of short intense events which is of high impact notably in the summer fig 4 an underestimated peak to mean ratio is simultaneously revealed for the summer short duration events figure s2e3 this characteristic could also influence the hydrological applications of imerg e g underestimating the surface influence of heavy flash events such findings could not be easily drawn from the traditional evaluations without considering the event based characteristics although our results show that the mean start and end time shifts are less than 0 5 h fig 9 the pdfs tell us that there are only 20 of the start and end times of the real events that are accurately reflected by imerg in comparison the time shifts with absolute values no less than 2 h could also account for over 20 which is nonnegligible for fine scale hydrological applications like flood predictions wu et al 2012 wu et al 2014 seasonal spatial distribution analysis further suggests that such bias could be worse in specific regions and seasons fig 10 moreover from the error perspective even if imerg duplicates an event profile identical to the real case but has an overall 1 h advance the intensities during the event could be biased in all time steps on top of that if a large proportion of events all have a small shift they could altogether contribute significantly to the total absolute error this is the case in our results where about 60 of the imerg derived events have an advanced start time fig 9a these findings imply that the mistiming issue of precipitation events detected in the satellite product should be given focused attention in future algorithm development as mentioned above although the lengthening effect of the interpolation procedures in the merging algorithm on event duration could contribute to the start and end time shifts they theoretically exert symmetric influences on both the start and end sides of the events therefore other reasons should be responsible for the generally advanced event time shifts of imerg for example the precipitation might fall on the ground tens of minutes after the ice scattering signal aloft is captured by the satellites guilloteau et al 2018 thus leading to the advanced timing of events the possible mislocation of precipitation systems caused by the uncorrected parallax shifts of pmw and geostationary sensors is likely to cause a skewing in the event timing as well li et al 2022 if these conjectures are further substantiated in future work the mistiming issue might be substantially mitigated by additional adjustment procedures moreover precipitating clouds could undergo substantial thermodynamical and microphysical changes in their lifetime which might give rise to different levels of fidelity in the course of events petkovic and kummerow 2017 future analysis should be made by combining the variation of cloud properties and environmental variables to further understand the asymmetric performance of satellite products during the events on the other hand the inhomogeneity of the sensor sources could bring about irregular event time shifts li et al 2018 which needs to be further investigated in future work in addition the bias of event duration shows significant latitude dependent values fig 3b1 which is suspected to be related to the data source composition in imerg that is also latitude dependent passive microwave algorithm team facility 2017 gebregiorgis et al 2017 to verify this conjuncture fig s4 compares the curves of zonal mean event duration bias and the morph source proportions as a function of latitude the basically monotonically increasing trend of the two curves as the latitude decreases as well as their high correlation coefficients 0 85 for all situations bears out their strong connection the polar orbit and low orbit satellites revolve around the earth with the same swath width at different latitudes this always leads to the undersampling of high quality pmw observations at low latitudes passive microwave algorithm team facility 2017 complementarily as shown the proportion of the morph sources increases to fill the gap spanning from 45 to 75 across conus fig s4a the pmw sources are suggested to miss light precipitation likely to occur both near the beginning and end of the events thus shortening the event duration ayat et al 2021 as the replacement of pmw in the ice snow surfaces ir sources with a high missing rate could exert a more substantial shortening effect on the duration tan et al 2016 in contrast the morph data inversely tend to prolong the event duration due to the high chance of assigning non zero values to dry grids through the interpolation process li et al 2022 at the same time the lengthening and shortening of the duration could result in a decrease and increase of the mean event precipitation rate respectively which is also reflected in our results although the intensity bias is affected by more factors fig 2d3 and 2d1 d4 the underestimation of long moderate events at high latitudes but the underestimation of short intense events at low latitudes will be further propagated into hydrological models when using imerg as the inputs in sum the uneven sampling density of the polar and low orbits naturally exerts a region dependent bias which is distinguished from the regional differences stemming from different surface types or cloud regimes ferraro et al 2013 tan et al 2022 therefore efforts to improve and unify satellite retrieval capability under different climate conditions might never minimize the impact of pmw sensor sampling density that results in regional dependent bias a path forward is the improvement of geostationary precipitation estimates kirstetter et al 2012 upadhyaya et al 2022 also this fact further emphasizes that fundamental improvement for the multi satellite merged precipitation products will rely on increasing the spatial temporal coverage of high quality observations by adding more pmw sensors in the gpm constellation kidd et al 2021 although the ability of pmw sensors to detect light rain needs to be further improved in this study we define a precipitation event as a continuous temporal half hourly rainy 0 1 mm h series compared with the commonly used minimum interevent time mit criterion for event definition our definition is equivalent to mit 0 5 h because of the temporal resolution of our data 0 5 h due to the complexity of precipitation processes there is no unified and standard mit values for event definition since the event properties are apparently sensitive to the chosen mit it is necessary to know the robustness of the inferred satellite bias on the selection of mit therefore we have repeated our analysis using mit 3 h the main text is for mit 0 5 h and the results are shown in figures s5 and s6 although the details are unavoidably altered the main bias patterns remain similar these results also coincide with the previous event based evaluations where robust performance is found under different mit values freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 5 conclusions precipitation naturally occurs in the form of discrete events accurate depiction of precipitation events advances our understanding of the multi scale atmospheric dynamic processes and our assessment of the land surface hydrological response to precipitation while satellite precipitation products have been widely evaluated and applied since their inception knowledge about their performance in terms of reproducing precipitation event characteristics and timing remains insufficient in this study we use 3 year gv mrms data to conduct an event based evaluation of the imerg product over conus from three progressive levels 1 the spatial variability and statistical distribution of event characteristics depth duration mean event precipitation rate peak intensity etc 2 the detection rate and false detection rate of precipitation events and 3 the ability to accurately capture the timing start peak and end time of the detected events the main conclusions are as follows 1 the spatial distribution of the number of events event depth and peak to mean intensity ratio is well reproduced by imerg as inferred by comparison to gv mrms over conus however in terms of the spatial pattern of event duration mean event precipitation rate and relative peak position significant discrepancies are found between imerg and gv mrms the event duration bias shows a latitude dependent pattern from negative imerg underestimating mean event duration in the north to positive in the south imerg underestimates the occurrence frequency of short duration high intensity events especially in the summer but overestimates the occurrence frequency of long duration moderate intensity events especially in the winter 2 on average over conus only about 50 of the gv mrms events overlap for at least 30 min with an imerg event and vice versa which are defined as the hit events however nearly half of the missed and false events result from wrong timing of events mostly short events the other half corresponds to isolated missed or false events when imerg simply does not detect any event miss isolated events or invents a nonexistent event false isolated events the event detectability rises with the longer event duration the winter season suffers from the poorest performance in detecting events with epod below 0 2 and contrasting efar above 0 8 in the north central u s 3 when imerg successfully detects a gv mrms event the temporal overlap between the two is about 70 on average which reflects the imperfect timing of imerg derived events as compared to gv mrms events specifically imerg events tend to start peak and end all earlier than gv mrms events with national mean shifts of 0 44 h 26 min 0 29 h 17 min and 0 12 h 7 min respectively for about only 20 of all situations the starting time of the event is correctly reproduced by imerg and the same applies to the peak time and end time imerg derived events suffer from the most severe mistiming in the northern u s in winter with their mean start time 1 5 hour earlier and end time 2 hour later than the real events duration dependent time shifts are revealed the event start time transits from advanced to delayed with the longer duration while the opposite is true for the event end time compared with the previous event based evaluations of satellite precipitation products that mainly focused on the mean event property differences freitas et al 2020 li et al 2021 this study goes one step further to investigate satellite derived event mismatching and mistiming issues providing more detailed knowledge and insight on their applications and improvements moreover the seasonal analyses also disentangle the markedly different features and error sources in summer and winter these contrasting seasonal errors largely canceled out each other in the annual results presented in previous studies thus hiding crucial information in addition this study is also the first systematic event based evaluation of satellite precipitation products in the u s and the first to use the comparable gauge radar merged reference dataset for comparison many points encountered during the present analysis could be further explored in future works for example based on the mismatching and mistiming issues of satellite derived events revealed in the study future studies should further quantify their impact on the total precipitation amount and frequency bias to make targeted improvements in retrieval since the temporal mismatches between gv mrms and imerg are likely to relate to the spatial inconsistency of precipitation features e g size location and propagation speed and direction further analysis of the spatial temporal evolution characteristics of precipitation events is promising and expected to provide more insight into the cause of this error li et al 2020 besides while the detected events with mistiming issues might be ameliorated with additional adjustments the completely missed or false events which have been suggested to make up a nonnegligible proportion of the total error could not be tackled easily in this way therefore more effort should be made to understand how these entirely ignored or fabricated events come into being for the asymmetric satellite performances in the course of events analysis that combines additional environmental variables and thermodynamical and microphysical factors is expected to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms and reveal approaches to improve the retrieval last but not least the method proposed here could be applied to other satellite precipitation products or even to an event based evaluation of the outputs of weather and climate models credit authorship contribution statement runze li

1931,this study diagnoses the impact of projected changes in climate and glacier cover on the hydrology of several natural flowing bow river headwater basins in the canadian rockies the bow river at lake louise 420 7 km2 the pipestone river near lake louise 304 2 km2 the bow river at banff 2192 2 km2 all of which drain the high elevation snowy partially glaciated central range and the elbow river

business as usual scenario representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 at 4 km resolution were used to force model simulations to examine the climate change impact a projected glacier cover under a business as usual scenario rcp8 5 was incorporated to assess the impact of concomitant glacier cover decline uncalibrated model simulations for the current climate and glacier coverage showed useful predictions of snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow when compared to surface observations from 2000 to 2015 under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario the basins of the bow river at banff and elbow river at calgary will warm up by 4 7 and 4 5 c respectively and receive 12 to 15 more precipitation annually with both basins experiencing a greater proportion of precipitation as rainfall peak snow accumulation in bow river basin will slightly rise by 3 mm whilst it will drop by 20 mm in elbow river basin and annual snowmelt volume will increase by 43 mm in bow river basin but decrease by 55 mm in elbow river basin snowcovered periods will decline by 37 and 46 days in bow and elbow river basins respectively due to suppressed snow redistribution by wind and gravity and earlier melt the shorter snowcovered period and warmer wetter climate will increase evapotranspiration and glacier melt if the glaciers were held constant and decrease sublimation lake levels soil moisture and groundwater levels the hydrological responses of the basins will differ despite similar climate changes because of differing biophysical characteristics climates and hydrological processes generating runoff climate change with concomitant glacier decline is predicted to increase the peak discharge and mean annual water yield by 12 23 m3 s 1 11 and 11 in the higher elevation basins of the bow river but will decrease the mean annual peak discharge by 3 58 m3 s 1 9 and increase the mean annual water yield by 18 in the lower elevation basin of the elbow river this shows complex and compensatory hydrological process responses to climate change with the reduced glacier contribution reducing the impact of higher precipitation in high elevation headwaters and drier soil conditions and lower

water supply from mountain headwaters to downstream regions in the future headwaters draining the canadian rockies eastern slopes span a large elevational gradient and contain a range of ecozones

the projected climate and glacier changes for these headwater basins this will provide the most detailed assessment yet of the current hydrology and the expected changes in the headwaters of one of the most water stressed regions in canada and the results can be useful for national and provincial park management climate adaptation policy development flood mitigation plans and water supply planning and management for large cities and irrigation districts 2 methods 2 1 study area and model domains the study was conducted in the bow river at banff brb and the elbow river at calgary erc alberta canada fig 1 both basins originate in the eastern slopes of the canadian rockies and are headwaters of the bow river that flows eastward and ultimately contributes to the south saskatchewan river saskatchewan river lake winnipeg and the nelson river flowing to hudson bay both basins contain a range of alpine rock alpine tundra and subalpine forests dominated by conifers brb lies entirely in the mountains with approximately 1 7 of the basin area covered by glacier bolch et al 2010 whereas erc has miniscule glacier coverage but its area consists of 21 grazed grassland and forage cropland castilla et al 2014 both basins have high surface relief with elevations ranging from 1376 m a s l above sea level at the water survey of canada wsc streamflow gauge 05bb001 in banff to just over 3400 m for brb and from 1075 m at wsc streamflow gauge 05bj010 in calgary to just over 3200 m for erc the geology in the region is characterized with mainly faulted and folded sedimentary bedrock composed of limestone sandstone siltstone dolostone and shale prior et al 2013 with surficial soils consisting primarily of highly permeable glaciofluvial and recent alluvial deposits in mountains and foothills and relatively impermeable till and glaciolacustrine deposits in forage cropland region bayrock and reimchen 1980 the weather for the region is dominated by continental air masses with long cold and dry winters and short warm and sub humid summers westerly flow originating from the pacific ocean develops warm and dry chinook föhn conditions that lead to brief periods of air temperature above 0 c during winter months large storms from easterly upslope flows can generate deep spring snowpacks or runoff events annual precipitation ranges between 800 mm and 1500 mm in higher elevations demuth et al 2008 and is higher in the west with the observed long term 1971 2000 mean annual precipitation ranging from 569 mm in lake louise at 1524 m 472 mm in banff at 1384 m to 412 mm in calgary international airport at 1084 m environment and climate change canada 2020 the long term 1971 2000 mean annual air temperatures are 0 3 3 and 4 1 c in lake louise banff and calgary respectively with mean monthly air temperatures ranging from 13 8 9 3 and 8 9 c in january to 12 14 6 and 16 2 c in july for lake louise banff and calgary respectively environment and climate change canada 2020 drainage basins were delineated based on arcview gis 3 2 terrain preprocessing esri 1999 using a resampled 20 m canadian digital elevation model cdem and contain approximately 2192 2 km2 for brb above wsc streamflow gauge 05bb001 and 1191 9 km2 for erc above wsc streamflow gauge 05bj010 shown in fig 1 in the upper brb drainage basins were also delineated for bow river at lake louise brll 420 7 km2 above wsc streamflow gauge 05ba001 and pipestone river near lake louise prll 304 2 km2 above wsc streamflow gauge 05ba002 these delineated drainage basins are the model domains of hydrological model simulations for this study in addition 9 6 50 and 25 sub basins were delineated based on the stream segmentation process in gis terrain preprocessing for the brll prll brb and erc model domains respectively table 1 lists the physiographic information for the model domains and a sub basin map for the model domains is provided in the supplement 2 2 hydrological model 2 2 1 crhm overview crhm pomeroy et al 2007 2022 was used to set up hydrological models for this study crhm is an object oriented modular and flexible platform for assembling physically based hydrological models with crhm the user constructs a purpose built model from a selection of possible basin spatial configurations spatial resolutions and physical process modules of varying degrees of physical complexity basin discretization is performed via hydrological response units hrus whose number and nature are selected based on the variability of basin attributes and the level of physical complexity chosen for the model hru are landscape units that are assumed to have some common biogeophysical characteristics and hydrological drainage characteristic the user selects physical complexity in light of hydrological understanding parameter availability basin complexity meteorological data availability and the objective flux or state to be predicted pomeroy et al 2022 provide a full description of crhm and recent updates include penman monteith algorithm in the evaporation module for evapotranspiration from vegetation with seasonal variations in leaf area index and height fang and pomeroy 2016 a hillslope module for better representation of surface and subsurface runoff including detention flow on hillslopes pomeroy et al 2016b and a glacier module for simulating glacier melt based on mass and energy balance pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a 2 2 2 hru delineation elevation aspect slope and land cover gis layers were used and intersected in gis analysis to determine hrus fig 2 elevation aspect and slope were extracted from the 20 m cdem land cover was obtained from the open access alberta biodiversity monitoring institute abmi landsat derived land cover polygon c 2000 castilla et al 2014 glacier cover area was downloaded from the randolph glacier inventory rgi 3 2 that was mapped using orthorectified landsat5 thematic mapper scenes for years 2004 to 2006 bolch et al 2010 and was used to separate glacier from seasonal snowcover area in the brb model domain pine forest coverage from the alberta forest species avie inventory was obtained from alberta agriculture and forestry 2018 and used to separate pine and spruce forest for the erc model domain in addition the water courses in the alberta drainage network inventory alberta environment and sustainable resource development 2012 was used to determine river channel valley hru for glacier hru determinations seven elevation bands north facing south facing and east facing aspects and gentle medium and steep slope gradients were taken into consideration in order to provide sufficient discretization of snow redistribution precipitation and temperature gradients slope aspect effects on net radiation and slope effects on runoff generation for rock hru determinations upper and lower elevation and north facing south facing and east facing aspects were taken into consideration for similar reasons for alpine tundra alpine sparse forest and valley shrubland hrus north facing south facing and east facing aspects were considered noting that these landscapes occupy narrow elevation ranges for all other forest open water river valley developed and exposed hrus elevation aspect and slope were not used to define hru areas as slope has little impact on sub canopy snowmelt ellis et al 2013 and other landscape types occupied valley bottoms for the erc model domain fewer criteria were considered for hru determination for glacier rock and alpine tundra hrus north facing south facing and east facing aspects were taken into consideration but not for the rest of the hrus the numbers of delineated hrus for the model domains are shown in table 1 and flowcharts of hru determination and sub basin hru information are provided in the supplement 2 2 3 model structure a set of physically based modules was linked in crhm to simulate the dominant hydrological processes for the model domains fig 3 shows the schematic setup of these modules and details of each module are provided in table 2 for the large model domains in this study the crhm model structures were grouped so that a set of physically based modules were assembled with a number of hrus to represent a sub basin the structural grouping was repeated with same type of sub basin holding the same module configuration but differing parameter sets and numbers of hrus muskingum routing was used to route the streamflow output from these sub basins along the main river channels fig 4 shows the sub basin group structure for the model domains 2 2 4 model parameterization crhm parameters values were determined based on field studies in research basins in the canadian rockies and similar environments in the boreal forest subarctic and prairies by remote sensing or from gis inventories for the blowing snow module fetch length vegetation height stalk density and stalk diameter parameters were determined using methods in previous studies for open prairie environment fang et al 2010 and alpine environments in the canadian rockies fang et al 2013 macdonald et al 2010 for the canopy module leaf area index and snow interception capacity parameters were derived from measured values for the similar forest types in the western cordillera and boreal forest hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 2002 2012 schmidt and gluns 1991 for the albedo module parameters albedo of bare ground values were set using measurements from prairie environment armstrong 2011 and boreal forest granger and pomeroy 1997 the albedo of fresh snow was determined from the observations and recommendations of male and gray 1981 for the glacier module the glacier hru area was determined from the rgi 3 2 glacier cover area based on landsat5 thematic mapper scenes for years 2004 to 2006 bolch et al 2010 for the brb model domain and was derived from the abmi landsat derived ice cover polygon c 2000 castilla et al 2014 for erc model domain the glacier ice thickness parameter was set based on previous studies in the upper bow river basin clarke et al 2013 naz et al 2014 a glacier hydrology model for simulating glacier mass and energy balance in peyto glacier pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a was instrumental in setting up thickness and density for firn layers glacier ice density albedo for firn and ice and travel time of icemelt firnmelt and snowmelt through glacier ice firn and snowpack for the soil module soil depth and porosity parameters were estimated from information on the predominant soil textures in the region soil landscapes of canada working group 2011 for alpine rock alpine tundra and forests hrus the water storage capacity in soil and groundwater layers were set based on reported values from long term studies of marmot creek research basin beke 1969 fang et al 2013 the water storage capacity was set based on values used in the peyto glacier hydrology model pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a for glacier hrus and was determined for foothill grassland and cropland hrus using methods described for prairie environment fang et al 2010 for the routing module routing lengths for river channel hrus were determined from the alberta drainage network gis inventory alberta environment and sustainable resource development 2012 and for non river channel hrus from the modified hack s law for length area relationship reported by fang et al 2010 manning s equation was used to calculate the average streamflow velocities based on longitudinal channel slope manning s roughness coefficient and the channel hydraulic radius as parameters the longitudinal channel slope of a hru or a sub basin was estimated from the average slope of the hru or sub basin manning s roughness coefficient was approximated based on surface cover and channel conditions using values reported by chow 1959 the hydraulic radius was determined from chow s lookup table using channel shape and channel depth as criteria the routing sequence within a sub basin was set using a routing distribution parameter to represent the typical flow sequence amongst hrus fang et al 2010 fang et al 2013 while the routing sequence amongst sub basins followed the channel flow order downstream through the basin both routing sequences are provided in the supplement values for the key parameters are listed in the supplement tables 2 3 wrf model the wrf model version 3 6 1 li et al 2019 was used to develop the forcing meteorological fields used to drive the crhm hydrological models this version of wrf simulates weather systems at convection permitting 4 km resolution and can capture variations in near surface meteorology caused by mesoscale orography model outputs from two 15 year periods of wrf experiments were available consisting of a control ctl simulation and a pgw simulation the ctl simulation was forced with boundary condition from a 6 hour era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 and corresponds to a retrospective period of 2000 2015 the pgw simulation was forced with the 6 hour era interim reanalysis data plus a climate perturbation the climate perturbation was based on 19 model ensemble mean change from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 under a business as usual forcing scenario representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the pgw is equivalent to a future period of 2084 2099 more details of wrf model are provided by li et al 2019 there are 49 and 25 grids respectively of the 4 km wrf model outputs used to force the hydrological model simulations for brb and erc model domains out of the 49 grids in brb model domain 9 and 6 wrf grids respectively are for brll and prll model domains information on these wrf grids is provided in the supplement 2 4 hydrological simulations hydrological model simulations were driven by the wrf outputs of near surface meteorological variables including air temperature vapour pressure wind speed shortwave irradiance and precipitation where the air temperature and vapour pressure were used to estimate relative humidity required by crhm three types of simulations were conducted reference simulation use the wrf ctl outputs for the 15 water year wy simulation in the current period i e 1 october 2000 to 30 september 2015 with the current glacier coverage from the rgi 3 2 inventory bolch et al 2010 climate scenario simulation use the wrf pgw outputs for the 15 wy simulation in the future period i e 1 october 2084 to 30 september 2099 with glacier ice volume reduced by 99 from the reference simulation a value guided by the rcp8 5 glacier projection in the southern canadian rockies at the end of the 21st century and a glacier dynamics model clarke et al 2015 the rcp8 5 climate and deglaciation projections are considered a high emission climate change scenario and were used to examine the hydrological impact of the worst case scenario glacier falsification simulations falsification 1 uses the wrf ctl outputs for the 15 wy simulation in the current period with the glacier ice volume reduced by 99 from the reference simulation falsification 2 uses the wrf pgw outputs for the 15 wy simulation in the future period with the current glacier coverage snow accumulation and streamflow from the reference simulation were evaluated against observed snow accumulation from alberta environment and parks aep snow survey courses and streamflow from environment and climate change canada s water survey of canada wsc hydrometric stations statistical indexes used to evaluate model simulations were the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmsd normalised rmsd nrmsd and model bias mb calculated as per fang et al 2013 2 5 hydrological index calculations several indices characterising the hydrological regime were examined including the rainfall ratio rr snow hydrology ratio shr snow damming ratio sdr and runoff coefficient rc rr is the cumulative rainfall divided by cumulative precipitation over a water year wy starting from 1 october to 30 september of the following year with rr greater than 0 5 indicating a rainfall dominated precipitation regime and rr less than 0 5 indicating a snowfall dominated precipitation regime shr is the cumulative snowmelt volume divided by cumulative precipitation over a wy with the higher shr indicating greater influence of snow hydrology on runoff sdr is adapted from lópez moreno et al 2020 to characterise the snowpack storage capacity that effectively dams precipitation compared to rainfall runoff during cold months and is estimated by the maximal difference between the cumulative fractions of precipitation and runoff for a wy starting from 1 october and ending 30 september of the following year with a higher sdr indicating that the seasonal snowpack acts to a greater degree as a natural water reservoir over the winter until snowmelt occurs rc is the cumulative streamflow volume divided by cumulative precipitation over a wy and normally varies between 1 and 0 with the higher rc reflecting better capability of basin to convert precipitation volume to streamflow volume 3 results 3 1 model evaluations crhm simulations of the snow accumulation swe using the reference simulation were compared to the monthly swe measurements from the following aep snow courses bow summit 2031 m a s l katherine lake 2380 m a s l bow river lake louise 1580 m a s l sunshine village 2230 m a s l and little elbow summit 2120 m a s l fig 5 simulated swe from the hrus corresponding to the location and land cover of these snow courses include the conifer forest 2120 m a s l and valley shrubland 2000 m a s l hrus from sub basin 2 in brb fig 5a the lower rock 2211 m a s l hru from sub basin 4 in brb fig 5b the river valley 1553 m a s l hru from sub basin 9 in brb fig 5c the alpine tundra 2322 m a s l hru from sub basin 43 in brb fig 5d and the regenerated forest 2149 m a s l hru from sub basin 3 in erc fig 5e the model generally reproduced snow accumulation and ablation patterns that were comparable to the measured swe with the noticeable overestimation of swe in most simulation years i e 2001 2003 2009 2015 compared to swe measurements at the little elbow summit snow course fig 5e and underestimation of swe in some simulation years i e 2006 2008 2012 compared to sunshine village snow course measured swe fig 5d for the 15 wy period 2000 2015 model simulations reasonably predicted swe when compared to snow courses in brb with mb ranging from 0 07 at sunshine village to 0 25 at katherine lake rmsd ranging from 52 mm at bow river lake louise to 132 mm at katherine lake and nrmsd varying from 0 21 at sunshine village to 0 32 at both katherine lake and bow river lake louise fig 5 simulations differed to a much greater degree from observations at the little elbow summit snow course in erc with mb of 0 51 rmsd of 175 mm and nrmsd of 0 72 the high mb value suggesting 51 overestimation compared to the observed swe have resulted from errors in the wrf forcing data and modelling of blowing snow redistribution into the regenerated forest hru that did not occur in nature model evaluation was also conducted using the crhm simulated streamflow from the reference simulation and the outlet streamflow discharge measured at wsc gauges bow river at banff brb pipestone river at lake louise prll bow river at lake louise brll and elbow river at calgary erc for 15 water years 2000 2015 fig 6 these gauges have no water management upstream and are suitable for a natural flow simulation such as used here they also represent high elevation steep partly glaciated and lake dominated environments brll high elevation steep environments prll nested within the mixed alpine subalpine montane valley bottom and high elevation environments with lakes and a small glacier coverage of the brb and contrasting montane forest and alpine front ranges and foothills environments of the erc the model reasonably simulated the daily streamflow at the brb and the 15 wy nse mb rmsd and nrmsd were 0 75 0 13 20 7 m3 s 1 and 0 57 respectively fig 6c for the two sub basins in upper brb the model achieved better streamflow simulation for prll with values of 0 70 0 02 4 3 m3 s 1 0 73 for nse mb rmsd and nrmsd respectively fig 6b whilst the 15 wy nse mb rmsd and nrmsd for brll were poorer at 0 38 0 25 8 9 m3 s 1 and 0 52 respectively fig 6a for the erc the simulation could capture daily streamflow for most years but missed peak flows in two flood years i e 2005 and 2013 and two high flow years i e 2008 and 2011 and so the 15 wy nse mb rmsd and nrmsd were 0 38 0 20 15 3 m3 s 1 and 1 32 respectively fig 6d this suggests errors in precipitation forcing from wrf over this basin comparison of the 15 wy mean daily streamflow for the brll shows that the model underestimated flow from middle may to early september and overestimated flow in october fig 6e which possibly resulted from underestimation of precipitation in wrf and model s delay in routing flow from glacier melt water leading to poor nse and mb values comparison with the 15 wy mean daily observed streamflow for the erc reveals that the model underestimated flow from late may to early july and displayed a flashier hydrograph from early august to middle september fig 6h this may be attributed to underestimation of precipitation in wrf and or errors in the model s simulation of rainfall generated streamflow the elbow river basin is composed of steep narrow mountain valleys that generate runoff quickly and may have challenged the routing in crhm or the ability of wrf to synthesise rainstorms for prll and brb comparisons of the 15 wy mean daily streamflow show that model estimated slightly higher winter flow fig 6f g likely caused by model s delay in glacier melt water overall given that the model was driven with synthetic meteorology without data assimilation within the wrf domain the results show remarkably good daily streamflow predictions for brb and its sub basin the prll and adequate predictions for daily streamflow for the brll sub basin of the brb and the erc without calibration suggesting that it can be employed to examine changes in climate in the region it is important to realise that the crhm model has produced very good results in this region when forced with locally observed meteorology fang et al 2013 pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a 3 2 changes in wrf meteorology due to climate change the wrf near surface meteorological variables were compared between ctl and pgw periods to show future changes in forcing climates fig 7 shows mean daily time series of changes in air temperature cumulative precipitation relative humidity wind speed shortwave and longwave irradiance for the bow and elbow river basins where mean annual changes shown in bold indicate they are statistically significant p 0 05 seasonal changes for the same variables shown in fig 7 are presented in table 3 the projections show that mean annual air temperatures will be warmer by 4 7 and 4 5 c in the pgw period for basins of brb and erc respectively fig 7a d spring and autumn temperatures will warm up more than the annual temperatures for both basins in the pgw period the dates of daily temperatures reaching 0 c in spring will advance by 20 days for brll to 28 days for erc whilst the dates of daily temperatures dropping below 0 c in autumn will fall 21 days later for prll to 29 days later for erc cumulative precipitation in the pgw compared to the ctl period will increase from 87 to 149 mm or by 12 15 fig 7e h in the brb more than half of the annual precipitation occur in winter under any scenario and the largest increases in seasonal precipitation in the pgw period will also occur in winter 110 142 mm table 3 for erc spring precipitation constitutes 45 or more of annual precipitation for any scenario and will increase by 58 mm in the pgw period precipitation is projected to decline by 5 25 mm and 2 11 mm respectively for summer and autumn in the pgw period for all basins table 3 decreases in mean annual relative humidity in the pgw period will range from 1 2 for erc to 3 0 for both brll and brb model domains fig 7i l with larger relative humidity decreases in spring and autumn table 3 mean annual wind speed is projected to decline by 0 1 m s 1 in the pgw period for all basins fig 7m p and reductions in seasonal wind speed in the pgw period will be less than 0 2 m s 1 table 3 there will be slight decreases in mean annual shortwave irradiance in the pgw period ranging from 5 0 w m 2 for erc to 7 8 w m 2 for prll fig 7q t with noticeably higher decreases in spring and increases in summer for all basins table 3 longwave irradiance will increase significantly in the pgw period for all basins in the range between 19 3 and 20 0 w m 2 annually fig 7u x with generally consistent increases in longwave irradiance throughout all seasons table 3 3 3 changes in water balance variables due to climate and concomitant glacier change the simulated annual water balance variables for all basins were compared between the reference and climate scenario simulation including the impact of deglaciation to show the hydrological changes predicted by the end of this century compared to the reference simulation annual rainfall will increase in all basins in the climate scenario simulation ranging from 158 mm or 42 increase for erc to 198 mm or 86 increase for brll fig 8 a d based on the seasons defined in table 3 rainfall will increase in winter spring and autumn in all basins with the highest increases in spring ranging from 84 mm for brll to 108 mm for erc followed by increases in winter from 26 mm for erc to 68 mm for brll for summer rainfall in the climate scenario simulation there will be small decreases ranging from 1 mm for erc to 11 mm for brll and no change for prll annual snowfall will decline in all basins under climate change ranging from 49 mm or 5 decrease for brll to 71 mm or 22 decrease for erc compared to the reference simulation fig 8e h there will be seasonal snowfall decreases in spring summer and autumn under climate change in all basins with the greatest decreases in spring of from 45 to 50 mm and in autumn ranging from 26 to 64 mm in contrast winter snowfall will increase under climate change in all basins ranging from 11 mm 8 increase for erc to 73 mm 11 increase for brll evapotranspiration et includes actual evaporation from soil intercepted rain and open water and transpiration from plants via withdrawals of soil moisture by roots and its annual values will be significantly higher under the climate scenario ranging from 68 mm 19 for erc to 109 mm 38 for brll fig 8i j et will initiate earlier in spring for all basins due to earlier snowcover depletion ranging from 11 days for brll to 25 days for erc sublimation includes fluxes from the surface snowpack blowing snow and forest canopy intercepted snow and its annual values will decrease significantly everywhere because of reduced snowfall and the effects on warmer air temperatures in suppressing blowing snow events and increasing unloading and melt drip of intercepted snow from forest canopies the annual decline in sublimation will range from 22 mm 36 for erc to 30 mm 28 for brll fig 8m p blowing snow transport is the net flux of snow redistributed by wind within a basin it does not represent a net loss or gain of swe from a basin but shows the degree of snow redistribution by wind from open tundras exposed glaciers and alpine ridgetops to lee slopes sheltered locations including glaciers gullies shrubs and treeline forests predictions showed that the annual blowing snow transport loss will decline significantly in the future because of reduced blowing snow occurrence with rising air temperatures wetter snowpacks and shorter snowcovered periods and the decreases in snow transport redistribution will range from 6 mm 27 for erc to 19 mm 32 for brll fig 8q t subsurface storage is the total water storage in soil and groundwater and is affected by complex interactions amongst et subsurface drainage and recharges from seasonal snowmelt glacier firnmelt and icemelt and rainfall subsurface storage will rise earlier in the spring by late century especially in the bow river basin and its sub basins as result of recharge from earlier snowmelt whilst the subsurface storage will decline in summer and autumn due to earlier and faster et over the longer summer overall the mean annual subsurface storage will decline from 23 to 19 saturation for brll and from 17 to 16 saturation for erc fig 8u x surface storage is the total storage in lakes stream channels and wetlands and its mean annual value will decline slightly under the climate scenario with declines ranging from 0 4 mm 18 for erc to 2 mm 28 for brll fig 8y ab glacier melt is the total melt from glacier firn and ice does not include glacier snowmelt and will decrease significantly in the warmer and deglaciated future fig 8ac af above lake louise the decrease in the annual glacier melt will be 35 mm for brll and 7 mm for prll the difference due to the higher remaining glacier coverage in brll 6 than in prll 1 7 annual glacier melt in the brb will decline by 24 mm largely driven by deglaciation upstream of lake louise the decrease in annual glacier melt will be very small for erc 0 05 mm due to little current glacier coverage in erc 3 4 changes in snow regime due to climate and concomitant glacier change the simulated snow accumulation and ablation regimes for all model domains were compared between the reference and climate scenario simulation including the impact of glacier decline on glacier snowpacks fig 9 to show changes by the end of the century where mean annual changes shown in bold indicate they are statistically significant p 0 05 predictions showed that the annual peak swe will increase in the bow river basins with significant increases of 3 mm 0 7 and 30 mm 4 in brb and brll respectively and an increase of 21 mm 3 in prll the timing of peak swe will advance by 18 days from 7 may to 19 april in brll and prll and from 6 may to 18 april in brb the erc snowpack will decline throughout the season with a 20 mm 32 decrease and one day delay from 19 april to 20 april in timing of peak swe table 4 future cumulative annual snowmelt volume will increase in the bow river basin ranging from 38 mm 5 in prll to 95 mm 11 in brll and 43 mm 7 in the brb whilst decreasing by 55 mm 19 in the erc table 4 similarly the date of seasonal snowpack depletion will advance from middle late august to late july early august in the bow river basin and from early july to mid june for erc as a result the seasonal snowcover converse being snow free period duration will decline increase everywhere ranging from 26 days shorter longer for prll to 46 days shorter longer for erc the seasonal snowmelt rate was estimated by dividing the annual peak swe by the days from peak swe to snowpack depletion and it will increase in the future from 4 5 mm d 1 to 4 7 mm d 1 in brb and from 5 9 mm d 1 to 6 5 mm d 1 in brll respectively in contrast the snowmelt rates will remain unchanged in prll at 5 9 mm d 1 and erc at 0 8 mm d 1 table 4 3 5 changes in streamflow regime due to climate and concomitant glacier change the future simulations include both climate change and glacier decline and predict the annual peak discharge will increase for the bow river basins but decrease for the erc fig 10 a d table 5 shows significant increases in the annual peak discharge ranging from 0 39 m3 s 1 for prll to 12 23 m3 s 1 for brb and a significant decrease in the annual peak discharge of 3 58 m3 s 1 for erc the timing of the annual peak discharge will advance by 15 to 17 days from late june to early june in the bow river basins and will occur three days earlier in the erc table 5 the timing of onset of spring freshet will advance 38 days from early may to late march for the bow river basins and 30 days from early april to early march for the erc fig 10a d the timing of the centre of flow volume d50 will advance 14 to 18 days in the bow river basins and 12 days in the erc table 5 annual streamflow volumes will increase by 11850 14130 106700 and 46 000 dam3 for brll prll brb and erc respectively fig 10e h corresponding to 4 8 11 and 18 increases in annual water yields for bow river at lake louise pipestone river at lake louise and bow river at banff and elbow river at calgary respectively the flow duration curve fig 10i k shows increases in daily streamflow for bow river basins for almost all exceedance probabilities ep under climate scenario for the 1 ep return period of 100 years daily streamflow will increase by 4 48 1 7 and 8 78 m3 s 1 for brll prll and brb respectively and for the 50 ep return period of 2 years daily streamflow will increase by 0 76 0 43 and 4 55 m3 s 1 for brll prll and brb respectively there will be less than 2 m3 s 1 decreases in daily streamflow for brll for the ep between 21 and 45 and for brb for the ep between 28 and 39 the flow duration curve fig 10 l shows daily streamflow for elbow river will increase for the ep greater than 4 i e return period of 25 years or less and will decrease for the ep less than 4 with the greatest decrease of 5 65 m3 s 1 occurring for the 0 5 ep return period of 200 years the changes in monthly streamflow discharge were calculated by subtracting the monthly discharge in climate change plus glacier decline simulation from that in the reference simulation fig 10m n shows monthly streamflow in bow river basins will increase notably for april to june with the greatest increases in may ranging from 8 42 m3 s 1 142 for prll to 38 28 m3 s 1 105 for brb monthly streamflows will decrease in bow river basins for july to september with the greater decreases in july ranging from 3 28 m3 s 1 19 for brll to 14 97 m3 s 1 23 for brb for autumn and winter months changes in monthly streamflow will be mixed in bow river sub basins with monthly streamflow in brll varying from a 0 7 m3 s 1 decrease in october to a 0 31 m3 s 1 increase in march and for prll ranging from a 0 16 m3 s 1 decrease in january and february to a 0 51 m3 s 1 increase in november in contrast monthly streamflows will mostly increase in brb during autumn and winter months ranging from 0 33 m3 s 1 in february to 3 74 m3 s 1 in november except for 0 08 m3 s 1 decrease in december for the elbow river monthly streamflow will increase for all months except for june and july ranging from increases of 0 93 m3 s 1 26 in december to 6 07 m3 s 1 48 in may contrasted with 2 45 m3 s 1 9 and 0 7 m3 s 1 6 decreases respectively in june and july fig 11 shows the comparison of 15 wy mean values for the hydrological indices between the reference and climate change plus glacier decline simulations for each basin the rr will increase from 0 2 to 0 33 for brll and 0 34 for prll and will rise from 0 27 to 0 41 for the brb as a whole bow river basins will remain snowfall dominated despite the increasing rr but not the elbow river where the rr will increase from 0 54 to 0 68 the shr will decrease by 0 01 0 05 and 0 05 to 0 73 0 74 and 0 66 for brll prll and brb respectively suggesting that snow hydrology will remain the overwhelmingly dominant runoff mechanism in the upper bow river above lake louise and will remain important for the bow river at banff for the elbow river the shr will decline from 0 42 to 0 3 indicating that rainfall runoff will become more dominant and snow hydrology less important by late century the sdr will increase by 0 04 0 01 and 0 02 to 0 43 0 41 and 0 36 for brll prll and brb respectively suggesting that snowpack s storage as natural water reservoir will rise slightly for bow river basins for the elbow river the sdr is currently low 0 06 and will decline to 0 04 indicating a very low snowpack storage capacity the rc will decrease by 0 04 0 02 and 0 02 to 0 52 0 55 and 0 48 for brll prll and brb respectively suggesting a future decline in streamflow generation efficiency for bow river basins for elbow river the rc will increase by 0 02 to 0 33 but streamflow generation efficiency will remain low 3 6 glacier falsification in falsification 1 i e wrf ctl climate with a diminished rcp8 5 projected glacier coverage annual streamflow volume declines by 24400 1130 and 36 960 dam3 for brll prll and brb respectively compared to the reference simulation fig 12 a c the reduced streamflow volume can be completely attributed to the 99 decrease in glacier ice volume projected by rcp8 5 in this case running with the wrf ctl climate this falsification estimates a current glacier wastage contribution of 8 9 0 6 and 3 7 of annual streamflow for bow river at lake louise pipestone river at lake louise and bow river at banff respectively for erc there was a minimal decrease i e 10 dam3 in annual streamflow volume with glacier removal from the basin fig 12d suggesting a negligible current glacier wastage contribution to the flow of the elbow river at calgary in falsification 2 i e wrf pgw climate with the current rgi 3 2 glacier coverage the annual glacier ice and firn melt will increase by 90 mm 184 42 mm 274 and 52 mm 163 for brll prll and brb fig 12e g indicating significantly higher annual glacier wastage contributions to the bow river basins if the future climate also had the current rgi 3 2 glacier coverage in contrast the increase in glacier wastage for this falsification was very small 0 05 mm for erc as result of its very limited current glacier coverage fig 12h 4 discussion uncalibrated hydrological simulations forced by wrf near surface meteorological variables at 4 km during 2000 2015 can make reasonable and useful predictions of seasonal snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow for headwater river basins in canadian rockies compared to field observations this is encouraging given the complex mountain terrain high heterogeneity of land cover and uncertainty in initial and boundary conditions in these basins the 4 km wrf near surface meteorological variables were found to be biased when compared to detailed weather station observations from a small well instrumented mountain research basin near to the brb and erb and bias correction by downscaling these 4 km wrf variables to observations improved hydrological simulations with a similar crhm model fang and pomeroy 2020 however observations are very sparse in the brb and erc especially at high elevations and this restricted opportunities to correct for wrf biases in this study thus these wrf variables especially precipitation without bias correction can cause the model unable to capture the extreme events such as the 2005 and 2013 floods and 2008 and 2011 high flows in the erc earlier modelling studies of the bow river headwaters have forced models either using sparse weather station observations farjad et al 2016 or coarse resolution numerical weather prediction outputs that were bias corrected to a single climate station gobena and gan 2010 the sparse or coarse resolution forcing data was not able to fully resolve mountain topography and models were heavily calibrated to streamflow which may have also compensated for errors in the forcing data thereby introducing an unacknowledged uncertainty in applying these models for assessing future mountain hydrology from climate change the uncalibrated approach with dynamically downscaled climate model forcings used here makes differences between predictions and observations fully apparent and does not attempt to compensate for biases in forcing meteorology thereby providing a more certain hydrological response to the dynamics of future climate with known model deficiencies uncalibrated hydrological modelling using crhm can reproduce the seasonality of the observed streamflow for the bow river headwater basins reflecting operation of the physically based routines for snow accumulation redistribution and melt however the model does have some deficiency in simulating streamflow for the bow river at lake louise that contains higher glacier coverage likely attributed to the general representation of routing for glaciers in that firn and ice melt is routed through linear reservoirs represented by firn and ice storage before being released to and routed through the subsurface and groundwater subsequently the slower routed glacier melt water to streamflow resulted in slightly higher winter flow for bow river at banff compared to the observation recent hydrological modelling using crhm showed good streamflow predictions for peyto and athabasca glacier basins in the canadian rockies aubry wake and pomeroy in review pradhananga and pomeroy 2022b suggesting that streamflow simulation for glaciers can be improved with more specific routing sequence for individual glaciers in addition the flashness in streamflow simulation for elbow river especially the rainfall generated streamflow reflects some challenges in routing flow in narrow mountain valleys and in representing large and complex foothills and agricultural regions with a relatively few numbers of hrus these limitations limit model performance and because it is uncalibrated are very apparent when examining synthesized streamflows in comparison to measured ones as the bow river headwater basins contain large variations in elevation aspect and slope and high heterogeneity of land cover the model considers different hrus based on criteria of elevation slope and aspect for glacier alpine rock and tundra as well as land cover types this model complexity is decided upon using the deductive and abductive reasoning approach described by pomeroy et al 2013 that is the deductive reasoning utilizes known physical laws and relationships to derive information from existing basin inventories and applies rule based continuity equations for predictions while abductive reasoning emphasizes the inference of information from research basins in the region this study avoids the inductive reasoning when deciding model complexity as such approach replies on calibration of current observations that can shift in the future climate and would be biased due to the synthetic meteorology used to force the model since the optimal model complexity is likely to change in a warming cold region such as the canadian rockies this model s spatial and process complexity was felt to be important to permit robust simulations and physical process diagnosis of future changes in mountain hydrology the basins of the bow river at banff and elbow river at calgary will warm up significantly by 4 7 and 4 5 c and will receive 12 to 15 more precipitation annually under the business as usual climate change scenario rcp8 5 the warmer and wetter future climates are similar to other findings for the late 21st century found in this region fang and pomeroy 2020 kienzle et al 2012 under climate change annual precipitation will transition towards more rainfall and less snowfall for all basins with the bow river basins remaining snowfall dominated whilst the elbow river will become a rainfall dominated regime for all basins rainfall will increase for all seasons except for summer when overall precipitation will decline in contrast snowfall will decrease for all seasons except for winter for both historical and future climates winter precipitation accounts for 50 or more of annual precipitation for the bow river basins whilst spring precipitation contributes at least 45 of annual precipitation in elbow river at calgary this is associated with the difference in seasonal weather patterns between the bow river and elbow river basins thériault et al 2015 wood et al 2018 pacific air masses produce storms that cross the continental divide from the west and precipitate over the central ranges of canadian rockies in winter whilst continental air masses generate infrequent but large upslope storms coming from the east and precipitating over the front ranges of canadian rockies in spring under climate change both the bow river and elbow river basins will experience reduced blowing snow transport diminished sublimation losses from blowing snow in the alpine and intercepted snow in forests shorter snowcovered periods and earlier snow depletion these changes are consistent with snow process based modelling results for warmer and wetter climates in canadian rockies front ranges fang and pomeroy 2020 lapp et al 2005 pomeroy et al 2015 rasouli et al 2022 tanzeeba and gan 2012 central ranges aubry wake and pomeroy in review and other high mountain basins lópez moreno et al 2013 2020 marty et al 2017 the decline in snowpacks throughout the season in the elbow river basin under the climate scenario appear to be influenced by warmer chinook events which develop frequently in the front ranges and foothills of canadian rockies and result in snowcover depletion from rapid melt and sublimation macdonald et al 2018 in contrast the higher peak snow accumulation and melt volumes under climate change in the bow river basins will result from the winter maximum in seasonal precipitation increases predicted for these basins the results also caused mixed responses in snowmelt rates under climate change with slightly higher melt rates for the bow river at banff but unchanged rates for elbow river at calgary which both contrast with predictions of slower snowmelt rates in a warmer climate for this region musselman et al 2017 the bow river headwaters contain a range of ecozones that span a large elevational gradient and the response of snowmelt rates to climate change varies in these ecozones due to the complex interplay amongst changes in air temperature precipitation snow redistribution albedo decay and seasonal variation in radiation fluxes to snowpack fang and pomeroy 2020 lopez moreno et al 2020 this study assessed the glacier contributions to streamflow in bow river headwaters based on a comparison of simulated mean annual streamflow volumes between hydrological models with current glacier coverage and a falsification consisting of a 99 reduction in glacier coverage for the same climate this is the same modelling approach for investigating glacier contribution to streamflow in bow river above lake louise employed by naz et al 2014 and for the peyto and athabasca glacier basins pradhananga and pomeroy 2022b for the bow river at banff the 3 7 glacier ice plus firn melt contribution to mean annual streamflow during 2000 2015 from this study is lower than the 4 9 during 2000 2009 estimated by bash and marshall 2014 and is higher than the 1 98 estimated during 1952 1993 by hopkinson and young 1998 the 2 2 during 1975 1998 by comeau et al 2009 and the 2 8 during 1976 1998 by demuth et al 2008 these differences result from the different initial glacier coverage interannual variabilities in streamflow and glacier wastage during these different periods bash and marshall 2014 demuth et al 2008 glacial retreat influence on glacial wastage naz et al 2014 and differences in melt calculation methodologies which range from temperature index estimates to energy balance melt models and various forcing meteorologies and scales as a result of shorter snowcover duration and earlier depletion under climate change the onset of the spring snowmelt freshet advanced from may to late march for the bow river basins and to early march for elbow river streamflow declined during july and august for bow river basins and during june and july for elbow river under climate change because of higher evapotranspiration loss reduced redistribution of snow causing faster snowpack depletion earlier meltwater availability and reduced alpine summer snowmelt and glacier melt the impact later in summer in the bow river is because of its greater glacier melt contribution and one month longer persistence of snowpacks the shift in spring snowmelt freshet and decline in summer streamflow with climate change have been found for many snow dominated basins in canadian rockies fang and pomeroy 2020 islam and gan 2015 kienzle et al 2012 rood et al 2008 and glacier melt dominated basins where climate change is accompanied by deglaciation aubry wake 2022 the annual peak discharge under climate change increased for the bow river basins but decreased for the elbow river this is due to the bow river basins being much more dominated by snow hydrology and having higher seasonal peak snowpacks and snow damming ratios for storing water to feed the spring freshet compared to the elbow river basin nevertheless both basins will have substantial increases in annual discharge volumes 11 for bow river at banff and 18 for the elbow river at calgary under climate change the increase in annual streamflow volume with climate change for the elbow river is very comparable to values found for other canadian rockies basins fang and pomeroy 2020 kienzle et al 2012 whilst the smaller increase for the bow river is attributed to diminished glacier contributions to streamflow under climate change for the two upper bow river basins the projected 4 increase in annual streamflow for bow river at lake louise is lower than 8 increase for the pipestone river at lake louise this reflects the reduced glacier contribution to streamflow suppressing the effect of higher precipitation in the high mountain partly glaciated and lake dominated basin of the bow river above lake louise compared to steep sparsely glaciated high mountain environments of the pipestone river basin the projected increases in streamflow for bow river headwaters contrast with earlier studies indicating declines in streamflow for this region in the 21st century farjad et al 2016 islam and gan 2015 decreasing streamflow from these earlier studies is attributed to coarse gcm rcm scale forcing data that have high degree of uncertainty and a large inter model variability in future precipitation for the canadian rockies low resolution climate models cannot reliably predict high mountain precipitation and convective storms in mountains that are important in governing the hydrology of the eastern slopes of the canadian rockies the dynamically downscaled climate change scenario and forcing data from wrf pgw for this study is felt to be an improvement on previous studies in the region that used statistically downscaled rcms or gcms that could not directly resolve mountain meteorology and precipitation processes wrf pgw is bounded by results from a 19 model rcm gcm ensemble mean change imposed on era interim forcing permits explicit convective storm microphysics representation and can resolve sharp mountain topography and orography with its 4 km resolution this study took advantage of the wrf pgw approach by running hydrological simulations with the 19 model ensemble mean change instead of each rcm gcm projection to avoid large uncertainties resulted from inter model variability limitations of this dynamically downscaled approach include the lack of multiple representations of future climate to permit assessment of forcing uncertainty introducing imbalances to lateral boundary forcing by adding nonlinear terms in climate change signal and the inability to track future storms and estimate the changes in future storm frequency and intensity as a result of non representation of nonlinear interactions between atmospheric circulation changes and climate warming li et al 2019 the research of gizaw and gan 2016 and sillmann et al 2013 has suggested that more frequent and intensive storm events in spring and summer are expected for the canadian rockies in late 21st century which could lead to a higher risk of future flooding wrf pgw can represent how past atmospheric dynamics will play out in a warmer wetter atmosphere but not these new atmospheric dynamics and thus caution should be taken in interpreting the results for peak annual flows this study examined the hydrological impact of climate change from the worst case high emission scenario represented by the business as usual rcp8 5 scenario while there are other emission scenarios such as low emission rcp2 6 and medium emission rcp4 5 scenarios the projected median changes for 2081 2100 relative to 1986 2005 based on cmip5 multi model ensemble include annual mean air temperature warming by 1 7 c in rcp2 6 and 2 9 c in rcp4 5 and annual precipitation increasing by 6 8 in rcp2 6 and 9 2 in rcp4 5 for alberta environment and climate change canada 2023 assessing the hydrological impact of these low to medium emission scenarios is recommended for the future study to explore the uncertainties among these climate change scenarios and some caution should be taken when interpreting this study s results using the rcp8 5 scenario in addition the 99 reduction in the glacier ice volume under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario was guided by a rcp8 5 deglaciation projection value of glacier volume for the southern canadian rockies clarke et al 2015 this rcp8 5 deglaciation projection is based on multi model gcm ensemble mean and has uncertainties in gcm future climate projections ice dynamics modelling and the surface mass balance model especially its empirical melt parameters these uncertainties could affect the future glacier extent projection and should be borne in mind when interpreting the results the results also suggest earlier snowmelt recharge of subsurface moisture in spring and lower subsurface moisture storage throughout the summer as a result of reduced snow redistribution earlier and faster snowmelt higher evapotranspiration and lower late summer precipitation under climate change this could prolong the fire season morgan et al 2008 westerling et al 2006 and increase risk of forest fire in this region macias fauria and johnson 2008 mori and johnson 2013 the projected warmer winter air temperature under climate change could develop favourable conditions for mountain pine beetle infestation and other forest diseases aukema et al 2008 woods et al 2005 impacts of forest disturbances pomeroy et al 2012 and effects of combined climate forest and soil changes rasouli et al 2019b on hydrological processes have been examined for marmot creek a small canadian rockies headwater basin such studies of combined climate glacier forest and soil changes on hydrological processes and basin response are needed for the larger canadian rockies sourced river basins to see how the combined impacts scale up to larger river basins and to better inform water resources and forest management adaptation to climate change 5 conclusions this study developed physically based hydrological models using the crhm platform that were forced with 4 km wrf near surface meteorology outputs in ctl i e 1 october 2000 to 30 september 2015 with current glacier coverage and pseudo global warming pgw i e 1 october 2084 to 30 september 2099 with representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 projected glacier coverage to diagnose the future changes in hydrology caused by the concomitant climate and glacier changes in several bow river headwater basins model evaluations using the observed snow accumulation and streamflow showed that the model is able to provide reasonable predictions of snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow for these basins except for adequate streamflow predictions for bow river at lake louise and elbow river under the business as usual climate change rcp 8 5 represented by the pgw period the basins of the bow river at banff and elbow river at calgary will warm by 4 7 and 4 5 c respectively and receive 12 to 15 more precipitation annually with both basins experiencing a greater proportion of precipitation as rainfall as a result increases in annual rainfall ranging from 158 mm 42 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 198 mm 86 for the bow river at lake louise and decreases in annual snowfall ranging from 49 mm 5 for the basins of the bow river at lake louise to 71 mm 22 for the elbow river at calgary will occur the high mountain winter snowfall will increase by from 11 mm 8 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 73 mm 11 for the bow river at lake louise despite the decline in spring and summer snowfall hydrological processes will have complex responses to the future climate including annual et increases ranging from 68 mm 19 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 109 mm 38 for the bow river at lake louise lower annual sublimation ranging from 22 mm 36 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 30 mm 28 for the bow river at lake louise slightly lower annual mean subsurface moisture content but greater soil drying in late summer and surface storage in lakes stream channels and wetlands decreasing by 0 4 mm 18 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 2 mm 28 for the bow river at lake louise common snow regime changes under the climate change between the basins of bow river and elbow river will include earlier snowcover depletion and substantially shorter snowcover duration with declines ranging from 26 days for the basins of the pipestone river at lake louise to 46 days for the elbow river at calgary sublimation losses from blowing snow transport and snow interception will decline substantially in all basins due to warmer winters suppressing blowing snow transport and increasing unloading of snow from forest canopies contrasting snow regime changes will include an increasing annual peak swe from 3 mm 0 7 for basins of the bow river at banff to 30 mm 4 for the bow river at lake louise higher annual snowmelt volume from 38 mm 5 for the pipestone river at lake louise to 95 mm 11 for the bow river at lake louise contrasting with 20 mm 32 lower peak swe and 55 mm 19 less snowmelt volume for the basin of the elbow river at calgary snowmelt rates will increase or remain unchanged ranging from 0 2 mm d 1 faster snowmelt rates for the basin of the bow river at banff and no change in melt rate for the elbow river at calgary the faster areal snowmelt is due in part to reduced snow redistribution from suppression of blowing snow and snow interception processes in warmer winters annual peak discharge for the bow river at banff under climate change will increase by 12 23 m3 s 1 and its timing will advance by 15 days with an 11 higher annual water yield despite the increase in annual water yield there will be a slight decline in streamflow generation efficiency for the bow river at banff due to the loss of most glacier contributions to streamflow under climate change by late 21st century in contrast peak discharge will decrease by 3 58 m3 s 1 and occur 3 days earlier with 18 greater annual water yield in the elbow river at calgary under climate change despite a slight increase in the runoff coefficient under climate change the elbow river at calgary will remain a relatively low water yield basin due to its reliance on rainfall runoff to support streamflow credit authorship contribution statement xing fang conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology software validation visualization writing

1931,this study diagnoses the impact of projected changes in climate and glacier cover on the hydrology of several natural flowing bow river headwater basins in the canadian rockies the bow river at lake louise 420 7 km2 the pipestone river near lake louise 304 2 km2 the bow river at banff 2192 2 km2 all of which drain the high elevation snowy partially glaciated central range and the elbow river at calgary 1191 9 km2 which drains the drier front ranges and foothills using models created using the modular flexible physically based cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm hydrological models were constructed and parameterised in crhm from local research results to include relevant streamflow generation processes for canadian rockies headwater basins such as blowing snow avalanching snow interception and sublimation energy budget snow and glacier melt infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils hillslope sub surface water redistribution wetlands lakes evapotranspiration groundwater flow surface runoff and open channel flow surface layer outputs from weather research and forecasting wrf model simulations for the current climate and for the late 21st century climate under a business as usual scenario representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 at 4 km resolution were used to force model simulations to examine the climate change impact a projected glacier cover under a business as usual scenario rcp8 5 was incorporated to assess the impact of concomitant glacier cover decline uncalibrated model simulations for the current climate and glacier coverage showed useful predictions of snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow when compared to surface observations from 2000 to 2015 under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario the basins of the bow river at banff and elbow river at calgary will warm up by 4 7 and 4 5 c respectively and receive 12 to 15 more precipitation annually with both basins experiencing a greater proportion of precipitation as rainfall peak snow accumulation in bow river basin will slightly rise by 3 mm whilst it will drop by 20 mm in elbow river basin and annual snowmelt volume will increase by 43 mm in bow river basin but decrease by 55 mm in elbow river basin snowcovered periods will decline by 37 and 46 days in bow and elbow river basins respectively due to suppressed snow redistribution by wind and gravity and earlier melt the shorter snowcovered period and warmer wetter climate will increase evapotranspiration and glacier melt if the glaciers were held constant and decrease sublimation lake levels soil moisture and groundwater levels the hydrological responses of the basins will differ despite similar climate changes because of differing biophysical characteristics climates and hydrological processes generating runoff climate change with concomitant glacier decline is predicted to increase the peak discharge and mean annual water yield by 12 23 m3 s 1 11 and 11 in the higher elevation basins of the bow river but will decrease the mean annual peak discharge by 3 58 m3 s 1 9 and increase the mean annual water yield by 18 in the lower elevation basin of the elbow river this shows complex and compensatory hydrological process responses to climate change with the reduced glacier contribution reducing the impact of higher precipitation in high elevation headwaters and drier soil conditions and lower spring snowpacks reducing peak discharges despite increased precipitation during spring runoff in the front range and foothills headwaters under a warmer climate keywords cold regions hydrology

canadian rockies are a vital source of freshwater to industry irrigation and domestic use in the lowland areas and are referred to as the one of the water towers of the world viviroli et al 2007 approximately 70 of annual runoff in major rivers of the saskatchewan nelson river and peace river systems originates from the canadian rockies ashmore and church 2001 and the high mountain headwaters on the eastern slopes of the canadian rockies provide up to 90 of streamflow to downstream users in canadian prairie provinces martz et al 2007 in the eastern slope headwaters of the canadian rockies streamflow is primarily generated from seasonal snowmelt and generally peaks during june rood et al 2008 whitfield and pomeroy 2017 with high flows generated from occasional convective rainfalls and associated rain on snow floods pomeroy et al 2016a shook 2016 glacier meltwater contributes significantly to streamflow during late summer and early fall and the relative contribution increases upstream towards the central ranges icefields and the continental divide bash and marshall 2014 comeau et al 2009 hopkinson and young 1998 snowmelt dominated regions are highly vulnerable to climate change in the 21st century adam et al 2009 and high mountains often respond more rapidly to climate change than do lower altitude regions beniston 2005 canadian rockies headwaters have been undergoing warming trends since last century debeer et al 2016 valeo et al 2007 harder et al 2015 showed warming of mean temperatures by 2 6 c and winter minimum temperatures by 3 6 c at the middle elevations of marmot creek a small canadian rockies headwater basin in the front ranges both greater than the regional average warming values for western canada reported by zhang et al 2000 the fraction of the precipitation as snowfall declines and rainfall ratio increases with the warming air temperatures knowles et al 2006 shook and pomeroy 2012 and this leads to decreases in seasonal snow accumulation fang and pomeroy 2020 lapp et al 2005 and earlier spring snowmelt runoff fang and pomeroy 2020 rood et al 2008 in the canadian rockies warming climate can cause changes to glacier contributions to streamflow in the southern canadian cordillera from glacier retreat debeer et al 2016 munro 2005 resulting in a shift in glacier fed river flow regimes demuth et al 2008 marshall et al 2011 many headwater rivers draining the canadian rockies eastern slopes over the 20th century have shown significant declining trends in annual flow volume burn et al 2004 flood peak and volume whitfield and pomeroy 2016 and summer flow rood et al 2008 with the predicted climate change in the 21st century ipcc 2013 and continuing economic development irrigation expansion and population growth leading to greater water demand in the downstream regions martz et al 2007 understanding the impacts of projected climate change on the hydrological cycle in the canadian rockies is important for managing the water supply from mountain headwaters to downstream regions in the future headwaters draining the canadian rockies eastern slopes span a large elevational gradient and contain a range of ecozones including icefield barren alpine alpine tundra subalpine forest montane forest rangeland and cultivated prairie streamflow generation in these ecozones is usually snowmelt dominated and is complex and highly variable fang and pomeroy 2020 kienzle et al 2012 pomeroy et al 2012 shea et al 2021 the large elevational gradient across ecozones influences temperature lapse rates wood et al 2018 and poses orographic effects on precipitation amount and phase smith 2008 thériault et al 2015 complex slope aspect patterns and high heterogeneity of forest structures in canadian rockies are additional factors affecting distribution of wind flow avalanching blowing snow sublimation losses and irradiance conway et al 2018 macdonald et al 2018 marsh et al 2012 musselman and pomeroy 2017 vionnet et al

pomeroy 2020 wang et al 2013 wayand et al 2018 rainfall can be widespread in spring and summer from frontal systems influenced by orography pomeroy et al 2016a and locally intense where there is convection scaff et al 2021 after rainfall glacier meltwater is a tertiary streamflow contributor on the eastern slopes and is governed by several factors the areal distribution of glaciers is highly related to regional temperature and precipitation variabilities shea et al 2004 and is further complicated by local topographic features such as elevation slope and aspect tennant et al 2012 and basin scale processes such as snow redistribution by wind and avalanche pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a the interannual variability of glacier mass balance in the headwaters influences streamflow generation and itself is influenced by climate variability and seasonal weather conditions demuth et al 2008 several studies have examined the impacts of climate change on snow accumulation snowmelt evapotranspiration glacier mass balance soil moisture storage and streamflow in the canadian rockies based on simulations of hydrological models driven by future climate scenarios generated by downscaling climate model outputs or perturbing current meteorological conditions aubry wake and pomeroy in review fang and pomeroy 2020 farjad et al 2016 islam and gan 2015 kienzle et al 2012 mahat and anderson 2013 rasouli et al 2019a 2022 hydrological models relying on streamflow calibration by employing the empirical degree day index approach for simulating snowmelt introduce substantial model uncertainty in predicting future changes due to lack of physically based process representations and possible parameter shifts in future climates or during extreme events such as rain on snow pomeroy et al 2013 walter et al 2005 climate models operating at coarse spatial resolution generally have poor precipitation and temperature accuracy in the canadian rockies rasouli et al 2019a and higher resolution atmospheric forcings have been found more suitable for providing more realistic representation of the forcing meteorology for hydrological simulations in the complex mountain

macdonald et al 2010 pomeroy et al 2009 pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a and have been extensively evaluated in mountain headwater basins fang et al 2013 fang and pomeroy 2016 pomeroy et al 2013 2016b pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a rasouli et al 2019a crhm has also been evaluated in the earth system models snow model intercomparison project and performed relatively well in modelling snowmelt at forest and alpine sites in canada france usa japan finland and switzerland krinner et al 2018 a recent application of the weather research and forecasting wrf atmospheric model at convection

mountain topography and can capture variations in near surface meteorology caused by mesoscale orography and convection crhm has been driven successfully by these wrf outputs to investigate impacts of climate change on hydrological processes in small canadian rockies and arctic headwater research basins aubry wake and pomeroy in review fang and pomeroy 2020 krogh and pomeroy 2019 the objectives of this study are to 1 deploy physically based hydrological models forced with 4 km wrf near surface meteorology outputs to simulate the cold regions hydrology of several diverse land cover complex terrain and varied climate canadian rockies headwater basins varying between 300 and 2000 km2 2 examine and diagnose the future changes in the hydrological processes and response of the region due to the projected climate and glacier changes for these headwater basins this will provide the most detailed assessment yet of the current hydrology and the expected changes in the headwaters of one of the most water stressed regions in canada and the results can be useful for national and provincial park management climate adaptation policy development flood mitigation plans and water supply planning and management for large cities and irrigation districts 2 methods 2 1 study area and model domains the study was conducted in the bow river at banff brb and the elbow river at calgary erc alberta canada fig 1 both basins originate in the eastern slopes of the canadian rockies and are headwaters of the bow river that flows eastward and ultimately contributes to the south saskatchewan river saskatchewan river lake winnipeg and the nelson river flowing to hudson bay both basins contain a range of alpine rock alpine tundra and subalpine forests dominated by conifers brb lies entirely in the mountains with approximately 1 7 of the basin area covered by glacier bolch et al 2010 whereas erc has miniscule glacier coverage but its area consists of 21 grazed grassland and forage cropland castilla et al 2014 both basins have high surface relief with elevations ranging from 1376 m a s l above sea level at the water survey of canada wsc streamflow gauge 05bb001 in banff to just over 3400 m for brb and from 1075 m at wsc streamflow gauge 05bj010 in calgary to just over 3200 m for erc the geology in the region is characterized with mainly faulted and folded sedimentary bedrock composed of limestone sandstone siltstone dolostone and shale prior et al 2013 with surficial soils consisting primarily of highly permeable glaciofluvial and recent alluvial deposits in mountains and foothills and relatively impermeable till and glaciolacustrine deposits in forage cropland region bayrock and reimchen 1980 the weather for the region is dominated by continental air masses with long cold and dry winters and short warm and sub humid summers westerly flow originating from the pacific ocean develops warm and dry chinook föhn conditions that lead to brief periods of air temperature above 0 c during winter months large storms from easterly upslope flows can generate deep spring snowpacks or runoff events annual precipitation ranges between 800 mm and 1500 mm in higher elevations demuth et al 2008 and is higher in the west with the observed long term 1971 2000 mean annual precipitation ranging from 569 mm in lake louise at 1524 m 472 mm in banff at 1384 m to 412 mm in calgary international airport at 1084 m environment and climate change canada 2020 the long term 1971 2000 mean annual air temperatures are 0 3 3 and 4 1 c in lake louise banff and calgary respectively with mean monthly air temperatures ranging from 13 8 9 3 and 8 9 c in january to 12 14 6 and 16 2 c in july for lake louise banff and calgary respectively environment and climate change canada 2020 drainage basins were delineated based on arcview gis 3 2 terrain preprocessing esri 1999 using a resampled 20 m canadian digital elevation model cdem and contain approximately 2192 2 km2 for brb above wsc streamflow gauge 05bb001 and 1191 9 km2 for erc above wsc streamflow gauge 05bj010 shown in fig 1 in the upper brb drainage basins were also delineated for bow river at lake louise brll 420 7 km2 above wsc streamflow gauge 05ba001 and pipestone river near lake louise prll 304 2 km2 above wsc streamflow gauge 05ba002 these delineated drainage basins are the model domains of hydrological model simulations for this study in addition 9 6 50 and 25 sub basins were delineated based on the stream segmentation process in gis terrain preprocessing for the brll prll brb and erc model domains respectively table 1 lists the physiographic information for the model domains and a sub basin map for the model domains is provided in the supplement 2 2 hydrological model 2 2 1 crhm overview crhm pomeroy et al 2007 2022 was used to set up hydrological models for this study crhm is an object oriented modular and flexible platform for assembling physically based hydrological models with crhm the user constructs a purpose built model from a selection of possible basin spatial configurations spatial resolutions and physical process modules of varying degrees of physical complexity basin discretization is performed via hydrological response units hrus whose number and nature are selected based on the variability of basin attributes and the level of physical complexity chosen for the model hru are landscape units that are assumed to have some common biogeophysical characteristics and hydrological drainage characteristic the user selects physical complexity in light of hydrological understanding parameter availability basin complexity meteorological data availability and the objective flux or state to be predicted pomeroy et al 2022 provide a full description of crhm and recent updates include penman monteith algorithm in the evaporation module for evapotranspiration from vegetation with seasonal variations in leaf area index and height fang and pomeroy 2016 a hillslope module for better representation of surface and subsurface runoff including detention flow on hillslopes pomeroy et al 2016b and a glacier module for simulating glacier melt based on mass and energy balance pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a 2 2 2 hru delineation elevation aspect slope and land cover gis layers were used and intersected in gis analysis to determine hrus fig 2 elevation aspect and slope were extracted from the 20 m cdem land cover was obtained from the open access alberta biodiversity monitoring institute abmi landsat derived land cover polygon c 2000 castilla et al 2014 glacier cover area was downloaded from the randolph glacier inventory rgi 3 2 that was mapped using orthorectified landsat5 thematic mapper scenes for years 2004 to 2006 bolch et al 2010 and was used to separate glacier from seasonal snowcover area in the brb model domain pine forest coverage from the alberta forest species avie inventory was obtained from alberta agriculture and forestry 2018 and used to separate pine and spruce forest for the erc model domain in addition the water courses in the alberta drainage network inventory alberta environment and sustainable resource development 2012 was used to determine river channel valley hru for glacier hru determinations seven elevation bands north facing south facing and east facing aspects and gentle medium and steep slope gradients were taken into consideration in order to provide sufficient discretization of snow redistribution precipitation and temperature gradients slope aspect effects on net radiation and slope effects on runoff generation for rock hru determinations upper and lower elevation and north facing south facing and east facing aspects were taken into consideration for similar reasons for alpine tundra alpine sparse forest and valley shrubland hrus north facing south facing and east facing aspects were considered noting that these landscapes occupy narrow elevation ranges for all other forest open water river valley developed and exposed hrus elevation aspect and slope were not used to define hru areas as slope has little impact on sub canopy snowmelt ellis et al 2013 and other landscape types occupied valley bottoms for the erc model domain fewer criteria were considered for hru determination for glacier rock and alpine tundra hrus north facing south facing and east facing aspects were taken into consideration but not for the rest of the hrus the numbers of delineated hrus for the model domains are shown in table 1 and flowcharts of hru determination and sub basin hru information are provided in the supplement 2 2 3 model structure a set of physically based modules was linked in crhm to simulate the dominant hydrological processes for the model domains fig 3 shows the schematic setup of these modules and details of each module are provided in table 2 for the large model domains in this study the crhm model structures were grouped so that a set of physically based modules were assembled with a number of hrus to represent a sub basin the structural grouping was repeated with same type of sub basin holding the same module configuration but differing parameter sets and numbers of hrus muskingum routing was used to route the streamflow output from these sub basins along the main river channels fig 4 shows the sub basin group structure for the model domains 2 2 4 model parameterization crhm parameters values were determined based on field studies in research basins in the canadian rockies and similar environments in the boreal forest subarctic and prairies by remote sensing or from gis inventories for the blowing snow module fetch length vegetation height stalk density and stalk diameter parameters were determined using methods in previous studies for open prairie environment fang et al 2010 and alpine environments in the canadian rockies fang et al 2013 macdonald et al 2010 for the canopy module leaf area index and snow interception capacity parameters were derived from measured values for the similar forest types in the western cordillera and boreal forest hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 2002 2012 schmidt and gluns 1991 for the albedo module parameters albedo of bare ground values were set using measurements from prairie environment armstrong 2011 and boreal forest granger and pomeroy 1997 the albedo of fresh snow was determined from the observations and recommendations of male and gray 1981 for the glacier module the glacier hru area was determined from the rgi 3 2 glacier cover area based on landsat5 thematic mapper scenes for years 2004 to 2006 bolch et al 2010 for the brb model domain and was derived from the abmi landsat derived ice cover polygon c 2000 castilla et al 2014 for erc model domain the glacier ice thickness parameter was set based on previous studies in the upper bow river basin clarke et al 2013 naz et al 2014 a glacier hydrology model for simulating glacier mass and energy balance in peyto glacier pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a was instrumental in setting up thickness and density for firn layers glacier ice density albedo for firn and ice and travel time of icemelt firnmelt and snowmelt through glacier ice firn and snowpack for the soil module soil depth and porosity parameters were estimated from information on the predominant soil textures in the region soil landscapes of canada working group 2011 for alpine rock alpine tundra and forests hrus the water storage capacity in soil and groundwater layers were set based on reported values from long term studies of marmot creek research basin beke 1969 fang et al 2013 the water storage capacity was set based on values used in the peyto glacier hydrology model pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a for glacier hrus and was determined for foothill grassland and cropland hrus using methods described for prairie environment fang et al 2010 for the routing module routing lengths for river channel hrus were determined from the alberta drainage network gis inventory alberta environment and sustainable resource development 2012 and for non river channel hrus from the modified hack s law for length area relationship reported by fang et al 2010 manning s equation was used to calculate the average streamflow velocities based on longitudinal channel slope manning s roughness coefficient and the channel hydraulic radius as parameters the longitudinal channel slope of a hru or a sub basin was estimated from the average slope of the hru or sub basin manning s roughness coefficient was approximated based on surface cover and channel conditions using values reported by chow 1959 the hydraulic radius was determined from chow s lookup table using channel shape and channel depth as criteria the routing sequence within a sub basin was set using a routing distribution parameter to represent the typical flow sequence amongst hrus fang et al 2010 fang et al 2013 while the routing sequence amongst sub basins followed the channel flow order downstream through the basin both routing sequences are provided in the supplement values for the key parameters are listed in the supplement tables 2 3 wrf model the wrf model version 3 6 1 li et al 2019 was used to develop the forcing meteorological fields used to drive the crhm hydrological models this version of wrf simulates weather systems at convection permitting 4 km resolution and can capture variations in near surface meteorology caused by mesoscale orography model outputs from two 15 year periods of wrf experiments were available consisting of a control ctl simulation and a pgw simulation the ctl simulation was forced with boundary condition from a 6 hour era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 and corresponds to a retrospective period of 2000 2015 the pgw simulation was forced with the 6 hour era interim reanalysis data plus a climate perturbation the climate perturbation was based on 19 model ensemble mean change from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 under a business as usual forcing scenario representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the pgw is equivalent to a future period of 2084 2099 more details of wrf model are provided by li et al 2019 there are 49 and 25 grids respectively of the 4 km wrf model outputs used to force the hydrological model simulations for brb and erc model domains out of the 49 grids in brb model domain 9 and 6 wrf grids respectively are for brll and prll model domains information on these wrf grids is provided in the supplement 2 4 hydrological simulations hydrological model simulations were driven by the wrf outputs of near surface meteorological variables including air temperature vapour pressure wind speed shortwave irradiance and precipitation where the air temperature and vapour pressure were used to estimate relative humidity required by crhm three types of simulations were conducted reference simulation use the wrf ctl outputs for the 15 water year wy simulation in the current period i e 1 october 2000 to 30 september 2015 with the current glacier coverage from the rgi 3 2 inventory bolch et al 2010 climate scenario simulation use the wrf pgw outputs for the 15 wy simulation in the future period i e 1 october 2084 to 30 september 2099 with glacier ice volume reduced by 99 from the reference simulation a value guided by the rcp8 5 glacier projection in the southern canadian rockies at the end of the 21st century and a glacier dynamics model clarke et al 2015 the rcp8 5 climate and deglaciation projections are considered a high emission climate change scenario and were used to examine the hydrological impact of the worst case scenario glacier falsification simulations falsification 1 uses the wrf ctl outputs for the 15 wy simulation in the current period with the glacier ice volume reduced by 99 from the reference simulation falsification 2 uses the wrf pgw outputs for the 15 wy simulation in the future period with the current glacier coverage snow accumulation and streamflow from the reference simulation were evaluated against observed snow accumulation from alberta environment and parks aep snow survey courses and streamflow from environment and climate change canada s water survey of canada wsc hydrometric stations statistical indexes used to evaluate model simulations were the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmsd normalised rmsd nrmsd and model bias mb calculated as per fang et al 2013 2 5 hydrological index calculations several indices characterising the hydrological regime were examined including the rainfall ratio rr snow hydrology ratio shr snow damming ratio sdr and runoff coefficient rc rr is the cumulative rainfall divided by cumulative precipitation over a water year wy starting from 1 october to 30 september of the following year with rr greater than 0 5 indicating a rainfall dominated precipitation regime and rr less than 0 5 indicating a snowfall dominated precipitation regime shr is the cumulative snowmelt volume divided by cumulative precipitation over a wy with the higher shr indicating greater influence of snow hydrology on runoff sdr is adapted from lópez moreno et al 2020 to characterise the snowpack storage capacity that effectively dams precipitation compared to rainfall runoff during cold months and is estimated by the maximal difference between the cumulative fractions of precipitation and runoff for a wy starting from 1 october and ending 30 september of the following year with a higher sdr indicating that the seasonal snowpack acts to a greater degree as a natural water reservoir over the winter until snowmelt occurs rc is the cumulative streamflow volume divided by cumulative precipitation over a wy and normally varies between 1 and 0 with the higher rc reflecting better capability of basin to convert precipitation volume to streamflow volume 3 results 3 1 model evaluations crhm simulations of the snow accumulation swe using the reference simulation were compared to the monthly swe measurements from the following aep snow courses bow summit 2031 m a s l katherine lake 2380 m a s l bow river lake louise 1580 m a s l sunshine village 2230 m a s l and little elbow summit 2120 m a s l fig 5 simulated swe from the hrus corresponding to the location and land cover of these snow courses include the conifer forest 2120 m a s l and valley shrubland 2000 m a s l hrus from sub basin 2 in brb fig 5a the lower rock 2211 m a s l hru from sub basin 4 in brb fig 5b the river valley 1553 m a s l hru from sub basin 9 in brb fig 5c the alpine tundra 2322 m a s l hru from sub basin 43 in brb fig 5d and the regenerated forest 2149 m a s l hru from sub basin 3 in erc fig 5e the model generally reproduced snow accumulation and ablation patterns that were comparable to the measured swe with the noticeable overestimation of swe in most simulation years i e 2001 2003 2009 2015 compared to swe measurements at the little elbow summit snow course fig 5e and underestimation of swe in some simulation years i e 2006 2008 2012 compared to sunshine village snow course measured swe fig 5d for the 15 wy period 2000 2015 model simulations reasonably predicted swe when compared to snow courses in brb with mb ranging from 0 07 at sunshine village to 0 25 at katherine lake rmsd ranging from 52 mm at bow river lake louise to 132 mm at katherine lake and nrmsd varying from 0 21 at sunshine village to 0 32 at both katherine lake and bow river lake louise fig 5 simulations differed to a much greater degree from observations at the little elbow summit snow course in erc with mb of 0 51 rmsd of 175 mm and nrmsd of 0 72 the high mb value suggesting 51 overestimation compared to the observed swe have resulted from errors in the wrf forcing data and modelling of blowing snow redistribution into the regenerated forest hru that did not occur in nature model evaluation was also conducted using the crhm simulated streamflow from the reference simulation and the outlet streamflow discharge measured at wsc gauges bow river at banff brb pipestone river at lake louise prll bow river at lake louise brll and elbow river at calgary erc for 15 water years 2000 2015 fig 6 these gauges have no water management upstream and are suitable for a natural flow simulation such as used here they also represent high elevation steep partly glaciated and lake dominated environments brll high elevation steep environments prll nested within the mixed alpine subalpine montane valley bottom and high elevation environments with lakes and a small glacier coverage of the brb and contrasting montane forest and alpine front ranges and foothills environments of the erc the model reasonably simulated the daily streamflow at the brb and the 15 wy nse mb rmsd and nrmsd were 0 75 0 13 20 7 m3 s 1 and 0 57 respectively fig 6c for the two sub basins in upper brb the model achieved better streamflow simulation for prll with values of 0 70 0 02 4 3 m3 s 1 0 73 for nse mb rmsd and nrmsd respectively fig 6b whilst the 15 wy nse mb rmsd and nrmsd for brll were poorer at 0 38 0 25 8 9 m3 s 1 and 0 52 respectively fig 6a for the erc the simulation could capture daily streamflow for most years but missed peak flows in two flood years i e 2005 and 2013 and two high flow years i e 2008 and 2011 and so the 15 wy nse mb rmsd and nrmsd were 0 38 0 20 15 3 m3 s 1 and 1 32 respectively fig 6d this suggests errors in precipitation forcing from wrf over this basin comparison of the 15 wy mean daily streamflow for the brll shows that the model underestimated flow from middle may to early september and overestimated flow in october fig 6e which possibly resulted from underestimation of precipitation in wrf and model s delay in routing flow from glacier melt water leading to poor nse and mb values comparison with the 15 wy mean daily observed streamflow for the erc reveals that the model underestimated flow from late may to early july and displayed a flashier hydrograph from early august to middle september fig 6h this may be attributed to underestimation of precipitation in wrf and or errors in the model s simulation of rainfall generated streamflow the elbow river basin is composed of steep narrow mountain valleys that generate runoff quickly and may have challenged the routing in crhm or the ability of wrf to synthesise rainstorms for prll and brb comparisons of the 15 wy mean daily streamflow show that model estimated slightly higher winter flow fig 6f g likely caused by model s delay in glacier melt water overall given that the model was driven with synthetic meteorology without data assimilation within the wrf domain the results show remarkably good daily streamflow predictions for brb and its sub basin the prll and adequate predictions for daily streamflow for the brll sub basin of the brb and the erc without calibration suggesting that it can be employed to examine changes in climate in the region it is important to realise that the crhm model has produced very good results in this region when forced with locally observed meteorology fang et al 2013 pradhananga and pomeroy 2022a 3 2 changes in wrf meteorology due to climate change the wrf near surface meteorological variables were compared between ctl and pgw periods to show future changes in forcing climates fig 7 shows mean daily time series of changes in air temperature cumulative precipitation relative humidity wind speed shortwave and longwave irradiance for the bow and elbow river basins where mean annual changes shown in bold indicate they are statistically significant p 0 05 seasonal changes for the same variables shown in fig 7 are presented in table 3 the projections show that mean annual air temperatures will be warmer by 4 7 and 4 5 c in the pgw period for basins of brb and erc respectively fig 7a d spring and autumn temperatures will warm up more than the annual temperatures for both basins in the pgw period the dates of daily temperatures reaching 0 c in spring will advance by 20 days for brll to 28 days for erc whilst the dates of daily temperatures dropping below 0 c in autumn will fall 21 days later for prll to 29 days later for erc cumulative precipitation in the pgw compared to the ctl period will increase from 87 to 149 mm or by 12 15 fig 7e h in the brb more than half of the annual precipitation occur in winter under any scenario and the largest increases in seasonal precipitation in the pgw period will also occur in winter 110 142 mm table 3 for erc spring precipitation constitutes 45 or more of annual precipitation for any scenario and will increase by 58 mm in the pgw period precipitation is projected to decline by 5 25 mm and 2 11 mm respectively for summer and autumn in the pgw period for all basins table 3 decreases in mean annual relative humidity in the pgw period will range from 1 2 for erc to 3 0 for both brll and brb model domains fig 7i l with larger relative humidity decreases in spring and autumn table 3 mean annual wind speed is projected to decline by 0 1 m s 1 in the pgw period for all basins fig 7m p and reductions in seasonal wind speed in the pgw period will be less than 0 2 m s 1 table 3 there will be slight decreases in mean annual shortwave irradiance in the pgw period ranging from 5 0 w m 2 for erc to 7 8 w m 2 for prll fig 7q t with noticeably higher decreases in spring and increases in summer for all basins table 3 longwave irradiance will increase significantly in the pgw period for all basins in the range between 19 3 and 20 0 w m 2 annually fig 7u x with generally consistent increases in longwave irradiance throughout all seasons table 3 3 3 changes in water balance variables due to climate and concomitant glacier change the simulated annual water balance variables for all basins were compared between the reference and climate scenario simulation including the impact of deglaciation to show the hydrological changes predicted by the end of this century compared to the reference simulation annual rainfall will increase in all basins in the climate scenario simulation ranging from 158 mm or 42 increase for erc to 198 mm or 86 increase for brll fig 8 a d based on the seasons defined in table 3 rainfall will increase in winter spring and autumn in all basins with the highest increases in spring ranging from 84 mm for brll to 108 mm for erc followed by increases in winter from 26 mm for erc to 68 mm for brll for summer rainfall in the climate scenario simulation there will be small decreases ranging from 1 mm for erc to 11 mm for brll and no change for prll annual snowfall will decline in all basins under climate change ranging from 49 mm or 5 decrease for brll to 71 mm or 22 decrease for erc compared to the reference simulation fig 8e h there will be seasonal snowfall decreases in spring summer and autumn under climate change in all basins with the greatest decreases in spring of from 45 to 50 mm and in autumn ranging from 26 to 64 mm in contrast winter snowfall will increase under climate change in all basins ranging from 11 mm 8 increase for erc to 73 mm 11 increase for brll evapotranspiration et includes actual evaporation from soil intercepted rain and open water and transpiration from plants via withdrawals of soil moisture by roots and its annual values will be significantly higher under the climate scenario ranging from 68 mm 19 for erc to 109 mm 38 for brll fig 8i j et will initiate earlier in spring for all basins due to earlier snowcover depletion ranging from 11 days for brll to 25 days for erc sublimation includes fluxes from the surface snowpack blowing snow and forest canopy intercepted snow and its annual values will decrease significantly everywhere because of reduced snowfall and the effects on warmer air temperatures in suppressing blowing snow events and increasing unloading and melt drip of intercepted snow from forest canopies the annual decline in sublimation will range from 22 mm 36 for erc to 30 mm 28 for brll fig 8m p blowing snow transport is the net flux of snow redistributed by wind within a basin it does not represent a net loss or gain of swe from a basin but shows the degree of snow redistribution by wind from open tundras exposed glaciers and alpine ridgetops to lee slopes sheltered locations including glaciers gullies shrubs and treeline forests predictions showed that the annual blowing snow transport loss will decline significantly in the future because of reduced blowing snow occurrence with rising air temperatures wetter snowpacks and shorter snowcovered periods and the decreases in snow transport redistribution will range from 6 mm 27 for erc to 19 mm 32 for brll fig 8q t subsurface storage is the total water storage in soil and groundwater and is affected by complex interactions amongst et subsurface drainage and recharges from seasonal snowmelt glacier firnmelt and icemelt and rainfall subsurface storage will rise earlier in the spring by late century especially in the bow river basin and its sub basins as result of recharge from earlier snowmelt whilst the subsurface storage will decline in summer and autumn due to earlier and faster et over the longer summer overall the mean annual subsurface storage will decline from 23 to 19 saturation for brll and from 17 to 16 saturation for erc fig 8u x surface storage is the total storage in lakes stream channels and wetlands and its mean annual value will decline slightly under the climate scenario with declines ranging from 0 4 mm 18 for erc to 2 mm 28 for brll fig 8y ab glacier melt is the total melt from glacier firn and ice does not include glacier snowmelt and will decrease significantly in the warmer and deglaciated future fig 8ac af above lake louise the decrease in the annual glacier melt will be 35 mm for brll and 7 mm for prll the difference due to the higher remaining glacier coverage in brll 6 than in prll 1 7 annual glacier melt in the brb will decline by 24 mm largely driven by deglaciation upstream of lake louise the decrease in annual glacier melt will be very small for erc 0 05 mm due to little current glacier coverage in erc 3 4 changes in snow regime due to climate and concomitant glacier change the simulated snow accumulation and ablation regimes for all model domains were compared between the reference and climate scenario simulation including the impact of glacier decline on glacier snowpacks fig 9 to show changes by the end of the century where mean annual changes shown in bold indicate they are statistically significant p 0 05 predictions showed that the annual peak swe will increase in the bow river basins with significant increases of 3 mm 0 7 and 30 mm 4 in brb and brll respectively and an increase of 21 mm 3 in prll the timing of peak swe will advance by 18 days from 7 may to 19 april in brll and prll and from 6 may to 18 april in brb the erc snowpack will decline throughout the season with a 20 mm 32 decrease and one day delay from 19 april to 20 april in timing of peak swe table 4 future cumulative annual snowmelt volume will increase in the bow river basin ranging from 38 mm 5 in prll to 95 mm 11 in brll and 43 mm 7 in the brb whilst decreasing by 55 mm 19 in the erc table 4 similarly the date of seasonal snowpack depletion will advance from middle late august to late july early august in the bow river basin and from early july to mid june for erc as a result the seasonal snowcover converse being snow free period duration will decline increase everywhere ranging from 26 days shorter longer for prll to 46 days shorter longer for erc the seasonal snowmelt rate was estimated by dividing the annual peak swe by the days from peak swe to snowpack depletion and it will increase in the future from 4 5 mm d 1 to 4 7 mm d 1 in brb and from 5 9 mm d 1 to 6 5 mm d 1 in brll respectively in contrast the snowmelt rates will remain unchanged in prll at 5 9 mm d 1 and erc at 0 8 mm d 1 table 4 3 5 changes in streamflow regime due to climate and concomitant glacier change the future simulations include both climate change and glacier decline and predict the annual peak discharge will increase for the bow river basins but decrease for the erc fig 10 a d table 5 shows significant increases in the annual peak discharge ranging from 0 39 m3 s 1 for prll to 12 23 m3 s 1 for brb and a significant decrease in the annual peak discharge of 3 58 m3 s 1 for erc the timing of the annual peak discharge will advance by 15 to 17 days from late june to early june in the bow river basins and will occur three days earlier in the erc table 5 the timing of onset of spring freshet will advance 38 days from early may to late march for the bow river basins and 30 days from early april to early march for the erc fig 10a d the timing of the centre of flow volume d50 will advance 14 to 18 days in the bow river basins and 12 days in the erc table 5 annual streamflow volumes will increase by 11850 14130 106700 and 46 000 dam3 for brll prll brb and erc respectively

flow duration curve fig 10i k shows increases in daily streamflow for bow river basins for almost all exceedance probabilities ep under climate scenario for the 1 ep return period of 100 years daily streamflow will increase by 4 48 1 7 and 8 78 m3 s 1 for brll prll and brb respectively and for the 50 ep return period of 2 years daily streamflow will increase by 0 76 0 43 and 4 55 m3 s 1 for brll prll and brb respectively there will be less than 2 m3 s 1 decreases in daily streamflow for brll for the ep between 21 and 45 and for brb for the ep between 28 and 39 the flow duration curve fig 10 l shows daily streamflow for elbow river will increase for the ep greater than 4 i e return period of 25 years or less and will decrease for the ep less than 4 with the greatest decrease of 5 65 m3 s 1 occurring for the 0 5 ep return period of 200 years the changes in monthly streamflow discharge were calculated by subtracting the monthly discharge in climate change plus glacier decline simulation from that in the reference simulation fig 10m n shows monthly streamflow in bow river basins will increase notably for april to june with the greatest increases in may ranging from 8 42 m3 s 1 142 for prll to 38 28 m3 s 1 105 for brb monthly streamflows will decrease in bow river basins for july to september with the greater decreases in july ranging from 3 28 m3 s 1 19 for brll to 14 97 m3 s 1 23 for brb for autumn and winter months changes in monthly streamflow will be mixed in bow river sub basins with monthly streamflow in brll varying from a 0 7 m3 s 1 decrease in october to a 0 31 m3 s 1 increase in march and for prll ranging from a 0 16 m3 s 1 decrease in january and february to a 0 51 m3 s 1 increase in november in contrast monthly streamflows will mostly increase in brb during autumn and winter months ranging from 0 33 m3 s 1 in february to 3 74 m3 s 1 in november except for 0 08 m3 s 1 decrease in december for the elbow river monthly streamflow will increase for all months except for june and july ranging from increases of 0 93 m3 s 1 26 in december to 6 07 m3 s 1 48 in may contrasted with 2 45 m3 s 1 9 and 0 7 m3 s 1 6 decreases respectively in june and july fig 11 shows the comparison of 15 wy mean values for the hydrological indices between the reference and climate change plus glacier decline simulations for each basin the rr will increase from 0 2 to 0 33 for brll and 0 34 for prll and will rise from 0 27 to 0 41 for the brb as a whole bow river basins will remain snowfall dominated despite the increasing rr but not the elbow river where the rr will increase from 0 54 to 0 68 the shr will decrease by 0 01 0 05 and 0 05 to 0 73 0 74 and 0 66 for brll prll and brb respectively suggesting that snow hydrology will remain the overwhelmingly dominant runoff mechanism in the upper bow river above lake louise and will remain important for the bow river at banff for the elbow river the shr will decline from 0 42 to 0 3 indicating that rainfall runoff will become more dominant and snow hydrology less important by late century the sdr will increase by 0 04 0 01 and 0 02 to 0 43 0 41 and 0 36 for brll prll and brb respectively suggesting that snowpack s storage as natural water reservoir will rise slightly for bow river basins for the elbow river the sdr is currently low 0 06 and will decline to 0 04 indicating a very low snowpack storage capacity the rc will decrease by 0 04 0 02 and 0 02 to 0 52 0 55 and 0 48 for brll prll and brb respectively suggesting a future decline in streamflow generation efficiency for bow river basins for elbow river the rc will increase by 0 02 to 0 33 but streamflow generation efficiency will remain low 3 6 glacier falsification in falsification 1 i e wrf ctl climate with a diminished rcp8 5 projected glacier coverage annual streamflow volume declines by 24400 1130 and 36 960 dam3 for brll prll and brb respectively compared to the reference simulation fig 12 a c the reduced streamflow volume can be completely attributed to the 99 decrease in glacier ice volume projected by rcp8 5 in this case running with the wrf ctl climate this falsification estimates a current glacier wastage contribution of 8 9 0 6 and 3 7 of annual streamflow for bow river at lake louise pipestone river at lake louise and bow river at banff respectively for erc there was a minimal decrease i e 10 dam3 in annual streamflow volume with glacier removal from the basin fig 12d suggesting a negligible current glacier wastage contribution to the flow of the elbow river at calgary in falsification 2 i e wrf pgw climate with the current rgi 3 2 glacier coverage the annual glacier ice and firn melt will increase by 90 mm 184 42 mm 274 and 52 mm 163 for brll prll and brb fig 12e g indicating significantly higher annual glacier wastage contributions to the bow river basins if the future climate also had the current rgi 3 2 glacier coverage in contrast the increase in glacier wastage for this falsification was very small 0 05 mm for erc as result of its very limited current glacier coverage fig 12h 4 discussion uncalibrated hydrological simulations forced by wrf near surface meteorological variables at 4 km during 2000 2015 can make reasonable and useful predictions of seasonal snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow for headwater river basins in canadian rockies compared to field observations this is encouraging given the complex mountain terrain high heterogeneity of land cover and uncertainty in initial and boundary conditions in these basins the 4 km wrf near surface meteorological variables were found to be biased when compared to detailed weather station observations from a small well instrumented mountain research basin near to the brb and erb and bias correction by downscaling these 4 km wrf variables to observations improved hydrological simulations with a similar crhm model fang and pomeroy 2020 however observations are very sparse in the brb and erc especially at high elevations and this restricted opportunities to correct for wrf biases in this study thus these wrf variables especially precipitation without bias correction can cause the model unable to capture the extreme events such as the 2005 and 2013 floods and 2008 and 2011 high flows in the erc earlier modelling studies of the bow river headwaters have forced models either using sparse weather station observations farjad et al 2016 or coarse resolution numerical weather prediction outputs that were bias corrected to a single climate station gobena and gan 2010 the sparse or coarse resolution forcing data was not able to fully resolve mountain topography and models were heavily calibrated to streamflow which may have also compensated for errors in the forcing data thereby introducing an unacknowledged uncertainty in applying these models for assessing future mountain hydrology from climate change the uncalibrated approach with dynamically downscaled climate model forcings used here makes differences between predictions and observations fully apparent and does not attempt to compensate for biases in forcing meteorology thereby providing a more certain hydrological response to the dynamics of future climate with known model deficiencies uncalibrated hydrological modelling using crhm can reproduce the seasonality of the observed streamflow for the bow river headwater basins reflecting operation of the physically based routines for snow accumulation redistribution and melt however the model does have some deficiency in simulating streamflow for the bow river at lake louise that contains higher glacier coverage likely attributed to the general representation of routing for glaciers in that firn and ice melt is routed through linear reservoirs represented by firn and ice storage before being released to and routed through the subsurface and groundwater subsequently the slower routed glacier melt water to streamflow resulted in slightly higher winter flow for bow river at banff compared to the observation recent hydrological modelling using crhm showed good streamflow predictions for peyto and athabasca glacier basins in the canadian rockies aubry wake and pomeroy in review pradhananga and pomeroy 2022b suggesting that streamflow simulation for glaciers can be improved with more specific routing sequence for individual glaciers in addition the flashness in streamflow simulation for elbow river especially the rainfall generated streamflow reflects some challenges in routing flow in narrow mountain valleys and in representing large and complex foothills and agricultural regions with a relatively few numbers of hrus these limitations limit model performance and because it is uncalibrated are very apparent when examining synthesized streamflows in comparison to measured ones as the bow river headwater basins contain large variations in elevation aspect and slope and high heterogeneity of land cover the model considers different hrus based on criteria of elevation slope and aspect for glacier alpine rock and tundra as well as land cover types this model complexity is decided upon using the deductive and abductive reasoning approach described by pomeroy et al 2013 that is the deductive reasoning utilizes known physical laws and relationships to derive information from existing basin inventories and applies rule based continuity equations for predictions while abductive reasoning emphasizes the inference of information from research basins in the region this study avoids the inductive reasoning when deciding model complexity as such approach replies on calibration of current observations that can shift in the future climate and would be biased due to the synthetic meteorology used to force the model since the optimal model complexity is likely to change in a warming cold region such as the canadian rockies this model s spatial and process complexity was felt to be important to permit robust simulations and physical process diagnosis of future changes in mountain hydrology the basins of the bow river at banff and elbow river at calgary will warm up significantly by 4 7 and 4 5 c and will receive 12 to 15 more precipitation annually under the business as usual climate change scenario rcp8 5 the warmer and wetter future climates are similar to other findings for the late 21st century found in this region fang and pomeroy 2020 kienzle et al 2012 under climate change annual precipitation will transition towards more rainfall and less snowfall for all basins with the bow river basins remaining snowfall dominated whilst the elbow river will become a rainfall dominated regime for all basins rainfall will increase for all seasons except for summer when overall precipitation will decline in contrast snowfall will decrease for all seasons except for winter for both historical and future climates winter precipitation accounts for 50 or more of annual precipitation for the bow river basins whilst spring precipitation contributes at least 45 of annual precipitation in elbow river at calgary this is associated with the difference in seasonal weather patterns between the bow river and elbow river basins thériault et al 2015 wood et al 2018 pacific air masses produce storms that cross the continental divide from the west and precipitate over the central ranges of canadian rockies in winter whilst continental air masses generate infrequent but large upslope storms coming from the east and precipitating over the front ranges of canadian rockies in spring under climate change both the bow river and elbow river basins will experience reduced blowing snow transport diminished sublimation losses from blowing snow in the alpine and intercepted snow in forests shorter snowcovered periods and earlier snow depletion these changes are consistent with snow process based modelling results for warmer and wetter climates in canadian rockies front ranges fang and pomeroy 2020 lapp et al 2005 pomeroy et al 2015 rasouli et al 2022 tanzeeba and gan 2012 central ranges aubry wake and pomeroy in review and other high mountain basins lópez moreno et al 2013 2020 marty et al 2017 the decline in snowpacks throughout the season in the elbow river basin under the climate scenario appear to be influenced by warmer chinook events which develop frequently in the front ranges and foothills of canadian rockies and result in snowcover depletion from rapid melt and sublimation macdonald et al 2018 in contrast the higher peak snow accumulation and melt volumes under climate change in the bow river basins will result from the winter maximum in seasonal precipitation increases predicted for these basins the results also caused mixed responses in snowmelt rates under climate change with slightly higher melt rates for the bow river at banff but unchanged rates for elbow river at calgary which both contrast with predictions of slower snowmelt rates in a warmer climate for this region musselman et al 2017 the bow river headwaters contain a range of ecozones that span a large elevational gradient and the response of snowmelt rates to climate change varies in these ecozones due to the complex interplay amongst changes in air temperature precipitation snow redistribution albedo decay and seasonal variation in radiation fluxes to snowpack fang and pomeroy 2020 lopez moreno et al 2020 this study assessed the glacier contributions to streamflow in bow river headwaters based on a comparison of simulated mean annual streamflow volumes between hydrological models with current glacier coverage and a falsification consisting of a 99 reduction in glacier coverage for the same climate this is the same modelling approach for investigating glacier contribution to streamflow in bow river above lake louise employed by naz et al 2014 and for the peyto and athabasca glacier basins pradhananga and pomeroy 2022b for the bow river at banff the 3 7 glacier ice plus firn melt contribution to mean annual streamflow during 2000 2015 from this study is lower than the 4 9 during 2000 2009 estimated by bash and marshall 2014 and is higher than the 1 98 estimated during 1952 1993 by hopkinson and young 1998 the 2 2 during 1975 1998 by comeau et al 2009 and the 2 8 during 1976 1998 by demuth et al 2008 these differences result from the different initial glacier coverage interannual variabilities in streamflow and glacier wastage during these different periods bash and marshall 2014 demuth et al 2008 glacial retreat influence on glacial wastage naz et al 2014 and differences in melt calculation methodologies which range from temperature index estimates to energy balance melt models and various forcing meteorologies and scales as a result of shorter snowcover duration and earlier depletion under climate change the onset of the spring snowmelt freshet advanced from may to late march for the bow river basins and to early march for elbow river streamflow declined during july and august for bow river basins and during june and july for elbow river under climate change because of higher evapotranspiration loss reduced redistribution of snow causing faster snowpack depletion earlier meltwater availability and reduced alpine summer snowmelt and glacier melt the impact later in summer in the bow river is because of its greater glacier melt contribution and one month longer persistence of snowpacks the shift in spring snowmelt freshet and decline in summer streamflow with climate change have been found for many snow dominated basins in canadian rockies fang and pomeroy 2020 islam and gan 2015 kienzle et al 2012 rood et al 2008 and glacier melt dominated basins where climate change is accompanied by deglaciation aubry wake 2022 the annual peak discharge under climate change increased for the bow river basins but decreased for the elbow river this is due to the bow river basins being much more dominated by snow hydrology and having higher seasonal peak snowpacks and snow damming ratios for storing water to feed the spring freshet compared to the elbow river basin nevertheless both basins will have substantial increases in annual discharge volumes 11 for bow river at banff and 18 for the elbow river at calgary under climate change the increase in annual streamflow volume with climate change for the elbow river is very comparable to values found for other canadian rockies basins fang and pomeroy 2020 kienzle et al 2012 whilst the smaller increase for the bow river is attributed to diminished glacier contributions to streamflow under climate change for the two upper bow river basins the projected 4 increase in annual streamflow for bow river at lake louise is lower than 8 increase for the pipestone river at lake louise this reflects the reduced glacier contribution to streamflow suppressing the effect of higher precipitation in the high mountain partly glaciated and lake dominated basin of the bow river above lake louise compared to steep sparsely glaciated high mountain environments of the pipestone river basin the projected increases in streamflow for bow river headwaters contrast with earlier studies indicating declines in streamflow for this region in the 21st century farjad et al 2016 islam and gan 2015 decreasing streamflow from these earlier studies is attributed to coarse gcm rcm scale forcing data that have high degree of uncertainty and a large inter model variability in future precipitation for the canadian rockies low resolution climate models cannot reliably predict high mountain precipitation and convective storms in mountains that are important in governing the hydrology of the eastern slopes of the canadian rockies the dynamically downscaled climate change scenario and forcing data from wrf pgw for this study is felt to be an improvement on previous studies in the region that used statistically downscaled rcms or gcms that could not directly resolve mountain meteorology and precipitation processes wrf pgw is bounded by results from a 19 model rcm gcm ensemble mean change imposed on era interim forcing permits explicit convective storm microphysics representation and can resolve sharp mountain topography and orography with its 4 km resolution this study took advantage of the wrf pgw approach by running hydrological simulations with the 19 model ensemble mean change instead of each rcm gcm projection to avoid large uncertainties resulted from inter model variability limitations of this dynamically downscaled approach include the lack of multiple representations of future climate to permit assessment of forcing uncertainty introducing imbalances to lateral boundary forcing by adding nonlinear terms in climate change signal and the inability to track future storms and estimate the changes in future storm frequency and intensity as a result of non representation of nonlinear interactions between atmospheric circulation changes and climate warming li et al 2019 the research of gizaw and gan 2016 and sillmann et al 2013 has suggested that more frequent and intensive storm events in spring and summer are expected for the canadian rockies in late 21st century which could lead to a higher risk of future flooding wrf pgw can represent how past atmospheric dynamics will play out in a warmer wetter atmosphere but not these new atmospheric dynamics and thus caution should be taken in interpreting the results for peak annual flows this study examined the hydrological impact of climate change from the worst case high emission scenario represented by the business as usual rcp8 5 scenario while there are other emission scenarios such as low emission rcp2 6 and medium emission rcp4 5 scenarios the projected median changes for 2081 2100 relative to 1986 2005 based on cmip5 multi model ensemble include annual mean air temperature warming by 1 7 c in rcp2 6 and 2 9 c in rcp4 5 and annual precipitation increasing by 6 8 in rcp2 6 and 9 2 in rcp4 5 for alberta environment and climate change canada 2023 assessing the hydrological impact of these low to medium emission scenarios is recommended for the future study to explore the uncertainties among these climate change scenarios and some caution should be taken when interpreting this study s results using the rcp8 5 scenario in addition the 99 reduction in the glacier ice volume under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario was guided by a rcp8 5 deglaciation projection value of glacier volume for the southern canadian rockies clarke et al 2015 this rcp8 5 deglaciation projection is based on multi model gcm ensemble mean and has uncertainties in gcm future climate projections ice dynamics modelling and the surface mass balance model especially its empirical melt parameters these uncertainties could affect the future glacier extent projection and should be borne in mind when interpreting the results the results also suggest earlier snowmelt recharge of subsurface moisture in spring and lower subsurface moisture storage throughout the summer as a result of reduced snow redistribution earlier and faster snowmelt higher evapotranspiration and lower late summer precipitation under climate change this could prolong the fire season morgan et al 2008 westerling et al 2006 and increase risk of forest fire in this region macias fauria and johnson 2008 mori and johnson 2013 the projected warmer winter air temperature under climate change could develop favourable conditions for mountain pine beetle infestation and other forest diseases aukema et al 2008 woods et al 2005 impacts of forest disturbances pomeroy et al 2012 and effects of combined climate forest and soil changes rasouli et al 2019b on hydrological processes have been examined for marmot creek a small canadian rockies headwater basin such studies of combined climate glacier forest and soil changes on hydrological processes and basin response are needed for the larger canadian rockies sourced river basins to see how the combined impacts scale up to larger river basins and to better inform water resources and forest management adaptation to climate change 5 conclusions this study developed physically based hydrological models using the crhm platform that were forced with 4 km wrf near surface meteorology outputs in ctl i e 1 october 2000 to 30 september 2015 with current glacier coverage and pseudo global warming pgw i e 1 october 2084 to 30 september 2099 with representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 projected glacier coverage to diagnose the future changes in hydrology caused by the concomitant climate and glacier changes in several bow river headwater basins model evaluations using the observed snow accumulation and streamflow showed that the model is able to provide reasonable predictions of snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow for these basins except for adequate streamflow predictions for bow river at lake louise and elbow river under the business as usual climate change rcp 8 5 represented by the pgw period the basins of the bow river at banff and elbow river at calgary will warm by 4 7 and 4 5 c respectively and receive 12 to 15 more precipitation annually with both basins experiencing a greater proportion of precipitation as rainfall as a result increases in annual rainfall ranging from 158 mm 42 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 198 mm 86 for the bow river at lake louise and decreases in annual snowfall ranging from 49 mm 5 for the basins of the bow river at lake louise to 71 mm 22 for the elbow river at calgary will occur the high mountain winter snowfall will increase by from 11 mm 8 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 73 mm 11 for the bow river at lake louise despite the decline in spring and summer snowfall hydrological processes will have complex responses to the future climate including annual et increases ranging from 68 mm 19 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 109 mm 38 for the bow river at lake louise lower annual sublimation ranging from 22 mm 36 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 30 mm 28 for the bow river at lake louise slightly lower annual mean subsurface moisture content but greater soil drying in late summer and surface storage in lakes stream channels and wetlands decreasing by 0 4 mm 18 for basins of the elbow river at calgary to 2 mm 28 for the bow river at lake louise common snow regime changes under the climate change between the basins of bow river and elbow river will include earlier snowcover depletion and substantially shorter snowcover duration with declines ranging from 26 days for the basins of the pipestone river at lake louise to 46 days for the elbow river at calgary sublimation losses from blowing snow transport and snow interception will decline substantially in all basins due to warmer winters suppressing blowing snow transport and increasing unloading of snow from forest canopies contrasting snow regime changes will include an increasing annual peak swe from 3 mm 0 7 for basins of the bow river at banff to 30 mm 4 for the bow river at lake louise higher annual snowmelt volume from 38 mm 5 for the pipestone river at lake louise to 95 mm 11 for the bow river at lake louise contrasting with 20 mm 32 lower peak swe and 55 mm 19 less snowmelt volume for the basin of the elbow river at calgary snowmelt rates will increase or remain unchanged ranging from 0 2 mm d 1 faster snowmelt rates for the basin of the bow river at banff and no change in melt rate for the elbow river at calgary the faster areal snowmelt is due in part to reduced snow redistribution from suppression of blowing snow and snow interception processes in warmer winters annual peak discharge for the bow river at banff under climate change will increase by 12 23 m3 s 1 and its timing will advance by 15 days with an 11 higher annual water yield despite the increase in annual water yield there will be a slight decline in streamflow generation efficiency for the bow river at banff due to the loss of most glacier contributions to streamflow under climate change by late 21st century in contrast peak discharge will decrease by 3 58 m3 s 1 and occur 3 days earlier with 18 greater annual water yield in the elbow river at calgary under climate change despite a slight increase in the runoff coefficient under climate change the elbow river at calgary will remain a relatively low water yield basin due to its reliance on rainfall

1932,river bathymetry is a key variable in estimating river discharge by remote sensing however traditional methods of mapping river bathymetry are expensive and time consuming which hinders the estimation of river discharge in this study we propose and test a method for estimating river bathymetry by combining remotely sensed observations of water level z and river width w with a nonlinear z w relationship derived from a generalized channel cross sectional shape the results from five reaches of the upper yangtze river show that the absolute relative error for the estimate is between 1 25 and 6 18 indicating the ability of this method to provide accurate estimates the channel exposure e is the main limitation of the proposed method and the river bathymetry estimates improve significantly with increasing e for the upper yangtze river averaging reaches over an appropriate length can reduce variability in river bathymetry estimate especially when data are reach averaged over a length of 10 km considering that a priori bathymetric information is not required and its computational process is relatively simple the proposed method could open up the possibility of bathymetry modeling of global rivers keywords river bathymetry upper yangtze river remote sensing z w relationship data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river discharge is a key variable of the global water cycle and is critical to research and applications such as flood forecasting and water resource management brakenridge et al 2012 huang et al 2018 traditionally river discharge is measured at various gauges within a river basin due to economic and political issues the amount of globally accessible in situ river discharge data has declined since 1970 sichangi et al 2016 additionally the majority of gauges are located in developed nations whereas the density of sites is lower in developing nations and remote regions that are inaccessible to humans tourian et al 2017a in recent decades remote sensing technology has been applied to inland river investigations as a new method for the global study of river systems satellite altimetry and imaging missions offer a much more macroscopic spatial perspective than ground based techniques smith 1997 alsdorf et al 2007 the joint nasa and cnes surface water and ocean topography swot mission launched on december 16 2022 and is now using a ka band radar interferometer to measure the water level and water surface area of rivers wider than 100 m which will further address the gap in gauging networks durand et al 2010 the use of remote sensing technologies to estimate river discharge shows considerable promise as indicated by an increasing number of studies pavelsky et al 2014 tourian et al 2017b bjerklie et al 2018 gleason durand 2020 some current remote sensing based discharge estimation approaches depend on the accurate measurement of river hydraulic variables from remote sensing platforms tarpanelli et al 2013 gleason smith 2014 pavelsky 2014 sichangi et al 2016 rai et al 2021 the ability of satellites to monitor water level z and river width w has been demonstrated in many studies birkett 1998 birkett et al 2002 birkett et al 2006 pekel et al 2016 river channel geometry including width and bathymetry i e river bed elevation are fundamental inputs to physically based hydrodynamic models however river channel geometry below the water surface is generally not observed from satellite remote sensing platforms zhou et al 2022 consequently one of the main barriers to the remote sensing of river discharge is the estimation of bathymetry field measurements of river bathymetry are often made using acoustic doppler current profilers adcps from cableways or boats however due to the high cost of labor and material resources field bathymetry data are very limited and cannot be used effectively in discharge estimation several scholars have explored the possibility of using optical remote sensing imagery to map river bathymetry legleiter roberts 2005 kasvi et al 2019 legleiter harrison 2019 this method was initially applied to bathymetric inversion in marine environments and gradually extended to inland rivers williams et al 2014 proposed spectrally based methods to retrieve bathymetry from optical image data legleiter et al 2009 used a method called optimal band ratio analysis obra to establish a relationship between an image derived quantity and water depth however the above methods rely on field bathymetry data as a priori information are limited to shallow depths where visible light can penetrate through the water column to the bottom and are affected by sediment in the water and reflectance properties of the river bottom among other limitations legleiter et al 2009 the image to depth quantile transformation idqt framework has been proposed as a way to reduce the need for field bathymetry legleiter 2016 additionally numerous attempts have been made to incorporate machine learning with optical images pan et al 2015 mandlburger et al 2021 in addition due to limitations imposed by turbidity streambed reflectance and the optical properties of the water column these optical image based bathymetric inversion methods can only provide reliable depth information in clear shallow water data assimilation da methods have been applied to satellite observations e g z and coupled with hydrodynamic models to predict bathymetry andreadis et al 2007 and durand et al 2009 estimated river depth using a da method based on the lisflood fp model biancamaria et al 2011 developed a local ensemble kalman filter da method combining coupled hydrologic hydraulic modeling of virtual swot observations to obtain arctic river bathymetry similarly brêda et al 2019 introduced a da method adapted kalman filter developed with hydraulically based variance and covariance although the da technique offers high estimate accuracy its implementation in global scale river bathymetry modeling is hindered by its computational costs farina et al 2015 and moramarco et al 2019 explored an approach for constructing bathymetry based on the maximum entropy theory legleiter and kinzel 2021 introduced a new framework divers for characterizing bathymetry inferred from velocities estimated by remote sensing based on a flow resistance equation a technique based on manning s equation was used to calculate depth from swot type observables derived from satellite altimetry and images tourian et al 2017 bjerklie et al 2018 in river discharge estimation depth is a key variable thus river bathymetry can likewise be estimated as a byproduct of manning s equation based river discharge estimation algorithms such as metroman durand et al 2014 and bayesian amhg manning oubanas et al 2018 compared to the da method these methods reduce computational costs but they rely on parameterization such as a priori distributions of river bathymetry roughness or discharge in addition to the above bathymetric inversion techniques some researchers have tried to generate empirical relationships between hydraulic variables based on large publicly available datasets that yield insight on the general behavior of natural rivers bjerklie et al 2020 by providing such relationships and associated statistical confidence levels river bathymetry can be inferred from a few simple hydraulic variables mesick mccreedy 2004 bjerklie 2007 dingman and bjerklie 2006 created a method for estimating water depth using successive concurrent observations of z and w likewise mersel et al 2013 proposed linear and slope break extrapolation methods to estimate bathymetry using survey bathymetry data for the upper mississippi illinois rio grande and ganges brahmaputra rivers as a substitute for remote sensing observations the basic premise of such methods is to first monitor a long time series data of z and w by satellite establish a stable relationship between z and w i e the z w relationship and finally extrapolate this relationship to the unobserved part of the river channel on the basis of dingman and bjerklie 2006 and mersel et al 2013 schaperow et al 2019 further proposed a curve fitting method and evaluated the performance of four z w relationships using similar swot observations of z and w derived from 5 m gridded bathymetry data from the upper mississippi river bjerklie et al 2018 derived the bathymetry from z and w observations generated by the jason 2 altimeter satellite and landsat imagery since it involves low computing costs and requires only two inputs z and w this method shows strong potential for use in global scale river bathymetry modeling the z and w employed in the investigations of mersel et al 2013 and schaperow et al 2019 were derived from survey bathymetry data not remote sensing observations although these authors simulate the uncertainty of remote sensing observations by adding noise they disregard some issues that might be encountered when using actual remote sensing data e g the asynchrony of z and w time series data in this study we aims to obtain river bathymetry using real remote sensing observations of both z and w the proposed method includes four steps 1 in section 3 1 and 3 2 z and w time series data based on remote sensing data are processed as input for predicting bathymetry and the effects of z and w error are evaluated 2 in section 3 3 1 based on typical generalized cross sectional shapes of natural rivers a generally applicable z w relationship is derived 3 in section 3 3 2 quantile function matching is used to obtain synthetic z and w observations from asynchronously measured z and w time series 4 in section 3 3 3 using synthetic z and w observations the z w relationship is fitted and extrapolated to estimate river bathymetry 2 study areas and data 2 1 study areas the yangtze river originates on the tibetan plateau and is the longest river in asia with a length of 6300 km and a basin area of 1800000 km2 sichangi et al 2018 the proposed methodology was applied to the reach of the upper yangtze river extending from jiangjin to yibin fig 1 a the selected reach is a classic mountain river and has an average annual flow of 2230 m3 s and a width of approximately 500 800 m li et al 2020 although the river is managed to ensure the safe navigation of ships and barges it is still naturally formed and is not affected by backwater from the three gorges reservoir no artificial dams affect the river in this study five river reaches 10 km for each reach were manually selected to correspond with virtual station i e the places where satellite tracks cross cut the river locations along the upper yangtze river fig 1b f furthermore only non braided channels were considered when selecting study reaches 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 satellite altimetry data satellite altimetry measures the distance between the satellite and the water surface by emitting a radar pulse placed into a repeat orbit the satellite altimeter passes over a given location of interest at a regular time interval termed the orbital cycle and the intersection of its ground track footprint with a river is called a virtual station in this study water level time series data for all virtual stations were downloaded from the open archive source hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr the hydroweb datasets consist of 18 hz or 20 hz ice 1 retracked water levels from multiple satellite radar altimeters with outliers removed to generate final water level products da silva et al 2010 normandin et al 2018 these water levels are referenced to the gravity recovery and climate experiment gcm02c geoid datum da silva et al 2010 for the upper yangtze river the water levels of virtual stations are taken from the sentinel 3 mission which includes two satellites sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b sentinel 3 has a 27 day orbital cycle and an orbital altitude of 814 km furthermore sentinel 3 is equipped with a sar altimeter which provides higher spatial along track resolution and is thus better suited to reduce land contamination observed within the lrm low resolution mode altimetry footprint cretaux calmant 2016 table 1 reports the details of the satellite altimetry dataset 2 2 2 sentinel 1 water surface area sentinel 1 data were used to detect changes in water surface area sentinel 1 provides data from a dual polarization c band synthetic aperture radar sar instrument at 5 405 ghz thus compared to optical images sar images are not affected by clouds darkness or other weather conditions torres et al 2012 mengen et al 2020 sentinel 1 includes two satellites sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b a single satellite has a repeat period of 12 days while two satellites operating alternately can reduce this period to 6 days in this study a total of 272 scenes of sentinel 1 dual polarized vv vh data in interferometric wide swath mode iw and ground range detected high resolution grdh format for the period of january 2016 to december 2021 were selected google earth engine gee https developers google com earth engine sentinel1 provides sentinel 1 data sar images that have been preprocessed with thermal noise removal radiometric calibration and terrain correction procedures gorelick et al 2017 2 3 in situ validation data to evaluate the water level at a virtual station measurements from the in situ station closest to the virtual station are needed daily water level data from five in situ stations fig 1a along the upper yangtze river for 2016 to 2021 were gathered table 1 and fig 2 show the relationship between the in situ station and virtual station additionally a field survey of the upper reaches of the yangtze river resulted in 228 km of river bathymetry which was used to evaluate the accuracy of the remote sensing based predictions 3 methodology 3 1 processing and validation of water level altimeter data obtained from the hydroweb dataset have been widely used the accuracy of these data has also been validated for some specific watersheds such as the amazon river and inner niger delta da silva et al 2010 normandin et al 2018 lei et al 2022 however for this study we evaluated the accuracy of water levels at virtual stations obtained from the hydroweb dataset to assess the accuracy of the hydroweb dataset for the yangtze river basin to do so the water level data from the in situ station closest to the virtual station was needed due to different elevation datum and locations sometimes the water level obtained from virtual stations cannot be directly compared to the measurement made from the corresponding in situ station lei et al 2022 thus an offset value called vertical datum bias hbias was added to the virtual station water level to unify the water level from the virtual and in situ stations to the common datum hbias is obtained by calculating the median of the difference in water level between the in situ and virtual stations i e hbias median ho he then the transferred value of water level hm at the virtual station can be calculated 1 h m h o h bias h o m e d i a n h o h e where ho and he are the water levels of the virtual and in situ stations respectively and hm is the transferred water level at the virtual station additionally in this study the water level at the virtual station was used to represent the reach as a whole for reaches including multiple virtual stations such as reaches 1 and 2 see fig 1b and c the virtual stations were combined into a water level time series after correcting the vertical datum deviation this processing is based on the assumption that all virtual stations in a reach have consistent statistical distributions to evaluate this assumption a k s test confidence level of 95 was performed for virtual stations in reaches 1 and 2 the results shown in fig 3 are consistent with the above assumptions 3 2 estimation and verification of river width limited by the spatial resolution of satellite images changes in width at specific cross sections on the order of a few or even a dozen meters are still challenging to detect despite major changes in discharge variations in water surface area in contrast are more easily detected and better reflect discharge changes huang et al 2018 to improve the accuracy of river width observations the water surface area of the reach was first calculated and then divided by the length of the reach to determine the effective river width hereinafter called river width w 2 w a w l where aw is the water surface area and l is the length of the reach approximately 10 km according to bjerklie et al 2007 this is an effective method for estimating w from remote sensing images smith et al 1996 brakenridge et al 2007 huang et al 2018 here sentinel 1 sar images were used to calculate the water surface area in addition to the preprocessing applied to the sar image data products we started with we also applied a lee filter to them subsequently the sentinel 1 dual polarized water index sdwi developed by jia et al 2019 was used to identify surface water bodies as shown in eq 3 the sdwi can effectively enhance the characteristics of surface water bodies and reduce interference from other surface types such as vegetation 3 sdwi ln 10 v v v h 8 where vv and vh denote the pixel values of the vv polarized image and vh polarized image respectively next the sdwi threshold was computed to automatically extract the water mask using the maximum between class variance method otsu 1979 fig 4 presents an example of a derived water mask following the above process we obtained time series for w of reaches 1 to 5 from the multitemporal sar images in addition outliers in the time series of w due to missing data in sar images were identified and removed using the iqr interquartile range method the accuracy of the estimated w should be confirmed before using it as input for predicting river bathymetry to this end a survey cross section was extracted every 20 m within the reach of the field bathymetric data collected by the adcp and then the cross sectional shape of each survey cross section was obtained by interpolation afterward the average cross sectional shape of the reach was synthesized from these profiles and the related measured w was calculated from the average cross sectional shape using the water level corresponding to the observation date of the estimated w as input 3 3 estimation of river bathymetry 3 3 1 theoretical derivation of the z w relationship in this study two unknown values were used to describe river bathymetry river bottom elevation z0 and cross sectional shape both of which are primary input parameters for hydrodynamic modeling that are directly correlated with river depth and discharge variation our method includes two key steps initially the z w relationship was derived and fitted to the values of z and w procured from remote sensing data second the fitted z w relationship was extrapolated to obtain z0 as well as the cross sectional shape the exact form of the z w relationship is a crucial question mersel et al 2013 successfully utilized bathymetric prediction to produce both linear and piecewise linear z w relationships however the application of mersel s method is restricted to a small number of optimal locations only 0 16 of cross sections therefore a more general nonlinear form of the z w relationship was derived from the typical channel cross sectional shape to simplify the model the process of deriving the z w relationship is based on the following two assumptions 1 the cross sectional shape is fixed i e the effect of scouring and deposition by within bank flows is ignored and 2 the cross sectional shape is symmetric indeed asymmetric cross sections are common in meander bends as the length of a reach increases the left right asymmetric sections could be averaged to provide a symmetric shape although the channel cross sectional shape varies along the river the cross section can be generalized to some typical shapes e g a triangle rectangle and parabola based on the statistics of a large number of cross sections the channel cross sectional shape can be approximated by a power function dingman bjerklie 2006 dingman 2007 neal et al 2015 bjerklie et al 2018 grimaldi et al 2018 li et al 2018 expressed as follows 4 y k x r where y is the river depth and x is the horizontal distance from the center fig 5 a for a symmetric cross section x can be replaced by w 5 x 1 2 w combining eq 4 and eq 5 yields the following 6 y k 2 r w r substituting eq 6 into z z0 y yields the following 7 z z 0 k 2 r w r redefining the coefficient parameter yields the following 8 z z 0 α w r eq 8 calculates the nonlinear z w relationship which is consistent with the form derived by schaperow et al 2019 from hydraulic geometry equations this implies that the proposed nonlinear z w relationship is reasonable and essentially universal r reflects the cross sectional shape a triangular cross section is indicated by r 1 and a parabola is denoted by r 2 as the value of r increases the river bottom becomes flatter and the river bank becomes steeper when r the river channel is rectangular fig 5b the coefficient α is specific to the given river and is related to other characteristics in addition to the cross sectional shape 3 3 2 extraction of synthetic z and w observations the fitting of the z w relationship requires z and w observations that is a series of z and w measurements from the same date is needed because z and w are measured by various satellite sensors with different temporal resolutions it is difficult to observe both variables at the same time to address this limitation tourian et al 2013 suggested a method for predicting discharge by using quantile function matching and the rating curve the quantile function signified by q p where p is the cumulative probability is frequently employed to describe the statistical distribution of a dataset fig 6 because the horizontal coordinates of the quantile functions for z qz p and w qw p are identical i e 0 p 1 one can directly connect their vertical coordinates to derive the synthetic z and w observations in other words the traditional one to one correspondence of t time is replaced by the one to one correspondence of p this type of q transformation is applied to eq 8 to replace z and w with qz and qw 9 q z z 0 α q w r note that the q transformation rule requires that eq 8 itself is nondecreasing gilchrist 2000 thus correlation analysis was performed for the relatively small number of synchronous measurements of z and w that were available the strong correlation and positive rank correlation in table 2 indicate that eq 9 is monotonically increasing this means that the quantile function matching method is appropriate 3 3 3 curve fitting given the synthetic z and w observations unknown parameters are estimated by fitting a nonlinear z w relationship first however the extent of the observed data was quantified by defining channel exposure e 1 wmin wbf wmin is the minimum w obtained from remote sensing and wbf is the bankfull flow width which is known from the field survey river bathymetry data the exposed region of the riverbed expands with an increasing e increasing the range of observed data when e 100 the riverbed flow is 0 which would correspond to an image captured when the river was completely dry given the nonlinear form of eq 9 the parameters were estimated using the levenberg marquardt algorithm dingman bjerklie 2006 schaperow et al 2019 this algorithm requires that initial values be set for unknown parameters therefore the initial value of z0 used the observed minimum z we then tried applying 5 values of r r 1 2 3 4 and 5 in turn and chose the r value with the largest r2 as the initial value of r then by substituting the initial values of z0 and r into eq 9 the initial value of α was calculated some incorrect parameter estimates were artificially eliminated to ensure that the z w relationship is consistent with physical reality specifically 1 the z w relationship is necessarily monotonically increasing so α and r must be nonnegative and 2 the natural channel cross section tends to be flat at the lowest point so r 1 based on the estimated parameters the z0 and cross sectional shape of the reaches can be estimated note that the results obtained in this manner represent the average of all cross sections along the river reach 3 4 error metrics to verify the accuracy of z and w the root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse are used as evaluation criteria 10 rms e z w m z w e z w 2 n 11 rrms e z w rmse m z w 100 where m denotes the measured data e denotes the estimated data m denotes the mean measured data n denotes the number of observations and subscripts z and w indicate the water level and river width respectively the performance of river bathymetry prediction is measured by the absolute error me and absolute relative error ape as follows 12 me z 0 z 0 ins 13 ape z 0 z 0 ins z 0 ins 100 where z0 is the estimated river bottom elevation and z0 ins is the measured river bottom elevation 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy of water level and river width to evaluate the quality of z and w obtained by remote sensing the differences between the estimated z and w and the measured values were first evaluated the accuracy of z estimate a few tens of centimeters rmse 0 32 0 62 m is better than that of w dozens of meters rmse 14 86 59 51 m and the performance metrics rrmse of both z and w show satisfactory results rrmse 10 specifically the rrmse values range from 0 16 to 0 24 and 2 23 to 8 81 for the observations of z and w respectively figs 7 and 8 moreover a relatively high w error for reaches 1 and 4 was found and could be attributed to underestimation of water surface area due to shade from bridges and ships to gauge the sensitivity of the estimated z0 to the precision of z w dz0 was written as a function of error in other variables 14 d z 0 z 0 z d z z 0 w d w the sensitivity z0 z is a constant i e z0 z 1 while z0 w depends on w which varies over time fig 9 a and b show that z0 w for reach 4 varies between 0 0398 and 0 0828 with an average value of 0 0565 which is smaller than z0 z indeed this phenomenon can be observed in all reaches fig 9c this means that compared to that of w the accuracy of z has a more significant impact on the error of z0 the error of z will directly transfer into an equal error value of z0 4 2 estimated river bathymetry using different reach average lengths for the w and z0 obtained from remote sensing data there will be many site specific errors at the scale of an individual survey cross section long known to vary greatly from one section to the next along natural river systems leopold and maddock 1953 park 1977 smith pavelsky 2008 taking reach 5 as an example by plotting all generated h max h values the ratio of maximum to mean depth which is related to the channel cross sectional shape as a function of reach length fig 10 h max h displays extreme variability at a single cross section but converges toward a stable values h max h 1 28 as the subreach length scale increases at length scales larger than 6 km all h max h values lie within 2 of the overall reach average this means that the average cross section of the reaches tends to have a more stable and smooth geometric shape e g parabola as the reach average length rises this is shown more intuitively in fig a1 in appendix a to further explore the impact of different reach averaged lengths the estimated z0 and actual z0 were compared this involved using the w obtained from six reach averaged lengths i e 1 km 2 km 4 km 6 km 8 km and 10 km to fit the z w relationship to calculate the estimated z0 a summary of the variations in the rrmse of w and the ape of z0 with reach averaged lengths is plotted in fig 11 fig 11a shows that the variation in reaches 3 and 4 has a different character from the other reaches the w error mainly arises from the inaccurate calculation of the water surface area which is related to satellite resolution river planform and other factors in addition to the reach averaged length thus it is not easy to find a length scale that can minimize the w error of all reaches compared to w fig 11a the z0 error fig 11b of each reach shows a more consistent trend with the change in reach averaged length except for reach 3 for reasons discussed below the ape values of z0 decrease as the reach averaged length increases and are stabilized at a lower level ape 2 when the length scale is larger than 6 km it should be noted that the length of 6 km is specific to the upper yangtze river while this length could be presented in the unit of mean channel width generating a ratio of length to width being about 7 in this study additionally the ratio values range from 3 to 11 for different scale rivers with mean channel widths being from 150 to 1000 m leopold 1994 bjerklie et al 2005 mersel et al 2013 indicating that the optimal ratio for all rivers might be slightly different the above results indicate that local geomorphic heterogeneities are an important factor to consider when estimating river bathymetry mersel et al 2013 found that irregular river cross sectional shapes will lead to a slope break of the z w relationship i e introducing breakpoints into the z w relationship which will significantly affect the accuracy of river bathymetry the local abrupt change in the cross sectional shape is minimized by an increase in reach averaged length resulting in a smoother curve for the z w relationship and thus a reduced number of breakpoints when the ratio of length to mean channel width is larger than 7 the cross sectional shape is basically stable so the accuracy of z0 derived from the z w relationship is stable the average cross section geometric shape of reach 3 is essentially constant under different length scales fig a1 and the error variation of z0 is not substantial which explains why the ape of z0 of reach 3 showed a different trend from that of other reaches overall the developed method calls for the reach averaged length to attain a certain size to increase the precision of the river bathymetry estimate although the w error is not necessarily minimal at larger length scales the prediction of river bathymetry can still achieve good accuracy due to the relative insensitivity of bathymetry error to river width error note that the proposed reach averaged length of 10 km is not universally applicable a suitable reach averaged length should be chosen for different sizes of rivers 4 3 fitting curve and river bathymetry estimation for all reaches after deriving z and w using remote sensing data z and w were further processed using quantile function matching to produce synthetic values of z and w at this point the nonlinear z w relationship could be fitted to synthetic estimates and extrapolated to predict z0 fig 12 demonstrates the process of fitting the nl model from nonsynchronous z and w time series data through quantile function matching as expected the z w relationship shows nondecreasing behavior the coefficient of determination is close to 1 00 r2 0 982 0 997 for all reaches which indicates that the model parameters are quite reliable additionally the r values range from 4 10 to 7 73 for reaches 1 to 5 fig 12 the r values of reaches 2 and 3 were significantly higher than those of the others with values of 7 73 and 6 68 respectively the size of the r value determines the channel cross sectional shape as the r value increases the slope of the bank increases the bottom becomes flatter and the channel cross sectional shape gradually changes from a smooth parabola to an approximate trapezoid this explains the significant differences between reaches 2 and 3 compared to the others bjerklie et al 2020 found that river cross sectional shape is on average parabolic i e r 2 based on an analysis of over 25 000 river cross sections throughout the united states from adcp data however in the present study the average value of r in reaches 1 to 5 was 5 59 due to the different ranges of the study reaches this is not unexpected indeed the value of r 2 describes the average cross sectional shape of different types of rivers including mountain and plain rivers while the value of r 5 59 reflects some characteristics of channel cross sectional in the upper yangtze river like steep banks as noted by dingman and bjerklie 2006 in some cases a value as high as r 5 may be appropriate the channel exposure of reaches 1 to 5 was in the range of 21 7 37 2 during the brief satellite observation period 2016 2021 because satellite observation under moderate flow typically predominates fig 13 illustrates the discrepancy between the actual and estimated bathymetry the results show that the suggested approach can reliably mimic the actual reach averaged cross section at moderate and high water levels however extrapolation results for areas close to the riverbed contain minor errors table 3 reports statistics of z0 prediction errors over all reaches specifically the me and ape values of z0 range from 3 05 m to 11 38 m and 1 25 to 6 18 for reaches 1 to 5 respectively compared to other reaches poor performance was observed at reach 5 this is predominantly because the reach averaged cross section of reach 5 is similar to a triangle section which results in an excessively steep decline in the water level as the river width decreases fig 13 overall the river bathymetry is overestimated at low channel exposure e 40 for all reaches 4 4 impact of channel exposure the z and w observations generated by the actual reach averaged cross section were perturbed by adding noise from monte carlo simulations to produce remote sensing like observations later the remote sensing derived synthetic z and w data were expanded to different channel exposures e 40 60 80 and 90 this analysis enabled us to compare the prediction error of z0 to different channel exposures to obtain a general rule the actual reach averaged cross sections of reach averaged lengths of 6 km 8 km and 10 km were considered the me values for z0 retrievals fitted by the nonlinear z w relationships are shown in fig 14 varying as a function of channel exposure note that the prediction results of all reaches based on remote sensing observations were regarded as one group although their channel exposure varied e 21 7 37 2 as shown in fig 14 the z0 projections extrapolated by z w relationships become more accurate as more of the channel is exposed the median me values decrease from 4 58 m at e 0 40 to 1 20 m at e 90 furthermore the distribution curves show that the distribution of me values becomes more concentrated with an increase in e this finding is consistent with previous studies mersel et al 2013 schaperow et al 2019 reporting that a rise in e can improve the prediction accuracy of river bathymetry the suggested approach depends on channel exposure during the satellite observation period values of e were low and thus river bathymetry was overestimated the proposed method might be able to reasonably approximate river bathymetry if extremely dry water conditions e g extreme drought in the yangtze river basin in the summer of 2022 xia et al 2022 can be captured over a longer observation period however as extremely low water levels in rivers observed by satellites are unpredictable methods to improve river bathymetry accuracy within a constrained time window were investigated the results of z0 prediction could be adjusted by adding correction coefficient k eq 15 presuming that partial river bathymetry data were available for the reaches the z w relationship was fitted by deriving the synthetic z and w values under different channel exposures from the a priori river bathymetry and was extrapolated to obtain z0 the function between e and me could then be obtained eq 16 based on this function correction factor k was calculated eq 17 15 z 0 ins k z 0 16 me z 0 z 0 ins f e 17 k 1 f e z 0 where z0 and z0 ins are the estimated and the actual river bottom elevations respectively e represents channel exposure the functions between e and me of reaches 1 to 5 were established to calculate k values processed from different reaches fig a2 all calculated k values do not differ much and are concentrated between values of 0 974 and 0 990 for this purpose a constant i e kc 0 981 which is applicable to the upper yangtze river was obtained by averaging all k values fig 15 displays the z0 prediction errors ape after corrected by different k values all k values are effective in improving the prediction of z0 fig 15 which means that the estimated k of one reach can be successfully applied to other reaches the k values calculated by reach 2 had the best effect reducing the degree of error by an average of 87 for all reaches even reach 5 which had the worst effect can reduce the level of error by 33 thus k values provide a possibility to improve z0 errors using priori information from nearby reaches which helps to alleviate the limitations of e 5 conclusion in this study a method to estimate river bathymetry that exclusively uses the remotely sensed observations of z and w is developed and tested by fitting synthetic z and w observations to produce a nonlinear z w relationship eq 8 z0 and cross sectional shape can be estimated the results for five reaches of the upper yangtze river show me and ape errors of z0 are 3 05 11 38 m and 1 25 6 18 respectively at a low e i e e 40 the method overestimates the bathymetry however as e increases the accuracy of z0 improves significantly and the median me values of z0 decrease from 4 58 m at e 0 40 to 1 20 m at e 90 the r value reflects the characteristics of the channel cross sectional shape in reaches 1 to 5 the r values range from 4 10 to 7 73 the river bottom becomes flatter and the river bank becomes steeper as r increases additionally as the reach averaged length increases the average channel cross section tends to have a stable and smooth cross sectional shape which reduces the z0 prediction error this illustrates that averaging reaches over an appropriate length can reduce variability in river bathymetry estimates for the upper yangtze river 10 km might be a suitable length the results of the present sensitivity analysis further indicate that river bathymetry inversion is more sensitive to errors in z when estimating river bathymetry by this method special attention should be paid to the precision of remote sensing observations of z channel exposure limits the effectiveness of our method however this limitation can be mitigated by using the correction factor k obtained from the priori information of nearby reaches for the yangtze river a constant of k 0 981 can be used to improve the estimates of reaches with low channel exposure reiterating that the bathymetry determined by this method is an average value that reflects the average cross sectional geometry of river reaches the proposed method is not intended to study the evolution of cross sectional shape owing to sediment load and movement despite the above limitations the proposed method is expected to provide a preliminary bathymetric estimate for global rivers this can provide an a priori distribution for other river bathymetry inversion approaches e g the da method and improve the assumption of channel cross sections in hydrodynamic models in addition this method can be extended to swot missions and river

1932,river bathymetry is a key variable in estimating river discharge by remote sensing however traditional methods of mapping river bathymetry are expensive and time consuming which hinders the estimation of river discharge in this study we propose and test a method for estimating river bathymetry by combining remotely sensed observations of water level z and river width w with a nonlinear z w relationship derived from a generalized channel cross sectional shape the results from five reaches of the upper yangtze river show that the absolute relative error for the estimate is between 1 25 and 6 18 indicating the ability of this method to provide accurate estimates the channel exposure e is the main limitation of the proposed method and the river bathymetry estimates improve significantly with increasing e for the upper yangtze river averaging reaches over an appropriate length can reduce variability in river bathymetry estimate especially when data are reach averaged over a length of 10 km considering that a priori bathymetric information is not required and its computational process is relatively simple the proposed method could open up the possibility of bathymetry modeling of global rivers keywords river bathymetry upper yangtze river remote sensing z w relationship data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river discharge is a key variable of the global water cycle and is critical to research and applications such as flood forecasting and water resource management brakenridge et al 2012 huang et al 2018 traditionally river discharge is measured at various gauges within a river basin due to economic and political issues the amount of globally accessible in situ river discharge data has declined since 1970 sichangi et al 2016 additionally the majority of gauges are located in developed nations whereas the density of sites is lower in developing nations and remote regions that are inaccessible to humans tourian et al 2017a in recent decades remote sensing technology has been applied to inland river investigations as a new method for the global study of river systems satellite altimetry and imaging missions offer a much more macroscopic spatial perspective than ground based techniques smith 1997 alsdorf et al 2007 the joint nasa and cnes surface water and ocean topography swot mission launched on december 16 2022 and is now using a ka band radar interferometer to measure the water level and water surface area of rivers wider than 100 m which will further address the gap in gauging networks durand et al 2010 the use of remote sensing technologies to estimate river discharge shows considerable promise as indicated by an increasing number of studies pavelsky et al 2014 tourian et al 2017b bjerklie et al 2018 gleason durand 2020 some current remote sensing based discharge estimation approaches depend on the accurate measurement of river hydraulic variables from remote sensing platforms tarpanelli et al 2013 gleason smith 2014 pavelsky 2014 sichangi et al 2016 rai et al 2021 the ability of satellites to monitor water level z and river width w has been demonstrated in many studies birkett 1998 birkett et al 2002 birkett et al 2006 pekel et al 2016 river channel geometry including width and bathymetry i e river bed elevation are fundamental inputs to physically based hydrodynamic models however river channel geometry below the water surface is generally not observed from satellite remote sensing platforms zhou et al 2022 consequently one of the main barriers to the remote sensing of river discharge is the estimation of bathymetry field measurements of river bathymetry are often made using acoustic doppler current profilers adcps from cableways or boats however due to the high cost of labor and material resources field bathymetry data are very limited and cannot be used effectively in discharge estimation several scholars have explored the possibility of using optical remote sensing imagery to map river bathymetry legleiter roberts 2005 kasvi et al 2019 legleiter harrison 2019 this method was initially applied to bathymetric inversion in marine environments and gradually extended to inland rivers williams et al 2014 proposed spectrally based methods to retrieve bathymetry from optical image data legleiter et al 2009 used a method called optimal band ratio analysis obra to establish a relationship between an image derived quantity and water depth however the above methods rely on field bathymetry data as a priori information are limited to shallow depths where visible light can penetrate through the water column to the bottom and are affected by sediment in the water and reflectance properties of the river bottom among other limitations legleiter et al 2009 the image to depth quantile transformation idqt framework has been proposed as a way to reduce the need for field bathymetry legleiter 2016 additionally numerous attempts have been made to incorporate machine learning with optical images pan et al 2015 mandlburger et al 2021 in addition due to limitations imposed by turbidity streambed reflectance and the optical properties of the water column these optical image based bathymetric inversion methods can only provide reliable depth information in clear shallow water data assimilation da methods have been applied to satellite observations e g z and coupled with hydrodynamic models to predict bathymetry andreadis et al 2007 and durand et al 2009 estimated river depth using a da method based on the lisflood fp model biancamaria et al 2011 developed a local ensemble kalman filter da method combining coupled hydrologic hydraulic modeling of virtual swot observations to obtain arctic river bathymetry similarly brêda et al 2019 introduced a da method adapted kalman filter developed with hydraulically based variance and covariance although the da technique offers high estimate accuracy its implementation in global scale river bathymetry modeling is hindered by its computational costs farina et al 2015 and moramarco et al 2019 explored an approach for constructing bathymetry based on the maximum entropy theory legleiter and kinzel 2021 introduced a new framework divers for characterizing bathymetry inferred from velocities estimated by remote sensing based on a flow resistance equation a technique based on manning s equation was used to calculate depth from swot type observables derived from satellite altimetry and images tourian et al 2017 bjerklie et al 2018 in river discharge estimation depth is a key variable thus river bathymetry can likewise be estimated as a byproduct of manning s equation based river discharge estimation algorithms such as metroman durand et al 2014 and bayesian amhg manning oubanas et al 2018 compared to the da method these methods reduce computational costs but they rely on parameterization such as a priori distributions of river bathymetry roughness or discharge in addition to the above bathymetric inversion techniques some researchers have tried to generate empirical relationships between hydraulic variables based on large publicly available datasets that yield insight on the general behavior of natural rivers bjerklie et al 2020 by providing such relationships and associated statistical confidence levels river bathymetry can be inferred from a few simple hydraulic variables mesick mccreedy 2004 bjerklie 2007 dingman and bjerklie 2006 created a method for estimating water depth using successive concurrent observations of z and w likewise mersel et al 2013 proposed linear and slope break extrapolation methods to estimate bathymetry using survey bathymetry data for the upper mississippi illinois rio grande and ganges brahmaputra rivers as a substitute for remote sensing observations the basic premise of such methods is to first monitor a long time series data of z and w by satellite establish a stable relationship between z and w i e the z w relationship and finally extrapolate this relationship to the unobserved part of the river channel on the basis of dingman and bjerklie 2006 and mersel et al 2013 schaperow et al 2019 further proposed a curve fitting method and evaluated the performance of four z w relationships using similar swot observations of z and w derived from 5 m gridded bathymetry data from the upper mississippi river bjerklie et al 2018 derived the bathymetry from z and w observations generated by the jason 2 altimeter satellite and landsat imagery since it involves low computing costs and requires only two inputs z and w this method shows strong potential for use in global scale river bathymetry modeling the z and w employed in the investigations of mersel et al 2013 and schaperow et al 2019 were derived from survey bathymetry data not remote sensing observations although these authors simulate the uncertainty of remote sensing observations by adding noise they disregard some issues that might be encountered when using actual remote sensing data e g the asynchrony of z and w time series data in this study we aims to obtain river bathymetry using real remote sensing observations of both z and w the proposed method includes four steps 1 in section 3 1 and 3 2 z and w time series data based on remote sensing data are processed as input for predicting bathymetry and the effects of z and w error are evaluated 2 in section 3 3 1 based on typical generalized cross sectional shapes of natural rivers a generally applicable z w relationship is derived 3 in section 3 3 2 quantile function matching is used to obtain synthetic z and w observations from asynchronously measured z and w time series 4 in section 3 3 3 using synthetic z and w observations the z w relationship is fitted and extrapolated to estimate river bathymetry 2 study areas and data 2 1 study areas the yangtze river originates on the tibetan plateau and is the longest river in asia with a length of 6300 km and a basin area of 1800000 km2 sichangi et al 2018 the proposed methodology was applied to the reach of the upper yangtze river extending from jiangjin to yibin fig 1 a the selected reach is a classic mountain river and has an average annual flow of 2230 m3 s and a width of approximately 500 800 m li et al 2020 although the river is managed to ensure the safe navigation of ships and barges it is still naturally formed and is not affected by backwater from the three gorges reservoir no artificial dams affect the river in this study five river reaches 10 km for each reach were manually selected to correspond with virtual station i e the places where satellite tracks cross cut the river locations along the upper yangtze river fig 1b f furthermore only non braided channels were considered when selecting study reaches 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 satellite altimetry data satellite altimetry measures the distance between the satellite and the water surface by emitting a radar pulse placed into a repeat orbit the satellite altimeter passes over a given location of interest at a regular time interval termed the orbital cycle and the intersection of its ground track footprint with a river is called a virtual station in this study water level time series data for all virtual stations were downloaded from the open archive source hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr the hydroweb datasets consist of 18 hz or 20 hz ice 1 retracked water levels from multiple satellite radar altimeters with outliers removed to generate final water level products da silva et al 2010 normandin et al 2018 these water levels are referenced to the gravity recovery and climate experiment gcm02c geoid datum da silva et al 2010 for the upper yangtze river the water levels of virtual stations are taken from the sentinel 3 mission which includes two satellites sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b sentinel 3 has a 27 day orbital cycle and an orbital altitude of 814 km furthermore sentinel 3 is equipped with a sar altimeter which provides higher spatial along track resolution and is thus better suited to reduce land contamination observed within the lrm low resolution mode altimetry footprint cretaux calmant 2016 table 1 reports the details of the satellite altimetry dataset 2 2 2 sentinel 1 water surface area sentinel 1 data were used to detect changes in water surface area sentinel 1 provides data from a dual polarization c band synthetic aperture radar sar instrument at 5 405 ghz thus compared to optical images sar images are not affected by clouds darkness or other weather conditions torres et al 2012 mengen et al 2020 sentinel 1 includes two satellites sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b a single satellite has a repeat period of 12 days while two satellites operating alternately can reduce this period to 6 days in this study a total of 272 scenes of sentinel 1 dual polarized vv vh data in interferometric wide swath mode iw and ground range detected high resolution grdh format for the period of january 2016 to december 2021 were selected google earth engine gee https developers google com earth engine sentinel1 provides sentinel 1 data sar images that have been preprocessed with thermal noise removal radiometric calibration and terrain correction procedures gorelick et al 2017 2 3 in situ validation data to evaluate the water level at a virtual station measurements from the in situ station closest to the virtual station are needed daily water level data from five in situ stations fig 1a along the upper yangtze river for 2016 to 2021 were gathered table 1 and fig 2 show the relationship between the in situ station and virtual station additionally a field survey of the upper reaches of the yangtze river resulted in 228 km of river bathymetry which was used to evaluate the accuracy of the remote sensing based predictions 3 methodology 3 1 processing and validation of water level altimeter data obtained from the hydroweb dataset have been widely used the accuracy of these data has also been validated for some specific watersheds such as the amazon river and inner niger delta da silva et al 2010 normandin et al 2018 lei et al 2022 however for this study we evaluated the accuracy of water levels at virtual stations obtained from the hydroweb dataset to assess the accuracy of the hydroweb dataset for the yangtze river basin to do so the water level data from the in situ station closest to the virtual station was needed due to different elevation datum and locations sometimes the water level obtained from virtual stations cannot be directly compared to the measurement made from the corresponding in situ station lei et al 2022 thus an offset value called vertical datum bias hbias was added to the virtual station water level to unify the water level from the virtual and in situ stations to the common datum hbias is obtained by calculating the median of the difference in water level between the in situ and virtual stations i e hbias median ho he then the transferred value of water level hm at the virtual station can be calculated 1 h m h o h bias h o m e d i a n h o h e where ho and he are the water levels of the virtual and in situ stations respectively and hm is the transferred water level at the virtual station additionally in this study the water level at the virtual station was used to represent the reach as a whole for reaches including multiple virtual stations such as reaches 1 and 2 see fig 1b and c the virtual stations were combined into a water level time series after correcting the vertical datum deviation this processing is based on the assumption that all virtual stations in a reach have consistent statistical distributions to evaluate this assumption a k s test confidence level of 95 was performed for virtual stations in reaches 1 and 2 the results shown in fig 3 are consistent with the above assumptions 3 2 estimation and verification of river width limited by the spatial resolution of satellite images changes in width at specific cross sections on the order of a few or even a dozen meters are still challenging to detect despite major changes in discharge variations in water surface area in contrast are more easily detected and better reflect discharge changes huang et al 2018 to improve the accuracy of river width observations the water surface area of the reach was first calculated and then divided by the length of the reach to determine the effective river width hereinafter called river width w 2 w a w l where aw is the water surface area and l is the length of the reach approximately 10 km according to bjerklie et al 2007 this is an effective method for estimating w from remote sensing images smith et al 1996 brakenridge et al 2007 huang et al 2018 here sentinel 1 sar images were used to calculate the water surface area in addition to the preprocessing applied to the sar image data products we started with we also applied a lee filter to them subsequently the sentinel 1 dual polarized water index sdwi developed by jia et al 2019 was used to identify surface water bodies as shown in eq 3 the sdwi can effectively enhance the characteristics of surface water bodies and reduce interference from other surface types such as vegetation 3 sdwi ln 10 v v v h 8 where vv and vh denote the pixel values of the vv polarized image and vh polarized image respectively next the sdwi threshold was computed to automatically extract the water mask using the maximum between class variance method otsu 1979 fig 4 presents an example of a derived water mask following the above process we obtained time series for w of reaches 1 to 5 from the multitemporal sar images in addition outliers in the time series of w due to missing data in sar images were identified and removed using the iqr interquartile range method the accuracy of the estimated w should be confirmed before using it as input for predicting river bathymetry to this end a survey cross section was extracted every 20 m within the reach of the field bathymetric data collected by the adcp and then the cross sectional shape of each survey cross section was obtained by interpolation afterward the average cross sectional shape of the reach was synthesized from these profiles and the related measured w was calculated from the average cross sectional shape using the water level corresponding to the observation date of the estimated w as input 3 3 estimation of river bathymetry 3 3 1 theoretical derivation of the z w relationship in this study two unknown values were used to describe river bathymetry river bottom elevation z0 and cross sectional shape both of which are primary input parameters for hydrodynamic modeling that are directly correlated with river depth and discharge variation our method includes two key steps initially the z w relationship was derived and fitted to the values of z and w procured from remote sensing data second the fitted z w relationship was extrapolated to obtain z0 as well as the cross sectional shape the exact form of the z w relationship is a crucial question mersel et al 2013 successfully utilized bathymetric prediction to produce both linear and piecewise linear z w relationships however the application of mersel s method is restricted to a small number of optimal locations only 0 16 of cross sections therefore a more general nonlinear form of the z w relationship was derived from the typical channel cross sectional shape to simplify the model the process of deriving the z w relationship is based on the following two assumptions 1 the cross sectional shape is fixed i e the effect of scouring and deposition by within bank flows is ignored and 2 the cross sectional shape is symmetric indeed asymmetric cross sections are common in meander bends as the length of a reach increases the left right asymmetric sections could be averaged to provide a symmetric shape although the channel cross sectional shape varies along the river the cross section can be generalized to some typical shapes e g a triangle rectangle and parabola based on the statistics of a large number of cross sections the channel cross sectional shape can be approximated by a power function dingman bjerklie 2006 dingman 2007 neal et al 2015 bjerklie et al 2018 grimaldi et al 2018 li et al 2018 expressed as follows 4 y k x r where y is the river depth and x is the horizontal distance from the center fig 5 a for a symmetric cross section x can be replaced by w 5 x 1 2 w combining eq 4 and eq 5 yields the following 6 y k 2 r w r substituting eq 6 into z z0 y yields the following 7 z z 0 k 2 r w r redefining the coefficient parameter yields the following 8 z z 0 α w r eq 8 calculates the nonlinear z w relationship which is consistent with the form derived by schaperow et al 2019 from hydraulic geometry equations this implies that the proposed nonlinear z w relationship is reasonable and essentially universal r reflects the cross sectional shape a triangular cross section is indicated by r 1 and a parabola is denoted by r 2 as the value of r increases the river bottom becomes flatter and the river bank becomes steeper when r the river channel is rectangular fig 5b the coefficient α is specific to the given river and is related to other characteristics in addition to the cross sectional shape 3 3 2 extraction of synthetic z and w observations the fitting of the z w relationship requires z and w observations that is a series of z and w measurements from the same date is needed because z and w are measured by various satellite sensors with different temporal resolutions it is difficult to observe both variables at the same time to address this limitation tourian et al 2013 suggested a method for predicting discharge by using quantile function matching and the rating curve the quantile function signified by q p where p is the cumulative probability is frequently employed to describe the statistical distribution of a dataset fig 6 because the horizontal coordinates of the quantile functions for z qz p and w qw p are identical i e 0 p 1 one can directly connect their vertical coordinates to derive the synthetic z and w observations in other words the traditional one to one correspondence of t time is replaced by the one to one correspondence of p this type of q transformation is applied to eq 8 to replace z and w with qz and qw 9 q z z 0 α q w r note that the q transformation rule requires that eq 8 itself is nondecreasing gilchrist 2000 thus correlation analysis was performed for the relatively small number of synchronous measurements of z and w that were available the strong correlation and positive rank correlation in table 2 indicate that eq 9 is monotonically increasing this means that the quantile function matching method is appropriate 3 3 3 curve fitting given the synthetic z and w observations unknown parameters are estimated by fitting a nonlinear z w relationship first however the extent of the observed data was quantified by defining channel exposure e 1 wmin wbf wmin is the minimum w obtained from remote sensing and wbf is the bankfull flow width which is known from the field survey river bathymetry data the exposed region of the riverbed expands with an increasing e increasing the range of observed data when e 100 the riverbed flow is 0 which would correspond to an image captured when the river was completely dry given the nonlinear form of eq 9 the parameters were estimated using the levenberg marquardt algorithm dingman bjerklie 2006 schaperow et al 2019 this algorithm requires that initial values be set for unknown parameters therefore the initial value of z0 used the observed minimum z we then tried applying 5 values of r r 1 2 3 4 and 5 in turn and chose the r value with the largest r2 as the initial value of r then by substituting the initial values of z0 and r into eq 9 the initial value of α was calculated some incorrect parameter estimates were artificially eliminated to ensure that the z w relationship is consistent with physical reality specifically 1 the z w relationship is necessarily monotonically increasing so α and r must be nonnegative and 2 the natural channel cross section tends to be flat at the lowest point so r 1 based on the estimated parameters the z0 and cross sectional shape of the reaches can be estimated note that the results obtained in this manner represent the average of all cross sections along the river reach 3 4 error metrics to verify the accuracy of z and w the root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse are used as evaluation criteria 10 rms e z w m z w e z w 2 n 11 rrms e z w rmse m z w 100 where m denotes the measured data e denotes the estimated data m denotes the mean measured data n denotes the number of observations and subscripts z and w indicate the water level and river width respectively the performance of river bathymetry prediction is measured by the absolute error me and absolute relative error ape as follows 12 me z 0 z 0 ins 13 ape z 0 z 0 ins z 0 ins 100 where z0 is the estimated river bottom elevation and z0 ins is the measured river bottom elevation 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy of water level and river width to evaluate the quality of z and w obtained by remote sensing the differences between the estimated z and w and the measured values were first evaluated the accuracy of z estimate a few tens of centimeters rmse 0 32 0 62 m is better than that of w dozens of meters rmse 14 86 59 51 m and the performance metrics rrmse of both z and w show satisfactory results rrmse 10 specifically the rrmse values range from 0 16 to 0 24 and 2 23 to 8 81 for the observations of z and w respectively figs 7 and 8 moreover a relatively high w error for reaches 1 and 4 was found and could be attributed to underestimation of water surface area due to shade from bridges and ships to gauge the sensitivity of the estimated z0 to the precision of z w dz0 was written as a function of error in other variables 14 d z 0 z 0 z d z z 0 w d w the sensitivity z0 z is a constant i e z0 z 1 while z0 w depends on w which varies over time fig 9 a and b show that z0 w for reach 4 varies between 0 0398 and 0 0828 with an average value of 0 0565 which is smaller than z0 z indeed this phenomenon can be observed in all reaches fig 9c this means that compared to that of w the accuracy of z has a more significant impact on the error of z0 the error of z will directly transfer into an equal error value of z0 4 2 estimated river bathymetry using different reach average lengths for the w and z0 obtained from remote sensing data there will be many site specific errors at the scale of an individual survey cross section long known to vary greatly from one section to the next along natural river systems leopold and maddock 1953 park 1977 smith pavelsky 2008 taking reach 5 as an example by plotting all generated h max h values the ratio of maximum to mean depth which is related to the channel cross sectional shape as a function of reach length fig 10 h max h displays extreme variability at a single cross section but converges toward a stable values h max h 1 28 as the subreach length scale increases at length scales larger than 6 km all h max h values lie within 2 of the overall reach average this means that the average cross section of the reaches tends to have a more stable and smooth geometric shape e g parabola as the reach average length rises this is shown more intuitively in fig a1 in appendix a to further explore the impact of different reach averaged lengths the estimated z0 and actual z0 were compared this involved using the w obtained from six reach averaged lengths i e 1 km 2 km 4 km 6 km 8 km and 10 km to fit the z w relationship to calculate the estimated z0 a summary of the variations in the rrmse of w and the ape of z0 with reach averaged lengths is plotted in fig 11 fig 11a shows that the variation in reaches 3 and 4 has a different character from the other reaches the w error mainly arises from the inaccurate calculation of the water surface area which is related to satellite resolution river planform and other factors in addition to the reach averaged length thus it is not easy to find a length scale that can minimize the w error of all reaches compared to w fig 11a the z0 error fig 11b of each reach shows a more consistent trend with the change in reach averaged length except for reach 3 for reasons discussed below the ape values of z0 decrease as the reach averaged length increases and are stabilized at a lower level ape 2 when the length scale is larger than 6 km it should be noted that the length of 6 km is specific to the upper yangtze river while this length could be presented in the unit of mean channel width generating a ratio of length to width being about 7 in this study additionally the ratio values range from 3 to 11 for different scale rivers with mean channel widths being from 150 to 1000 m leopold 1994 bjerklie et al 2005 mersel et al 2013 indicating that the optimal ratio for all rivers might be slightly different the above results indicate that local geomorphic heterogeneities are an important factor to consider when estimating river bathymetry mersel et al 2013 found that irregular river cross sectional shapes will lead to a slope break of the z w relationship i e introducing breakpoints into the z w relationship which will significantly affect the accuracy of river bathymetry the local abrupt change in the cross sectional shape is minimized by an increase in reach averaged length resulting in a smoother curve for the z w relationship and thus a reduced number of breakpoints when the ratio of length to mean channel width is larger than 7 the cross sectional shape is basically stable so the accuracy of z0 derived from the z w relationship is stable the average cross section geometric shape of reach 3 is essentially constant under different length scales fig a1 and the error variation of z0 is not substantial which explains why the ape of z0 of reach 3 showed a different trend from that of other reaches overall the developed method calls for the reach averaged length to attain a certain size to increase the precision of the river bathymetry estimate although the w error is not necessarily minimal at larger length scales the prediction of river bathymetry can still achieve good accuracy due to the relative insensitivity of bathymetry error to river width error note that the proposed reach averaged length of 10 km is not universally applicable a suitable reach averaged length should be chosen for different sizes of rivers 4 3 fitting curve and river bathymetry estimation for all reaches after deriving z and w using remote sensing data z and w were further processed using quantile function matching to produce synthetic values of z and w at this point the nonlinear z w relationship could be fitted to synthetic estimates and extrapolated to predict z0 fig 12 demonstrates the process of fitting the nl model from nonsynchronous z and w time series data through quantile function matching as expected the z w relationship shows nondecreasing behavior the coefficient of determination is close to 1 00 r2 0 982 0 997 for all reaches which indicates that the model parameters are quite reliable additionally the r values range from 4 10 to 7 73 for reaches 1 to 5 fig 12 the r values of reaches 2 and 3 were significantly higher than those of the others with values of 7 73 and 6 68 respectively the size of the r value determines the channel cross sectional shape as the r value increases the slope of the bank increases the bottom becomes flatter and the channel cross sectional shape gradually changes from a smooth parabola to an approximate trapezoid this explains the significant differences between reaches 2 and 3 compared to the others bjerklie et al 2020 found that river cross sectional shape is on average parabolic i e r 2 based on an analysis of over 25 000 river cross sections throughout the united states from adcp data however in the present study the average value of r in reaches 1 to 5 was 5 59 due to the different ranges of the study reaches this is not unexpected indeed the value of r 2 describes the average cross sectional shape of different types of rivers including mountain and plain rivers while the value of r 5 59 reflects some characteristics of channel cross sectional in the upper yangtze river like steep banks as noted by dingman and bjerklie 2006 in some cases a value as high as r 5 may be appropriate the channel exposure of reaches 1 to 5 was in the range of 21 7 37 2 during the brief satellite observation period 2016 2021 because satellite observation under moderate flow typically predominates fig 13 illustrates the discrepancy between the actual and estimated bathymetry the results show that the suggested approach can reliably mimic the actual reach averaged cross section at moderate and high water levels however extrapolation results for areas close to the riverbed contain minor errors table 3 reports statistics of z0 prediction errors over all reaches specifically the me and ape values of z0 range from 3 05 m to 11 38 m and 1 25 to 6 18 for reaches 1 to 5 respectively compared to other reaches poor performance was observed at reach 5 this is predominantly because the reach averaged cross section of reach 5 is similar to a triangle section which results in an excessively steep decline in the water level as the river width decreases fig 13 overall the river bathymetry is overestimated at low channel exposure e 40 for all reaches 4 4 impact of channel exposure the z and w observations generated by the actual reach averaged cross section were perturbed by adding noise from monte carlo simulations to produce remote sensing like observations later the remote sensing derived synthetic z and w data were expanded to different channel exposures e 40 60 80 and 90 this analysis enabled us to compare the prediction error of z0 to different channel exposures to obtain a general rule the actual reach averaged cross sections of reach averaged lengths of 6 km 8 km and 10 km were considered the me values for z0 retrievals fitted by the nonlinear z w relationships are shown in fig 14 varying as a function of channel exposure note that the prediction results of all reaches based on remote sensing observations were regarded as one group although their channel exposure varied e 21 7 37 2 as shown in fig 14 the z0 projections extrapolated by z w relationships become more accurate as more of the channel is exposed the median me values decrease from 4 58 m at e 0 40 to 1 20 m at e 90 furthermore the distribution curves show that the distribution of me values becomes more concentrated with an increase in e this finding is consistent with previous studies mersel et al 2013 schaperow et al 2019 reporting that a rise in e can improve the prediction accuracy of river bathymetry the suggested approach depends on channel exposure during the satellite observation period values of e were low and thus river bathymetry was overestimated the proposed method might be able to reasonably approximate river bathymetry if extremely dry water conditions e g extreme drought in the yangtze river basin in the summer of 2022 xia et al 2022 can be captured over a longer observation period however as extremely low water levels in rivers observed by satellites are unpredictable methods to improve river bathymetry accuracy within a constrained time window were investigated the results of z0 prediction could be adjusted by adding correction coefficient k eq 15 presuming that partial river bathymetry data were available for the reaches the z w relationship was fitted by deriving the synthetic z and w values under different channel exposures from the a priori river bathymetry and was extrapolated to obtain z0 the function between e and me could then be obtained eq 16 based on this function correction factor k was calculated eq 17 15 z 0 ins k z 0 16 me z 0 z 0 ins f e 17 k 1 f e z 0 where z0 and z0 ins are the estimated and the actual river bottom elevations respectively e represents channel exposure the functions between e and me of reaches 1 to 5 were established to calculate k values processed from different reaches fig a2 all calculated k values do not differ much and are concentrated between values of 0 974 and 0 990 for this purpose a constant i e kc 0 981 which is applicable to the upper yangtze river was obtained by averaging all k values fig 15 displays the z0 prediction errors ape after corrected by different k values all k values are effective in improving the prediction of z0 fig 15 which means that the estimated k of one reach can be successfully applied to other reaches the k values calculated by reach 2 had the best effect reducing the degree of error by an average of 87 for all reaches even reach 5 which had the worst effect can reduce the level of error by 33 thus k values provide a possibility to improve z0 errors using priori information from nearby reaches which helps to alleviate the limitations of e 5 conclusion in this study a method to estimate river bathymetry that exclusively uses the remotely sensed observations of z and w is developed and tested by fitting synthetic z and w observations to produce a nonlinear z w relationship eq 8 z0 and cross sectional shape can be estimated the results for five reaches of the upper yangtze river show me and ape errors of z0 are 3 05 11 38 m and 1 25 6 18 respectively at a low e i e e 40 the method overestimates the bathymetry however as e increases the accuracy of z0 improves significantly and the median me values of z0 decrease from 4 58 m at e 0 40 to 1 20 m at e 90 the r value reflects the characteristics of the channel cross sectional shape in reaches 1 to 5 the r values range from 4 10 to 7 73 the river bottom becomes flatter and the river bank becomes steeper as r increases additionally as the reach averaged length increases the average channel cross section tends to have a stable and smooth cross sectional shape which reduces the z0 prediction error this illustrates that averaging reaches over an appropriate length can reduce variability in river bathymetry estimates for the upper yangtze river 10 km might be a suitable length the results of the present sensitivity analysis further indicate that river bathymetry inversion is more sensitive to errors in z when estimating river bathymetry by this method special attention should be paid to the precision of remote sensing observations of z channel exposure limits the effectiveness of our method however this limitation can be mitigated by using the correction factor k obtained from the priori information of nearby reaches for the yangtze river a constant of k 0 981 can be used to improve the estimates of reaches with low channel exposure reiterating that the bathymetry determined by this method is an average value that reflects the average cross sectional geometry of river reaches the proposed method is not intended to study the evolution of cross sectional shape owing to sediment load and movement despite the above limitations the proposed method is expected to provide a preliminary bathymetric estimate for global rivers this can provide an a priori distribution for other river bathymetry inversion approaches e g the da method and improve the assumption of channel cross sections in hydrodynamic models in addition this method can be extended to swot missions and river discharge estimation based on bathymetric estimate using our method can be considered for further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1933,due to climate change the frequencies of extreme meteorological events have increased around the world over the last few decades which would significantly affect the growth of vegetation especially in humid regions however few previous studies have investigated the effects of compound extreme meteorological events on the growth of vegetation such as compound drought and heat events cdhes in this research we assessed the individual and interactive impacts of drought and heat events on the growth of vegetation using geographic detectors in the poyang lake basin pylb which is located in a typical humid zone in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlyr of china we found that the effect of heat events on the growth of vegetation was greater than that of drought events in this region among the various vegetation types shrubland sl and cultivated vegetation cv were most significantly affected by drought and heat events respectively and broadleaf forest blf was more tolerant of drought heat events than other vegetation drought events had significantly negative effects on the growth of vegetation and needle leaf nlf and blf exhibited a two month lagged response the impact of cdhe on the growth of vegetation was remarkably stronger than that of a single event and the interaction type was bi factor enhanced or nonlinear enhanced our findings highlight

events fischer et al 2021 nangombe et al 2018 extreme weather events are forecast to grow more frequent and more spatially widespread in the future diffenbaugh et al 2015 skinner et al 2018 vegetation is a sensitive indicator of climate change and it may be severely threatened meanwhile vegetation is a vital dynamic part of the terrestrial and atmospheric systems and it may affect the underlying surface conditions water vapor cycle and carbon cycle christopher et al 2018 sungmin et al 2022 the growth of vegetation is influenced and constrained by climatic conditions and a suitable combination of water and heat is important for its growth nemani et al 2003 the vegetation is abundant and varied in the humid zones and this area has a high incidence of droughts heat waves and other events ning et al 2022 wu and jiang 2022 chen et al 2021 liu et al 2022a for example the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlyr experienced an unprecedented drought and heat event during the summer and fall in 2022 these events can affect various vegetation growth processes including photosynthesis breathing action and carbon utilization thereby result in leaf senescence and mortality reichstein et al 2013 teskey et al 2015 berdugo et al 2020 therefore it is important to investigate the effects of extreme meteorological events on vegetation in humid areas precipitation and temperature are the key climatic factors that affect the growth of vegetation and climate anomalies or drought and heat are mostly represented using indices of drought e g standardized precipitation index spi and heat standardized temperature index sti mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 zscheischler et al 2017a these indices have been applied widely to assess drought or heat events at global or regional scales over recent decades many studies have been conducted to improve our understanding of the impacts of drought or heat on vegetation miller et al 2022 li et al 2021 baumbach et al 2017 gampe et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 for example wang et al 2022 investigated the effects of drought events on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi for vegetation in inner mongolia and found that the probability of ndvi degradation increased with the degree of drought xu et al 2019 showed that the impacts of extreme droughts on vegetation productivity will increase further under climate change rita et al 2020 investigated the impacts of the european summer drought in 2017 on the vegetation ndvi and found marked differences in the responses of different types of vegetation to drought where these differences were closely linked to elevation dong et al 2022 found that heat events slowed the growth in the vegetation ndvi on the tibetan plateau and the growth of vegetation was more sensitive to heat events in june than july and august zhang et al 2015 indicated that different types of vegetation vary in terms of their sensitivity to extreme heat drought and heat events may occur simultaneously and the two may interact but previous studies mainly assessed the separate effects of drought or heat events on vegetation droughts and heat rarely occur separately and thus they should be regarded as compound extreme events zscheischler et al 2017b that may have greater impacts than individual extreme events wu et al 2021 therefore some studies have investigated the impacts of cdhes kang et al 2022 found that the desert steppe region was most affected by cdhes in inner mongolia li et al 2021 showed that the impact of cdhes on vegetation loss increased as the air temperature increased from june to august in xinjiang however cdhes are becoming more frequent and severe and their effects on vegetation growth require further investigation most previous studies that examined the effects of droughts heats on the vegetation ndvi employed correlation analysis regression analysis methods and trend analysis ge et al 2021 xiong et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhan et al 2022 rousta et al 2020 however these studies assumed significant linear relationships between certain factors and vegetation over a time series but the response of growth by terrestrial vegetation to various factors can be complex and linear statistical methods may not accurately describe the relationships between vegetation and certain variables peng et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 zhao et al 2019 copula based models have recently been applied to investigate the interactive effects of droughts and heats on vegetation li et al 2021 but this approach is unable to discern how drought and heat events interact or explain the spatial heterogeneity of plant responses to extreme events the geographic detector pattern is considered a potential approach for researching the spatial heterogeneity of growth by vegetation and related factors where it can identify the significance and extent of various types of drivers meteorology geography human activities etc and explain their interactive effect on vegetation however this model has not been widely tested for analyzing the effects of droughts and heats on the capacity for growth by vegetation the poyang lake basin pylb is located in the mlyr in southern china and this area has high vegetation cover due to the implementation of forest restoration and ecological restoration projects the types of vegetation in the pylb are diverse but broadleaf forest blf needle leaf forest nlf and scrubland sl predominate numerous national nature reserves are present in the pylb including wuyi mountain jiuling mountain and luoxiao mountain ecological resources are abundant and the terrestrial vegetation ecosystem is an important green ecological barrier in the mlyr the region is in a humid subtropical zone with abundant but highly uneven seasonal precipitation and thus drought and heat events are frequent and they can have severe impacts on the growth of vegetation therefore we studied the impacts of droughts and heats on the growth of vegetation in the pylb as a typical humid region in southern china to improve our understanding of the potential reactions of vegetation to climate change the main aims of our research were 1 to determine the relative effects of drought events and heat events on growth by different types of vegetation and 2 to quantitatively estimate the interactive effects of drought and heat events on the growth of different vegetation types 2 datasets and methods 2 1 study area the pylb is on the south side of mlyr between 113 42 118 30 e and 24 29 30 05 n fig 1 this area has a subtropical humid climate which is influenced by the east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon the pylb is one of the eight major subsections of the yangtze river basin with a basin area of 162 225 km2 and it accounts for 9 of the total basin the pylb comprises poyang lake the largest fresh lake in china and five rives system flood into the lake the terrain is low in the middle but high in the surrounding area thereby forming a relatively complete large watershed ecosystem 2 2 datasets in this study ndvi data and vegetation type data for the pylb were obtained from the resource and environmental sciences and data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the pylb has suffered more severe drought and heat events over the last two decades than previously so we focused on cdhes that occurred in this region over the last two decades gampe et al 2021 liu et al 2022a ndvi was used to characterize the vegetation growth state based on spot vegetation ndvi satellite remote sensing data from 1998 to 2019 the maximum combination approach was commonly used to reduce the effects of cloud cover and other interfering factors and the ndvi was converted into monthly data with a resolution of 1 km these data effectively reflect the changes in vegetation cover and growth and they have been widely employed for vegetation monitoring forestry utilization and other purposes chen et al 2022 in addition we used the 1 1 000 000 vegetation atlas of china we focused on the five most common planting cover types in pylb comprising cultivated vegetation cv nlf grassland gl blf and sl fig 2 we used monthly meteorological data including precipitation and temperature from 34 national basic meteorological stations in the pylb from 1998 to 2019 these data were obtained from jiangxi meteorological information center 2 3 methods 2 3 1 identification of extreme climatic events one month time scale spi and sti data were used to characterize drought and heat events during 1998 2019 where they captured the short term responses of relevant vegetation to surface fluxes zscheischler et al 2017a spi and sti were calculated following the same procedure they were computed by fitting the marginal distribution of monthly cumulative rainfall temperature to get the probability p which was then converted to a standard variable according to a standardized normal distribution ω i e s t i ω 1 p the marginal probability p of spi sti was evaluated using the empirical weibull plotting position feng et al 2021 to determine whether a basin wide drought heat event occurred based on the average spi sti for all stations in the pylb spi 0 5 indicated a drought event and sti 0 5 indicated a heat event hao et al 2020 han et al 2018 all drought and heat events during the study period could be identified using spi and sti but some of these drought and heat events were not temporally synchronized we screened out drought and heat events that were temporally coherent spi 0 5 and sti 0 5 and defined their combination as cdhe 2 3 2 identification of vegetation growth we calculated the variation in ndvi v ndvi under the condition of cdhes on a monthly scale to represent the growth or decline of vegetation as follows 1 v ndvi 0 ndvi i ndvi i 1 where v ndvi 0 denotes the change in ndvi when vegetation did not exhibit a lagged response to drought heat event and i is the time month comprising the month when the cdhe occurred the change in the vegetation in the pylb is considered to exhibit a lag time of 1 2 months in response to precipitation and temperature tan et al 2015 jiang et al 2022 thus we calculated the response of the v ndvi for vegetation with lags of one and two months under drought and heat conditions by using the following formulae 2 v ndvi 1 ndvi i 1 ndvi i 3 v ndvi 2 ndvi i 2 ndvi i where v ndvi 1 and v ndvi 2 are the changes in vegetation growth with lags of one month and two months under drought and heat conditions respectively and i is the time month comprising the month when the cdhe occurred in addition we calculated the spatial correlation between each drought heat event and vegetation v ndvi to reflect the direction of the effect of a drought heat event on the growth of vegetation spearman correlation and 95 significance tests were used for further analyses a positive spatial correlation between spi and v ndvi i e v ndvi decreased with the intensity of drought events indicated that a drought event had an inhibitory effect on the growth of vegetation a positive spatial correlation between sti and v ndvi i e v ndvi increased with the intensity of the heat event indicated that a heat event promoted the growth of vegetation and vice versa 2 3 3 quantifying single and interactive effects of extreme climate events on vegetation both drought and heat affect the growth of vegetation and they may also interact to affect vegetation therefore the factor detector and interaction factor blocks in the geographic detector were used to analyze the single and interactive effects of drought and heat events on the growth of vegetation respectively the geographic detector requires discretization of the input so it was necessary to discretize the drought heat events based on the arcgis platform spi and sti were divided into nine categories by using the natural break point method and 12 344 effective sampling points were generated in the study area the spatial correlation data for 12 344 sampling points were obtained by overlaying v ndvi spi sti and vegetation type data during the cdhe periods in the study area the geographic detector is a spatial statistical model that can effectively detect spatial heterogeneity and its related pattern wang et al 2017 this model involves overlaying the geographical distribution of variables x spi and sti and y v ndvi in space to account for the geographical heterogeneity of v ndvi caused by spi and sti fig 3 the explanatory power is calculated as follows 4 q 1 i 1 j n i σ i 2 n σ 2 where j is the classification of spi and sti ni and σ i 2 express the cell counts and the variance of v ndvi at i layer respectively n and σ 2 express the cell counts and the variance of v ndvi in the whole pylb and q express the affected degree of drought and heat events for changes in ndvi q 0 1 where a larger value of q denotes stronger explanatory power and vice versa interaction detection is used to identify the interactions between factors i e to identify whether the effects of drought events and heat events together cdhes on vegetation will be stronger or weaker than that of separate drought events heat events or whether the effects of drought events and heat events on vegetation are independent of each other the evaluation method involves comparing the single factor s q value q drought q heat and the combined effect q drought heat when q drought heat q drought q heat the interaction mode is enhanced in a nonlinear manner when q drought heat q drought q heat the mode is independent when q drought heat max q drought q heat the mode is bi factor enhanced when min q drought q heat q drought heat max q drought q heat the mode is single factor weakened when q drought heat min q drought q heat the mode is weakened in a nonlinear manner 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of drought and heat events first we identified watershed based drought and heat events during the vegetation growing season in 1998 2019 which occurred over 31 and 110 months respectively based on the one month spi and sti indices in total 15 cdhes were identified based on the temporal consistency of the drought and heat events figs 4 and 5 these cdhes generally occurred between july and september with an average occurrence frequency of about one and a half years heat events occurred frequently in the summer and autumn every year and the precipitation had obvious seasonal characteristics drought events tended to occur frequently after the end of the rainy season in july which was also the period when cdhes often occurred among these cdhes the difference in the spatial distribution of drought events was more obvious than that of heat events in addition there were large differences in the intensity of droughts among different regions of the basin whereas the differences were small for heat events severe drought events occurred in september 2001 july 2003 and september 2019 and severe heat events occurred mainly in july 2003 july 2007 and august 2019 3 2 effects of drought and heat events on vegetation differences in the physical structure of different vegetation types determine their susceptibility and tolerance to different drought heat events thus we used factor detector analysis with geographic detectors to investigate the impacts of drought and heat events on the growth of the main types of vegetation cv nlf gl blf and sl in the pylb to illustrate the effects of different drought and heat events on the growth of vegetation fig 6 shows a bar chart depicting the effects of different drought and heat events on the five main types of vegetation individually during the growing season the single factor explanatory power q of the effect of heat events on vegetation was 0 170 which was greater than that for the effect of drought events on vegetation 0 160 thereby indicating that the effect of heat events on the growth of vegetation was stronger than that of drought events in this region for different types of vegetation the single factor explanatory power q of the effect of drought events on sl was largest at 0 191 the mean value of the explanatory power q of the effect on blf was 0 140 the mean explanatory power q of the effect of heat events on cv was largest at 0 191 and the lowest was 0 153 for blf the spatial correlations between drought heat events and v ndvi showed that most drought events were positively correlated with vndvi for different vegetation types thus v ndvi was smaller when the drought event was stronger thereby indicating that drought events mainly inhibited the growth of vegetation in addition we found that some drought events were negatively correlated with v ndvi which contributed to vegetation growth but the q values for the influence of these drought events on v ndvi were generally small for example the q values were all small for the effects of the first 13th and 14th drought events on cv and similar results were also found for other types of vegetation the consistency of the direction of the effect of heat events on changes in the growth of vegetation was significantly worse than that for drought events and vegetation exhibited more irregular responses positive and negative effects were chaotic in general v ndvi was negatively correlated with more heat events thereby indicating that heat events mainly inhibited the growth of vegetation 3 3 delayed impacts of drought and heat events on vegetation growth the delayed responses of five major vegetation types in pylb to drought and heat events were also investigated we calculated the average value of the explanatory power q for the effects of 15 drought and heat events on different types of vegetation in the current month as well as with one month lag and two months lag the lag period corresponding to the maximum value of the average explanatory power is the optimal response time of vegetation to drought heat events and it indicates the lagged impact of extreme events which reflects the sensitivity of vegetation to different types of drought heat stress shi et al 2022 we found that the lagged effects of drought and heat events on vegetation varied among the vegetation types as shown in table 1 the maximum mean explanatory power for the effects of drought events on gl and sl were 0 116 and 0 159 respectively thereby indicating no significant lagged effect of drought events by contrast the responses of cv nlf and blf to drought events had lag times of 1 month 2 months and 2 months respectively sl exhibited no significant lagged response to heat events and the other four types of vegetation had lagged response times of 2 months to heat events nlf blf and sl had the same lag times in response to the effects of drought and heat events but cv and gl responded faster to drought events than heat events and gl responded significantly more rapidly 3 4 the effect of compound drought and heat events on vegetation growth fig 7 shows the single factor explanatory power and interactions for the effects of 15 drought and heat events on vegetation during 1998 2019 as shown in fig 7 the average interaction effect of drought and heat events on vegetation was 0 35 which was obviously greater than those for the individual extreme events 0 170 and 0 160 respectively thereby indicating an obvious interaction between drought and heat events the interactions clearly amplified the damaging effects of compound events compared with individual extreme climate events in particular cdhes had the strongest influence on sl where the mean q drought heat was 0 396 and the least influence on nlf with a mean q drought heat of 0 323 table 2 shows the modes of interactions between the different drought and hot events according to the results obtained by the interaction detector the interaction mode for the effects of drought and heat events on ndvi was bi factor enhanced or nonlinear enhanced which suggests that the interaction between drought and heat events had a greater impact on the growth of vegetation than the single or combined effects of the single factors for example in 2001 the influence of compound drought and heat events on cv q drought heat 0 504 was larger than the separate effects of drought events q drought 0 278 and heat events q heat 0 294 and the interaction was bi factor enhanced in addition the influence of cdhe on sl in 2006 q drought heat 0 480 was larger than the separate effects of drought events q drought 0 101 or hot events q heat 0 348 and the interaction was nonlinear enhanced 4 discussion in this study spi and sti indexes were used to identify cdhes in the pylb and geographic detectors were used to quantitatively analyze their relative effects and interactive effects on vegetation growth which have rarely been reported in previous studies in general our results showed that heat events had a greater power for explaining the changes in vegetation than drought events thereby suggesting that the relative effect of heat events on vegetation was greater than that of drought events previous studies obtained similar conclusions where they suggested that the effect of the air temperature on vegetation was greater than that of precipitation in the pylb jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2015b possibly due to the abundant precipitation in humid areas where rainfall is not the key factor that promotes or limits the growth of vegetation zhang and zhang 2019 different types of vegetation respond differently to drought and heat events we found that drought events and heat events had small impacts on the forest vegetation types nlf and blf with a lag effect of two months which indicates that forests are more tolerant of extreme weather conditions than other types of vegetation as also suggested by huang and xia 2019 zhang et al 2016 and baumbach et al 2017 huang and xia 2019 found that even under severe drought conditions blf was more stable than other types of vegetation gl and sl baumbach et al 2017 also showed that forests exhibited almost no significant correlations between extreme heat and very low ndvi events which suggests that they were better able to withstand extreme heat than other types of vegetation we also found that gl and sl responded more quickly to drought events probably because they tend to absorb moisture from the topsoil and react rapidly to rainfall changes jiang et al 2022 similar results were obtained by zhang et al 2017 and shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 and shi et al 2022 showed that the lag time was shorter in response to drought for gl and sl than woodland cv comprises shallow rooted species but the time lag in response to drought was longer compared with gl probably because irrigation attenuated the sensitivity to drought zhan et al 2022 in particular we found that most of the drought events had consistent inhibitory effects on the growth of vegetation and the few drought events that promoted the growth of vegetation usually had smaller values for the explanatory power q heat events had highly irregular inhibitory or promoting effects on the growth of vegetation which may have been related to the different heat preferences of certain vegetation types different types of vegetation vary in terms of their water and heat use strategies rooting habits xylem structure and stomatal regulation strategies which can all affect their tolerance of extreme weather conditions xu et al 2018 wu et al 2015 in addition increases in temperature can affect the growth of vegetation in two ways where an appropriate amount of warming can boost vegetation growth by increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis wang et al 2015a papagiannopoulou et al 2017 but when the temperature exceeds that tolerated by vegetation the denaturation of enzymes may be accelerated to inhibit growth wang and alimohammadi 2012 zhang et al 2015a wang et al 2021a thus in future studies additional sample sequences and particular plant species will need to be assessed to further quantify the effects of drought or heat events fig 7 shows that there was a clear interaction between drought events and heat events and the impact of cdhes on vegetation was stronger than that of the individual extreme events in addition the characteristic spatial distributions of growing vegetation are generally influenced by the combined effect of drought and heat events when drought is accompanied by heat low moisture conditions are generated to exacerbate the negative effects of heat stress thereby drastically reducing the growth of vegetation li et al 2020 teskey et al 2015 roy et al 2022 we employed different methods in this study but our findings are consistent with those obtained previously compound drought and heat events will have more severe impacts on ecosystems zscheischler et al 2018 gazol and camarero 2022 for example feng et al 2019 showed that when extreme drought heat events became cdhes the risk of vegetation loss will be increased zhu et al 2021 explored the impacts of high temperature and drought on vegetation growth in china and showed that the combined impact of high temperature and drought on vegetation productivity was greater than that of drought or high temperature alone in addition there are obvious differences between the study areas which may lead to different conclusions for example in arid regions kang et al 2022 studied the influence of cdhes on the ndvi in inner mongolia and found that temperature had the greatest effect on vegetation followed by cdhes and drought had the least significant effect it is possible that the vegetation has adapted to a prolonged period of low precipitation and is more resistant to drought in this study we explored the interaction between drought and heat events which interacted in a bi factor enhanced or nonlinear enhanced mode interaction patterns are influenced by factors such as drought and heat conditions and vegetation types so it is necessary to consider different drought and heat conditions and refine the vegetation types in further studies to examine the effects of drought and heat events on vegetation we analyzed the pylb as a typical humid zone to obtain important insights into the response of vegetation to cdhes in this climatic region climate change has increased the probability and extent of drought and heat events and drought events are often accompanied by heat and thus the interaction between them amplifies their ecological impacts ridder et al 2022 wang et al 2021b therefore it is crucial to consider interactions compound events when analyzing the impacts of extreme events a unique advantage of our method is that the interactions between extreme climate events can be quantified using the geographic detector model which is not based on linear assumptions and it yields more reliable interaction results than classical regression analysis wang and xu 2017 our findings provide new insights into the use of the geographic detector model to explore the effects of compound weather extremes on vegetation and this method can be easily extended to other climatic regions at present there are ndvi data sets with longer time series such as the gimms ndvi3g version1 dataset 1982 2015 however with the increasing degree of climate change the probability of the appearance of cdhes increased significantly in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river of china after 2000 gampe et al 2021 liu et al 2022a and thus the ndvi data set from 1998 to 2019 was collected it should note that extreme weather events are still frequent after 2019 liu et al 2022b however the corresponding meteorological data are inaccessible therefore it is quite necessary to consider recent datasets in future studies to enhance the conclusions in addition our study was conducted based on a monthly time scale where we focused on the short term effects of cdhes on vegetation as well as considering the simultaneous and lagged relationships between drought heat events and vegetation and thus we may have overlooked the cumulative effects of drought and heat events on vegetation therefore the cumulative impacts of extreme climate events need to be investigated in future studies 5 conclusions in this research we used the geographic detector pattern to quantitatively assess the individual and interactive effects of drought and heat events on vegetation in the pylb which is located in a typical humid zone in southern china the impact of heat events on vegetation was generally stronger than that of drought events in the study area the responses of different vegetation types to drought heat events varied whereas blf was more tolerant of drought heat events than other vegetation types drought events mainly inhibited the growth of vegetation whereas heat events had mixed effects on inhibiting or promoting the growth of vegetation sl responded the fastest to drought heat events whereas the responses of nlf and blf generally had two month lags the effect of cdhes on the growth of vegetation q drought heat 0 35 was significantly stronger than that of the individual extreme events 0 170 and 0 160 respectively with nonlinear enhanced and bi factor enhanced interaction modes credit authorship contribution statement huiming han methodology

1933,due to climate change the frequencies of extreme meteorological events have increased around the world over the last few decades which would significantly affect the growth of vegetation especially in humid regions however few previous studies have investigated the effects of compound extreme meteorological events on the growth of vegetation such as compound drought and heat events cdhes in this research we assessed the individual and interactive impacts of drought and heat events on the growth of vegetation using geographic detectors in the poyang lake basin pylb which is located in a typical humid zone in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlyr of china we found that the effect of heat events on the growth of vegetation was greater than that of drought events in this region among the various vegetation types shrubland sl and cultivated vegetation cv were most significantly affected by drought and heat events respectively and broadleaf forest blf was more tolerant of drought heat events than other vegetation drought events had significantly negative effects on the growth of vegetation and needle leaf nlf and blf exhibited a two month lagged response the impact of cdhe on the growth of vegetation was remarkably stronger than that of a single event and the interaction type was bi factor enhanced or nonlinear enhanced our findings highlight

et al 2022 wu and jiang 2022 chen et al 2021 liu et al 2022a for example the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlyr experienced an unprecedented drought and heat event during the summer and fall in 2022 these events can affect various vegetation growth processes including photosynthesis breathing action and carbon utilization thereby result in leaf senescence and mortality reichstein

heterogeneity of growth by vegetation and related factors where it can identify the significance and extent of various types of drivers meteorology geography human activities etc and explain their interactive effect on vegetation however this model has not been widely tested for analyzing the effects of droughts and heats on the capacity for growth by vegetation the poyang lake basin pylb is

research were 1 to determine the relative effects of drought events and heat events on growth by different types of vegetation and 2 to quantitatively estimate the interactive effects of drought and heat events on the growth of different vegetation types 2 datasets and methods 2 1 study area the pylb is on the south side of mlyr between 113 42 118 30 e and 24 29 30 05 n fig 1 this area has a subtropical humid climate which is influenced by the east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon the pylb is one of the eight major subsections of the yangtze river basin with a basin area of 162 225 km2 and it accounts for 9 of the total basin the pylb comprises poyang lake the largest fresh lake in china and five rives system flood into the lake the terrain is low in the middle but high in the surrounding area thereby forming a relatively complete large watershed ecosystem 2 2 datasets in this study ndvi data and vegetation type data for the pylb were obtained from the resource and environmental sciences and data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the pylb has suffered more severe drought and heat events over the last two decades than previously so we focused on cdhes that occurred in this region over the last two decades gampe et al 2021 liu et al 2022a ndvi was used to characterize the vegetation growth state based on spot vegetation ndvi satellite remote sensing data from 1998 to 2019 the maximum combination approach was commonly used to reduce the effects of cloud cover and other interfering factors and the ndvi was converted into monthly data with a resolution of 1 km these data effectively reflect the changes in vegetation cover and growth and they have been widely employed for vegetation monitoring forestry utilization and other purposes chen et al 2022 in addition we used the 1 1 000 000 vegetation atlas of china we focused on the five most common planting cover types in pylb comprising cultivated vegetation cv nlf grassland gl blf and sl fig 2 we used monthly meteorological data including precipitation and temperature from 34 national basic meteorological stations in the pylb from 1998 to 2019 these data were obtained from jiangxi meteorological information center 2 3 methods 2 3 1 identification of extreme climatic events one month time scale spi and sti data were used to characterize drought and heat events during 1998 2019 where they captured the short term responses of relevant vegetation to surface fluxes zscheischler et al 2017a spi and sti were calculated following the same procedure they were computed by fitting the marginal distribution of monthly cumulative rainfall temperature to get the probability p which was then converted to a standard variable according to a standardized normal distribution ω i e s t i ω 1 p the marginal probability p of spi sti was evaluated using the empirical weibull plotting position feng et al 2021 to determine whether a basin wide drought heat event occurred based on the average spi sti for all stations in the pylb spi 0 5 indicated a drought event and sti 0 5 indicated a heat event hao et al 2020 han et al 2018 all drought and heat events during the study period could be identified using spi and sti but some of these drought and heat events were not temporally synchronized we screened out drought and heat events that were temporally coherent spi 0 5 and sti 0 5 and defined their combination as cdhe 2 3 2 identification of vegetation growth we calculated the variation in ndvi v ndvi under the condition of cdhes on a monthly scale to represent the growth or decline of vegetation as follows 1 v ndvi 0 ndvi i ndvi i 1 where v ndvi 0 denotes the change in ndvi when vegetation did not exhibit a lagged response to drought heat event and i is the time month comprising the month when the cdhe occurred the change in the vegetation in the pylb is considered to exhibit a lag time of 1 2 months in response to precipitation and temperature tan et al 2015 jiang et al 2022 thus we calculated the response of the v ndvi for vegetation with lags of one and two months under drought and heat conditions by using the following formulae 2 v ndvi 1 ndvi i 1 ndvi i 3 v ndvi 2 ndvi i 2 ndvi i where v ndvi 1 and v ndvi 2 are the changes in vegetation growth with lags of one month and two months under drought and heat conditions respectively and i is the time month comprising the month when the cdhe occurred in addition we calculated the spatial correlation between each drought heat event and vegetation v ndvi to reflect the direction of the effect of a drought heat event on the growth of vegetation spearman correlation and 95 significance tests were used for further analyses a positive spatial correlation between spi and v ndvi i e v ndvi decreased with the intensity of drought events indicated that a drought event had an inhibitory effect on the growth of vegetation a positive spatial correlation between sti and v ndvi i e v ndvi increased with the intensity of the heat event indicated that a heat event promoted the growth of vegetation and vice versa 2 3 3 quantifying single and interactive effects of extreme climate events on vegetation both drought and heat affect the growth of vegetation and they may also interact to affect vegetation therefore the factor detector and interaction factor blocks in the geographic detector were used to analyze the single and interactive effects of drought and heat events on the growth of vegetation respectively the geographic detector requires discretization of the input so it was necessary to discretize the drought heat events based on the arcgis platform spi and sti were divided into nine categories by using the natural break point method and 12 344 effective sampling points were generated in the study area the spatial correlation data for 12 344 sampling points were obtained by overlaying v ndvi spi sti and vegetation type data during the cdhe periods in the study area the geographic detector is a spatial statistical model that can effectively detect spatial heterogeneity and its related pattern wang et al 2017 this model involves overlaying the geographical distribution of variables x spi and sti and y v ndvi in space to account for the geographical heterogeneity of v ndvi caused by spi and sti fig 3 the explanatory power is calculated as follows 4 q 1 i 1 j n i σ i 2 n σ 2 where j is the classification of spi and sti ni and σ i 2 express the cell counts and the variance of v ndvi at i layer respectively n and σ 2 express the cell counts and the variance of v ndvi in the whole pylb and q express the affected degree of drought and heat events for changes in ndvi q 0 1 where a larger value of q denotes stronger explanatory power and vice versa interaction detection is used to identify the interactions between factors i e to identify whether the effects of drought events and heat events together cdhes on vegetation will be stronger or weaker than that of separate drought events heat events or whether the effects of drought events and heat events on vegetation are independent of each other the evaluation method involves comparing the single factor s q value q drought q heat and the combined effect q drought heat when q drought heat q drought q heat the interaction mode is enhanced in a nonlinear manner when q drought heat q drought q heat the mode is independent when q drought heat max q drought q heat the mode is bi factor enhanced when min q drought q heat q drought heat max q drought q heat the mode is single factor weakened when q drought heat min q drought q heat the mode is weakened in a nonlinear manner 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of drought and heat events first we identified watershed based drought and heat events during the vegetation growing season in 1998 2019 which occurred over 31 and 110 months respectively based on the one month spi and sti indices in total 15 cdhes were identified based on the temporal consistency of the drought and heat events figs 4 and 5 these cdhes generally occurred between july and september with an average occurrence frequency of about one and a half years heat events occurred frequently in the summer and autumn every year and the precipitation had obvious seasonal characteristics drought events tended to occur frequently after the end of the rainy season in july which was also the period when cdhes often occurred among these cdhes the difference in the spatial distribution of drought events was more obvious than that of heat events in addition there were large differences in the intensity of droughts among different regions of the basin whereas the differences were small for heat events severe drought events occurred in september 2001 july 2003 and september 2019 and severe heat events occurred mainly in july 2003 july 2007 and august 2019 3 2 effects of drought and heat events on vegetation differences in the physical structure of different vegetation types determine their susceptibility and tolerance to different drought heat events thus we used factor detector analysis with geographic detectors to investigate the impacts of drought and heat events on the growth of the main types of vegetation cv nlf gl blf and sl in the pylb to illustrate the effects of different drought and heat events on the growth of vegetation fig 6 shows a bar chart depicting the effects of different drought and heat events on the five main types of vegetation individually during the growing season the single factor explanatory power q of the effect of heat events on vegetation was 0 170 which was greater than that for the effect of drought events on vegetation 0 160 thereby indicating that the effect of heat events on the growth of vegetation was stronger than that of drought events in this region for different types of vegetation the single factor explanatory power q of the effect of drought events on sl was largest at 0 191 the mean value of the explanatory power q of the effect on blf was 0 140 the mean explanatory power q of the effect of heat events on cv was largest at 0 191 and the lowest was 0 153 for blf the spatial correlations between drought heat events and v ndvi showed that most drought events were positively correlated with vndvi for different vegetation types thus v ndvi was smaller when the drought event was stronger thereby indicating that drought events mainly inhibited the growth of vegetation in addition we found that some drought events were negatively correlated with v ndvi which contributed to vegetation growth but the q values for the influence of these drought events on v ndvi were generally small for example the q values were all small for the effects of the first 13th and 14th drought events on cv and similar results were also found for other types of vegetation the consistency of the direction of the effect of heat events on changes in the growth of vegetation was significantly worse than that for drought events and vegetation exhibited more irregular responses positive and negative effects were chaotic in general v ndvi was negatively correlated with more heat events thereby indicating that heat events mainly inhibited the growth of vegetation 3 3 delayed impacts of drought and heat events on vegetation growth the delayed responses of five major vegetation types in pylb to drought and heat events were also investigated we calculated the average value of the explanatory power q for the effects of 15 drought and heat events on different types of vegetation in the current month as well as with one month lag and two months lag the lag period corresponding to the maximum value of the average explanatory power is the optimal response time of vegetation to drought heat events and it indicates the lagged impact of extreme events which reflects the sensitivity of vegetation to different types of drought heat stress shi et al 2022 we found that the lagged effects of drought and heat events on vegetation varied among the vegetation types as shown in table 1 the maximum mean explanatory power for the effects of drought events on gl and sl were 0 116 and 0 159 respectively thereby indicating no significant lagged effect of drought events by contrast the responses of cv nlf and blf to drought events had lag times of 1 month 2 months and 2 months respectively sl exhibited no significant lagged response to heat events and the other four types of vegetation had lagged response times of 2 months to heat events nlf blf and sl had the same lag times in response to the effects of drought and heat events but cv and gl responded faster to drought events than heat events and gl responded significantly more rapidly 3 4 the effect of compound drought and heat events on vegetation growth fig 7 shows the single factor explanatory power and interactions for the effects of 15 drought and heat events on vegetation during 1998 2019 as shown in fig 7 the average interaction effect of drought and heat events on vegetation was 0 35 which was obviously greater than those for the individual extreme events 0 170 and 0 160 respectively thereby indicating an obvious interaction between drought and heat events the interactions clearly amplified the damaging effects of compound events compared with individual extreme climate events in particular cdhes had the strongest influence on sl where the mean q drought heat was 0 396 and the least influence on nlf with a mean q drought heat of 0 323 table 2 shows the modes of interactions between the different drought and hot events according to the results obtained by the interaction detector the interaction mode for the effects of drought and heat events on ndvi was bi factor enhanced or nonlinear enhanced which suggests that the interaction between drought and heat events had a greater impact on the growth of vegetation than the single or combined effects of the single factors for example in 2001 the influence of compound drought and heat events on cv q drought heat 0 504 was larger than the separate effects of drought events q drought 0 278 and heat events q heat 0 294 and the interaction was bi factor enhanced in addition the influence of cdhe on sl in 2006 q drought heat 0 480 was larger than the separate effects of drought events q drought 0 101 or hot events q heat 0 348 and the interaction was nonlinear enhanced 4 discussion in this study spi and sti indexes were used to identify cdhes in the pylb and geographic detectors were used to quantitatively analyze their relative effects and interactive effects on vegetation growth which have rarely been reported in previous studies in general our results showed that heat events had a greater power for explaining the changes in vegetation than drought events thereby suggesting that the relative effect of heat events on vegetation was greater than that of drought events previous studies obtained similar conclusions where they suggested that the effect of the air temperature on vegetation was greater than that of precipitation in the pylb jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2015b possibly due to the abundant precipitation in humid areas where rainfall is not the key factor that promotes or limits the growth of vegetation zhang and zhang 2019 different types of vegetation respond differently to drought and heat events we found that drought events and heat events had small impacts on the forest vegetation types nlf and blf with a lag effect of two months which indicates that forests are more tolerant of extreme weather conditions than other types of vegetation as also suggested by huang and xia 2019 zhang et al 2016 and baumbach et al 2017 huang and xia 2019 found that even under severe drought conditions blf was more stable than other types of vegetation gl and sl baumbach et al 2017 also showed that forests exhibited almost no significant correlations between extreme heat and very low ndvi events which suggests that they were better able to withstand extreme heat than other types of vegetation we also found that gl and sl responded more quickly to drought events probably because they tend to absorb moisture from the topsoil and react rapidly to rainfall changes jiang et al 2022 similar results were obtained by zhang et al 2017 and shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 and shi et al 2022 showed that the lag time was shorter in response to drought for gl and sl than woodland cv comprises shallow rooted species but the time lag in response to drought was longer compared with gl probably because irrigation attenuated the sensitivity to drought zhan et al 2022 in particular we found that most of the drought events had consistent inhibitory effects on the growth of vegetation and the few drought events that promoted the growth of vegetation usually had smaller values for the explanatory power q heat events had highly irregular inhibitory or promoting effects on the growth of vegetation which may have been related to the different heat preferences of certain vegetation types different types of vegetation vary in terms of their water and heat use strategies rooting habits xylem structure and stomatal regulation strategies which can all affect their tolerance of extreme weather conditions xu et al 2018 wu et al 2015 in addition increases in temperature can affect the growth of vegetation in two ways where an appropriate amount of warming can boost vegetation growth by increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis wang et al 2015a papagiannopoulou et al 2017 but when the temperature exceeds that tolerated by vegetation the denaturation of enzymes may be accelerated to inhibit growth wang and alimohammadi 2012 zhang et al 2015a wang et al 2021a thus in future studies additional sample sequences and particular plant species will need to be assessed to further quantify the effects of drought or heat events fig 7 shows that there was a clear interaction between drought events and heat events and the impact of cdhes on vegetation was stronger than that of the individual extreme events in addition the characteristic spatial distributions of growing vegetation are generally influenced by the combined effect of drought and heat events when drought is accompanied by heat low moisture conditions are generated to exacerbate the negative effects of heat stress thereby drastically reducing the growth of vegetation li et al 2020 teskey et al 2015 roy et al 2022 we employed different methods in this study but our findings are consistent with those obtained previously compound drought and heat events will have more severe impacts on ecosystems zscheischler et al 2018 gazol and camarero 2022 for example feng et al 2019 showed that when extreme drought heat events became cdhes the risk of vegetation loss will be increased zhu et al 2021 explored the impacts of high temperature and drought on vegetation growth in china and showed that the combined impact of high temperature and drought on vegetation productivity was greater than that of drought or high temperature alone in addition there are obvious differences between the study areas which may lead to different conclusions for example in arid regions kang et al 2022 studied the influence of cdhes on the ndvi in inner mongolia and found that temperature had the greatest effect on vegetation followed by cdhes and drought had the least significant effect it is possible that the vegetation has adapted to a prolonged period of low precipitation and is more resistant to drought in this study we explored the interaction between drought and heat events which interacted in a bi factor enhanced or nonlinear enhanced mode interaction patterns are influenced by factors such as drought and heat conditions and vegetation types so it is necessary to consider different drought and heat conditions and refine the vegetation types in further studies to examine the effects of drought and heat events on vegetation we analyzed the pylb as a typical humid zone to obtain important insights into the response of vegetation to cdhes in this climatic region climate change has increased the probability and extent of drought and heat events and drought events are often accompanied by heat and thus the interaction between them amplifies their ecological impacts ridder et al 2022 wang et al 2021b therefore it is crucial to consider interactions compound events when analyzing the impacts of extreme events a unique advantage of our method is that the interactions between extreme climate events can be quantified using the geographic detector model which is not based on linear assumptions and it yields more reliable interaction results than classical regression analysis wang and xu 2017 our findings provide new insights into the use of the geographic detector model to explore the effects of compound weather extremes on vegetation and this method can be easily extended to other climatic regions at present there are ndvi data sets with longer time series such as the gimms ndvi3g version1 dataset 1982 2015 however with the increasing degree of climate change the probability of the appearance of cdhes increased significantly in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river of china after 2000 gampe et al 2021 liu et al 2022a and thus the ndvi data set from 1998 to 2019 was collected it should note that extreme weather events are still frequent after 2019 liu et al 2022b however the corresponding meteorological data are inaccessible therefore it is quite necessary to consider recent datasets in future studies to enhance the conclusions in addition our study was conducted based on a monthly time scale where we focused on the short term effects of cdhes on vegetation as well as considering the simultaneous and lagged relationships between drought heat events and vegetation and thus we may have overlooked the cumulative effects of drought and heat events on vegetation therefore the cumulative impacts of extreme climate events need to be investigated in future studies 5 conclusions in this research we used the geographic detector pattern to quantitatively assess the individual and interactive effects of drought and heat events on vegetation in the pylb which is located in a typical humid zone in southern china the impact of heat events on vegetation was generally stronger than that of drought events in the study area the responses of different vegetation types to drought heat events varied whereas blf was more tolerant of drought heat events than other vegetation types drought events mainly inhibited the growth of vegetation whereas heat events had mixed effects on inhibiting or promoting the growth of vegetation sl responded the fastest to drought heat events whereas the responses of nlf and blf generally had two month lags the effect of cdhes on the growth of vegetation q drought heat 0 35 was significantly stronger than that of the individual extreme events 0 170 and 0 160 respectively with nonlinear enhanced and bi factor enhanced interaction modes credit authorship contribution statement huiming han methodology

1934,the accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et and its major components e g transpiration tr and soil evaporation ev requires an understanding of complex soil plant atmosphere interactions the temperature gradient based three temperature 3t model for simulating the dynamics of ev and tr has no requirement for resistance terms and its use of simple input variables i e temperature and radiation allows its application to both field studies and remote sensing however reference temperature is a key requirement for the 3t model and approaches for obtaining accurate reference temperature and the implications of different reference temperature choices on et estimates remain poorly understood this study improved a resistance based model applicable to a wide range of climatic ecosystem conditions and integrated it with the 3t model to predict et and tr a novel numerical approach was used to estimate the reference temperature under dry land surface scenarios the two models provided similar predictions of ev tr and et at the four sites provided that the available energy for the canopy e g net radiation and ground soil e g net radiation and ground heat flux was constrained within the framework of the energy balance alternatively the accuracy of simulations of ev and et by the 3t model significantly declined due to systematic mismatching of input drivers temperature and radiation under dry and wet scenarios we emphasize that 3t is working better when input temperature and radiation under dry and wet land conditions were systematically matched within the framework of energy balance the results of this study provide a promising novel temperature gradient method for detecting canopy water stress keywords evapotranspiration transpiration temperature

stomata good et al 2014 li et al 2019 liu et al 2022 the accurate estimation of et and the partitioning of et into ev and tr is vital for understanding earth surface processes and their feedbacks to climate systems jasechko et al 2013 wang et al 2014 good et al 2015 lian et al 2018 wei et al 2017 the dynamics of soil evaporation and plant transpiration have significant impacts on the earth surface temperature and the suitability of climate and soil conditions for sustaining ecosystems anderegg et al 2019 piao et al 2020 the analytical expressions of et its time varying properties and its components provide a basis for understanding climate soil vegetation interactions e g penman 1948 monteith 1977 allen et al 1998 einara et al 2022 koppa et al 2022 developing these analytical expressions can pose a challenge due to the limitations associated with the structure and parameterization of ecohydrological models fatichi et al 2016 yang et al 2016 gibson et al 2021 liebhard et al 2022 the high complexity of evapotranspiration dynamics necessitates the need for occasional simplification of the processes affecting et ev and tr to solve these et related analytical expressions as well as ignoring aerodynamic and surface resistances e g eichelmann et al 2022 zhao et al 2019 this is particularly true for remote sensing based large scale et estimates where each type of resistance is difficult to parameterize anderson et al 2012 milly and dunne 2016 norman et al 1995 wang et al 2007 burchard et al 2022 the temperature based model uses thermal remotely sensed land surface temperature lst to estimate et anderson et al 2007 bartholie et al 1972 minacapilli et al 2016 norman et al 1995 chen et al 2021 resistance based models widely use the penman monteith p m equation to estimate et allen et al 1998 dai et al 2004 luo et al 2018 monteith 1977 penman 1948 models of a wide range of complexity including both resistance based and temperature based have been developed to estimate et and its components anderson et al 2012 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 wang and yamanaka 2014 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 xinlei et al 2022 however as noted by chen and liu 2020 it remains a challenge to estimate et by integration of resistance based and temperature based schemes in addition to the above challenges research in this field has been limited by the lack of et partitioning in addition relatively few studies have been conducted on linking canopy temperature gradient and plant water stress recent theoretical methods have been developed to address this issue jackson et al 1981 liu et al 2020 qiu et al 2009 for example qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1996b qiu et al 1998 developed the three temperature 3t model for estimating evaporation using measured surface temperature reference surface temperature e g dry soil without evaporation or a dry canopy without transpiration and air temperature as input parameters reference dry leaf temperature tl d or reference dry soil temperature tgd of man made dry leaves and dry soil respectively can be measured simultaneously using a ground based thermal imaging instrument this reference temperature can be used as input to a 3t model for obtaining accurate estimations of et and its components e g feng et al 2014 qiu et al 1998 1999a 1999b zhao et al 2022 the 3t model has been extended for remote sensing applications through the use of a satellite based thermal imager qiu et al 2006 qiu and zhao 2010 xiong and qiu 2011 2014 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 and successfully applied to the global scale for producing et products yu et al 2022 the 3t model requires limited inputs representative of key et process e g net radiation and temperature and is considered to be robust particularly for arid and semi arid areas tian et al 2013 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 the 3t model has been shown to be sensitive to input temperatures and the simulation accuracy of the model is largely limited by the accuracy of the input reference temperature qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1998 xiong et al 2019 however tld and tgd are assumed values and are difficult to measure in practice therefore obtaining an accurate representation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the reference temperature poses a challenge in general tld and tgd can be used within remote sensing applications by selecting the maximum lst within a suitable pixel however their values vary with the scale of the selected pixels thereby limiting the model applicability tian et al 2013 2014 xiong and qiu 2011 2014 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 tld and tgd can provide insights into the relationships between climate soil and vegetation under dry land surfaces therefore deriving methods for theoretically estimating tld and tgd is important for rigorously interpretating their results and for improved simulations of et and its components the present study improved a resistance based model that accounts for the aerodynamic and surface resistances of water vapor transfer between soil plants and the atmosphere over the land surface this resistance based model is appliable under a wide range of climatic ecosystem conditions the resistance based model was coupled with the 3t model for simulating et and tr the resistance based model was developed by wang and yamanaka 2014 and was chosen for various reasons first the model uses the newton raphson iteration scheme to separately solve the governing equations for the canopy and the ground surface without the need for radiometric temperature measurements second since this model uses the energy balance between the soil surface and the vegetation canopy and considers their energy interactions it can achieve a good performance in partitioning et in various ecosystems wang and yamanaka 2014 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 third the model considers all related resistance e g stomatal control of transpiration including its dependence on soil moisture the model also explicitly considers solar radiation the model was localized to fit the characteristics of each ecosystem wang and yamanaka 2014 provide further details on the model the present study aimed to develop a novel approach for coupling a 3t model and a resistance based model within an energy budget framework for simulating et and transpiration under wet and dry land surface conditions the simulations of soil and vegetation behavior by the integrated model were compared with observed data collected at the three sites in the heihe river basin in china and one site in a temperate grassland in japan the key differences between the two models were identified and sensitivity analysis was used to quantify and characterize these differences the present study also discusses how differences in the model formulations can result in differences between the model predictions 2 materials and methods 2 1 a simple 3t model the three temperature 3t model was developed by qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1996b qiu et al 1999b and was used in the present study to calculate soil ev and plant tr the model is characterized by a simplified estimation process and avoidance of resistance terms and was developed to estimate ev based on surface temperature measures by tir thermometers qiu et al 1998 2006 qiu and zhao 2010 or thermocouples qiu et al 1999a the 3t model can also be used within remote sensing applications tian et al 2013 xiong and qiu 2011 zhao et al 2010 the model makes the assumption of dry leaves and a dry soil column as the reference canopy and reference soil with negligible tr and ev respectively however the model assumes similar atmospheric properties as those of the canopy and test soil surfaces ev of the test surface could then be calculated through a comparison of the energy balance equations of reference surfaces to those of test surfaces at which time the resistance terms were canceled the 3t model requires reference dry soil dry soil without ev and reference dry leaves dry plant leaves without tr to calculate ev and tr vegetation tr is estimated by eq 1 by the inclusion of a reference temperature for vegetation 1 tr r nv r nvd t l t a t ld t a where rnvd and rngd are the net radiation values on the canopy of vegetation and the canopy of reference dry vegetation respectively tl is the vegetation temperature c tld is the reference dry vegetation temperature c and ta is the temperature of air c in contrast to previous studies in which rnv tl tld and ta were directly measured the present study directly measured only ta whereas the remaining parameters were numerically derived as described in section 2 2 ev can be estimated by eq 2 by including a reference dry soil 2 ev r ng g r ngd g d t g t a t gd t a where rng and rnd are the net radiation values on the ground soil and reference dry soil respectively g and gd are the soil heat fluxes in wet and dry soils respectively tg and tgd are the surface

and has been applied for diagnostically deriving energy balance equations e g wang and yamanaka 2014 yamanaka et al 1997 2 3 key differences between the two model formulations there are some differences between the two model formulations that influence the similarities of their representations of et ev and tr these differences are listed in tables s1 and s2 and can be summarized as 1 the 3t model requires few input parameters e g radiation and temperature and does not consider soil water and vegetation dynamics the resistance based model requires meteorological variable inputs e g radiation temperature and wind speed as well as soil e g soil water content and vegetation property inputs e g leaf area index canopy height 2 the 3t model is simple and is based on the energy balance approach therefore it does not consider resistance for estimating the latent heat flux and its components the resistance based model considers resistances of both the canopy e g leaf stomatal resistance and aerodynamic resistance and the soil layer e g aerodynamic resistance and surface soil resistance 3 radiometric temperature measurements are the key input variables for the 3t model over both actual and dry land surface the resistance based model uses the newton raphson iteration scheme to separately solve the governing equations for the canopy and the ground surface temperature without the need for radiometric temperature measurements 2 4 integrate the temperature gradient based 3t and resistance based with numerical solutions of reference temperatures the ev tr and e can be simulated both by simple 3t and a resistance based model in spite of there has large difference in the main equation input variables and calculation procedure however in essence both were derived based on the principle of surface energy balance as shown in fig 1 the resistance based model constrained by energy balance use numerical techniques to solve canopy and surface temperatures which makes it possible to correlate energy balance components with associated surface temperatures under various land conditions e g dry and wet land surface the reference temperature is the theoretical temperature of a dry environment and has strong spatial and temporal characteristics acquiring the reference temperature with a high temporal resolution is difficult which limits the accuracy of the 3t model in calculations of et as assumed there is no evaporation or transpiration exists over an ideal dry land surface and all energy is used to heat the environment in 3t model the energy balance for a dry land surface can be expressed as 15 r n vd 1 f v 1 α v s d l d σ t gd 4 2 σ t p 4 h vd 16 r n g d f v 1 α g s d l d 1 f v σ t p 4 σ t gd 4 g d h gd where rnvd and rngd are the net radiation

canopy surface respectively w m 2 hvd and hgd are given as 17 h vd c p ρ a t ld t a r av 18 h g d c p ρ a t g d t a r a g g d can be estimated as 19 g d λ soil t gd t ss z soil similarly the nr iteration scheme was applied to simultaneously solve eq 15 and eq 16 for tld and tgd respectively provided that the observed values of ha p sd ld u zv ta lai and tss were provided tld and tgd were obtained for input of the 3t model the current framework can be validated by field measurement of energy flux rn let h and g water flux tr and land surface temperature tl and tg unfortunately there is no observations of tld and tgd to calibrate the model model performance of both 3t model and resistance based model were measured by root mean square difference rmsd and the i index wang and yamanaka 2014 as well as r2 r is the correlation coefficient by measuring the performance of 3t model in different model experiment scenarios the uncertainty evaluation of et simulated by 3t model was carried out 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the method provided by beven 1979 and qiu et al 1998 the analysis allowed each model to judge the effect of typical errors

outputs o of tr et ev and t et 3 study sites and datasets 3 1 study sites and the observed data the present study validated and accessed the performance of the model by comparing model simulations to soil hydrological micrometeorological and flux data collected at four sites temperate grassland alpine meadow cropland and desert riparian forest that deployed an eddy covariance ec system and monitoring by automatic weather stations awss table 1 the temperate grassland was in the center for research in isotopes and environmental dynamics cried experimental fields at the university of tsukuba japan the routinely measures radiation energy fluxes and related meteorological variables are provided in ma et al 2018 a seasonal isotope measurement dataset including water vapor plant stem water and soil water was collected in 2011 and details of field work was described in the literature of wang et al 2015 leaf temperature were measured for randomly selected leaves at least 60 times using a handheld infrared thermometer pt 7ld optex shiga japan during the sampling period 1 h of the experiment and their mean value was taken to represent the average canopy temperature the other three sites alpine meadow cropland and desert riparian forest were in the heihe river basin north china for the ec flux dataset edire was used for post processing estimation and a set of generic algorithms were used to populate the results liu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 the sap flux density f kg m2 h 1 of the sample trees in desert riparian forest were measured by thermal dissipation method dataset of surface soil temperature measured by awss were collected at 3 sites in heihe river basin further details of the three sites and datasets https data tpdc ac cn zh hans are provided by liu et al 2018 3 2 collection of the transpiration datasets transpiration is a major component of evapotranspiration and can be estimated through several methods although transpiration can be directly measured based on sap flow evapotranspiration can be partitioned based on the isotope approach or uwue methods the present study collated all the available transpiration datasets from the study sites these data were used to assess the model performance wang et al 2015 partitioned evapotranspiration based on the field measurement of water isotopes in a temperate grassland site and obtained the transpiration dataset during the growing season zhou et al 2018 used the uwue method to obtain transpiration datasets both at daily and hourly scales in a cropland site transpiration data measured by the sap flow method bai et al 2017 for populus euphratica in the desert riparian forest site were collected 4 results 4 1 comparison between model simulated and observed evapotranspiration et simulations of the 3t model driven by the integrated reference temperature and associated temperature gradients between the actual and ideal dry surface and resistance based models were similar to measured eddy covariance ec at the four sites fig 2 with high r2 values 0 78 obtained both the simulated hourly and daily mean e of the resistance based model showed good agreement with ec observations with a small root mean square deviation rmsd 16 02 47 9 w m 2 and elevated i index 0 90 0 99 at the four sites the integrated temperature gradient based 3t model showed a similar performance with a rmsd and i index of 15 18 50 27 w m 2 and 0 90 0 99 respectively table 2 the models were able to represent the observed diurnal variation in ec among the three growing season stages early growing peak and late growing stages as well as the daily variation fig 3 with no systematic bias detected 4 2 comparison between model simulated and observed plant transpiration in contrast to the availability of robust et datasets through eddy covariance measurements few robust datasets are available for the validation of model simulations of ev and tr the simulations of tr by both the integrated temperature gradient based 3t model and resistance based models were similar to observations with high r2 0 60 values fig 4 the simulated hourly and daily mean tr by the resistance based model were in good agreement with observations with a reasonable rmsd 0 03 0 11 mm h 1 and a high i index 0 82 0 89 obtained at the four sites the integrated temperature gradient based 3t model obtained a similar performance with an rmsd and i index of 0 03 0 12 mm h 1 and 0 79 0 90 respectively table 2 4 3 evaluations of model simulated leaf canopy and ground surface temperatures the legitimacy of partitioning of et by the resistance based model can be more clearly indicated by tl and tg than by total et the simulations of leaf temperature tl and ground temperature tg by the resistance based model can be validated by in situ field measurements fig 5 the hourly mean simulations of tl and tg were in good agreement with observations with a small rmsd 2 12 2 15 c and elevated i index 0 80 0 90 similar model performances were achieved for the daily average dataset with higher rmsd and i index of 2 36 2 96 c and 0 96 0 98 respectively table 2 the model provided accurate simulations of both the diurnal and daily variations in leaf temperature tl and reference ground soil temperature tg at the four sites fig 6 4 4 sensitivity analysis both the simple 3t and the resistance based models can simulate ev tr and e both models were essentially derived based on the principle of the surface energy balance however large differences in the main equations input variables and calculation procedure exist between the two models uncertainties in the 3t model may originate from input variables and parameters table 3 summarizes the sensitivities of the 3t model simulations of et tr ev and t et to some model input variables tg had the greatest impact on et with an error of 5 in tg translating to an error of 13 8 in et simulations of et were also sensitive to the other temperature e g tl ta and radiation factors rnv and rng simulations of tr were sensitive to tl and rnv with a 5 error in tl or rnv translating to a 8 5 error in tr simulations of ev were most sensitive to tg with a 5 error in tg resulting in a 8 6 error in ev simulations of t et showed similar sensitivities to the input variables besides for tg with a 5 error in tg introducing only a 1 t et error table 4 summarizes the sensitivities of simulations of et tr ev and t et by the resistance based model to some model parameters and variables among those parameters rst min was the most influential on et with an error of 30 in this parameter introducing an error in et of 8 4 on average while this margin of error is not always negligible it is not a severe problem in addition a generally small value of si was obtained for t et suggesting that t et is insensitive to errors in the assigned values of all these parameters among the many variables simulations of et were most sensitive to ha with a 5 error in ha producing up to a 7 error in et such an error range would be a minor problem in practice simulations of t et were most sensitive to the leaf area index lai and then ta although errors of 5 introduced only 1 errors in t et consequently the calculated values of et and t et were robust even if errors possibly existed in measured variables and or assigned model parameters table 3 summarizes the sensitivities of simulations by the resistance based model of tl and tg to some parameters and variables both under wet and dry land these sensitivities are further discussed in section 4 2 5 discussion 5 1 advantages and disadvantages of the proposed integrating framework for simulating evapotranspiration and its components the simulation of the current study indicated that the proposed integrating framework have ability of reconstructing the dynamics of the energy flux e g rn h let and g water flux e g tr ev as well as land surface temperatures tl and tg under different land surface conditions e g dry and wet therefore this study proposes a reasonable way and linking the dynamics of water flux e g et tr and ev and land surface temperature e g lst tl and tg under different land surface scenarios the simulations of tr and ev by both the 3t and resistance based models exhibit excellent performance in simulating water flux when comparing with field measurements or the well acknowledged standard methods the results of the present study confirmed the validity and capability of the proposed scheme for estimating water flux e g et tr and ev and associated land surface temperature e g lst tl and tg under dry and wet conditions although previous related models e g tseb s w model pm mu that simulate partitioning the water flux have shown similar performances table a1 the advantages of present method were summarized following first the radiation transfer process and energy balance between canopy and surface were fully considered in this model and newton raphson scheme was used to solve the energy balance function therefore tl and tg can be easily stably and quickly estimated without the need to measure the directional radiation temperature this provides a rigorous framework for estimating and partitioning all the components of the energy balance and linking associated land surface temperatures at a spectrum of spatial temporal scales second the proposed framework allows for the consideration and parameterization of various surface conditions e g water availability that affect et making it easier to predict et and associated surface temperature under various scenarios e g dry surface and wetland tables under dry land surface conditions ev tr and soil water content equal to 0 the resistance based model comprehensively accounts for the energy balance between the dry canopy and the dry surface as well as the interaction between the two in this way the resistance based model can simultaneously output the canopy reference temperature tld and soil reference temperature tgd therefore the proposed framework can provide feasible estimates of dynamic reference temperature of the land surface third the current energy balance based numerical algorithm provides a way for linking the plant water stress represented by transpiration rate e g ratio between actual and potential transpiration rate without water stress and associated canopy temperature gradient however the current framework needs further improvement the present study simulating the seasonality of et and its components without considering various landscape heterogeneity e g land use cover changes vegetation canopy structure and land surface albedo simply representing by weighted average by vegetation and soil surface without considering snow and freeze thaw process effects in alpine meadow ecosystem in relation to the resistance based model the 3t model has fewer parameters and is most sensitive to radiation and temperature which are relatively easy to measure at the same time the model simulation results are highly sensitive to the input parameters the simulations of the 3t model were greatly affected by a large deviation in parameters the choice of g affected the consistency of the model in estimating soil evaporation selection of observed soil heat flux g0 and gd outputs for dry soil instead of those for wet and dry soil will result in a reduction in the accuracy of simulated et when compared with observations and inconsistent estimations of soil evaporation between the 3t and resistance based models this result can be attributed to the fact that daily seasonal and inter year variations in the reference temperature and g are based on the soil surface energy balance ratio which is more consistent with each component of the energy balance e g rng hg lev than g0 therefore it should be noted that the 3t model exhibits optimal performance when using as inputs systematic reference temperature surface temperature and soil heat flux and radiation data within the same time windows in addition simulation errors within the resistance based model may originate from model input variables and parameters table 3 since model simulations of the surface temperatures are not particularly accurate errors within the estimation of tl and tg as well as tld and tgd are difficult to avoid however through the application of the 3t model with a high spatial and temporal resolution the present study provides a systematic approach to estimating the actual and reference temperature which reconstructs the spatiotemporal dynamics of reference temperature and provides theoretical support for the estimation of evapotranspiration and its components besides rainfall interception loss as a component of et was not included in the model which may results in errors statistical results indicated no significant difference p 0 05 in et partition results between the datasets for rain entire days and sunny days and the errors caused by intercepted rainfall accounted for less than 2 of t et table 5 for dry canopy there is greater interception capacity similarly without considering the interception loss the current model would overestimate the reference temperature and transpiration estimates for rainy areas more complex intercept models need to be considered however the 3t model is driven by the integrated reference temperature and the associatedtemperature gradient between the actual and ideal dry surface both of which do not consider the effect of interception the possible errors caused due to lacking interception loss can be eliminated to a certain extent therefore although there are possible errors in the model simulations the et partition results are quite robust and reasonable 5 2 differences in land surface temperature between wet and dry land surfaces in general reference dry soil is represented by a dry soil column open at the top and buried in a field qiu et al 1998 whereas green paper is used as a reference for dry leaves qiu et al 1996a the present study used the energy balance equation to estimate the dry soil and leaf reference temperatures tgd and tp the patterns of seasonality of tgd and tp at the four sites were similar to those of wet soil and leaf temperature tg and tl indicating that reference temperature which is representative of dry land exhibited diurnal and seasonal cycles with large amplitudes the sensitivities of dry and wet land surfaces under the same environmental conditions were different table 6 ta ld ha and sd were the most influential variables under a wet vegetation canopy whereas ta ld zv and sd were the most important variables under a dry vegetation canopy ta tss ld sd and ha were the most influential parameters for a wet ground surface whereas ta tss ld and sd were most influential under a dry vegetation canopy zm rst min av and cla i were vital parameters for estimating tl over a wet surface whereas zm av and zh were the vital parameters for a dry canopy clai λss zss and ag were the influential parameters for estimating tl for a wet ground surface which differed from those most influential for a dry ground surface in which the rank of the parameters in terms of the sensitivity of the model for estimating tl was λss zss zm ag zh wet and dry land exhibit high and low sensitivity to relative humidity ha respectively in addition the daytime and nighttime biophysical effects were different table 7 for wet land surfaces ta ld and ha at night were more sensitive to both tl and tg than during the day soil water lai and sd showed weak sensitivity at night but high sensitivity during the day ta and ld were more sensitive to tl and tg during the night than during the day both lai and sd showed weaker sensitivity to tl and tg during night than during the day under dry conditions tss was more sensitive to tg during the night than during the day zv was negatively related to tg and tl during the day whereas the opposite relationship was observed at night fig 7 shows the time series of the leaf temperature gradient tl and ground soil temperature gradient tg for the four sites the difference in temperature tg between wet and dry soil tgd tg exhibited diurnal and seasonal variations tg was large during the sunshine period with the peak occurred at noon coinciding with the maximum solar radiation tg was also large during the fast growing period with the peak reached in july coinciding with the largest leaf area index lai 5 3 linking the canopy temperature gradient and plant water stress the monitoring of vegetation water stress is critical for maintaining agricultural and ecosystem health particularly under a warming climate jiao et al 2021 two methods are typically used to express plant water stress using the plant canopy water stress index cwsi 1 using the transpiration rate such as cwsi 1 tr tp where tp is the potential transpiration rate without water stress 2 using the temperature gradient such as cwsi tl tminl tmaxl tminl where tmaxl and tminl are the maximum and minimum limits of canopy temperature respectively jackson et al 1981 the current study assumed two extreme land surface scenarios under dry and saturated land surfaces with an absence of plant water stress the present study applied the validated resistance based model under scenarios of a saturated land surface without water stress to simulate plant potential transpiration trp and the corresponding canopy temperature tminl at each site the cwsi was estimated by using the temperature gradient method and 1 tr tp plant water stress estimated by the two methods showed very good agreement r2 0 99 fig 8 this result implied that the use of the difference in canopy temperature is promising for detecting plant water stress analysis of data for the four sites indicated that plant water stress displayed different spatial temporal patterns almost no water stress was detected within the temperate grassland in the study site during the growing season characterized by a cwsi 0 not shown this result can be attributed to the abundant precipitation supply 1 132 mm during the growing season almost no water stress was observed at the daman agriculture site at night characterized by a cwsi close to 0 but with dynamic water stress during the day this result can be attributed to strong day time evapotranspiration higher plant water stress was observed for desert riparian forests ecosystems than for alpine meadows during the growing season however the opposite was true during the non growing season this result could be attributed to the strong potential evapotranspiration acting on desert riparian forests ecosystems during the growing season resulting in fluctuations in groundwater depth in this site alpine meadows experienced water stress during the non growing season whereas desert riparian forests were able to use groundwater although estimation of cwsi by 1 tr tp poses a challenge cwsi can be more readily acquired using the temperature gradient approach based on thermal infrared remote sensing technology and appropriate calculations large scale e g regional and global estimations and detection of plant water stress is therefore feasible 6 conclusions the present study compared simulations of et ev and tr between the 3t model and an energy balanced resistance based model reference actual temperatures were constructed based on the energy balance in dry wet land surface scenarios both models provided accurate simulations of et with high r2 values 0 78 when compared with et measured by eddy covariance ec the two models provided similar predictions of ev tr and et at the four sites provided that the soil heat flux was constrained within the framework energy balance otherwise there were declines in the accuracies of simulations of et by the 3t model both models showed similar performances in their simulations of tr r2 0 55 when compared with tr estimated by sap flux measurements in desert riparian forest ecosystems the water isotope approach in temperate grasslands and the uwue method in agricultural ecosystems the results of the present study provide a promising approach for detecting canopy water stress based on monitoring of the canopy temperature gradient under dry to wet

1934,the accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et and its major components e g transpiration tr and soil evaporation ev requires an understanding of complex soil plant atmosphere interactions the temperature gradient based three temperature 3t model for simulating the dynamics of ev and tr has no requirement for resistance terms and its use of simple input variables i e temperature and radiation allows its application to both field studies and remote sensing however reference temperature is a key requirement for the 3t model and approaches for obtaining accurate reference temperature and the implications of different reference temperature choices on et estimates remain poorly understood this study improved a resistance based model applicable to a wide range of climatic ecosystem conditions and integrated it with the 3t model to predict et and tr a novel numerical approach was used to estimate the reference temperature under dry land surface scenarios the two models provided similar predictions of ev tr and et at the four sites provided that the available energy for the canopy e g net radiation and ground soil e g net radiation and ground heat flux was constrained within the framework of the energy balance alternatively the accuracy of simulations of ev and et by the 3t model significantly declined due to systematic mismatching of input drivers temperature and radiation under dry and wet scenarios we emphasize that 3t is working better when input temperature and radiation under dry and wet land conditions were systematically matched within the framework of energy balance the results of this study provide a promising novel temperature gradient method for detecting canopy water stress keywords evapotranspiration transpiration temperature

surface temperature and the suitability of climate and soil conditions for sustaining ecosystems anderegg et al 2019 piao et al 2020 the analytical expressions of et its time varying properties and its components provide a basis for understanding climate soil vegetation interactions e g penman 1948 monteith 1977 allen et al 1998 einara et al 2022 koppa et al 2022 developing these analytical expressions can pose a challenge due to the limitations associated with the structure and parameterization of ecohydrological models fatichi et al 2016 yang et al 2016 gibson et al 2021 liebhard et al 2022 the high complexity of evapotranspiration dynamics necessitates the need for occasional simplification of the processes affecting et ev and tr to solve these et related analytical expressions as well as ignoring aerodynamic and surface resistances e g eichelmann et al 2022 zhao et al 2019 this is particularly true for remote sensing based large scale et estimates where each type of resistance is difficult to parameterize anderson et al 2012 milly and dunne 2016 norman et al 1995 wang et al 2007 burchard et al 2022 the temperature based model uses thermal remotely sensed land surface temperature lst to estimate et anderson et al 2007 bartholie et al 1972 minacapilli et al 2016 norman et al 1995 chen et al 2021 resistance based models widely use the penman monteith p m equation to estimate et allen et al 1998 dai et al 2004 luo et al 2018 monteith 1977 penman 1948 models of a wide range of complexity including both resistance based and temperature based have been developed to estimate et and its components anderson et al 2012 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 wang and yamanaka 2014 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 xinlei et al 2022 however as noted by chen and liu 2020 it remains a challenge to estimate et by integration of resistance based and temperature based schemes in addition to the above challenges research in this field has been limited by the lack of et partitioning in addition relatively few studies have been conducted on linking canopy temperature gradient and plant water stress recent theoretical methods have been developed to address this issue jackson et al 1981 liu et al 2020 qiu et al 2009 for example qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1996b qiu et al 1998 developed the three temperature 3t model for estimating evaporation using measured surface temperature reference surface temperature e g dry soil without evaporation or a dry canopy without transpiration and air temperature as input parameters reference dry leaf temperature tl d or reference dry soil temperature tgd of man made dry leaves and dry soil respectively can be measured simultaneously using a ground based thermal imaging instrument this reference temperature can be used as input to a 3t model for obtaining accurate estimations of et and its components e g feng et al 2014 qiu et al 1998 1999a 1999b zhao et al 2022 the 3t model has been extended for remote sensing applications through the use of a satellite based thermal imager qiu et al 2006 qiu and zhao 2010 xiong and qiu 2011 2014 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 and successfully applied to the global scale for producing et products yu et al 2022 the 3t model requires limited inputs representative of key et process e g net radiation and temperature and is considered to be robust particularly for arid and semi arid areas tian et al 2013 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 the 3t model has been shown to be sensitive to input temperatures and the simulation accuracy of the model is largely limited by the accuracy of the input reference temperature qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1998 xiong et al 2019 however tld and tgd are assumed values and are difficult to measure in practice therefore obtaining an accurate representation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the reference temperature poses a challenge in general tld and tgd can be used within remote sensing applications by selecting the maximum lst within a suitable pixel however their values vary with the scale of the selected pixels thereby limiting the model applicability tian et al 2013 2014 xiong and qiu 2011 2014 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 tld and tgd can provide insights into the relationships between climate soil and vegetation under dry land surfaces therefore deriving methods for theoretically estimating tld and tgd is important for rigorously interpretating their results and for improved simulations of et and its components the present study improved a resistance based model that accounts for the aerodynamic and surface resistances of water vapor transfer between soil plants and the atmosphere over the land surface this resistance based model is appliable under a wide range of climatic ecosystem conditions the resistance based model was coupled with the 3t model for simulating et and tr the resistance based model was developed by wang and yamanaka 2014 and was chosen for various reasons first the model uses the newton raphson iteration scheme to separately solve the governing equations for the canopy and the ground surface without the need for radiometric temperature measurements second since this model uses the energy balance between the soil surface and the vegetation canopy and considers their energy interactions it can achieve a good performance in partitioning et in various ecosystems wang and yamanaka 2014 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 third the model considers all related resistance e g stomatal control of transpiration including its dependence on soil moisture the model also explicitly considers solar radiation the model was localized to fit the characteristics of each ecosystem wang and yamanaka 2014 provide further details on the model the present study aimed to develop a novel approach for coupling a 3t model and a resistance based model within an energy budget framework for simulating et and transpiration under wet and dry land surface conditions the simulations of soil and vegetation behavior by the integrated model were compared with observed data collected at the three sites in the heihe river basin in china and one site in a temperate grassland in japan the key differences between the two models were identified and sensitivity analysis was used to quantify and characterize these differences the present study also discusses how differences in the model formulations can result in differences between the model predictions 2 materials and methods 2 1 a simple 3t model the three temperature 3t model was developed by qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1996b qiu et al 1999b and was used in the present study to calculate soil ev and plant tr the model is characterized by a simplified estimation process and avoidance of resistance terms and was developed to estimate ev based on surface temperature measures by tir thermometers qiu et al 1998 2006 qiu and zhao 2010 or thermocouples qiu et al 1999a the 3t model can also be used within remote sensing applications tian et al 2013 xiong and qiu 2011 zhao et al 2010 the model makes the assumption of dry leaves and a dry soil column as the reference canopy and reference soil with negligible tr and ev respectively however the model assumes similar atmospheric properties as those of the canopy and test soil surfaces ev of the test surface could then be calculated through a comparison of the energy balance equations of reference surfaces to those of test surfaces at which time the resistance terms were canceled the 3t model requires reference dry

and has been applied for diagnostically deriving energy balance equations e g wang and yamanaka 2014 yamanaka et al 1997 2 3 key differences between the two model formulations there are some differences between the two model formulations that influence the similarities of their representations of et ev and tr these differences are listed in tables s1 and s2 and can be summarized as 1 the 3t model requires few input parameters e g radiation and temperature and does not consider soil water and vegetation dynamics the resistance based model requires meteorological variable inputs e g radiation temperature and wind speed as well as soil e g soil water content and vegetation property inputs e g leaf area index canopy height 2 the 3t model is simple and is based on the energy balance approach therefore it does not consider resistance for estimating the latent heat flux and its components the resistance based model considers resistances of both the canopy e g leaf stomatal resistance and aerodynamic resistance and the soil layer e g aerodynamic resistance and surface soil resistance 3 radiometric temperature measurements are the key input variables for the 3t model over both actual and dry land surface the resistance based model uses the newton raphson iteration scheme to separately solve the governing equations for the canopy and the ground surface temperature without the need for radiometric temperature measurements 2 4 integrate the temperature gradient based 3t and resistance based with numerical solutions of reference temperatures the ev tr and e can be simulated both by simple 3t and a resistance based model in spite of there has large difference in the main equation input variables and calculation procedure however in essence both were derived based on the principle of surface energy balance as shown in fig 1 the resistance based model constrained by energy balance use numerical techniques to solve canopy and surface temperatures which makes it possible to correlate energy balance components with associated surface temperatures under various land conditions e g dry and wet land surface the reference temperature is the theoretical temperature of a dry environment and has strong spatial and temporal characteristics acquiring the reference temperature with a high temporal resolution is difficult which limits the accuracy of the 3t model in calculations of et as assumed there is no evaporation or transpiration exists over an ideal dry land surface and all energy is used to heat the environment in 3t model the energy balance for a dry land surface can be expressed as 15 r n vd 1 f v 1 α v s d l d σ t gd 4 2 σ t p 4 h vd 16 r n g d f v 1 α g s d l d 1 f v σ t p 4 σ t gd 4 g d h gd where rnvd and rngd are the net radiation

canopy surface respectively w m 2 hvd and hgd are given as 17 h vd c p ρ a t ld t a r av 18 h g d c p ρ a t g d t a r a g g d can be estimated as 19 g d λ soil t gd t ss z soil similarly the nr iteration scheme was applied to simultaneously solve eq 15 and eq 16 for tld and tgd respectively provided that the observed values of ha p sd ld u zv ta lai and tss were provided tld and tgd were obtained for input of the 3t model the current framework can be validated by field measurement of energy flux rn let h and g water flux tr and land surface temperature tl and tg unfortunately there is no observations of tld and tgd to calibrate the model model performance of both 3t model and resistance based model were measured by root mean square difference rmsd and the i index wang and yamanaka 2014 as well as r2 r is the correlation coefficient by measuring the performance of 3t model in different model experiment scenarios the uncertainty evaluation of et simulated by 3t model was carried out 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the method provided by beven 1979 and qiu et al 1998 the analysis allowed each model to judge the effect of typical errors

outputs o of tr et ev and t et 3 study sites and datasets 3 1 study sites and the observed data the present study validated and accessed the performance of the model by comparing model simulations to soil hydrological micrometeorological and flux data collected at four sites temperate grassland alpine meadow cropland and desert riparian forest that deployed an eddy covariance ec system and monitoring by automatic weather stations awss table 1 the temperate grassland was in the center for research in isotopes and environmental dynamics cried experimental fields at the university of tsukuba japan the routinely measures radiation energy fluxes and related meteorological variables are provided in ma et al 2018 a seasonal isotope measurement dataset including water vapor plant stem water and soil water was collected in 2011 and details of field work was described in the literature of wang et al 2015 leaf temperature were measured for randomly selected leaves at least 60 times using a handheld infrared thermometer pt 7ld optex shiga japan during the sampling period 1 h of the experiment and their mean value was taken to represent the average canopy temperature the other three sites alpine meadow cropland and desert riparian forest were in the heihe river basin north china for the ec flux dataset edire was used for post processing estimation and a set of generic algorithms were used to populate the results liu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 the sap flux density f kg m2 h 1 of the sample trees in desert riparian forest were measured by thermal dissipation method dataset of surface soil temperature measured by awss were collected at 3 sites in heihe river basin further details of the three sites and datasets https data tpdc ac cn zh hans are provided by liu et al 2018 3 2 collection of the transpiration datasets transpiration is a major component of evapotranspiration and can be estimated through several methods although transpiration can be directly measured based on sap flow evapotranspiration can be partitioned based on the isotope approach or uwue methods the present study collated all the available transpiration datasets from the study sites these data were used to assess the model performance wang et al 2015 partitioned evapotranspiration based on the field measurement of water isotopes in a temperate grassland site and obtained the transpiration dataset during the growing season zhou et al 2018 used the uwue method to obtain transpiration datasets both at daily and hourly scales in a cropland site transpiration data measured by the sap flow method bai et al 2017 for populus euphratica in the desert riparian forest site were collected 4 results 4 1 comparison between model simulated and observed evapotranspiration et simulations of the 3t model driven by the integrated reference temperature and associated temperature gradients between the actual and ideal dry surface and resistance based models were similar to measured eddy covariance ec at the four sites fig 2 with high r2 values 0 78 obtained both the simulated hourly and daily mean e of the resistance based model showed good agreement with ec observations with a small root mean square deviation rmsd 16 02 47 9 w m 2 and elevated i index 0 90 0 99 at the four sites the integrated temperature gradient based 3t model showed a similar performance with a rmsd and i index of 15 18 50 27 w m 2 and 0 90 0 99 respectively table 2 the models were able to represent the observed diurnal variation in ec among the three growing season stages early growing peak and late growing stages as well as the daily variation fig 3 with no systematic bias detected 4 2 comparison between model simulated and observed plant transpiration in contrast to the availability of robust et datasets through eddy covariance measurements few robust datasets are available for the validation of model simulations of ev and tr the simulations of tr by both the integrated temperature gradient based 3t model and resistance based models were similar to observations with high r2 0 60 values fig 4 the simulated hourly and daily mean tr by the resistance based model were in good agreement with observations with a reasonable rmsd 0 03 0 11 mm h 1 and a high i index 0 82 0 89 obtained at the four sites the integrated temperature gradient based 3t model obtained a similar performance with an rmsd and i index of 0 03 0 12 mm h 1 and 0 79 0 90 respectively table 2 4 3 evaluations of model simulated leaf canopy and ground surface temperatures the legitimacy of partitioning of et by the resistance based model can be more clearly indicated by tl and tg than by total et the simulations of leaf temperature tl and ground temperature tg by the resistance based model can be validated by in situ field measurements fig 5 the hourly mean simulations of tl and tg were in good agreement with observations with a small rmsd 2 12 2 15 c and elevated i index 0 80 0 90 similar model performances were achieved for the daily average dataset with higher rmsd and i index of 2 36 2 96 c and 0 96 0 98 respectively table 2 the model provided accurate simulations of both the diurnal and daily variations in leaf temperature tl and reference ground soil temperature tg at the four sites fig 6 4 4 sensitivity analysis both the simple 3t and the resistance based models can simulate ev tr and e both models were essentially derived based on the principle of the surface energy balance however large differences in the main equations input variables and calculation procedure exist between the two models uncertainties in the 3t model may originate from input variables and parameters table 3 summarizes the sensitivities of the 3t model simulations of et tr ev and t et to some model input variables tg had the greatest impact on et with an error of 5 in tg translating to an error of 13 8 in et simulations of et were also sensitive to the other temperature e g tl ta and radiation factors rnv and rng simulations of tr were sensitive to tl and rnv with a 5 error in tl or rnv translating to a 8 5 error in tr simulations of ev were most sensitive to tg with a 5 error in tg resulting in a 8 6 error in ev simulations of t et showed similar sensitivities to the input variables besides for tg with a 5 error in tg introducing only a 1 t et error table 4 summarizes the sensitivities of simulations of et tr ev and t et by the resistance based model to some model parameters and variables among those parameters rst min was the most influential on et with an error of 30 in this parameter introducing an error in et of 8 4 on average while this margin of error is not always negligible it is not a severe problem in addition a generally small value of si was obtained for t et suggesting that t et is insensitive to errors in the assigned values of all these parameters among the many variables simulations of et were most sensitive to ha with a 5 error in ha producing up to a 7 error in et such an error range would be a minor problem in practice simulations of t et were most sensitive to the leaf area index lai and then ta although errors of 5 introduced only 1 errors in t et consequently the calculated values of et and t et were robust even if errors possibly existed in measured variables and or assigned model parameters table 3 summarizes the sensitivities of simulations by the resistance based model of tl and tg to some parameters and variables both under wet and dry land these sensitivities are further discussed in section 4 2 5 discussion 5 1 advantages and disadvantages of the proposed integrating framework for simulating evapotranspiration and its components the simulation of the current study indicated that the proposed integrating framework have ability of reconstructing the dynamics of the energy flux e g rn h let and g water flux e g tr ev as well as land surface temperatures tl and tg under different land surface conditions e g dry and wet therefore this study proposes a reasonable way and linking the dynamics of water flux e g et tr and ev and land surface temperature e g lst tl and tg under different land surface scenarios the simulations of tr and ev by both the 3t and resistance based models exhibit excellent performance in simulating water flux when comparing with field measurements or the well acknowledged standard methods the results of the present study confirmed the validity and capability of the proposed scheme for estimating water flux e g et tr and ev and associated land surface temperature e g lst tl and tg under dry and wet conditions although previous related models e g tseb s w model pm mu that simulate partitioning the water flux have shown similar performances table a1 the advantages of present method were summarized following first the radiation transfer process and energy balance between canopy and surface were fully considered in this model and newton raphson scheme was used to solve the energy balance function therefore tl and tg can be easily stably and quickly estimated without the need to measure the directional radiation temperature this provides a rigorous framework for estimating and partitioning all the components of the energy balance and linking associated land surface temperatures at a spectrum of spatial temporal scales second the proposed framework allows for the consideration and parameterization of various surface conditions e g water availability that affect et making it easier to predict et and associated surface temperature under various scenarios e g dry surface and wetland tables under dry land surface conditions ev tr and soil water content equal to 0 the resistance based model comprehensively accounts for the energy balance between the dry canopy and the dry surface as well as the interaction between the two in this way the resistance based model can simultaneously output the canopy reference temperature tld and soil reference temperature tgd therefore the proposed framework can provide feasible estimates of dynamic reference temperature of the land surface third the current energy balance based numerical algorithm provides a way for linking the plant water stress represented by transpiration rate e g ratio between actual and potential transpiration rate without water stress and associated canopy temperature gradient however the current framework needs further improvement the present study simulating the seasonality of et and its components without considering various landscape heterogeneity e g land use cover changes vegetation canopy structure and land surface albedo simply representing by weighted average by vegetation and soil surface without considering snow and freeze thaw process effects in alpine meadow ecosystem in relation to the resistance based model the 3t model has fewer parameters and is most sensitive to radiation and temperature which are relatively easy to measure at the same time the model simulation results are highly sensitive to the input parameters the simulations of the 3t model were greatly affected by a large deviation in parameters the choice of g affected the consistency of the model in estimating soil evaporation selection of observed soil heat flux g0 and gd outputs for dry soil instead of those for wet and dry soil will result in a reduction in the accuracy of simulated et when compared with observations and inconsistent estimations of soil evaporation between the 3t and resistance based models this result can be attributed to the fact that daily seasonal and inter year variations in the reference temperature and g are based on the soil surface energy balance ratio which is more consistent with each component of the energy balance e g rng hg lev than g0 therefore it should be noted that the 3t model exhibits optimal performance when using as inputs systematic reference temperature surface temperature and soil heat flux and radiation data within the same time windows in addition simulation errors within the resistance based model may originate from model input variables and parameters table 3 since model simulations of the surface temperatures are not particularly accurate errors within the estimation of tl and tg as well as tld and tgd are difficult to avoid however through the application of the 3t model with a high spatial and temporal resolution the present study provides a systematic approach to estimating the actual and reference temperature which reconstructs the spatiotemporal dynamics of reference temperature and provides theoretical support for the estimation of evapotranspiration and its components besides rainfall interception loss as a component of et was not included in the model which may results in errors statistical results indicated no significant difference p 0 05 in et partition results between the datasets for rain entire days and sunny days and the errors caused by intercepted rainfall accounted for less than 2 of t et table 5 for dry canopy there is greater interception capacity similarly without considering the interception loss the current model would overestimate the reference temperature and transpiration estimates for rainy areas more complex intercept models need to be considered however the 3t model is driven by the integrated reference temperature and the associatedtemperature gradient between the actual and ideal dry surface both of which do not consider the effect of interception the possible errors caused due to lacking interception loss can be eliminated to a certain extent therefore although there are possible errors in the model simulations the et partition results are quite robust and reasonable 5 2 differences in land surface temperature between wet and dry land surfaces in general reference dry soil is represented by a dry soil column open at the top and buried in a field qiu et al 1998 whereas green paper is used as a reference for dry leaves qiu et al 1996a the present study used the energy balance equation to estimate the dry soil and leaf reference temperatures tgd and tp the patterns of seasonality of tgd and tp at the four sites were similar to those of wet soil and leaf temperature tg and tl indicating that reference temperature which is representative of dry land exhibited diurnal and seasonal cycles with large amplitudes the sensitivities of dry and wet land surfaces under the same environmental conditions were different table 6 ta ld ha and sd were the most influential variables under a wet vegetation canopy whereas ta ld zv and sd were the most important variables under a dry vegetation canopy ta tss ld sd and ha were the most influential parameters for a wet ground surface whereas ta tss ld and sd were most influential under a dry vegetation canopy zm rst min av and cla i were vital parameters for estimating tl over a wet surface whereas zm av and zh were the vital parameters for a dry canopy clai λss zss and ag were the influential parameters for estimating tl for a wet ground surface which differed from those most influential for a dry ground surface in which the rank of the parameters in terms of the sensitivity of the model for estimating tl was λss zss zm ag zh wet and dry land exhibit high and low sensitivity to relative humidity ha respectively in addition the daytime and nighttime biophysical effects were different table 7 for wet land surfaces ta ld and ha at night were more sensitive to both tl and tg than during the day soil water lai and sd showed weak sensitivity at night but high sensitivity during the day ta and ld were more sensitive to tl and tg during the night than during the day both lai and sd showed weaker sensitivity to tl and tg during night than during the day under dry conditions tss was more sensitive to tg during the night than during the day zv was negatively related to tg and tl during the day whereas the opposite relationship was observed at night fig 7 shows the time series of the leaf temperature gradient tl and ground soil temperature gradient tg for the four sites the difference in temperature tg between wet and dry soil tgd tg exhibited diurnal and seasonal variations tg was large during the sunshine period with the peak occurred at noon coinciding with the maximum solar radiation tg was also large during the fast growing period with the peak reached in july coinciding with the largest leaf area index lai 5 3 linking the canopy temperature gradient and plant water stress the monitoring of vegetation water stress is critical for maintaining agricultural and ecosystem health particularly under a warming climate jiao et al 2021 two methods are typically used to express plant water stress using the plant canopy water stress index cwsi 1 using the transpiration rate such as cwsi 1 tr tp where tp is the potential transpiration rate without water stress 2 using the temperature gradient such as cwsi tl tminl tmaxl tminl where tmaxl and tminl are the maximum and minimum limits of canopy temperature respectively jackson et al 1981 the current study assumed two extreme land surface scenarios under dry and saturated land surfaces with an absence of plant water stress the present study applied the validated resistance based model under scenarios of a saturated land surface without water stress to simulate plant potential transpiration trp and the corresponding canopy temperature tminl at each site the cwsi was estimated by using the temperature gradient method and 1 tr tp plant water stress estimated by the two methods showed very good agreement r2 0 99 fig 8 this result implied that the use of the difference in canopy temperature is promising for detecting plant water stress analysis of data for the four sites indicated that plant water stress displayed different spatial temporal patterns almost no water stress was detected within the temperate grassland in the study site during the growing season characterized by a cwsi 0 not shown this result can be attributed to the abundant precipitation supply 1 132 mm during the growing season almost no water stress was observed at the daman agriculture site at night characterized by a cwsi close to 0 but with dynamic water stress during the day this result can be attributed to strong day time evapotranspiration higher plant water stress was observed for desert riparian forests ecosystems than for alpine meadows during the growing season however the opposite was true during the non growing season this result could be attributed to the strong potential evapotranspiration acting on desert riparian forests ecosystems during the growing season resulting in fluctuations in groundwater depth in this site alpine meadows experienced water stress during the non growing season whereas desert riparian forests were able to use groundwater although estimation of cwsi by 1 tr tp poses a challenge cwsi can be more readily acquired using the temperature gradient approach based on thermal infrared remote sensing technology and appropriate calculations large scale e g regional and global estimations and detection of plant water stress is therefore feasible 6 conclusions the present study compared simulations of et ev and tr between the 3t model and an energy balanced resistance based model reference actual temperatures were constructed based on the energy balance in dry wet land surface scenarios both models provided accurate simulations of et with high r2 values 0 78 when compared with et measured by eddy covariance ec the two models provided similar predictions of ev tr and et at the four sites provided that the soil heat flux was constrained within the framework energy balance otherwise there were declines in the accuracies of simulations of et by the 3t model both models showed similar performances in their simulations of tr r2 0 55 when compared with tr estimated by sap flux measurements in desert riparian forest ecosystems the water isotope approach in temperate grasslands and the uwue method in agricultural ecosystems the results of the present study provide a promising approach for detecting canopy water stress based on monitoring of the canopy temperature gradient under dry to wet
