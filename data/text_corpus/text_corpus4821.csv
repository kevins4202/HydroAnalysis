24105,the northwestern tropical pacific ocean nwtpo moorings observing system including 15 moorings was established in 2013 to provide velocity profile data observing system simulation experiments osses were carried out to assess the ability of the observation system to monitor intraseasonal variability in a pilot study where ideal mooring observed velocity was assimilated using ensemble optimal interpolation enoi based on the regional oceanic modeling system roms because errors between the control and nature runs have a mesoscale structure a random ensemble derived from 20 90 day bandpass filtered nine year model outputs is proved to be more appropriate for the nwtpo mooring array assimilation than a random ensemble derived from a 30 day running mean the simulation of the intraseasonal currents in the north equatorial current nec north equatorial countercurrent necc and equatorial undercurrent euc areas can be improved by assimilating velocity profiles using a 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble the root mean square errors rmses of the intraseasonal zonal u and meridional velocity v above 500 m depth within the study area between 0 n 18 n and 122 e 147 e were reduced by 15 4 and 16 9 respectively improvements in the downstream area of the nec moorings transect were optimum where the rmses of the intraseasonal velocities above 500 m were reduced by more than 30 assimilating velocity profiles can have a positive impact on the simulation and forecast of thermohaline structure and sea level anomalies in the ocean keywords observing system simulation experiments data assimilation roms mooring array ensemble optimal interpolation 1 introduction the northwestern tropical pacific ocean nwtpo circulation system impacts the ocean heat balance and ocean atmosphere interaction in the western pacific warm pool and affects enso cycles and the global climate system webster and lukas 1992 the nwtpo is where water masses from middle to high latitudes intersect and is the source region for the indonesian through flow and therefore has a significant impact on the global thermohaline circulation gordon 1986 fine et al 1994 upper circulation in the nwtpo is characterized by alternating zonal currents fig 1 the westward flowing north equatorial current nec is located between 9 n and 18 n and bifurcates at the philippine coast into the poleward kuroshio current kc and equatorward mindanao current mc qiu and lukas 1996 part of the mc turns eastward and feeds the eastward flowing north equatorial countercurrent necc between 3 n and 8 n yu et al 2000 the lower depth boundary of the necc is stable at 200 m as measured by a previous study wang et al 2016b south of the necc there is the broad westward flowing south equatorial current sec part of which turns northward and also feeds into the necc when it reaches the western boundary reid 1986 at depths of 200 400 m fig 1b convergence of the mc and new guinea coastal undercurrent ngcuc near the equator feeds the eastward flowing equatorial undercurrent euc and the core of the euc lies between 200 300 m johnson et al 2002 wang et al 2016b variability of the nwtpo upper circulation system is quite strong and complex at intraseasonal seasonal interannual and longer timescales qiu and joyce 1992 johnston and merrifield 2000 qiu and chen 2010 hsin and qiu 2012 wu 2013 chen and qiu 2004 xiao et al 2017 there is a great deal of uncertainty in the simulation forecasting of the nwtpo circulation system the impacts of the different observation methods on seasonal interannual forecasting variability in the tropical upper pacific have been well assessed in the past smith and meyers 1996 fischer et al 1997 parent et al 2003 yan et al 2007 the different methods have included expendable bathythermo graphs xbt international tropical ocean and global atmosphere tropical atmosphere ocean toga tao arrays satellite observations and the array for real time geostrophic oceanography argo the current ocean model combined with existing observational networks in the nwtpo can mainly resolve seasonal to interannual forecasting signals and simulate the dominant circulation on a large spatial scale balmaseda and anderson 2009 fujii et al 2015 zheng and zhu 2016 however traditional observing systems are still insufficient to monitor the upper intraseasonal activities in the nwtpo especially in chaotic and turbulent areas oke et al 2015 considering that the intraseasonal anomalies of the current in the upper nwtpo are pronounced compared to the magnitude of the seasonal mean flow and intraseasonal variability can play a role in the nwtpo heat and tracer budget wang et al 2016a it is also necessary to improve intraseasonal simulation of the nwtpo as an important supplement to the nwtpo and global ocean observation system the nwtpo moorings observation system supported by the western pacific ocean system structure dynamics and consequences wpos project was established in 2013 this observation system contains fifteen moorings with upward and downward looking acoustic doppler current profilers adcp deployed at 400 m depth at each mooring fig 1 five of the moorings located along 130 e were deployed to observe nec variability and seven moorings were deployed across the necc and euc along the 142 e transect the other three moorings were deployed in the nec 139 05 e 11 58 n necc 140 e 4 7 n and euc 140 e 2 n compared to traditional observing systems which are indirect measurements of the current the nwtpo moorings observing system can directly provide velocity profile observations at high temporal resolution therefore it is important to explore how the new observations can improve estimations of the upper intraseasonal current processes in the nwtpo to improve estimations it is not only essential that the observing systems satisfy the requirements of data assimilation da systems but also to assess if the schemes of the da are appropriate in this study observing system simulation experiments osses assimilating ideal mooring observed currents are designed using ensemble optimal interpolation enoi ensemble optimal interpolation is a multivariate da method derived from the ensemble kalman filter and widely used in eddy resolving operational applications because of its multivariate properties and computational efficiency oke et al 2008 counillon and bertino 2009a b the ensemble members of enoi are critical for assimilation performance which are usually chosen from the long term results of model integration the assimilation efficiency depends largely on how well the ensemble can represent the background error of the system oke et al 2005 counillon and bertino 2009a to make the ensemble resemble the dominant errors of the model pseudo information on some timescales should be eliminated or restrained to correctly reproduce the mesoscale variability around australia oke et al 2008 used a three day average of the model state minus the seasonal cycle of the model spin up run to eliminate the seasonal variability xie and zhu 2010 obtained a quasi stationary ensemble that can vary with the seasons to represent flow dependence in the seasonality term for assimilation with argo profiles fu et al 2011 found that it is necessary to remove the annual and semi annual cycles from temperature and sea level data to avoid spurious long range correlations in the north sea and baltic sea the main objective of this study is to assess the capacity of the nwtpo mooring array to perform intraseasonal monitoring using enoi da systems with targeted ensemble scheme the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the assimilation system and the design of the da experiments section 3 evaluates the time scales of ensemble effect on mooring observed current da results section 4 gives the result of the mooring observed current da experiments and section 5 provides a summary and discussion 2 model da methods and experiment design 2 1 model setup and validation observing system simulation experiments osses in the nwtpo were conducted using the regional oceanic modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 2005 the model domain spans the south china sea and the western pacific ocean 15 s 35 n and 100 e 150 e the model consists of 511 517 grids with an average spatial resolution of 10 km and a vertical s coordinate designed to have 40 levels a horizontally orthogonal coordinate system was used the model water depth is based on the 2 min earth topography etopo2v2 and the minimum and maximum depths for the domain are set to 10 and 5 000 m respectively the mellor and yamada 2 5 level turbulent closure scheme mellor and yamada 1982 was used to parameterize the vertical mixing a daily mean wind field from the quikscat ocean surface wind product was employed which was converted into the wind stress using the bulk formula given by large and pond 1982 the other daily atmospheric forcing fields including heat fluxes solar radiation fluxes evaporation precipitation e p air temperature and specific humidity were obtained from the u s national centers of environmental prediction reanalysis project kalnay et al 1996 monthly temperature salinity sea surface height ssh and velocity fields from reanalysis data derived from an ocean data assimilation system in asia the indian ocean and the west pacific ocean aipocean yan et al 2015a b provided the lateral boundary conditions the radiation boundary condition was laterally open the model was initialized with monthly climatological temperature and salinity data for january from the world ocean atlas 2001 woa01 conkright et al 2002 and a spin up of 10 years was performed fig 2 shows the mean temperature and salinity along 140 e for the upper 1000 m simulated by the roms for 2000 2008 along with the climatology of woa01 along 140 e the temperature pattern is very close to that of woa01 and the good consistency between the model and woa01 isotherm slopes in the meridional direction indicates the rationality of the simulated zonal velocity however the surface temperature values from the model are noticeably a little higher than those from woa01 and the isotherm of 12 c from the model near the 8 n slopes more gently than that for woa01 the simulated fresh water cores at surface and high salinity cores at depth are consistent with climatology the simulated stratification of temperature and salinity shows a similar vertical structure to that of woa01 to validate if the roms could reproduce the intraseasonal variability of the current satellite based ocean surface current estimates from the ocean surface current analysis real time oscar bonjean and lagerloef 2002 product were compared with the roms outputs during the experimental period the oscar currents with a spatial resolution of 1 3 and five day temporal interval represent the average over a 30 m thick surface layer they were estimated from altimeter based ssh sea surface wind and sea surface temperature data the oscar outputs provide reasonably accurate intraseasonal variability especially in the tropical pacific ocean johnson et al 2007 the time series of 0 30 m vertical averaged zonal and meridional velocities u30 and v30 respectively from roms and oscar at three sites representative of different mooring transects are shown in fig 3 a 20 90 day intraseasonal bandpass filter was applied to the data data from roms and oscar are generally consistent in simulating u30 and v30 for example at 142 e 1 n and 142 e 6 n the correlations of intraseasonal velocity between roms and oscar are 0 60 and 0 47 for u30 and 0 41 and 0 50 for v30 respectively at 130 e 13 n the correlations are relatively small with values of 0 40 and 0 22 respectively the amplitudes of u30 and v30 at 130 e 13 n from roms are greater than those from oscar the intraseasonal variability of the currents is mainly generated by the intraseasonal variability of wind forcing and ocean internal instability wang et al 2016a making it difficult to reproduce phase and amplitude fully and accurately in general roms presents some capacity to capture intraseasonal signals it is reasonable that the model included in the assimilation system is used to assess the ability of the nwtpo mooring array to monitor intraseasonal variability 2 2 da method the enoi scheme of evensen 2003 was used in this data assimilative model the enoi analysis scheme can be expressed as follows 1 φ a φ f α c p h t α h c p h t r 1 d h φ f where φ ssh t s u v t denotes the model state vector including sea surface height ssh potential temperature t salinity s and zonal and meridional velocity u and v the superscript a is for analysis f is for background and t is for matrix transpose p is the background error covariance matrix r is the observation error covariance matrix d is an l dimension vector to denote observations l is the number of observations h is the measurement operator and c is the localized factor used to decrease the pseudo covariance of the background error variance matrix houtekamer and mitchell 2001 shu et al 2011a b wu et al 2014 the symbol represents the schur product defined by c p i j c i j p i j and α is a scaling factor to tune the magnitude of covariance which is set to 0 1 in this study in enoi the background error covariance matrix is computed via a historical ensemble as 2 p a a t n 1 where a is the ensemble perturbation defined as a a a a is the centered historical ensemble with an m n dimensional matrix where m is the size of the model variables and n is the number of ensemble members which is set to 100 in this study a is the ensemble mean considering that representation errors are the main source of observational errors the observational error δ in this study is defined by 3 δ s dx l x dy l y where s indicates the ensemble standard deviation deng et al 2010 liu et al 2016 lx and ly define a neighboring horizontal region lx 350 km and ly 200 km around the sites of the observations in the zonal and meridional direction respectively and dx and dy are the differences between the model grid point and the observation sites in the zonal and meridional directions respectively the assimilated observational variables are zonal and meridional velocities 2 3 experiment design considering that wind forcing errors are the major sources of model error in the upper nwtpo the osses are constructed through twin forcing experiments using different surface wind forcing the model run forced by the quikscat wind field is defined as the nature run and served as the true state of the osses the da models are forced by the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp wind field atlas et al 2011 the assimilated pseudo observations are derived from the daily averaged u and v profiles between 20 500 m at mooring array positions generated by the nature run the experiment is designed as follows table 1 i the nature run in this experiment the model run was forced by the quikscat wind field for the two year period from january 1 2001 to december 31 2002 ii the control run ctl in this experiment the model run was forced by ccmp wind field for the two year period from january 1 2001 to december 31 2002 iii the first da experiment da1 in this experiment all pseudo observations at the mooring array were assimilated to evaluate the effect of different ensembles on the da result for the mooring observed current da1 includes two sub da experiments da1a and da1b in da1a the ensemble was randomly derived from a 30 day running mean of the model outputs between 2000 and 2008 ens 1 in da1b the ensemble was randomly derived from the 20 90 day bandpass filtered model daily averaged outputs ens 2 iv the second da experiment da2 in this experiment only the pseudo observations across nec along the 130 e transect and at 139 05 e 11 58 n were assimilated a scheme of the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble was adopted v the third da experiment da3 in this experiment only the pseudo observations across the necc and euc along the 142 e transect at 140 e 4 7 n and at 140 e 2 n were assimilated a scheme of the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble was adopted to consider a realistic situation with initial field errors the experiments da1 da2 and da3 were started after a year of the ctl run beginning on january 1 2002 and ending on december 31 2002 the pseudo observations were assimilated every 3 days 3 effect of ensemble time scale on mooring observed current da results the nwtpo circulation system has strong variability at intraseasonal interannual decadal and even longer timescales the power spectra of the 0 500 m averaged u and v of three representative moorings in the nec 130 e 13 n necc 142 e 6 n and euc 142 e 1 n are shown in fig 4 the velocity data were derived from roms daily averaged outputs between 2000 and 2008 the power spectra of v presented the highest power peaks at 49 days 130 e 13 n 90 days 142 e 6 n and 35 days 142 e 1 n which indicates that the variances of v were mainly dominated by intraseasonal variability however the power spectra of u were dominated by both intraseasonal variability and longer timescale variability the variances of u exceeded the 90 significance level within the 200 240 day band at 130 e 13 n 118 294 day band at 142 e 6 n and 240 490 day band at 142 e 1 n on lower frequency timescales the correlations of velocity at 100 m depth at the mooring site at 130 e 13 n and its surrounding area derived from ens 1 and ens 2 are shown in fig 5 there are strong positive correlations for u between the nec point and a long region departing from it in the zonal direction fig 5a1 whereas the correlations for v are sign alternating fig 5a2 indicating that the u and v with a 30 day running mean present different spatial correlation scales the large positive correlation scale of u in the zonal direction is likely related to the large scale background current variation of u which also has a long timescale e g interannual or longer the sign alternating correlations are likely related to upper ocean waves by intraseasonal variability the correlations of u and v derived from the 20 90 day bandpass filtered model outputs are shown in fig 5b1 and b2 respectively the correlation scale of u with the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble is much lower than that with 30 day running mean ensemble in the meridional direction the correlation scale has few differences between the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble and the 30 day running ensemble the above two ensemble types with different time variabilities present different error characteristics in space in an enoi system the background error covariance matrix is not accurate even in an ideal experiment the result of a da using enoi is largely dependent on the scheme of the ensemble an appropriate ensemble scheme should make the background error covariance matrix describe realistic errors accurately fig 6 shows the sea level anomaly sla fields for the nature run ctl and differences between the two on january 1 2002 and december 31 2002 differences in the sla between the nature run and ctl mainly represent mesoscale processes therefore it may be more reasonable to use an ensemble that can focus mesoscale errors da1a and da1b were designed to evaluate the effect of different ensembles on the mooring observed current da result according to the correlations between u and v at the nwtpo mooring sites and u and v in the surrounding region revealed by the intraseasonal ensemble 350 km and 200 km were set as the localized radii in the zonal and meridional directions respectively in da1a and da1b the localized radius in the vertical was set to 150 m the time series of the rmses of u and v above 500 m within the study area between 0 n 18 n and 122 e 147 e are shown in fig 7 the da1a did not reduce the rmses compared with the ctl in particular the mooring observed current assimilated that used the 30 day mean ensemble magnified velocity errors during the last three months of 2002 fig 7a and b however the rmses of u and v in da1b declined by about 12 8 and 11 8 respectively compared to those in the ctl fig 7a and b moreover the rmses of the intraseasonal u and v isu and isv in da1b were reduced by 15 4 and 16 9 respectively compared to those in the ctl fig 8 a and b the rmses in da1a of both isu and isv are still much larger than those in exp da1b fig 8a and b therefore the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble is more effective in assimilating data from the nwtpo mooring array than the 30 day running mean ensemble in the twin experiments above the errors between the nature run and the ctl are mainly mesoscale in terms of spatial scale fig 6 and couple with the intraseasonal timescale ensemble well however the 30 day running mean ensemble that includes subseasonal frequency signals introduced spurious correlations in its error covariance when the 30 day running mean ensemble was adopted for the da experiment the intraseasonal variability of the observation was regarded as the subseasonal variability by the subseasonal information in the ensemble which produced more false analysis increments therefore based on the u and v power spectra the ensemble including subseasonal information should be removed to resolve mesoscale model errors the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble is more reasonable for assimilating the nwtpo mooring array 4 da results six boxes were selected to represent the upstream au bu and cu and downstream ad bd and cd areas of the background currents nec necc and euc at the mooring array fig 9 to avoid the influence of lateral boundaries areas bd and cd are relatively smaller than the other areas the reduced rmses of the isu and isv relative to the ctl above 500 m in the six areas are shown in table 2 in da2 assimilating the nec mooring array largely improved simulation of the downstream current in area ad with rmses decreasing by 32 7 and 34 5 in the isu and isv respectively the improvement in area au was much smaller than in ad with the rmses decreasing by 13 3 and 12 3 in the isu and isv respectively the larger improvement in the downstream area may be caused by the current dependent error covariance of enoi however the background current also transfers assimilation information to the downstream area when the model is integrated over time another relatively larger improvement appeared in area bu with rmses decreasing by 7 2 and 11 1 for the isu and isv respectively the main reason may be that part of the necc water is from the nec and area bu is located downstream of area ad to some extent in the other areas the improvement in velocity is very limited in da2 table 2 in da3 assimilating the velocity profiles of the necc and euc mooring array improved the simulation in downstream areas better than in upstream areas in area bd rmses of the isu and isv decreased by 9 3 and 14 5 respectively but in area bu they only decreased by 4 3 and 5 5 furthermore the rmses of the isu and isv in area cd decreased by 25 and 31 6 respectively but only decreased by 11 and 7 4 in area cu assimilating the necc and euc mooring array had little effect on the simulation of the nec areas and upstream necc areas table 2 in da1b simulation of the intraseasonal current was significantly improved in all six areas the rmse reductions were larger than those in da2 and da3 except for the isv in area cu the rmses of both the isu and isv were reduced by more than 10 in all six areas except for isv in area cu and isu in area bu where they were reduced by only 4 2 and 9 7 respectively the largest improvement in da1b was in area ad where the rmses of the isu and isv were reduced by 33 8 and 35 8 respectively table 2 fig 10 shows the area averaged rmse profiles of the isu and isv over the study area the rmses of the isu and isv decreased with depth in the ctl which indicates that the influence of surface winds on velocity weakens with depth and the rmses ranged from 0 109 m s to 0 028 m s and 0 109 m s to 0 036 m s for the isu and isv respectively the rmses were reduced at all levels in all three da experiments and the rmses in da1b were the smallest ranging from 0 094 m s to 0 026 m s for the isu and from 0 094 m s to 0 032 m s for the isv the da2 produced smaller rmses for the isu and isv than da3 but the rmses in da2 were still larger than those in da1b for all levels to assess the effect of the mooring observed current da on other oceanic variables the averaged rmse profiles of temperature and salinity over the study area were generated and are shown in fig 11 temperature rmses ranged from 1 48 c to 0 25 c and peaked at 50 m in the ctl fig 11a the rmses of salinity ranged from 0 180 psu to 0 024 psu and peaked at the surface in the ctl fig 11b with the three da experiments the rmses of temperature were significantly reduced at all levels and da1b produced the smallest rmses ranging from 1 38 c to 0 23 c fig 11a the reduced temperature rmses mainly occurred at depths below 50 m implying that da of mooring observed velocity profiles can impact simulation of the baroclinic structure of the ocean in contrast the rmses in salinity declined less fig 11b the rmses in temperature and salinity in da2 were also smaller than those in da3 which is consistent with the results for the rmses of velocity however the averaged rmse profiles in da1b and da2 are very similar for a reliable estimate of the state of the upper ocean it is important to assess improvements the sla fig 12 shows the time averaged rmses of the sla in the ctl and the three da experiments the slas with large rmses were located in areas au and ad fig 12a the rmses were significantly reduced by assimilating the nec moorings fig 12c but not by assimilating the necc and euc moorings fig 12d this is also why da2 produced smaller rmses than da3 for velocity temperature and salinity since the sla errors near the transect of the necc and euc moorings were very small the reduced rmses in da1b and in da2 are similar in da1b the rmses of the variable slas over the study area declined by 13 1 which is larger than the 11 6 observed in da2 and 4 2 in da3 however improvements in the area north of 18 n are limited because of the constraint of the nwtpo moorings site locations fig 12b to make sense of the spread of assimilated information we examined the vorticity of the current ω which is expressed by 4 ω d v d x d u d y fig 13 shows the differences of the time averaged rmse for the vorticity at 50 m between the da1b and the ctl negative values mean that assimilating the nwtpo moorings observing system has a positive effect on vorticity simulation and vice versa within the first 30 days assimilating mooring observed velocity profiles is only helpful to simulate vorticity only at relatively short length scales i e near the moorings array fig 13a the assimilating information spreads to a wider region within the second 30 days and improvement in area ad was most evident fig 13b however within the third 30 days days 61 90 the effects of da in the kc and ngcuc areas are negative fig 13c as intraseasonal variability can be generated by internal instabilities even without atmospheric forcing the internal intraseasonal variability in the western boundary current area is especially complex although assimilating mooring observed velocity profiles can reduce local intraseasonal errors once the assimilated information spreads to an area with complex local dynamic processes it is difficult for the assimilated information to have a positive effect on the simulation due to the strong nonlinearity of the internal ocean the western boundary current area is a sensitive area for target observation especially in the kc and ngcuc areas where targeted observing sites may be needed to supplement the existing nwtpo moorings observing system but overall assimilating the nwtpo mooring observed velocity profiles had an obvious positive effect on regional simulation of vorticity and the improvement in downstream area of the moorings transect was better than that in the upstream area fig 13d 5 discussion and conclusions in this study the nwtpo mooring observing system to monitor intraseasonal variability was assessed using osses the experiments were carried out using the roms model with enoi by assimilation of mooring observed velocity profiles two sub da experiments with different ensembles proved that a 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble strategy outperforms a 30 day running mean ensemble strategy aimed at resolving mesoscale model errors the aim of filtering the ensemble with a 20 90 day bandpass filter is to improve the focus of the background error covariance matrix on mesoscale errors in space using the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble the nwtpo moorings observing system was assessed in detail by assimilating different moorings networks the nec moorings play a more important role in monitoring intraseasonal variability in the nec and upstream necc areas and the necc and euc moorings perform better at intraseasonal monitoring in the downstream necc area and euc area the results of the da experiments that assimilate the entire moorings array showed a 15 4 and 16 9 reduction of rmse in terms of isu and isv respectively within the study area the best improvement in the simulation was in the downstream area of the nec moorings transect ad where the rmses of the intraseasonal velocities were reduced by more than 30 the declines in the rmses of temperature mainly occurred at depths below 50 m implying that da of the mooring observed velocity profiles can impact the baroclinic structure of the ocean it is notable that sla errors especially those near the nec moorings transect can be significantly reduced when the mooring observed velocity profiles are assimilated however the current nwtpo moorings observing system is not able to accurately monitor intraseasonal variability in the kc and ngcuc areas these studies are crucial to determine the ability of the present nwtpo mooring observing system to monitor intraseasonal variability and for the design of optimal nwtpo monitoring networks in the future the results of the mooring observed current da depend on the observation system and the performance of the related da system in this study the improvement of intraseasonal current simulation was about 15 which was quite modest one reason was that few moorings were developed in the study area the other was that intraseasonal circulation control largely relied on the model itself moreover in this study no obvious low frequency subseasonal timescale errors were revealed in the large scale background currents between the ctl and nature run it is difficult to completely avoid low frequency errors in real simulations which will restrict improvement of current simulation on the intraseasonal time scale by assimilating moored currents using an intraseasonal filtered ensemble so in real moored current assimilations low frequency errors should also be considered and reduced on the one hand the low frequency errors of large scale background currents can be reduced well if other traditional observing systems especially the argo and satellite altimeter are assimilated on the other hand the low frequency information from the mooring observed currents also can be used to reduce low frequency errors and improve large scale background current simulations therefore efforts to integrate existing multivariate observing systems in the nwtpo should be studied and a separate multi scale mooring observed current assimilation scheme should be explored further acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and

24105,the northwestern tropical pacific ocean nwtpo moorings observing system including 15 moorings was established in 2013 to provide velocity profile data observing system simulation experiments osses were carried out to assess the ability of the observation system to monitor intraseasonal variability in a pilot study where ideal mooring observed velocity was assimilated using ensemble optimal interpolation enoi based on the regional oceanic modeling system roms because errors between the control and nature runs have a mesoscale structure a random ensemble derived from 20 90 day bandpass filtered nine year model outputs is proved to be more appropriate for the nwtpo mooring array assimilation than a random ensemble derived from a 30 day running mean the simulation of the intraseasonal currents in the north equatorial current nec north equatorial countercurrent necc and equatorial undercurrent euc areas can be improved by assimilating velocity profiles using a 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble the root mean square errors rmses of the intraseasonal zonal u and meridional velocity v above 500 m depth within the study area between 0 n 18 n and 122 e 147 e were reduced by 15 4 and 16 9 respectively improvements in the downstream area of the nec moorings transect were optimum where the rmses of the intraseasonal velocities above 500 m were reduced by more than 30 assimilating velocity profiles can have a positive impact on the simulation and forecast of thermohaline structure and sea level anomalies in the ocean keywords observing system simulation

atmosphere interaction in the western pacific warm pool and affects enso cycles and the global climate system webster and lukas 1992 the nwtpo is where water masses from middle to high latitudes intersect and is the source region for the indonesian through flow and therefore has a significant impact on the global thermohaline circulation gordon 1986 fine et al 1994 upper circulation in the

is quite strong and complex at intraseasonal seasonal interannual and longer timescales qiu and joyce 1992 johnston and merrifield 2000 qiu and chen 2010 hsin and qiu 2012 wu 2013 chen and qiu 2004 xiao et al 2017 there is a great deal of uncertainty in the simulation forecasting of the nwtpo circulation system the impacts of the different observation methods on seasonal interannual forecasting variability in the tropical upper pacific have been well assessed in the past smith and meyers 1996 fischer et al 1997 parent et al 2003 yan et al 2007 the different methods have included expendable bathythermo graphs xbt international tropical ocean and global atmosphere tropical atmosphere ocean toga tao arrays satellite observations and the array for real time geostrophic oceanography argo the current ocean model combined with existing observational networks in the nwtpo can mainly resolve seasonal to interannual forecasting signals and simulate the dominant circulation on a large spatial scale balmaseda and anderson 2009 fujii et al 2015 zheng and zhu 2016 however traditional observing systems are still insufficient to monitor the upper intraseasonal activities in the nwtpo especially in chaotic and turbulent areas oke et al 2015 considering that the intraseasonal anomalies of the current in the upper nwtpo are pronounced compared to the magnitude of the seasonal mean flow and intraseasonal variability can play a role in the nwtpo heat and tracer budget wang et al 2016a it is also necessary to improve intraseasonal simulation of the nwtpo as an important supplement to the nwtpo and global ocean observation system the nwtpo moorings observation system supported by the western pacific ocean system structure dynamics and consequences wpos project was established in 2013 this observation system contains fifteen moorings with upward and downward looking acoustic doppler current profilers adcp deployed at 400 m depth at each mooring fig 1 five of the moorings located along 130 e were deployed to observe nec variability and seven moorings were deployed across the necc and euc along the 142 e transect the other three moorings were deployed in the nec 139 05 e 11 58 n necc 140 e 4 7 n and euc 140 e 2 n compared to traditional observing systems which are indirect measurements of the current the nwtpo moorings observing system can directly provide velocity profile observations at high temporal resolution therefore it is important to explore how the new observations can improve estimations of the upper intraseasonal current processes in the nwtpo to improve estimations it is not only essential that the observing systems satisfy the requirements of data assimilation da systems but also to assess if the schemes of the da are appropriate in this study observing system simulation experiments osses assimilating ideal mooring observed currents are designed using ensemble optimal interpolation enoi ensemble optimal interpolation is a multivariate da method derived from the ensemble kalman filter and widely used in eddy resolving operational applications because of its multivariate properties and computational efficiency oke et al 2008 counillon and bertino 2009a b the ensemble members of enoi are critical for assimilation performance which are usually chosen from the long term results of model integration the assimilation efficiency depends largely on how well the ensemble can represent the background error of the system oke et al 2005 counillon and bertino 2009a to make the ensemble resemble the dominant errors of the model pseudo information on some timescales should be eliminated or restrained to correctly reproduce the mesoscale variability around australia oke et al 2008 used a three day average of the model state minus the seasonal cycle of the model spin up run to eliminate the seasonal variability xie and zhu 2010 obtained a quasi stationary ensemble that can vary with the seasons to represent flow dependence in the seasonality term for assimilation with argo profiles fu et al 2011 found that it is necessary to remove the annual and semi annual cycles from temperature and sea level data to avoid spurious long range correlations in the north sea and baltic sea the main objective of this study is to assess the capacity of the nwtpo mooring array to perform intraseasonal monitoring using enoi da systems with targeted ensemble scheme the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the assimilation system and the design of the da experiments section 3 evaluates the time scales of ensemble effect on mooring observed current da results section 4 gives the result of the mooring observed current da experiments and section 5 provides a summary and discussion 2 model da methods and experiment design 2 1 model setup and validation observing system simulation experiments osses in the nwtpo were conducted using the regional oceanic modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 2005 the model domain spans the south china sea and the western pacific ocean 15 s 35 n and 100 e 150 e the model consists of 511 517 grids with an average spatial resolution of 10 km and a vertical s coordinate designed to have 40 levels a horizontally orthogonal coordinate system was used the model water depth is based on the 2 min earth topography etopo2v2 and the minimum and maximum depths for the domain are set to 10 and 5 000 m respectively the mellor and yamada 2 5 level turbulent closure scheme mellor and yamada 1982 was used to parameterize the vertical mixing a daily mean wind field from the quikscat ocean surface wind product was employed which was converted into the wind stress using the bulk formula given by large and pond 1982 the other daily atmospheric forcing fields including heat fluxes solar radiation fluxes evaporation precipitation e p air temperature and specific humidity were obtained from the u s national centers of environmental prediction

ocean and the west pacific ocean aipocean yan et al 2015a b provided the lateral boundary conditions the radiation boundary condition was laterally open the model was initialized with monthly climatological temperature and salinity data for january from the world ocean atlas 2001 woa01 conkright et al 2002 and a spin up of 10 years was performed fig 2 shows the mean temperature and salinity along 140 e for the upper 1000 m simulated by the roms for 2000 2008 along with the climatology of woa01 along 140 e the temperature pattern is very close to that of woa01 and the good consistency between the model and woa01 isotherm slopes in the meridional direction indicates the rationality of the simulated zonal velocity however the surface temperature values from the model are noticeably a little higher than those from woa01 and the isotherm of 12 c from the model near the 8 n slopes more gently than that for woa01 the simulated fresh water cores at surface and high salinity cores at depth are consistent with climatology the simulated stratification of temperature and salinity shows a similar vertical structure to that of woa01 to validate if the roms could reproduce the intraseasonal variability of the current satellite based ocean surface current estimates from the ocean surface current analysis real time oscar bonjean and lagerloef 2002 product were compared with the roms outputs during the experimental period the oscar currents with a spatial resolution of 1 3 and five day temporal interval represent the average over a 30 m thick surface layer they were estimated from altimeter based ssh sea surface wind and sea surface temperature data the oscar outputs provide reasonably accurate intraseasonal variability especially in the tropical pacific ocean johnson et al 2007 the time series of 0 30 m vertical averaged zonal and meridional velocities u30 and v30 respectively from roms and oscar at three sites representative of different mooring transects are shown in fig 3 a 20 90 day intraseasonal bandpass filter was applied to the data data from roms and oscar are generally consistent in simulating u30 and v30 for example at 142 e 1 n and 142 e 6 n the correlations of intraseasonal velocity between roms and oscar are 0 60 and 0 47 for u30 and 0 41 and 0 50 for v30 respectively at 130 e 13 n the correlations are relatively small with values of 0 40 and 0 22 respectively the amplitudes of u30 and v30 at 130 e 13 n from roms are greater than those from oscar the intraseasonal variability of the currents is mainly generated by the intraseasonal variability of wind forcing and ocean internal instability wang et al 2016a making it difficult to reproduce phase and amplitude fully and accurately in general roms presents some capacity to capture intraseasonal signals it is reasonable that the model included in the assimilation system is used to assess the ability of the nwtpo mooring array to monitor intraseasonal variability 2 2 da method the enoi scheme of evensen 2003 was used in this data assimilative model the enoi analysis scheme can be expressed as follows 1 φ a φ f α c p h t α h c p h t r 1 d h φ f

2011a b wu et al 2014 the symbol represents the schur product defined by c p i j c i j p i j and α is a scaling factor to tune the magnitude of covariance which is set to 0 1 in this study in enoi the background error covariance matrix is computed via a historical ensemble as 2 p a a t n 1 where a is the ensemble perturbation defined as a a a a is the centered historical ensemble with an m n dimensional matrix where m is the size of the model variables and n is the number of ensemble members which is set to 100 in this study a is the ensemble mean considering that representation errors are the main source of observational errors the observational error δ in this study is defined by 3 δ s dx l x dy l y where s indicates the ensemble standard deviation deng et al 2010 liu et al 2016 lx and ly define a neighboring horizontal region lx 350 km and ly 200 km around the sites of the observations in the zonal and meridional direction respectively and dx and dy are the differences between the model grid point and the observation sites in the zonal and meridional directions respectively the assimilated observational variables are zonal and meridional velocities 2 3 experiment design considering that wind forcing errors are the major sources of model error in the upper nwtpo the osses are constructed through twin forcing experiments using different surface wind forcing the model run forced by the quikscat wind field is defined as the nature run and served as the true state of the osses the da models are forced by the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp wind field atlas et al 2011 the assimilated pseudo observations are derived from the daily averaged u and v profiles between 20 500 m at mooring array positions generated by the nature run the experiment is designed as follows table 1 i the nature run in this experiment the model run was forced by the quikscat wind field for the two year period from january 1 2001 to december 31 2002 ii the control run ctl in this experiment the model run was forced by ccmp wind field for the two year period from january 1 2001 to december 31 2002 iii the first da experiment da1 in this experiment all pseudo observations at the mooring array were assimilated to evaluate the effect of different ensembles on the da result for the mooring observed current da1 includes two sub da experiments da1a and da1b in da1a the ensemble was randomly derived from a 30 day running mean of the model outputs between 2000 and 2008 ens 1 in da1b the ensemble was randomly derived from the 20 90 day bandpass filtered model daily averaged outputs ens 2 iv the second da experiment da2 in this experiment only the pseudo observations across nec along the 130 e transect and at 139 05 e 11 58 n were assimilated a scheme of the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble was adopted v the third da experiment da3 in this experiment only the pseudo observations across the necc and euc along the 142 e transect at 140 e 4 7 n and at 140 e 2 n were assimilated a scheme of the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble was adopted to consider a realistic situation with initial field errors the experiments da1 da2 and da3 were started after a year of the ctl run beginning on january 1 2002 and ending on december 31 2002 the pseudo observations were assimilated every 3 days 3 effect of ensemble time scale on mooring observed current da results the nwtpo circulation system has strong variability at intraseasonal interannual decadal and even longer timescales the power spectra of the 0 500 m averaged u and v of three representative moorings in the nec 130 e 13 n necc 142 e 6 n and euc 142 e 1 n are shown in fig 4 the velocity data were derived from roms daily averaged outputs between 2000 and 2008 the power spectra of v presented the highest power peaks at 49 days 130 e 13 n 90 days 142 e 6 n and 35 days 142 e 1 n which indicates that the variances of v were mainly dominated by intraseasonal variability however the power spectra of u were dominated by both intraseasonal variability and longer timescale variability the variances of u exceeded the 90 significance level within the 200 240 day band at 130 e 13 n 118 294 day band at 142 e 6 n and 240 490 day band at 142 e 1 n on lower frequency timescales the correlations of velocity at 100 m depth at the mooring site at 130 e 13 n and its surrounding area derived from ens 1 and ens 2 are shown in fig 5 there are strong positive correlations for u between the nec point and a long region departing from it in the zonal direction fig 5a1 whereas the correlations for v are sign alternating fig 5a2 indicating that the u and v with a 30 day running mean present different spatial correlation scales the large positive correlation scale of u in the zonal direction is likely related to the large scale background current variation of u which also has a long timescale e g interannual or longer the sign alternating correlations are likely related to upper ocean waves by intraseasonal variability the correlations of u and v derived from the 20 90 day bandpass filtered model outputs are shown in fig 5b1 and b2 respectively the correlation scale of u with the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble is much lower than that with 30 day running mean ensemble in the meridional direction the correlation scale has few differences between the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble and the 30 day running ensemble the above two ensemble types with different time variabilities present different error characteristics in space in an enoi system the background error covariance matrix is not accurate even in an ideal experiment the result of a da using enoi is largely dependent on the scheme of the ensemble an appropriate ensemble scheme should make the background error covariance matrix describe realistic errors accurately fig 6 shows the sea level anomaly sla fields for the nature run ctl and differences between the two on january 1 2002 and december 31 2002 differences in the sla between the nature run and ctl mainly represent mesoscale processes therefore it may be more reasonable to use an ensemble that can focus mesoscale errors da1a and da1b were designed to evaluate the effect of different ensembles on the mooring observed current da result according to the correlations between u and v at the nwtpo mooring sites and u and v in the surrounding region revealed by the intraseasonal ensemble 350 km and 200 km were set as the localized radii in the zonal and meridional directions respectively in da1a and da1b the localized radius in the vertical was set to 150 m the time series of the rmses of u and v above 500 m within the study area between 0 n 18 n and 122 e 147 e are shown in fig 7 the da1a did not reduce the rmses compared with the ctl in particular the mooring observed current assimilated that used the 30 day mean ensemble magnified velocity errors during the last three months of 2002 fig 7a and b however the rmses of u and v in da1b declined by about 12 8 and 11 8 respectively compared to those in the ctl fig 7a and b moreover the rmses of the intraseasonal u and v isu and isv in da1b were reduced by 15 4 and 16 9 respectively compared to those in the ctl fig 8 a and b the rmses in da1a of both isu and isv are still much larger than those in exp da1b fig 8a and b therefore the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble is more effective in assimilating data from the nwtpo mooring array than the 30 day running mean ensemble in the twin experiments above the errors between the nature run and the ctl are mainly mesoscale in terms of spatial scale fig 6 and couple with the intraseasonal timescale ensemble well however the 30 day running mean ensemble that includes subseasonal frequency signals introduced spurious correlations in its error covariance when the 30 day running mean ensemble was adopted for the da experiment the intraseasonal variability of the observation was regarded as the subseasonal variability by the subseasonal information in the ensemble which produced more false analysis increments therefore based on the u and v power spectra the ensemble including subseasonal information should be removed to resolve mesoscale model errors the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble is more reasonable for assimilating the nwtpo mooring array 4 da results six boxes were selected to represent the upstream au bu and cu and downstream ad bd and cd areas of the background currents nec necc and euc at the mooring array fig 9 to avoid the influence of lateral boundaries areas bd and cd are relatively smaller than the other areas the reduced rmses of the isu and isv relative to the ctl above 500 m in the six areas are shown in table 2 in da2 assimilating the nec mooring array largely improved simulation of the downstream current in area ad with rmses decreasing by 32 7 and 34 5 in the isu and isv respectively the improvement in area au was much smaller than in ad with the rmses decreasing by 13 3 and 12 3 in the isu and isv respectively the larger improvement in the downstream area may be caused by the current dependent error covariance of enoi however the background current also transfers assimilation information to the downstream area when the model is integrated over time another relatively larger improvement appeared in area bu with rmses decreasing by 7 2 and 11 1 for the isu and isv respectively the main reason may be that part of the necc water is from the nec and area bu is located downstream of area ad to some extent in the other areas the improvement in velocity is very limited in da2 table 2 in da3 assimilating the velocity profiles of the necc and euc mooring array improved the simulation in downstream areas better than in upstream areas in area bd rmses of the isu and isv decreased by 9 3 and 14 5 respectively but in area bu they only decreased by 4 3 and 5 5 furthermore the rmses of the isu and isv in area cd decreased by 25 and 31 6 respectively but only decreased by 11 and 7 4 in area cu assimilating the necc and euc mooring array had little effect on the simulation of the nec areas and upstream necc areas table 2 in da1b simulation of the intraseasonal current was significantly improved in all six areas the rmse reductions were larger than those in da2 and da3 except for the isv in area cu the rmses of both the isu and isv were reduced by more than 10 in all six areas except for isv in area cu and isu in area bu where they were reduced by only 4 2 and 9 7 respectively the largest improvement in da1b was in area ad where the rmses of the isu and isv were reduced by 33 8 and 35 8 respectively table 2 fig 10 shows the area averaged rmse profiles of the isu and isv over the study area the rmses of the isu and isv decreased with depth in the ctl which indicates that the influence of surface winds on velocity weakens with depth and the rmses ranged from 0 109 m s to 0 028 m s and 0 109 m s to 0 036 m s for the isu and isv respectively the rmses were reduced at all levels in all three da experiments and the rmses in da1b were the smallest ranging from 0 094 m s to 0 026 m s for the isu and from 0 094 m s to 0 032 m s for the isv the da2 produced smaller rmses for the isu and isv than da3 but the rmses in da2 were still larger than those in da1b for all levels to assess the effect of the mooring observed current da on other oceanic variables the averaged rmse profiles of temperature and salinity over the study area were generated and are shown in fig 11 temperature rmses ranged from 1 48 c to 0 25 c and peaked at 50 m in the ctl fig 11a the rmses of salinity ranged from 0 180 psu to 0 024 psu and peaked at the surface in the ctl fig 11b with the three da experiments the rmses of temperature were significantly reduced at all levels and da1b produced the smallest rmses ranging from 1 38 c to 0 23 c fig 11a the reduced temperature rmses mainly occurred at depths below 50 m implying that da of mooring observed velocity profiles can impact simulation of the baroclinic structure of the ocean in contrast the rmses in salinity declined less fig 11b the rmses in temperature and salinity in da2 were also smaller than those in da3 which is consistent with the results for the rmses of velocity however the averaged rmse profiles in da1b and da2 are very similar for a reliable estimate of the state of the upper ocean it is important to assess improvements the sla fig 12 shows the time averaged rmses of the sla in the ctl and the three da experiments the slas with large rmses were located in areas au and ad fig 12a the rmses were significantly reduced by assimilating the nec moorings fig 12c but not by assimilating the necc and euc moorings fig 12d this is also why da2 produced smaller rmses than da3 for velocity temperature and salinity since the sla errors near the transect of the necc and euc moorings were very small the reduced rmses in da1b and in da2 are similar in da1b the rmses of the variable slas over the study area declined by 13 1 which is larger than the 11 6 observed in da2 and 4 2 in da3 however improvements in the area north of 18 n are limited because of the constraint of the nwtpo moorings site locations fig 12b to make sense of the spread of assimilated information we examined the vorticity of the current ω which is expressed by 4 ω d v d x d u d y fig 13 shows the differences of the time averaged rmse for the vorticity at 50 m between the da1b and the ctl negative values mean that assimilating the nwtpo moorings observing system has a positive effect on vorticity simulation and vice versa within the first 30 days assimilating mooring observed velocity profiles is only helpful to simulate vorticity only at relatively short length scales i e near the moorings array fig 13a the assimilating information spreads to a wider region within the second 30 days and improvement in area ad was most evident fig 13b however within the third 30 days days 61 90 the effects of da in the kc and ngcuc areas are negative fig 13c as intraseasonal variability can be generated by internal instabilities even without atmospheric forcing the internal intraseasonal variability in the western boundary current area is especially complex although assimilating mooring observed velocity profiles can reduce local intraseasonal errors once the assimilated information spreads to an area with complex local dynamic processes it is difficult for the assimilated information to have a positive effect on the simulation due to the strong nonlinearity of the internal ocean the western boundary current area is a sensitive area for target observation especially in the kc and ngcuc areas where targeted observing sites may be needed to supplement the existing nwtpo moorings observing system but overall assimilating the nwtpo mooring observed velocity profiles had an obvious positive effect on regional simulation of vorticity and the improvement in downstream area of the moorings transect was better than that in the upstream area fig 13d 5 discussion and conclusions in this study the nwtpo mooring observing system to monitor intraseasonal variability was assessed using osses the experiments were carried out using the roms model with enoi by assimilation of mooring observed velocity profiles two sub da experiments with different ensembles proved that a 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble strategy outperforms a 30 day running mean ensemble strategy aimed at resolving mesoscale model errors the aim of filtering the ensemble with a 20 90 day bandpass filter is to improve the focus of the background error covariance matrix on mesoscale errors in space using the 20 90 day bandpass filtered ensemble the nwtpo moorings observing system was assessed in detail by assimilating different moorings networks the nec moorings play a more important role in monitoring intraseasonal variability in the nec and upstream necc areas and the necc and euc moorings perform better at intraseasonal monitoring in the downstream necc area and euc area the results of the da experiments that assimilate the entire moorings array showed a 15 4 and 16 9 reduction of rmse in terms of isu and isv respectively within the study area the best improvement in the simulation was in the downstream area of the nec moorings transect ad where the rmses of the intraseasonal velocities were reduced by more than 30 the declines in the rmses of temperature mainly occurred at depths below 50 m implying that da of the mooring observed velocity profiles can impact the baroclinic structure of the ocean it is notable that sla errors especially those near the nec moorings transect can be significantly reduced when the mooring observed velocity profiles are assimilated however the current nwtpo moorings observing system is not able to accurately monitor intraseasonal variability in the kc and ngcuc areas these studies are crucial to determine the ability of the present nwtpo mooring observing system to monitor intraseasonal variability and for the design of optimal nwtpo monitoring networks in the future the results of the mooring observed current da depend on the observation system and the performance of the related da system in this study the improvement of intraseasonal current simulation was about 15 which was quite modest one reason was that few moorings were developed in the study area the other was that intraseasonal circulation control largely relied on the model itself moreover in this study no obvious low frequency subseasonal timescale errors were revealed in the large scale background currents between the ctl and nature run it is difficult to completely avoid low frequency errors in real simulations which will restrict improvement of current simulation on the intraseasonal time scale by assimilating moored currents using an intraseasonal filtered ensemble so in real moored current assimilations low frequency errors should also be considered and reduced on the one hand the low frequency errors of large scale background currents can be reduced well if other traditional observing systems especially the argo and satellite altimeter are assimilated on the other hand the low frequency information from the mooring observed currents also can be used to reduce low frequency errors and improve large scale background current simulations therefore efforts to integrate existing multivariate observing systems in the nwtpo should be studied and a separate multi scale mooring observed current assimilation scheme should be explored further acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and

24106,effective data assimilation methods for incorporating observations into marine biogeochemical models are required to improve hindcasts nowcasts and forecasts of the ocean s biogeochemical state recent assimilation efforts have shown that updating model physics alone can degrade biogeochemical fields while only updating biogeochemical variables may not improve a model s predictive skill when the physical fields are inaccurate here we systematically investigate whether multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical model states are superior to only updating either physical or biogeochemical variables we conducted a series of twin experiments in an idealized ocean channel that experiences wind driven upwelling the forecast model was forced with biased wind stress and perturbed biogeochemical model parameters compared to the model run representing the truth taking advantage of the multivariate nature of the deterministic ensemble kalman filter denkf we assimilated different combinations of synthetic physical sea surface height sea surface temperature and temperature profiles and biogeochemical surface chlorophyll and nitrate profiles observations we show that when biogeochemical and physical properties are highly correlated e g thermocline and nutricline multivariate updates of both are essential for improving model skill and can be accomplished by assimilating either physical e g temperature profiles or biogeochemical e g nutrient profiles observations in our idealized domain the improvement is largely due to a better representation of nutrient upwelling which results in a more accurate nutrient input into the euphotic zone in contrast assimilating surface chlorophyll improves the model state only slightly because surface chlorophyll contains little information about the vertical density structure we also show that a degradation of the correlation between observed subsurface temperature and nutrient fields which has been an issue in several previous assimilation studies can be reduced by multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical fields keywords ensemble kalman filter multivariate updates coupled physical biogeochemical ocean model 1 introduction with the rapid expansion of ocean observing platforms which now provide a wealth of observations and growing numerical model capabilities effective ways of

shulman et al 2013 diffuse light attenuation coefficients ciavatta et al 2014 and remote sensing reflectance jones et al 2016 are also being pursued however it has long been recognized that deficiencies in biogeochemical fields can arise from deficiencies in the physical state e g doney 1999 oschlies and garcon 1999 doney et al 2004 because the physics controls both horizontal and vertical transport of nutrients oxygen plankton and many other biogeochemical variables several studies have investigated the impact of assimilating physical data alone on coupled physical biogeochemical systems berline et al 2007 samuelsen et al 2009 while et al 2010 el moussaoui et al 2011 fiechter et al 2011 raghukumar et al 2015 one important and perhaps surprising finding drawn from these studies is that despite the clear improvement in physical model fields the physical data assimilation alone does not generally improve but often degrades simulated biogeochemical fields for example while et al 2010 and el moussaoui et al 2011 reported overestimated surface nutrients and chlorophyll concentrations particularly in equatorial regions associated with spurious increases in vertical velocities when assimilating physical data in global ocean models berline et al 2007 found large increases in vertical nutrient fluxes in mid latitudes and sub tropics that were partly due to the misalignment between physical and biogeochemical fields resulting from updates of the physical fields raghukumar et al 2015 also showed that assimilating physical data leads to elevated production particularly in oligotrophic regions and attributed the overestimation to a net upward nutrient flux resulting from high vertical velocity fluctuations due to the initialization shocks after updates to the density distribution and increased nutrient variance on density surfaces due to the adjustment of physical variables in the assimilation step collectively the above studies demonstrate that adjusting only physical or biogeochemical fields is not sufficient to improve the full 3d biogeochemical model state an obvious next step is the simultaneous updating of physical and biogeochemical fields two approaches have emerged to address it the simpler approach is applying a correction to the nutrient field alongside the physical data assimilation shulman et al 2013 while et al 2010 the second approach is to jointly assimilate physical and biogeochemical observations into the models to date few studies have explored this idea but with encouraging results anderson et al 2000 ourmières et al 2009 song et al 2016a b mattern et al 2016 these studies show that assimilating both physical and biogeochemical data can maintain dynamical consistency between the physical and biogeochemical fields and provide better state estimates than only assimilating one or the other however one clear drawback of this approach is that the required physical and biogeochemical observations might not always be available concurrently here we propose and test an alternative approach for updating both types of model fields even when only one data type biogeochemical or physical is available the approach takes advantage of the inherently multivariate nature of the ensemble kalman filter enkf to generate multivariate increments that can be applied consistently to all model state variables while the enkf has been used to assimilate physical or biological ocean observations in the past its ability to update biological model fields by assimilating physical observations and vice versa has not yet been tested in ocean applications this paper aims to systematically assess whether when and why multivariate enkf updates of both physical and biogeochemical fields can outperform isolated updates of physical or biogeochemical fields by assimilating only one observation type and compare these two da strategies against the joint updates of both fields by assimilating both observation types this is achieved by conducting a series of twin experiments in an idealized ocean channel that experiences wind driven upwelling 2 model description and experimental setup 2 1 the coupled physical biogeochemical model we use the regional ocean modeling system haidvogel et al 2008 roms http myroms org configured in a computationally efficient idealized channel roms is a free surface terrain following primitive equation ocean model that has been used extensively for coupled physical biogeochemical modeling and data assimilation e g hu et al 2012 raghukumar et al 2015 song et al 2016a b the idealized channel is 82 km wide with the depth symmetrically increasing from 25 m at the two edges to 140 m in the middle fig 1 the model grid is uniformly spaced with a horizontal resolution of 1 km generating 84 cross channel and 82 along channel grid points and has 16 terrain following vertical layers with thickness ranging from 1 6 m at the surface near the channel edges to 22 6 m at the bottom of the mid channel periodic lateral boundary conditions are applied to the southern and northern open boundaries that is any physical or biogeochemical tracer or flow that leaves the domain through one boundary will re enter at the opposite side vertical mixing is parameterized using the mellor and yamada 1982 level 2 5 turbulence closure scheme bottom friction is specified using a linear drag formulation the model is forced with a uniform along channel wind that generates upwelling on one side of the channel and downwelling on the other the wind forcing is prescribed by a clipped sine curve resulting in 30 days of non zero wind stress followed by 30 days of relaxation without any wind forcing gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0 002 pa is added to generate a more realistic wind regime one cycle with a peak wind stress of 0 07 pa high wind and 0 06 pa low wind is shown in fig 1a the biogeochemical component of the coupled model uses the nitrogen cycle model of fennel et al 2006 the model is a relatively simple representation of the pelagic nitrogen n cycle including two species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 one phytoplankton group phy chlorophyll chl as a separate state variable to allow for photoacclimation one zooplankton group zoo and two pools of detritus representing large fast sinking particles ldet and suspended small particles sdet the model accounts for photoacclimation of phytoplankton based on the model of geider et al 1997 resulting in a variable ratio of chlorophyll to phytoplankton biomass in the model the biogeochemical fields do not influence physical fields i e there is no feedback from biology to physics this coupled model has been a valuable tool for understanding interacting physical and biogeochemical processes within realistic configurations for both coastal e g fennel et al 2006 2008 and open ocean ecosystems e g xue et al 2013 as well as for data assimilation experiments e g hu et al 2012 mattern et al 2013 the biogeochemical component of the coupled model was spun up for 1 year without any wind forcing and no flow at the lateral boundaries the initial temperature ranges from 14 5 c at the mid channel bottom to 22 c at the surface initial nitrate ranges from 13 5 mmol n m 3 at depth to 0 5 mmol n m 3 at the surface and all other initial biogeochemical variables were homogeneous at a low positive value salinity was fixed at 35 psu and surface heat flux was not included in this idealized setup the biogeochemical variables reached a steady state after 1 year of spin up the spun up biogeochemical fields were used as initial condition for all coupled simulations which were forced with high or low wind fig 1a for 180 days covering three wind cycles 2 2 experimental framework the performance of different data assimilation strategies is evaluated in twin experiments that consist of a reference model run representing the truth from which synthetic observations are generated and a model with biased physics and biology that is subject to ensemble based assimilation of the synthetic observations we test two contrasting scenarios scenario 1 where the forecast model is forced with lower wind stress and a lower photosynthesis irradiance pi parameter value than the truth leading to underestimation of the true upwelling and productivity scenario 2 where a higher wind stress and higher pi value lead to overestimation of upwelling and productivity for the sake of brevity we only detail the experimental setup of scenario 1 scenario 2 is identical except for the wind forcing and biological parameter set in scenario 1 the reference or truth is generated by running the coupled model as described in section 2 1 and forced with higher wind peak wind stress of 0 07 pa denoted as high wind in fig 1a the along channel northward wind leads to upwelling of nutrient rich cold water at the western edge of the channel stimulating phytoplankton growth assuming coriolis frequency f 0 synthetic observations are sampled from the reference run including sea surface height ssh sea surface temperature sst and surface chlorophyll at all grid points assuming no data missing due to cloud cover and 28 temperature and 16 nitrate profiles from a regular sampling grid see fig 1b typical gaussian observation errors of n 0 0 3 c for temperature both sst and temperature profiles n 0 1 cm for ssh n 0 35 true concentration for surface chlorophyll and n 0 10 true concentration for nitrate profiles are added to the synthetic data in addition smaller errors in the biological observations i e n 0 10 true concentration for chlorophyll and n 0 5 true concentration for nitrate are tested as described in section 2 2 3 in the biased model the peak wind stress is about 14 smaller gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0 002 pa was added to the wind stress to create an ensemble of wind forcing files one realization is shown in fig 1a denoted as low wind in addition the five biological parameters to which the system is most sensitive were perturbed these parameters were identified in sensitivity experiments as follows for each parameter the model was run twice after doubling and halving the parameter value the five parameters for which these perturbations resulted in the largest root mean square rms difference to the unperturbed simulation are referred to as the most sensitive ones in the ensemble simulations all five parameters are sampled from a uniform distribution around their nominal value with a variance of 75 of the nominal value the nominal values of the top two most sensitive parameters the photosynthesis irradiance initial slope 0 015 mg c mg chl w m 2 d 1 and zooplankton grazing rate 0 6 d 1 are set to be 40 lower than those of the reference run to simulate model bias errors the other three parameters phytoplankton growth rate 1 0 d 1 mortality rate 0 1 d 1 and maximum chlorophyll to carbon ratio 0 0535 mg chl mg c 1 are not biased 2 2 1 denkf algorithm we use the deterministic formulation of the enkf denkf which was introduced by sakov and oke 2008 and has been used previously in biogeochemical data assimilation applications e g simon et al 2015 jones et al 2016 the central idea underlying the enkf is that an ensemble of model simulations can be used to approximate the model s estimate of uncertainty and that the model state can be updated using available observations as the ensemble is integrated forward in time evensen 1994 the enkf algorithm consists of sequential forecast and analysis steps during the forecast step the model ensemble is propagated forward in time during the analysis step the model state is updated using the kalman filter kf analysis equation 1 x a x f k d h x f where x is the n 1 model state estimate vector n is the number of model state variables at all grid points the superscripts a and f represent the analysis and the forecast estimates respectively d is the m 1 vector of observations m is the number of available observations h linear in this form dimension of m n is the measurement operator mapping the model state onto the observations and k is the n m kalman gain matrix given as 2 k p f h t h p f h t r 1 where p f represents the n n prior sample error covariance matrix approximated using the forecast ensemble r is the m m observation error covariance and superscript t denotes matrix transpose in the original stochastic enkf burgers et al 1998 the forecast ensemble x f is updated via kalman analysis eq 1 and requires perturbing observations d in order to obtain an analysis error covariance consistent with that given by the linear kalman filter in contrast the denkf updates the ensemble mean and ensemble anomalies separately without perturbing observations and is hence termed deterministic first the forecast ensemble mean x f is updated as in eq 1 then the forecast ensemble anomalies a f are updated by a a a f 1 2 kh a f which ensures that the resulting covariance matrix is slightly inflated compared to the theoretical value given by the kalman filter finally the analysis ensemble is reconstructed as x a a a x a x a for more details on the denkf see sakov and oke 2008 in principle the denkf can update the entire model state based on the correlations in the ensemble covariance between the observations and model variables however computational constraints often prohibit inclusion of all 3d state variables in the assimilation state vector x i f the ith ensemble member here we limit updates to the four biological variables nitrate chlorophyll phytoplankton and zooplankton and one physical variable temperature that are most relevant to the dynamics of the system 2 2 2 assimilation settings we chose an ensemble size of 20 for our data assimilation experiments relatively small ensembles like this can lead to spurious correlations between distant grid points to prevent the potential negative effects of spurious correlations we applied a distance based localization method known as local analysis evensen 2003 hunt et al 2007 sakov and bertino 2011 in local analysis the spatial domain of influence of each observation is artificially reduced by multiplying the ensemble anomalies and innovations with a distance dependent localization function gaspari and cohn 1999 we chose a localization radius of 20 km for sst ssh temperature profiles and nitrate profiles and 10 km for surface chlorophyll additionally to account for the underestimation of the forecast error covariance due to the small ensemble size an inflation factor of 1 05 was applied to the ensemble anomalies inflating the ensemble around its mean at every update step anderson and anderson 1999 the localization radius and inflation factor are based on initial tests that involve selecting the values that best reduce the model data errors without causing ensemble collapse or generating discontinuities in the analyzed fields additional practical implementation choices were made to make the denkf performance more robust as follows because chlorophyll and nitrate concentrations at some grid points can be as low as 10 4 mg m3 for chlorophyll or mmol m3 for nitrate resulting in extremely low magnitudes of the observation error covariance r we set a lower limit of 10 2 for the diagonal elements of r corresponding to chlorophyll and nitrate observations this is equivalent to artificially increasing the error of very low chlorophyll and nitrate observations this can be thought of as applying inflation in the observation space which has already been explored in anderson 2009 we also inflate the assumed observation error covariance by a factor of 2 when updating the ensemble anomalies while using the original observation error variance for updating the ensemble mean as proposed in sakov et al 2012 this is done to produce a weaker update for the ensemble based state error covariance without changing the ensemble analysis mean and hence retain a larger ensemble spread to prevent an initial shock to the system due to large initial updates we increased the observation error by a factor of 8 4 and 2 for the first three da steps respectively as in sakov et al 2012 finally a post processing step was performed at the end of each update step resetting any negative values of temperature and biogeochemical variables to their corresponding forecast values less than 0 2 of grid cells were affected by this throughout the assimilation period 2 2 3 data assimilation experiments we carried out a series of assimilation experiments for scenarios 1 and 2 table 1 using different strategies for assimilating a single biogeochemical or physical or both observational data types method 1 isolated updates where only one of the two data types is used either physical observations to update physical model fields or biogeochemical observations to update biogeochemical model fields method 2 multivariate updates single data type where only one data type is used to update both physical and biogeochemical model fields taking advantage of the multivariate covariance structure within the denkf and method 3 joint updates both data types where both data types are assimilated in a two step update with physical observations being used first and biogeochemical observations used next the acronyms for assimilation experiments introduced in table 1 are in accord with the posterior probability of the model state given the observations e g p model observation in all experiments the denkf update is performed every two days during upwelling peaks of the second and third wind cycle day 74 to 98 and 134 to 158 respectively leading to 26 assimilation steps in total detailed analysis of the experiments focuses on the third wind cycle when the largest deviation between the biased ensemble runs and the true state has developed the assimilation impact is assessed by comparing the assimilative runs to an ensemble of model simulations with the same model configuration but without any data assimilation this ensemble run is referred to as the free run the model s forecast skill a metric of how long the model s forecast from the analysis outperforms the free run is also assessed for this purpose we perform 25 day ensemble runs referred to as forecast runs that are initialized from the updated states on day 140 the 17th da step and forced with the same winds as the assimilation runs model data misfit is quantified by examining the deviations from the truth model minus truth for da runs at assimilation times when both forecast and analysis exist the forecast ensemble mean is used for calculating the deviation we first computed the daily deviations at each grid point during the analysis period day 134 to 158 and then averaged the deviation or absolute deviation values over space and time to obtain the mean deviation bias and the mean absolute deviation mad symbols biassurf and madsurf represent bias and mad averaged over the surface layer only whereas madall represents averaging over the entire water column 3 results below we provide a detailed analysis of scenario 1 the case underestimating upwelling and productivity results from scenario 2 the case overestimating upwelling and productivity are presented in section 3 4 3 1 comparison between truth and free run time series of domain averaged surface temperature nitrate and phytoplankton from the truth free run and different da runs are shown in fig 2 compared to the truth the free run is overall warmer and has lower surface nitrate and phytoplankton due to weaker upwelling fig 3 shows a snapshot of ssh surface temperature nitrate and phytoplankton on day 140 ssh anomalies on both upwelling and downwelling edges are smaller in the free run than the truth in the free run the band of cold nutrient rich water along the upwelling edge is much narrower than in the truth and the band of elevated phytoplankton concentrations detached from the coast in the truth is not simulated by the free run the corresponding vertical distributions of the same variables along a cross channel transect are shown in fig 4 the reference isotherm represented by the 16 c isotherm and reference isopleth of nitrate represented by the 5 mmol no3 m 3 isoline coincide and are deeper in the free run than the truth at the upwelling edge along channel section averaged temperature and nitrate profiles near the upwelling edge fig 5 a e show that in the free run temperature is warmer and nitrate concentration lower than the truth in the top 60 m the differences between the truth and free run are also reflected by the positive biassurf in temperature negative biassurf in nitrate and phytoplankton as well as the large madall in all variables fig 6 3 2 impact of assimilation on physical and biogeochemical states 3 2 1 method 1 isolated updates first we assess the assimilation impact when biogeochemical variables are used to update only biogeochemical variables or physical variables to update only physical variables assimilating surface chlorophyll to correct the biogeochemical variables alone b chl and b chl 10 barely affects the time evolution of surface nitrate and improves surface phytoplankton only when the chlorophyll observation error is reduced to 10 fig 2 second row the point to point comparison metrics confirm that b chl and b chl 10 slightly reduce biassurf and madsurf for phytoplankton but b chl 10 leads to an increase in madall for nitrate and phytoplankton fig 6 in b chln and b chln5 where nitrate profiles are assimilated in addition to surface chlorophyll the updates in surface nitrate and phytoplankton are more noticeable than in b chl but the ensemble mean is still far from the truth fig 2 third row and the reference isopleth of nitrate in b chln is only slightly lifted up to the truth fig 5f the metrics in fig 6 show that b chln improves nitrate with a smaller biassurf and madall than b chl reducing the nitrate observation error b chln5 leads to little further improvement relative to b chln assimilating sst and ssh t psurf remarkably improves surface temperature and increases surface nitrate and phytoplankton concentrations toward the truth without directly updating them during analysis steps fig 2 fourth row however the phytoplankton peak is delayed and concentrations are overestimated after the peak in upwelling t psurf clearly lifts up the reference isotherm and isopleth of nitrate toward the truth fig 5c g but degrades the nitrate profile at depths greater than 25 m fig 5g the comparison metrics show that t psurf improves ssh temperature surface nitrate and phytoplankton with lower biases and mad values but degrades subsurface nitrate with higher madall than the free run fig 6 compared to t psurf assimilating additional temperature profiles t pall improves the timing of the phytoplankton peak but overestimates phytoplankton more after peak upwelling fig 2 fifth row comparison metrics in fig 6 show that t pall further improves temperature with lower madall but degrades nitrate with higher mad values than those in t psurf and the free run fig 6 none of the method 1 isolated updates approaches satisfactorily improves the biogeochemical ocean model state although the physical model state is remarkably improved by assimilating the physical data 3 2 2 method 2 multivariate updates single data type second we assess the impact of multivariate updates where a single data type biogeochemical or physical observations is used for multivariate updates of biogeochemical variables and temperature assimilating only surface chlorophyll tb chl slightly improves surface temperature and nitrate relative to b chl fig 2 second row with slightly smaller biassurf and madall fig 6 reducing the chlorophyll observation error tb chl 10 leads to larger increases in surface nitrate and phytoplankton fig 2 second row that further reduce their biassurf and nitrate madsurf but also substantially increases nitrate madall assimilating additional nitrate profiles to update both physical and biogeochemical fields in tb chln and tb chln5 remarkably improves the time evolution of surface temperature during the upwelling period and nitrate and phytoplankton for the entire time period fig 2 third row compared to b chln b chln5 and tb chl improvement in tb chln is also obvious in the spatial distributions with an extended area of cold and high nutrient water along the upwelling edge fig 3 and a clear lift of the reference isotherm near the surface and isopleth of nitrate toward the truth compared to the free run and b chln figs 4 and 5 tb chln and tb chln5 yield the smallest madall for all variables among da runs that only assimilate biogeochemical observations fig 6 then we used physical observations ssh and sst in tn psurf ssh sst and temperature profiles in tn pall for multivariate updates of physical variables and the nitrate field we only update the nitrate field instead of all biogeochemical variables because of the high correlation between physical fields and nitrate in contrast to the relatively low correlation between physical fields and other biogeochemical variables compared to t psurf and t pall method 1 tn psurf and tn pall lead to larger increases in surface nitrate and phytoplankton and overall agree better with the truth except that surface phytoplankton is overestimated after peak upwelling fig 2 fourth and fifth rows tn pall also remarkably improves the spatial distribution of surface and subsurface temperature and nitrate but fails to improve that for phytoplankton figs 3 and 4 vertically viewed both tn psurf and tn pall effectively lift the depths of reference isotherm and isopleth of nitrate approaching the truth fig 5 overall tn pall yields lower madall for temperature and nitrate than tn psurf fig 6 method 2 multivariate updates single data type improves the physical and biogeochemical ocean model states more satisfactorily than method 1 isolated updates does 3 2 3 method 3 joint updates both data types the last set of assimilation experiments used both data types physical and biogeochemical observations to provide a two step update where physical observations are assimilated first to update physical fields or both types of fields and biogeochemical observations are assimilated next to update biogeochemical fields only we have also performed tests where in the second step biogeochemical observations are used to update both types of variables but found this slightly degraded the updated physical fields from step one probably because in the first step physical observations already provide sufficient improvement to physical fields here we used a two step update approach for two practical reasons i its relatively lower computation cost and ii ease of selecting subsets of variables to be updated theoretical considerations do provide some support for the two step update specifically in a bayesian formulation if the observations have non correlated errors one and two step updates should produce the same results e g bierman 1977 we note however this exact equivalence is broken by the presence of localization inflation and the linearity assumption underlying the enkf compared with the physical da runs t psurf t pall tn psurf and tn pall method 3 runs t psurf b chl t pall b chln tn psurf b chl and tn pall b chln are as effective in increasing the surface nitrate but underestimate surface phytoplankton slightly more during peak upwelling while agreeing better with the truth afterwards fig 2 sixth and seventh row similar to tb chln and physical da runs method 3 effectively raises the reference isopleth of nitrate to the truth figs 4 and 5 however t psurf b chl and tn psurf b chl lead to relatively high madall for nitrate similar to that in t psurf and tn psurf suggesting that the assimilation of additional surface chlorophyll has little information to constrain subsurface nitrate with additional profile observations t pall b chln and tn pall b chln simulate nitrate profiles that better delineate the true pattern throughout the water column fig 5i j and substantially reduce madall for nitrate than t psurf b chl and tn psurf b chl fig 6 among all da runs across different methods with the same observation error applied tn pall b chln generally yields the lowest madsurf or madall for all variables presented in fig 6 as well as zooplankton small and large detritus listed in table 2 based on table 2 the method 2 and method 3 generally yield beneficial effects on more biogeochemical variables than method 1 interestingly despite the beneficial effects on phytoplankton in many assimilation runs zooplankton is barely improved except in tn pall b chln and tb chln5 we found that surface zooplankton is persistently underestimated in all assimilation runs not shown consistent with the lower grazing rate used in the biased model in scenario 1 also noticeable from table 2 is that small and large detritus are improved in all assimilation runs except those only assimilating surface chlorophyll while ammonium is least improved by assimilation among all variables 3 2 4 nitrate and temperature correlation to investigate whether and to what degree the assimilation affects the correlation between temperature and nutrients we present scatterplots of nitrate and temperature from the 28 stations shown in fig 1b at all assimilation dates fig 7 in the free run fig 7a there is a tight correlation between temperature and nitrate in nitrate rich subsurface water the variance of the nitrate concentration around the best fit between nitrate and temperature is small and its pdf probability density function peaks sharply near 0 fig 7h compared to the free run method 1 runs that adjust only the nitrate or temperature fields b chln in fig 7b and t pall in fig 7c and a method 3 run that has weak effect on nitrate with assimilation of surface chlorophyll t psurf b chl in fig 7d degrade the temperature nitrate relationship in these cases the nitrate variance on temperature surfaces increases by more than 4 times and flatter more skewed pdfs of nitrate result fig 7h i j compared to the free run in contrast assimilation runs in which temperature and nitrate are adjusted simultaneously either based on multivariate updates method 2 runs tb chln in fig 7e and tn pall in fig 7f and method 3 run tn psurf b chl in fig 7g or by assimilating both fields method 3 runs t pall b chln and tn pall b chln not shown better preserve the temperature nitrate relationship in these multivariate update runs the nitrate variance increases much less compared fig 7e f g with fig 7b c d and the pdf of nitrate is much sharper than in isolated update runs fig 7h i j 3 3 impact of assimilation on the forecast skill the comparisons of assimilation experiments in previous sections show that method 2 multivariate updates single data type and method 3 joint updates both data types improve ocean model fields more significantly and better preserve the temperature nitrate correlation than method 1 isolated updates here we examine whether the different assimilation methods improve model forecast skill and how they differ fig 8 shows the difference of domain averaged madsurf and madall between the free and forecast runs for ssh temperature nitrate and phytoplankton where a positive value indicates improvement by assimilation it is evident that all assimilation methods improve model forecast skill in all or at least some model fields and display positive mad differences for 10 to 25 days depending on the method and model field specifically for physical fields method 2 run tb chln improves forecast skill of ssh for 24 days and temperature fields for 15 days which is as good as the physical da runs t pall and tn pall and method 3 runs fig 8a b e assimilating additional temperature profiles slightly improves forecast skill for physical fields with overall higher mad differences e g compare t pall b chln and t psurf b chl in fig 8a b e with respect to nitrate method 2 tb chln tn pall and method 3 all except t psurf b chl which has little improvement on nitrate madall strongly improve forecast skill for 10 days in surface waters and 12 days in the entire water column by comparison method 1 leads to smaller and shorter lasting improvements b chln or even has a deleterious impact t pall in nitrate assimilating additional profiles brings extra improvement in forecast skill for nitrate e g compare tn pall b chln and tn psurf b chl in fig 8f for the phytoplankton field the improvement in forecast skill from assimilation is sustained for longer with positive madsurf and madall difference for 25 days in all forecast runs except for surface phytoplankton in tn pall and overall larger mad difference in method 3 runs than method 2 or method 1 runs fig 8d g 3 4 sensitivity of the assimilation methods to twin experimental design we have shown in the above sections that assimilation corrects the underestimating upwelling and productivity scenario 1 by increasing the upwelling and or concentrations of biogeochemical variables with the improvements varying among different assimilation methods the conclusions drawn in scenario 1 hold in the contrasting scenario 2 where upwelling and productivity are overestimated consistent with scenario 1 fig 9 shows that when only assimilating surface chlorophyll method 2 run tb chl only slightly outperforms method 1 run b chl with slightly reduced upwelling of cold water and nitrate to the surface however when additional nitrate profiles are assimilated the improvement by method 2 run tb chln over method 1 run b chln is clear with both surface temperature and nitrate substantially improved assimilating physical observations satisfactorily improves surface temperature and results in a better representation of surface nitrate when nitrate is updated along with temperature tn pall compared with t pall however both runs particularly t pall substantially increase surface phytoplankton leading to even larger overestimation of surface phytoplankton than in the free run fig 9 the elevated production at the surface is partially associated with spurious fluctuations in vertical velocity when physical fields are significantly adjusted e g see higher root mean square rms vertical velocity in tb chln tn psurf and tn pall in fig s1 in the supplement as a result more nutrients are brought from the subsurface to the surface the problem of overestimating surface phytoplankton is substantially mitigated when surface chlorophyll and nitrate profiles are assimilated in addition to physical observations in tn pall b chln fig 9 the quantitative effects are summarized in table s1 in the supplement compared to scenario 1 the beneficial effects on biogeochemical variables in scenario 2 in terms of madall reduction are weaker but the degradation of biogeochemical fields except surface nitrate when assimilating physical observations to update physical fields alone t pall is clearer consistent with scenario 1 table s1 shows that method 2 outperforms method 1 also in scenario 2 with lower madsurf and madall for all biogeochemical variables overall method 3 yields the lowest madsurf or madall for physical and biogeochemical variables 4 discussion we have performed a series of twin experiments comparing different assimilation strategies in an idealized upwelling channel that is subject to biased physics i e with weaker or stronger upwelling than the truth and biased biology i e with perturbed biogeochemical parameters our results show that updating the biogeochemical or physical model state alone method 1 isolated updates is not sufficient for improving the biogeochemical ocean state and forecasts without addressing the issue of biased upwelling which is at the root of the inaccurate simulation of biogeochemical fields any corrections to the biogeochemical fields during assimilation updates dissipate quickly and do not lead to sustained improvements when adjusting the physical model state alone subsurface nitrate distributions are degraded and surface productivity is overestimated despite substantial improvements in physical fields the degradation in biogeochemical fields is primarily due to two issues the increased nutrient variance on temperature isosurfaces when only adjusting the temperature or nutrient field and the spurious high vertical velocities when physical fields are substantially adjusted both issues can result in unreasonable nutrient inputs to the euphotic zone as has been reported in raghukumar et al 2015 our experiments show that simultaneously adjusting physical and biogeochemical fields is key to avoid breaking the temperature nutrient relationship and to improve the biogeochemical ocean model state estimation the simultaneous update can be achieved by method 2 multivariate updates single data type which takes advantage of the correlation between physical and biogeochemical fields and the multivariate nature of the kalman filter or by method 3 joint updates both data types which assimilates physical and biogeochemical observations sequentially in realistic applications method 3 is more cumbersome because physical and biogeochemical observations may not be available concurrently this makes the remarkable improvement obtained by method 2 very attractive when only one type of observations is available in our case the extra benefit of method 2 over method 1 results from a strong correlation between the biogeochemical or physical observations and the unobserved physical or biogeochemical model fields to be updated specifically temperature and nitrate for example assimilating surface chlorophyll alone leads to limited improvement on the 3d biogeochemical state estimation even when correcting both physical and biogeochemical fields because the correlation between surface chlorophyll and interior temperature and nitrate fields is weak this is also confirmed by our sensitivity tests which show that assimilating surface chlorophyll with lower observation error increases the madall for temperature and nitrate despite the improvement in surface phytoplankton in contrast when additional nitrate profiles are assimilated the biogeochemical state is much improved and the superiority of method 2 over method 1 is much clearer reducing the observation error of nitrate profiles further reduces madall for all physical and biogeochemical model fields compare tb chln and tb chln5 in table 2 other studies have reported similar success in taking advantage of the relationship between temperature or density and nutrients using methods other than enkf while et al 2010 showed that applying an increment to the nutrient field based on the nutrient potential density relationship during the physical data assimilation improves nutrient distribution shulman et al 2013 found that instantaneously updating nitrate based on observation derived statistical relations between temperature and nitrate improves model nitrate fields coupled physical biogeochemical data assimilation as in method 3 joint updates both data types has demonstrated success in a few studies using methods other than enkf anderson et al 2000 ourmières et al 2009 song et al 2016a 2016b mattern et al 2016 here we demonstrate the advantages of method 3 for the enkf our results add that even when physical and biogeochemical observations are assimilated using method 3 updating physical and biogeochemical fields simultaneously with physical observations can result in a bigger improvement in the biogeochemical model state e g see higher forecast skills in tn psurf b chl and tn pall b chln in relative to t psurf b chl and t pall b chln in fig 8c f this is especially true when the available biogeochemical observations are not able to effectively constrain the biased biogeochemical fields i e t psurf b chl where only surface chlorophyll is assimilated to update the biology fails to reduce the increased nitrate variance on temperature surfaces following assimilation of physical data we notice that despite the remarkable improvement in nitrate in methods 2 and 3 runs which assimilate nitrate profiles tb chln and t pall b chln discrepancies between the domain averaged surface phytoplankton figs 2 and 9 in the da runs and the truth remain we attribute these discrepancies to a combination of two factors first the relatively high observation error of 35 for chlorophyll results in more modest denkf updates than a smaller observation error would an uncertainty of 35 is typically used for satellite chlorophyll and has been adopted in several prior assimilation studies e g ciavatta et al 2011 hu et al 2012 our sensitivity experiments show that reducing the chlorophyll observation error could drive surface phytoplankton closer to the truth e g compared b chl 10 with b chl and tb chl 10 with tb chl in fig 2 second we forced the ensemble of free and da runs with phytoplankton initial slopes and zooplankton grazing rate values that are 40 lower than those for the truth in scenario 1 and 40 higher in scenario 2 which act to exacerbate the underestimation or overestimation of productivity the two factors contributing to the bias in phytoplankton estimation in addition to the biased physical fields can also explain the inaccurate zooplankton which is consistently underestimated in scenario 1 and overestimated in scenario 2 improvements could be achieved by applying bias correction methods such as state augmentation to simultaneously estimate and correct biased parameters with the model state variables e g see review in dee 2005 and more recent biogeochemical ocean model applications in simon et al 2015 and gharamti et al 2017a b and will be the focus of future work we would also like to note that in our experiments assimilating ssh and sst alone e g tn psurf is almost as effective as assimilating additional temperature profiles e g tn pall in lifting the depths of the reference isotherm and isopleth of nitrate toward the truth primarily due to the tight correlation between ssh and model interior density and nutrient structures wilson and adamec 2002 it should be noted however that surface heat flux was not included in our model simulations we expect that the performance of assimilating sst to update the thermocline will diminish as surface heat fluxes modify upper water temperatures nevertheless tn pall outperforms tn psurf with clearly lower madall for temperature nitrate and phytoplankton demonstrating the importance of assimilating additional subsurface observations in improving the accuracy of estimated 3d fields beyond the position of the thermocline and nutricline to date satellite chlorophyll sst and ssh observations are the main observation streams for data assimilation due to their excellent spatial and temporal resolution and almost real time accessibility for most regions of the world s oceans fortunately with the rapid expansion of ocean observing platforms profiles of physical and biogeochemical variables from floats and gliders will become more abundant and available for data assimilation to further improve model estimation and prediction 5 conclusions we have assessed the impacts of updating physical and biogeochemical model fields individually versus simultaneously via different assimilation strategies on ocean ecosystem estimation and prediction we found that adjusting the physical or biogeochemical model state alone method 1 isolated updates degrades the tight correlation between temperature and nitrate and is insufficient to improve biogeochemical ocean state and prediction simultaneous multivariate or sequential updates to physical and biogeochemical fields are required to avoid degrading the temperature and nitrate relationship and to strongly improve the biogeochemical model state simultaneous updates can be realized through method 2 multivariate updates single data type by assimilating either physical or biogeochemical observations to update both model fields or method 3 joint updates both data types that sequentially assimilates physical and biogeochemical observations surface chlorophyll is of limited use for improving the 3d model state in our idealized upwelling system even when correcting physical and biogeochemical fields because the correlation between surface chlorophyll and interior nitrate and density structures is weak this highlights the importance of collecting subsurface information for improving biogeochemical ocean model state overall method 3 joint updates both data types outperforms method 2 multivariate updates single data type in terms of

24106,effective data assimilation methods for incorporating observations into marine biogeochemical models are required to improve hindcasts nowcasts and forecasts of the ocean s biogeochemical state recent assimilation efforts have shown that updating model physics alone can degrade biogeochemical fields while only updating biogeochemical variables may not improve a model s predictive skill when the physical fields are inaccurate here we systematically investigate whether multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical model states are superior to only updating either physical or biogeochemical variables we conducted a series of twin experiments in an idealized ocean channel that experiences wind driven upwelling the forecast model was forced with biased wind stress and perturbed biogeochemical model parameters compared to the model run representing the truth taking advantage of the multivariate nature of the deterministic ensemble kalman filter denkf we assimilated different combinations of synthetic physical sea surface height sea surface temperature and temperature profiles and biogeochemical surface chlorophyll and nitrate profiles observations we show that when biogeochemical and physical properties are highly correlated e g thermocline and nutricline multivariate updates of both are essential for improving model skill and can be accomplished by assimilating either physical e g temperature profiles or biogeochemical e g nutrient profiles observations in our idealized domain the improvement is largely due to a better representation of nutrient upwelling which results in a more accurate nutrient input into the euphotic zone in contrast assimilating surface chlorophyll improves the model state only slightly because surface chlorophyll contains little information about the vertical density structure we also show that a degradation of the correlation between observed subsurface temperature and nutrient fields which has been an issue in several previous assimilation studies can be reduced by multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical fields keywords ensemble kalman filter multivariate updates coupled physical biogeochemical ocean model 1 introduction with the rapid expansion of ocean observing platforms which now provide a wealth of observations and growing numerical model capabilities effective ways of combining observations and dynamic models through data assimilation da are needed while da techniques and methodologies are well developed in meteorology and physical oceanography e g ghil and malanotte rizzoli 1991 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 2001 kalnay 2003 their applications in marine biogeochemical models are less mature but actively developing see reviews of biogeochemical state estimation in gregg 2008 edwards et al 2015 and state parameter estimation in gharamti et al 2017a b biogeochemical data assimilation falls into two general categories the optimization of

shown that model parameters can also be updated sequentially along with the model state variables e g simon et al 2015 gharamti et al 2017a b for biogeochemical state estimation efforts have primarily been made in assimilating satellite ocean color observations predominantly satellite derived chlorophyll into coupled physical biogeochemical models e g natvik and evensen 2003 gregg 2008 ciavatta et al 2011 hu et al 2012 ford et al 2012 fontana et al 2013 ford and barciela 2017 assimilation of satellite ocean color products other than chlorophyll such as phytoplankton absorption coefficients shulman et al 2013 diffuse light attenuation coefficients ciavatta et al 2014 and remote sensing reflectance jones et al 2016 are also being pursued however it has long been recognized that deficiencies in biogeochemical fields can arise from deficiencies in the physical state e g doney 1999 oschlies and garcon 1999 doney et al 2004 because the physics controls both horizontal and vertical transport of nutrients oxygen plankton and many other biogeochemical variables several studies have investigated the impact of assimilating physical data alone on coupled physical biogeochemical systems berline et al 2007 samuelsen et al 2009 while et al 2010 el moussaoui et al 2011 fiechter et al 2011 raghukumar et al 2015 one important and perhaps surprising finding drawn from these studies is that despite the clear improvement in physical model fields the physical data assimilation alone does not generally improve but often degrades simulated biogeochemical fields for example while et al 2010 and el moussaoui et al 2011 reported overestimated surface nutrients and chlorophyll concentrations particularly in equatorial regions associated with spurious increases in vertical velocities when assimilating physical data in global ocean models berline et al 2007 found large increases in vertical nutrient fluxes in mid latitudes and sub tropics that were partly due to the misalignment between physical and biogeochemical fields resulting from updates of the physical fields raghukumar et al 2015 also showed that assimilating physical data leads to elevated production particularly in oligotrophic regions and attributed the overestimation to a net upward nutrient flux resulting from high vertical velocity fluctuations due to the initialization shocks after updates to the density distribution and increased nutrient variance on density surfaces due to the adjustment of physical variables in the assimilation step collectively the above studies demonstrate that adjusting only physical or biogeochemical fields is not sufficient to improve the full 3d biogeochemical model state an obvious next step is the simultaneous updating of physical and biogeochemical fields two approaches have emerged to address it the simpler approach is applying a correction to the nutrient field alongside the physical data assimilation shulman et al 2013 while et al 2010 the second approach is to jointly assimilate physical and biogeochemical observations into the models to date few studies have explored this idea but with encouraging results anderson et al 2000 ourmières et al 2009 song et al 2016a b mattern et al 2016 these studies show that assimilating both physical and biogeochemical data can maintain dynamical consistency between the physical and biogeochemical fields and provide better state estimates than only assimilating one or the other however one clear drawback of this approach is that the required physical and biogeochemical observations might not always be available concurrently here we propose and test an alternative approach for updating both types of model fields even when only one data type biogeochemical or physical is available the approach takes advantage of the inherently multivariate nature of the ensemble kalman filter enkf to generate multivariate increments that can be applied consistently to all model state variables while the enkf has been used to assimilate physical or biological ocean observations in the past its ability to update biological model fields by assimilating physical observations and vice versa has not yet been tested in ocean applications this paper aims to systematically assess whether when and why multivariate enkf updates of both physical and biogeochemical fields can outperform isolated updates of physical or biogeochemical fields by assimilating only one observation type and compare these two da strategies against the joint updates of both fields by assimilating both observation types this is achieved by conducting a series of twin experiments in an idealized ocean channel that experiences wind driven upwelling 2 model description and experimental setup 2 1 the coupled physical biogeochemical model we use the regional ocean modeling system haidvogel et al 2008 roms http myroms org configured in a computationally efficient idealized channel roms is a free surface terrain following primitive equation ocean model that has been used extensively for coupled physical biogeochemical modeling and data assimilation e g hu et al 2012 raghukumar et al 2015 song et al 2016a b the idealized channel is 82 km wide with the depth symmetrically increasing from 25 m at the two edges to 140 m in the middle fig 1 the model grid is uniformly spaced with a horizontal resolution of 1 km generating 84 cross channel and 82 along channel grid points and has 16 terrain following vertical layers with thickness ranging from 1 6 m at the surface near the channel edges to 22 6 m at the bottom of the mid channel periodic lateral boundary conditions are applied to the southern and northern open boundaries that is any physical or biogeochemical tracer or flow that leaves the domain through one boundary will re enter at the opposite side vertical mixing is parameterized using the mellor and yamada 1982 level 2 5 turbulence closure scheme bottom friction is specified using a linear drag formulation the model is forced with a uniform along channel wind that generates upwelling on one side of the channel and downwelling on the other the wind forcing is prescribed by a clipped sine curve resulting in 30 days of non zero wind stress followed by 30 days of relaxation without any wind forcing gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0 002 pa is added to generate a more realistic wind regime one cycle with a peak wind stress of 0 07 pa high wind and 0 06 pa low wind is shown in fig 1a the biogeochemical component of the coupled model uses the nitrogen cycle model of fennel et al 2006 the model is a relatively simple representation of the pelagic nitrogen n cycle including two species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 one phytoplankton group phy chlorophyll chl as a separate state variable to allow for photoacclimation one zooplankton group zoo and two pools of detritus representing large fast sinking particles ldet and suspended small particles sdet the model accounts for photoacclimation of phytoplankton based on the model of geider et al 1997 resulting in a variable ratio of chlorophyll to phytoplankton biomass in the model the biogeochemical fields do not influence physical fields i e there is no feedback from biology to physics this coupled model has been a valuable tool for understanding interacting physical and biogeochemical processes within realistic configurations for both coastal e g fennel et al 2006 2008 and open ocean ecosystems e g xue et al 2013 as well as for data assimilation experiments e g hu et al 2012 mattern et al 2013 the biogeochemical component of the coupled model was spun up for 1 year without any wind forcing and no flow at the lateral boundaries the initial temperature ranges from 14 5 c at the mid channel bottom to 22 c at the surface initial nitrate ranges from 13 5 mmol n m 3 at depth to 0 5 mmol n m 3 at the surface and all other initial biogeochemical variables were homogeneous at a low positive value salinity was fixed at 35 psu and surface heat flux was not included in this idealized setup the biogeochemical variables reached a steady state after 1 year of spin up the spun up biogeochemical fields were used as initial condition for all coupled simulations which were forced with high or low wind fig 1a for 180 days covering three wind cycles 2 2 experimental framework the performance of different data assimilation strategies is evaluated in twin experiments that consist of a reference model run representing the truth from which synthetic observations are generated and a model with biased physics and biology that is subject to ensemble based assimilation of the synthetic observations we test two contrasting scenarios scenario 1 where the forecast model is forced with lower wind stress and a lower photosynthesis irradiance pi parameter value than the truth leading to underestimation of the true upwelling and productivity scenario 2 where a higher wind stress and higher pi value lead to overestimation of upwelling and productivity for the sake of brevity we only detail the experimental setup of scenario 1 scenario 2 is identical except for the wind forcing and biological parameter set in scenario 1 the reference or truth is generated by running the coupled model as described in section 2 1 and forced with higher wind peak wind stress of 0 07 pa denoted as high wind in fig 1a the along channel northward wind leads to upwelling of nutrient rich cold water at the western edge of the channel stimulating phytoplankton growth assuming coriolis frequency f 0 synthetic observations are sampled from the reference run including sea surface height ssh sea surface temperature sst and surface chlorophyll at all grid points assuming no data missing due to cloud cover and 28 temperature and 16 nitrate profiles from a regular sampling grid see fig 1b typical gaussian observation errors of n 0 0 3 c for temperature both sst and temperature profiles n 0 1 cm for ssh n 0 35 true concentration for surface chlorophyll and n 0 10 true concentration for nitrate profiles are added to the synthetic data in addition smaller errors in the biological observations i e n 0 10 true concentration for chlorophyll and n 0 5 true concentration for nitrate are tested as described in section 2 2 3 in the biased model the peak wind stress is about 14 smaller gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0 002 pa was added to the wind stress to create an ensemble of wind forcing files one realization is shown in fig 1a denoted as low wind in addition the five biological parameters to which the system is most sensitive were perturbed these parameters were identified in sensitivity experiments as follows for each parameter the model was run twice after doubling and halving the parameter value the five parameters for which these perturbations resulted in the largest root mean square rms difference to the unperturbed simulation are referred to as the most sensitive ones in the ensemble simulations all five parameters are sampled from a uniform distribution around their nominal value with a variance of 75 of the nominal value the nominal values of the top two most sensitive parameters the photosynthesis irradiance initial slope 0 015 mg c mg chl w m 2 d 1 and zooplankton grazing rate 0 6 d 1 are set to be 40 lower than those of the reference run to simulate model bias errors the other three parameters phytoplankton growth rate 1 0 d 1 mortality rate 0 1 d 1 and maximum chlorophyll to carbon ratio 0 0535 mg chl mg c 1 are not biased 2 2 1 denkf algorithm we use the deterministic formulation of the enkf denkf which was introduced by sakov and oke 2008 and has been used previously in biogeochemical data assimilation applications e g simon et al 2015 jones et al 2016 the central idea underlying the enkf is that an ensemble of model simulations can be used to approximate the model s estimate of uncertainty and that the model state can be updated using available observations as the ensemble is integrated forward in time evensen 1994 the enkf algorithm consists of sequential forecast and analysis steps during the forecast step the model ensemble is propagated forward in time during the analysis step the model state is updated using the kalman filter kf analysis equation 1 x a x f k d h x f where x is the n 1 model state estimate vector n is the number of model state variables at all grid points the superscripts a and f represent the analysis and the forecast estimates respectively d is the m 1 vector of observations m is the number of available observations h linear in this form dimension of m n is the measurement operator mapping the model state onto the observations and k is the n m kalman gain matrix given as 2 k p f h t h p f h t r 1 where p f represents the n n prior sample error covariance matrix approximated using the forecast ensemble r is the m m observation error covariance and superscript t denotes matrix transpose in the original stochastic enkf burgers et al 1998 the forecast ensemble x f is updated via kalman analysis eq 1 and requires perturbing observations d in order to obtain an analysis error covariance consistent with that given by the linear kalman filter in contrast the denkf updates the ensemble mean and ensemble anomalies separately without perturbing observations and is hence termed deterministic first the forecast ensemble mean x f is updated as in eq 1 then the forecast ensemble anomalies a f are updated by a a a f 1 2 kh a f which ensures that the resulting covariance matrix is slightly inflated compared to the theoretical value given by the kalman filter finally the analysis ensemble is reconstructed as x a a a x a x a for more details on the denkf see sakov and oke 2008 in principle the denkf can update the entire model state based on the correlations in the ensemble covariance between the observations and model variables however computational constraints often prohibit inclusion of all 3d state variables in the assimilation state vector x i f the ith ensemble member here we limit updates to the four biological variables nitrate chlorophyll phytoplankton and zooplankton and one physical variable temperature that are most relevant to the dynamics of the system 2 2 2 assimilation settings we chose an ensemble size of 20 for our data assimilation experiments relatively small ensembles like this can lead to spurious correlations between distant grid points to prevent the potential negative effects of spurious correlations we applied a distance based localization method known as local analysis evensen 2003 hunt et al 2007 sakov and bertino 2011 in local analysis the spatial domain of influence of each observation is artificially reduced by multiplying the ensemble anomalies and innovations with a distance dependent localization function gaspari and cohn 1999 we chose a localization radius of 20 km for sst ssh temperature profiles and nitrate profiles and 10 km for surface chlorophyll additionally to account for the underestimation of the forecast error covariance due to the small ensemble size an inflation factor of 1 05 was applied to the ensemble anomalies inflating the ensemble around its mean at every update step anderson and anderson 1999 the localization radius and inflation factor are based on initial tests that involve selecting the values that best reduce the model data errors without causing ensemble collapse or generating discontinuities in the analyzed fields additional practical implementation choices were made to make the denkf performance more robust as follows because chlorophyll and nitrate concentrations at some grid points can be as low as 10 4 mg m3 for chlorophyll or mmol m3 for nitrate resulting in extremely low magnitudes of the observation error covariance r we set a lower limit of 10 2 for the diagonal elements of r corresponding to chlorophyll and nitrate observations this is equivalent to artificially increasing the error of very low chlorophyll and nitrate observations this can be thought of as applying inflation in the observation space which has already been explored in anderson 2009 we also inflate the assumed observation error covariance by a factor of 2 when updating the ensemble anomalies while using the original observation error variance for updating the ensemble mean as proposed in sakov et al 2012 this is done to produce a weaker update for the ensemble based state error covariance without changing the ensemble analysis mean and hence retain a larger ensemble spread to prevent an initial shock to the system due to large initial updates we increased the observation error by a factor of 8 4 and 2 for the first three da steps respectively as in sakov et al 2012 finally a post processing step was performed at the end of each update step resetting any negative values of temperature and biogeochemical variables to their corresponding forecast values less than 0 2 of grid cells were affected by this throughout the assimilation period 2 2 3 data assimilation experiments we carried out a series of assimilation experiments for scenarios 1 and 2 table 1 using different strategies for assimilating a single biogeochemical or physical or both observational data types method 1 isolated updates where only one of the two data types is used either physical observations to update physical model fields or biogeochemical observations to update biogeochemical model fields method 2 multivariate updates single data type where only one data type is used to update both physical and biogeochemical model fields taking advantage of the multivariate covariance structure within the denkf and method 3 joint updates both data types where both data types are assimilated in a two step update with physical observations being used first and biogeochemical observations used next the acronyms for assimilation experiments introduced in table 1 are in accord with the posterior probability of the model state given the observations e g p model observation in all experiments the denkf update is performed every two days during upwelling peaks of the second and third wind cycle day 74 to 98 and 134 to 158 respectively leading to 26 assimilation steps in total detailed analysis of the experiments focuses on the third wind cycle when the largest deviation between the biased ensemble runs and the true state has developed the assimilation impact is assessed by comparing the assimilative runs to an ensemble of model simulations with the same model configuration but without any data assimilation this ensemble run is referred to as the free run the model s forecast skill a metric of how long the model s forecast from the analysis outperforms the free run is also assessed for this purpose we perform 25 day ensemble runs referred to as forecast runs that are initialized from the updated states on day 140 the 17th da step and forced with the same winds as the assimilation runs model data misfit is quantified by examining the deviations from the truth model minus truth for da runs at assimilation times when both forecast and analysis exist the forecast ensemble mean is used for calculating the deviation we first computed the daily deviations at each grid point during the analysis period day 134 to 158 and then averaged the deviation or absolute deviation values over space and time to obtain the mean deviation bias and the mean absolute deviation mad symbols biassurf and madsurf represent bias and mad averaged over the surface layer only whereas madall represents averaging over the entire water column 3 results below we provide a detailed analysis of scenario 1 the case underestimating upwelling and productivity results from scenario 2 the case overestimating upwelling and productivity are presented in section 3 4 3 1 comparison between truth and free run time series of domain averaged surface temperature nitrate and phytoplankton from the truth free run and different da runs are shown in fig 2 compared to the truth the free run is overall warmer and has lower surface nitrate and phytoplankton due to weaker upwelling fig 3 shows a snapshot of ssh surface temperature nitrate and phytoplankton on day 140 ssh anomalies on both upwelling and downwelling edges are smaller in the free run than the truth in the free run the band of cold nutrient rich water along the upwelling edge is much narrower than in the truth and the band of elevated phytoplankton concentrations detached from the coast in the truth is not simulated by the free run the corresponding vertical distributions of the same variables along a cross channel transect are shown in fig 4 the reference isotherm represented by the 16 c isotherm and reference isopleth of nitrate represented by the 5 mmol no3 m 3 isoline coincide and are deeper in the free run than the truth at the upwelling edge along channel section averaged temperature and nitrate profiles near the upwelling edge fig 5 a e show that in the free run temperature is warmer and nitrate concentration lower than the truth in the top 60 m the differences between the truth and free run are also reflected by the positive biassurf in temperature negative biassurf in nitrate and phytoplankton as well as the large madall in all variables fig 6 3 2 impact of assimilation on physical and biogeochemical states 3 2 1 method 1 isolated updates first we assess the assimilation impact when biogeochemical variables are used to update only biogeochemical variables or physical variables to update only physical variables assimilating surface chlorophyll to correct the biogeochemical variables alone b chl and b chl 10 barely affects the time evolution of surface nitrate and improves surface phytoplankton only when the chlorophyll observation error is reduced to 10 fig 2 second row the point to point comparison metrics confirm that b chl and b chl 10 slightly reduce biassurf and madsurf for phytoplankton but b chl 10 leads to an increase in madall for nitrate and phytoplankton fig 6 in b chln and b chln5 where nitrate profiles are assimilated in addition to surface chlorophyll the updates in surface nitrate and phytoplankton are more noticeable than in b chl but the ensemble mean is still far from the truth fig 2 third row and the reference isopleth of nitrate in b chln is only slightly lifted up to the truth fig 5f the metrics in fig 6 show that b chln improves nitrate with a smaller biassurf and madall than b chl reducing the nitrate observation error b chln5 leads to little further improvement relative to b chln assimilating sst and ssh t psurf remarkably improves surface temperature and increases surface nitrate and phytoplankton concentrations toward the truth without directly updating them during analysis steps fig 2 fourth row however the phytoplankton peak is delayed and concentrations are overestimated after the peak in upwelling t psurf clearly lifts up the reference isotherm and isopleth of nitrate toward the truth fig 5c g but degrades the nitrate profile at depths greater than 25 m fig 5g the comparison metrics show that t psurf improves ssh temperature surface nitrate and phytoplankton with lower biases and mad values but degrades subsurface nitrate with higher madall than the free run fig 6 compared to t psurf assimilating additional temperature profiles t pall improves the timing of the phytoplankton peak but overestimates phytoplankton more after peak upwelling fig 2 fifth row comparison metrics in fig 6 show that t pall further improves temperature with lower madall but degrades nitrate with higher mad values than those in t psurf and the free run fig 6 none of the method 1 isolated updates approaches satisfactorily improves the biogeochemical ocean model state although the physical model state is remarkably improved by assimilating the physical data 3 2 2 method 2 multivariate updates single data type second we assess the impact of multivariate updates where a single data type biogeochemical or physical observations is used for multivariate updates of biogeochemical variables and temperature assimilating only surface chlorophyll tb chl slightly improves surface temperature and nitrate relative to b chl fig 2 second row with slightly smaller biassurf and madall fig 6 reducing the chlorophyll observation error tb chl 10 leads to larger increases in surface nitrate and phytoplankton fig 2 second row that further reduce their biassurf and nitrate madsurf but also substantially increases nitrate madall assimilating additional nitrate profiles to update both physical and biogeochemical fields in tb chln and tb chln5 remarkably improves the time evolution of surface temperature during the upwelling period and nitrate and phytoplankton for the entire time period fig 2 third row compared to b chln b chln5 and tb chl improvement in tb chln is also obvious in the spatial distributions with an extended area of cold and high nutrient water along the upwelling edge fig 3 and a clear lift of the reference isotherm near the surface and isopleth of nitrate toward the truth compared to the free run and b chln figs 4 and 5 tb chln and tb chln5 yield the smallest madall for all variables among da runs that only assimilate biogeochemical observations fig 6 then we used physical observations ssh and sst in tn psurf ssh sst and temperature profiles in tn pall for multivariate updates of physical variables and the nitrate field we only update the nitrate field instead of all biogeochemical variables because of the high correlation between physical fields and nitrate in contrast to the relatively low correlation between physical fields and other biogeochemical variables compared to t psurf and t pall method 1 tn psurf and tn pall lead to larger increases in surface nitrate and phytoplankton and overall agree better with the truth except that surface phytoplankton is overestimated after peak upwelling fig 2 fourth and fifth rows tn pall also remarkably improves the spatial distribution of surface and subsurface temperature and nitrate but fails to improve that for phytoplankton figs 3 and 4 vertically viewed both tn psurf and tn pall effectively lift the depths of reference isotherm and isopleth of nitrate approaching the truth fig 5 overall tn pall yields lower madall for temperature and nitrate than tn psurf fig 6 method 2 multivariate updates single data type improves the physical and biogeochemical ocean model states more satisfactorily than method 1 isolated updates does 3 2 3 method 3 joint updates both data types the last set of assimilation experiments used both data types physical and biogeochemical observations to provide a two step update where physical observations are assimilated first to update physical fields or both types of fields and biogeochemical observations are assimilated next to update biogeochemical fields only we have also performed tests where in the second step biogeochemical observations are used to update both types of variables but found this slightly degraded the updated physical fields from step one probably because in the first step physical observations already provide sufficient improvement to physical fields here we used a two step update approach for two practical reasons i its relatively lower computation cost and ii ease of selecting subsets of variables to be updated theoretical considerations do provide some support for the two step update specifically in a bayesian formulation if the observations have non correlated errors one and two step updates should produce the same results e g bierman 1977 we note however this exact equivalence is broken by the presence of localization inflation and the linearity assumption underlying the enkf compared with the physical da runs t psurf t pall tn psurf and tn pall method 3 runs t psurf b chl t pall b chln tn psurf b chl and tn pall b chln are as effective in increasing the surface nitrate but underestimate surface phytoplankton slightly more during peak upwelling while agreeing better with the truth afterwards fig 2 sixth and seventh row similar to tb chln and physical da runs method 3 effectively raises the reference isopleth of nitrate to the truth figs 4 and 5 however t psurf b chl and tn psurf b chl lead to relatively high madall for nitrate similar to that in t psurf and tn psurf suggesting that the assimilation of additional surface chlorophyll has little information to constrain subsurface nitrate with additional profile observations t pall b chln and tn pall b chln simulate nitrate profiles that better delineate the true pattern throughout the water column fig 5i j and substantially reduce madall for nitrate than t psurf b chl and tn psurf b chl fig 6 among all da runs across different methods with the same observation error applied tn pall b chln generally yields the lowest madsurf or madall for all variables presented in fig 6 as well as zooplankton small and large detritus listed in table 2 based on table 2 the method 2 and method 3 generally yield beneficial effects on more biogeochemical variables than method 1 interestingly despite the beneficial effects on phytoplankton in many assimilation runs zooplankton is barely improved except in tn pall b chln and tb chln5 we found that surface zooplankton is persistently underestimated in all assimilation runs not shown consistent with the lower grazing rate used in the biased model in scenario 1 also noticeable from table 2 is that small and large detritus are improved in all assimilation runs except those only assimilating surface chlorophyll while ammonium is least improved by assimilation among all variables 3 2 4 nitrate and temperature correlation to investigate whether and to what degree the assimilation affects the correlation between temperature and nutrients we present scatterplots of nitrate and temperature from the 28 stations shown in fig 1b at all assimilation dates fig 7 in the free run fig 7a there is a tight correlation between temperature and nitrate in nitrate rich subsurface water the variance of the nitrate concentration around the best fit between nitrate and temperature is small and its pdf probability density function peaks sharply near 0 fig 7h compared to the free run method 1 runs that adjust only the nitrate or temperature fields b chln in fig 7b and t pall in fig 7c and a method 3 run that has weak effect on nitrate with assimilation of surface chlorophyll t psurf b chl in fig 7d degrade the temperature nitrate relationship in these cases the nitrate variance on temperature surfaces increases by more than 4 times and flatter more skewed pdfs of nitrate result fig 7h i j compared to the free run in contrast assimilation runs in which temperature and nitrate are adjusted simultaneously either based on multivariate updates method 2 runs tb chln in fig 7e and tn pall in fig 7f and method 3 run tn psurf b chl in fig 7g or by assimilating both fields method 3 runs t pall b chln and tn pall b chln not shown better preserve the temperature nitrate relationship in these multivariate update runs the nitrate variance increases much less compared fig 7e f g with fig 7b c d and the pdf of nitrate is much sharper than in isolated update runs fig 7h i j 3 3 impact of assimilation on the forecast skill the comparisons of assimilation experiments in previous sections show that method 2 multivariate updates single data type and method 3 joint updates both data types improve ocean model fields more significantly and better preserve the temperature nitrate correlation than method 1 isolated updates here we examine whether the different assimilation methods improve model forecast skill and how they differ fig 8 shows the difference of domain averaged madsurf and madall between the free and forecast runs for ssh temperature nitrate and phytoplankton where a positive value indicates improvement by assimilation it is evident that all assimilation methods improve model forecast skill in all or at least some model fields and display positive mad differences for 10 to 25 days depending on the method and model field specifically for physical fields method 2 run tb chln improves forecast skill of ssh for 24 days and temperature fields for 15 days which is as good as the physical da runs t pall and tn pall and method 3 runs fig 8a b e assimilating additional temperature profiles slightly improves forecast skill for physical fields with overall higher mad differences e g compare t pall b chln and t psurf b chl in fig 8a b e with respect to nitrate method 2 tb chln tn pall and method 3 all except t psurf b chl which has little improvement on nitrate madall strongly improve forecast skill for 10 days in surface waters and 12 days in the entire water column by comparison method 1 leads to smaller and shorter lasting improvements b chln or even has a deleterious impact t pall in nitrate assimilating additional profiles brings extra improvement in forecast skill for nitrate e g compare tn pall b chln and tn psurf b chl in fig 8f for the phytoplankton field the improvement in forecast skill from assimilation is sustained for longer with positive madsurf and madall difference for 25 days in all forecast runs except for surface phytoplankton in tn pall and overall larger mad difference in method 3 runs than method 2 or method 1 runs fig 8d g 3 4 sensitivity of the assimilation methods to twin experimental design we have shown in the above sections that assimilation corrects the underestimating upwelling and productivity scenario 1 by increasing the upwelling and or concentrations of biogeochemical variables with the improvements varying among different assimilation methods the conclusions drawn in scenario 1 hold in the contrasting scenario 2 where upwelling and productivity are overestimated consistent with scenario 1 fig 9 shows that when only assimilating surface chlorophyll method 2 run tb chl only slightly outperforms method 1 run b chl with slightly reduced upwelling of cold water and nitrate to the surface however when additional nitrate profiles are assimilated the improvement by method 2 run tb chln over method 1 run b chln is clear with both surface temperature and nitrate substantially improved assimilating physical observations satisfactorily improves surface temperature and results in a better representation of surface nitrate when nitrate is updated along with temperature tn pall compared with t pall however both runs particularly t pall substantially increase surface phytoplankton leading to even larger overestimation of surface phytoplankton than in the free run fig 9 the elevated production at the surface is partially associated with spurious fluctuations in vertical velocity when physical fields are significantly adjusted e g see higher root mean square rms vertical velocity in tb chln tn psurf and tn pall in fig s1 in the supplement as a result more nutrients are brought from the subsurface to the surface the problem of overestimating surface phytoplankton is substantially mitigated when surface chlorophyll and nitrate profiles are assimilated in addition to physical observations in tn pall b chln fig 9 the quantitative effects are summarized in table s1 in the supplement compared to scenario 1 the beneficial effects on biogeochemical variables in scenario 2 in terms of madall reduction are weaker but the degradation of biogeochemical fields except surface nitrate when assimilating physical observations to update physical fields alone t pall is clearer consistent with scenario 1 table s1 shows that method 2 outperforms method 1 also in scenario 2 with lower madsurf and madall for all biogeochemical variables overall method 3 yields the lowest madsurf or madall for physical and biogeochemical variables 4 discussion we have performed a series of twin experiments comparing different assimilation strategies in an idealized upwelling channel that is subject to biased physics i e with weaker or stronger upwelling than the truth and biased biology i e with perturbed biogeochemical parameters our results show that updating the biogeochemical or physical model state alone method 1 isolated updates is not sufficient for improving the biogeochemical ocean state and forecasts without addressing the issue of biased upwelling which is at the root of the inaccurate simulation of biogeochemical fields any corrections to the biogeochemical fields during assimilation updates dissipate quickly and do not lead to sustained improvements when adjusting the physical model state alone subsurface nitrate distributions are degraded and surface productivity is overestimated despite substantial improvements in physical fields the degradation in biogeochemical fields is primarily due to two issues the increased nutrient variance on temperature isosurfaces when only adjusting the temperature or nutrient field and the spurious high vertical velocities when physical fields are substantially adjusted both issues can result in unreasonable nutrient inputs to the euphotic zone as has been reported in raghukumar et al 2015 our experiments show that simultaneously adjusting physical and biogeochemical fields is key to avoid breaking the temperature nutrient relationship and to improve the biogeochemical ocean model state estimation the simultaneous update can be achieved by method 2 multivariate updates single data type which takes advantage of the correlation between physical and biogeochemical fields and the multivariate nature of the kalman filter or by method 3 joint updates both data types which assimilates physical and biogeochemical observations sequentially in realistic applications method 3 is more cumbersome because physical and biogeochemical observations may not be available concurrently this makes the remarkable improvement obtained by method 2 very attractive when only one type of observations is available in our case the extra benefit of method 2 over method 1 results from a strong correlation between the biogeochemical or physical observations and the unobserved physical or biogeochemical model fields to be updated specifically temperature and nitrate for example assimilating surface chlorophyll alone leads to limited improvement on the 3d biogeochemical state estimation even when correcting both physical and biogeochemical fields because the correlation between surface chlorophyll and interior temperature and nitrate fields is weak this is also confirmed by our sensitivity tests which show that assimilating surface chlorophyll with lower observation error increases the madall for temperature and nitrate despite the improvement in surface phytoplankton in contrast when additional nitrate profiles are assimilated the biogeochemical state is much improved and the superiority of method 2 over method 1 is much clearer reducing the observation error of nitrate profiles further reduces madall for all physical and biogeochemical model fields compare tb chln and tb chln5 in table 2 other studies have reported similar success in taking advantage of the relationship between temperature or density and nutrients using methods other than enkf while et al 2010 showed that applying an increment to the nutrient field based on the nutrient potential density relationship during the physical data assimilation improves nutrient distribution shulman et al 2013 found that instantaneously updating nitrate based on observation derived statistical relations between temperature and nitrate improves model nitrate fields coupled physical biogeochemical data assimilation as in method 3 joint updates both data types has demonstrated success in a few studies using methods other than enkf anderson et al 2000 ourmières et al 2009 song et al 2016a 2016b mattern et al 2016 here we demonstrate the advantages of method 3 for the enkf our results add that even when physical and biogeochemical observations are assimilated using method 3 updating physical and biogeochemical fields simultaneously with physical observations can result in a bigger improvement in the biogeochemical model state e g see higher forecast skills in tn psurf b chl and tn pall b chln in relative to t psurf b chl and t pall b chln in fig 8c f this is especially true when the available biogeochemical observations are not able to effectively constrain the biased biogeochemical fields i e t psurf b chl where only surface chlorophyll is assimilated to update the biology fails to reduce the increased nitrate variance on temperature surfaces following assimilation of physical data we notice that despite the remarkable improvement in nitrate in methods 2 and 3 runs which assimilate nitrate profiles tb chln and t pall b chln discrepancies between the domain averaged surface phytoplankton figs 2 and 9 in the da runs and the truth remain we attribute these discrepancies to a combination of two factors first the relatively high observation error of 35 for chlorophyll results in more modest denkf updates than a smaller observation error would an uncertainty of 35 is typically used for satellite chlorophyll and has been adopted in several prior assimilation studies e g ciavatta et al 2011 hu et al 2012 our sensitivity experiments show that reducing the chlorophyll observation error could drive surface phytoplankton closer to the truth e g compared b chl 10 with b chl and tb chl 10 with tb chl in fig 2 second we forced the ensemble of free and da runs with phytoplankton initial slopes and zooplankton grazing rate values that are 40 lower than those for the truth in scenario 1 and 40 higher in scenario 2 which act to exacerbate the underestimation or overestimation of productivity the two factors contributing to the bias in phytoplankton estimation in addition to the biased physical fields can also explain the inaccurate zooplankton which is consistently underestimated in scenario 1 and overestimated in scenario 2 improvements could be achieved by applying bias correction methods such as state augmentation to simultaneously estimate and correct biased parameters with the model state variables e g see review in dee 2005 and more recent biogeochemical ocean model applications in simon et al 2015 and gharamti et al 2017a b and will be the focus of future work we would also like to note that in our experiments assimilating ssh and sst alone e g tn psurf is almost as effective as assimilating additional temperature profiles e g tn pall in lifting the depths of the reference isotherm and isopleth of nitrate toward the truth primarily due to the tight correlation between ssh and model interior density and nutrient structures wilson and adamec 2002 it should be noted however that surface heat flux was not included in our model simulations we expect that the performance of assimilating sst to update the thermocline will diminish as surface heat fluxes modify upper water temperatures nevertheless tn pall outperforms tn psurf with clearly lower madall for temperature nitrate and phytoplankton demonstrating the importance of assimilating additional subsurface observations in improving the accuracy of estimated 3d fields beyond the position of the thermocline and nutricline to date satellite chlorophyll sst and ssh observations are the main observation streams for data assimilation due to their excellent spatial and temporal resolution and almost real time accessibility for most regions of the world s oceans fortunately with the rapid expansion of ocean observing platforms profiles of physical and biogeochemical variables from floats and gliders will become more abundant and available for data assimilation to further improve model estimation and prediction 5 conclusions we have assessed the impacts of updating physical and biogeochemical model fields individually versus simultaneously via different assimilation strategies on ocean ecosystem estimation and prediction we found that adjusting the physical or biogeochemical model state alone method 1 isolated updates degrades the tight correlation between temperature and nitrate and is insufficient to improve biogeochemical ocean state and prediction simultaneous multivariate or sequential updates to physical and biogeochemical fields are required to avoid degrading the temperature and nitrate relationship and to strongly improve the biogeochemical model state simultaneous updates can be realized through method 2 multivariate updates single data type by assimilating either physical or biogeochemical observations to update both model fields or method 3 joint updates both data types that sequentially assimilates physical and biogeochemical observations surface chlorophyll is of limited use for improving the 3d model state in our idealized upwelling system even when correcting physical and biogeochemical fields because the correlation between surface chlorophyll and interior nitrate and density structures is weak this highlights the importance of collecting subsurface information for improving biogeochemical ocean model state overall method 3 joint updates both data types outperforms method 2 multivariate updates single data type in terms of

24107,in this study the coupled ocean atmosphere wave and sediment transport coawst modeling system was employed to explore sediment dynamics in the northern gulf of mexico during hurricane gustav in 2008 the performance of the model was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively against in situ and remote sensing measurements respectively after gustav s landfall in coastal louisiana the maximum significant wave heights reached more than 8 m offshore and they decreased quickly as it moved toward the inner shelf where the vertical stratification was largely destroyed alongshore currents were dominant westward on the eastern sector of the hurricane track and offshoreward currents prevailed on the western sector high suspended sediment concentrations 1000 mg l were confined to the inner shelf at surface layers and the simulated high concentrations at the bottom layer extended to the 200 m isobaths the stratification was restored one week after landfall although not fully the asymmetric hurricane winds induced stronger hydrodynamics in the eastern sector which led to severe erosion the calculated suspended sediment flux ssf was convergent to the hurricane center and the maximum ssf was simulated near the south and southeast of the mississippi river delta the averaged post hurricane deposition over the louisiana shelf was 4 0 cm which was 3 2 26 times higher than the annual accumulation rate under normal weather conditions keywords coawst cohesive sediment gulf of mexico sediment flux 1 introduction the mississippi river is the seventh largest river globally in terms of its sediment flux meade and moody 2010 allison et al 2012 where it delivers 115 mt of sediments per year to the northern gulf of mexico ngom the combined high fluvial sediment discharge relatively steady sea level and modest wave and tide energy have resulted in the relatively rapid progradation of the bird foot delta over the past 7500 years coleman et al 1998 xu et al 2011 the deposition of sediments in the mississippi delta has been highly localized and the accumulation rate is in the order of the cm yr level allison et al 2007 osterman et al 2009 the fluvial sediments settled quickly around the delta plain and only a small portion could reach the shelf break in normal conditions dail et al 2007 whereas under severe weather conditions such as tropical cyclones hurricanes the deposited sediments could be resuspended by intensified bottom shear stress and the thickness of the post hurricane deposition could be up to 19 cm goñi et al 2006 the ngom region is hit by hurricanes and tropical storms every 3 years on average keim et al 2007 records of event driven erosion and deposition have been captured based on sediment cores from coastal woodland to shelf break which exhibited upward fining sequences turner et al 2006 goñi et al 2006 2007 dail et al 2007 williams and flanagan 2009 liu et al 2011 radionuclide analysis e g 7be 137cs 234th and 210 pb also indicates that the post hurricane deposition mainly comprised resuspended material from previously deposited sediments and that storm mudflows are capable of exporting sediments out of the delta front corbett et al 2004 allison et al 2005 goñi et al 2006 walsh et al 2006 in addition understanding shelf sediment transport processes during hurricanes is important in terms of coastal engineering and marine ecosystem for example in 1969 the strong storm waves associated with hurricane camille triggered landslides and damaged three oil platforms around the mississippi delta mcadoo et al 2000 more recently the mudslides induced by hurricane ivan 2004 and katrina 2005 caused severe damage to pipelines in the ngom nodine et al 2007 in addition from an ecosystem perspective the high precipitation caused by hurricanes can increase the export of dissolved organic matter and influence the biogeochemical processes and water quality in nearshore areas yoon and raymond 2012 hurricanes can induce dramatic changes in the water level chen et al 2008 sheng et al 2010 surface temperature shay et al 1992 walker et al 2005 vertical structure of the water column zambon et al 2014 and other variables hu and chen 2011 in addition changes in the ocean conditions can affect hurricanes and modulate their intensity and movement bender and ginis 2000 walker et al 2005 liu et al 2011 understanding the hydrodynamics during hurricane events as well as their impacts on sediment dynamics is still very challenging due to the difficulties related to obtaining in situ measurements lapetina and sheng 2015 remote sensing can capture the extension and development of elevated surface suspended sediments walker and hammack 2000 palaseanu lovejoy et al 2013 but the availability and quality of these data are largely compromised by thick clouds and water vapor numerical model is an alternative option for investigating ocean conditions and their impacts on sediment dynamics during hurricane events olabarrieta et al 2012 adapted the coupled ocean atmosphere wave and sediment transport coawst warner et al 2010 modeling system for hurricane ida and nor ida in the gulf of mexico during 2009 where they demonstrated that the asymmetry of the low pressure vortex were influenced mainly by wave induced sea surface roughness the wind speeds and wave heights became smaller due to feedback between the atmosphere and wind waves using parametric wind fields liu et al 2018 adapted a sediment transport model to delft3d lesser et al 2004 and simulated an average 4 cm thick post hurricane deposition in coastal wetlands after the landfall of hurricane gustav in 2008 under driving by wind fields from a parametric hurricane wind model xu et al 2016 adapted the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 haidvogel et al 2008 to the ngom for hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 and found that the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition were influenced by the hurricane tracks bed shear stress grain sizes and bathymetry in this study we employed numerical modeling to investigate the ocean conditions and sediment dynamics in the ngom during hurricane gustav which was the seventh tropical storm and the third hurricane in 2008 gustav first appeared as a tropical wave in the lesser antilles and grew quickly from a tropical depression to a hurricane in less than 12 h beven and kimberlain 2009 gustav reached its peak intensity upon landing in western cuba subsequently it gradually became weaker after entering the gulf of mexico because of increased wind shear and dry air intrusion forbes et al 2010 on september 1 2008 gustav made landfall near cocodrie louisiana as a category 2 hurricane it then decayed into a tropical storm during its slow movement across louisiana forbes et al 2010 using a three way ocean wave atmosphere coupled sediment transport model the objectives of this study were 1 to understand the spatial and temporal extent of the disruption of the hydrodynamics and deltaic deposits on a continental shelf e g the ngom due to land falling hurricane by using gustav as an example 2 to semi quantitatively evaluate the impact of a land falling hurricane on alongshore and cross shore sediment transport and 3 to examine the impacts of hydrodynamic asymmetry along the two sides of a hurricane on the sediment dynamics 2 model setup we adapted

jones 1997 to support variable exchanges between different models in addition coawst provides a comprehensive matlab toolbox to prepare the necessary model inputs e g ocean initial and boundary conditions for the sediment module the community sediment transport modeling system cstms warner et al 2008 was integrated into the ocean model the sediment routines employed multiple algorithms to simulate suspended sediment transport and bed load transport and the incorporated seabed modules could track the stratigraphy morphology and seabed consolidation warner et al 2010 in this study we conducted an 11 day three way roms swan wrf coupled sediment transport simulation of hurricane gustav august 30 september 9 2008 details of the model setup are described in the following 2 1 ocean sediment transport model roms cstms the ocean model domain covered the entire gulf of mexico at a 5 km horizontal resolution we focused on the ngom region where the riverine and deltaic deposition is most abundant fig 1 vertically there were 36 terrain following sigma layers for an open boundary the orlanski type radiation condition was imposed combined with temperature and salinity nudging toward the hybrid coordinate ocean model solutions hycom ncoda glbu0 08 https hycom org 1 12 resolution chassignet et al 2003 a gradient boundary condition was applied to sediment tracers and the sea free surface depth averaged current velocity boundary conditions were specified according to flather 1976 tidal forcing was derived from the oregon state university osu tidal inversion software otis regional tidal solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 initial conditions sea level hydrodynamics temperature and salinity were extracted from the hycom reanalysis for august 30 2008 water discharge and sediment concentration data for 39 rivers were retrieved from usgs gages http nwis waterdata usgs gov and specified at the land ocean boundary the temperature field was nudged to the hycom derived climatology every three days to provide a better bottom boundary condition for the atmospheric model for the sediment model cstms we defined two cohesive and one non cohesive sediment class for river

usseabed project buczkowski 2006 fig 2 to achieve an equilibrium initial condition for sediment fields we first performed a two way coupled swan roms with cstms simulation starting from january 1 1993 and then extracted the model output on august 30 2008 as the initial sediment condition more details of the model setup are given in supplementary files the sediment model was parameterized according to two previous ngom sediment modeling studies by xu et al 2011 2016 table 1 considering the high percentage of cohesive particles in the study region and intensive seafloor scour during hurricanes balsam and beeson 2003 ellwood et al 2006 dail et al 2007 teague et al 2007 turner et al 2007 we set 40 sediment layers with a total thickness of 1 m 2 5 cm for each to resolve the sediment bed variability we applied the cohesive algorithm so the critical shear stress of the sediment layers increased downward by following an asymptotic line to represent the effect of self weight consolidation parchure and mehta 1985 rinehimer et al 2008 the equilibrium critical shear stress profile was designed as follows 1 τ c r k e x p log m k 1 t c r o f f t c r s l p where τ cr k is the bed critical shear stress in layer k m k 1 is the total bed mass from the top sediment layer to layer k 1 and t c r o f f and t c r s l p are unitless constants we constructed the τ cr k profile according to rinehimer et al 2008 in order to represent sediment resuspension see fig 3 2 2 wave model swan the swan model was employed to simulate the wind wave generation and propagation processes swan is based on a eulerian formulation of the discrete spectral balance of action density that accounts for refractive propagation over arbitrary wind and current fields booij et al 1999 chen et al 2005 in our simulations the swan model shared the same grid as the roms model and its surface wind was fed by the atmospheric model the ratio of the maximum individual wave height relative to the depth was 0 73 and the proportionality coefficient of the rate of dissipation was 1 0 bottom friction was calculated using the formulations given by madsen et al 1988 2 3 atmospheric model wrf wrf arw core version 3 7 1 was employed to represent atmospheric conditions skamarock et al 2005 the wrf grid dimension was 429 by 429 with 6 km horizontal resolution fig 1 the single moment six class microphysics scheme was implemented which features water vapor cloud water cloud ice rain snow and graupel hong and lim 2006 the rapid radiative transfer model for general circulation models rrtmg shortwave and longwave schemes iacono et al 2008 was employed to compute the longwave and shortwave radiation physics where it was called every 6 min on the grid the eta similarity scheme janjic 2002 and unified noah land surface model tewari et al 2004 were selected the wrf model was initialized using the 1 global forecasting system http www emc ncep noaa gov gfs developed by the national centers

formed and balanced with other fields after initialization the era interim atmospheric model result era interim https www ecmwf int en research climate reanalysis era interim was applied as the boundary condition no nudging or data assimilation was used in the three way coupled simulation 2 4 model coupling model coupling and interpolation were performed using mct and scrip as part of the coawst model in our setup roms sent the sea surface temperature to wrf and the sea surface height ssh and vertically averaged currents to swan our simulation employed a wave current bottom boundary layer model ssw bbl madsen 1994 which considered the effect of wave enhanced bottom stress on the momentum bottom boundary condition for the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the bottom roughness comprised the sum of the grain roughness sediment transport roughness and bedform roughness wrf and swan then sent the atmospheric forcing heat flux and sea surface stress and sea surface wave parameters e g significant wave height wavelength relative peak period and dissipation energy to roms surface winds from wrf were used by swan to calculate the significant wave height and wave period which were then used to estimate the sea surface roughness in wrf taylor and yelland 2001 the sediment concentration was not included in the water density equation morphological changes due to sediment were not considered in order to avoid instability in our model exchanges of the variables among the three models occurred at an interval of 600 s we designed several experiments to verify the sensitivity of the model to wave current interactions during the hurricane simulation including the three dimensional vortex force and the bernoulli head wave breaking induced accelerations and turbulence injection and wave enhanced vertical viscosity mixing uchiyama et al 2010 olabarrieta et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 the wind speed significant wave height and water level were evaluated quantitatively in each test based on the willmott model skill willmott 1982 and the results did not indicate any substantial differences model skill difference 0 01 when wave current interactions were included in addition we conducted a domain wide comparison of the current speed significant wave heights and suspended sediment concentrations ssc and only found very trivial differences the limited effect of wave current interactions may be attributed to the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the coastal area where wave driven littoral currents and undertows were most salient this study focused mainly on the sediment dynamics on the ngom shelf so our analysis was based on the results from the benchmark run where the aforementioned wave current interaction processes were not incorporated 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration we compared the outputs of the three models against observations to evaluate the performance of our hurricane simulation as shown in fig 4 the model simulated hurricane track agreed well with the observed track the model simulated track diverted slightly to the west after september 1 and it resulted in a westward shift of the landfall location by 30 km the model s simulations of the wind speed air pressure significant wave height and sea level captured the observed variations at the national data buoy center buoy stations and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa tidal gauges see fig 1 for the locations of the tidal gauges and buoy stations during the hurricane the data correlation coefficients for the model observation comparison ranged from 0 81 to 0 98 as gustav approached the wind speed fig 5 a b and c and significant wave height fig 5d e and f increased sharply whereas the air pressure dropped substantially fig 5g h and i changes in the sea level were largely localized depending on the quadrant relative to the hurricane at stations 8 735 180 and 8 727 520 to the east of the hurricane track the sea level increased by 0 5 1 1 m during the passage of the hurricane fig 5k and l and a higher frequency signal was found at station 8 772 447 to the west of the hurricane fig 5j the good agreement between the model and observations allowed us to be confident that the coupled model was capable of reproducing hurricane induced changes in the ocean conditions no in situ ssc measurements were available during gustav so we qualitatively compared the surface ssc simulated by the model with a partially cloud free modis terra image obtained at 16 30 00 utc on september 2 2008 fig 6 no quantitative comparison was conducted because attempts to derive ssc from the modis images failed due to their poor quality we analyzed a large amount of satellite raw data and the image in fig 6 had the best quality the model and satellite image indicated high turbidity in the waters west of the bird foot delta the ssc decreased sharply toward the outer shelf in the south compared with the modis image the extension of the ssc simulated using the model was more widespread we attributed this discrepancy to 1 the availability of satellite data only one snap shot was available which may or may not have represented the in situ conditions for a relatively long period e g up to hours 2 the sensitivity of the model to different parameters especially the settling velocity which requires further study nevertheless our model was capable of capturing the southeastward sediment plume along the southern limit of the high turbid water in addition the storm layer thickness simulated by the model was comparable to that reported in previous studies where it was usually less than 20 cm keen et al 2004 allison et al 2005 goñi et al 2006 2007 palinkas et al 2013 xu et al 2016 3 2 ocean conditions and suspended sediment distributions the simulated wind speed reached more than 40 m s when gustav made landfall the wind direction varied substantially in different quadrants relative to the vortex northerly wind to the west and southerly wind to the east fig 7 a the wind speed decreased sharply after moving away from the center of the vortex the maximum wave height occurred to the east of the hurricane track where it reached more than 8 m fig 7a in coastal areas water depths 20 m the wave heights dropped sharply to less than 2 5 m even in the presence of strong winds 35 m s fig 7a this pattern was very similar to that reported by stone et al 1995 and xu et al 2016 which could be explained by the peak wave energy dissipation around the 25 30 m contours on the mississippi river subaqueous delta previous studies reported a positive correlation between wave dissipation and sediment resuspension during hurricane events which would be further strengthened in the mississippi delta due to the soft and muddy seafloor sheremet et al 2005 elgar and raubenheimer 2008 the currents exhibited great spatial variability in different quadrants relative to the hurricane track during strong winds fig 7b alongshelf currents were prevalent to the east of the track and they flowed toward the west the speed of these alongshelf currents could be up to 2 1 m s fig 7b by contrast to the west the currents turned to a south and southeastward offshoreward direction with a speed of 1 2 m s strong bottom shear stress 6 pa was found near the bird foot delta where the water depth was shallower than 50 m fig 7b during gustav the highest simulated ssc reached 10 000 mg l in both the surface and bottom layers on the shelf the spatial limits of high turbidity water ssc 1000 mg l largely followed the 50 m isobaths at the surface layer and 200 m isobaths for the bottom layer figs 7c and 7d the distribution of the high surface ssc matched that of the strong bottom shear stress while high bottom ssc was prevalent especially over the shelf between 89 w and 93 w we calculated the temporal variation in the spatial ngom averaged bottom shear stress induced by currents and waves and the total bed thickness the wave and current induced bottom shear stresses increased dramatically after september 1 and reached their peak values 0 64 n m2 and 0 20 n m2 respectively when gustav made landfall subsequently the bottom shear stress recovered to normal conditions within 2 days the maximum spatial averaged erosion depth in the ngom was 2 cm and 50 of the resuspended sediments settled back to the seabed by around 10 00 00 utc on september 3 fig 8 after 60 h more the percentage reached 80 on september 9 90 of the resuspended sediments had returned to the seabed soon after another major hurricane called ike entered the ngom and made landfall in texas on september 13 2008 3 3 variations in vertical structure during gustav the wind speed and wave height began to increase from 00 00 00 utc on august 31 before reaching their peak values around 16 00 00 utc on september 1 and then returning to normal conditions around 00 00 00 utc on september 9 fig 5 we extracted the temperature salinity and ssc fields along the 50 m isobath transect the position is shown in fig 1b at these three times to plot their vertical structures in the pre during and post hurricane stages respectively fig 9 we used the brunt väisälä frequency bvf to estimate the intensity and depth of the pycnocline fig 9 the mean bvf at a given depth n is given by 2 n g ρ d ρ d z where g 9 81 m s2 is the acceleration due to gravity ρ is the spatial mean potential density of the water along the 50 m isobath transect at a certain depth and d ρ d z is the vertical potential density gradient we excluded water density variations due to ssc and the estimated bvf only represented the vertical stratification induced by the water itself and not by the water sediment mixture as shown in fig 9a before the landfall of gustav the water was well stratified and the temperature dropped gradually with the depth from 32 c to 20 c the water temperature was low 25 c near the southwest pass of the mississippi delta which connects to the shelf water through a submarine canyon the salinity increased with depth where it ranged from 26 to 38 psu fig 9d low salinity water was found mostly around the mississippi river mouth due to the large input of freshwater high ssc 100 mg l was simulated at the bottom close to the mississippi river mouth fig 9g bvf calculations identified a strong pycnocline in the sub surface layer 7 m below surface fig 10 another salient density stratification with higher intensity was detected near the bottom the transect averaged ssc was maximized at the bottom with a magnitude of 100 mg l after the landing of gustav the transect averaged temperature decreased by 2 c 9b stratification was largely destroyed due to strong vertical mixing fig 9e the only exception was at the west end 150 km away from the landing site freshwater from the atchafalaya bay flushed offshore and generated a low salinity transect which was 150 km wide and 40 m deep fig 9e walker 2001 ssc increased dramatically with the hurricane s passage and reached more than 1000 mg l in the water column figs 9h and 10 compared with the pre hurricane stage the sub surface pycnocline was thoroughly destroyed whereas the strength of the near bottom density stratification remained largely unchanged fig 10 the ssc profile exhibited limited vertical variation with a mean value of 830 mg l throughout the water column one week after gustav landed 00 00 00 utc september 9 the sea surface temperature had not recovered from the hurricane induced cooling fig 9c the low salinity river plume near the mississippi river s southwest pass could be identified again fig 9f the surface ssc decreased dramatically after gustav landed but a higher ssc remained at the bottom than that in the pre hurricane stage fig 9i a weak sub surface pycnocline was found and the transect averaged ssc decreased throughout the water column although it was still higher than that in the pre hurricane stage fig 10 the sediment and temperature were still different from those in the pre hurricane stage but more than 90 of the resuspended sediments had already settled on the seabed before another hurricane called ike 2008 entered the gulf of mexico and induced another round of resuspension therefore the post hurricane condition in this study did not represent 100 restoration 3 4 asymmetric transport during the hurricane highly intensified short term events e g hurricanes floods and winter storms are capable of substantially disrupting shelf deposition liu and fearn 1993 turner et al 2006 a unique feature of hurricane induced sediment transport is the asymmetry on different sides of the vortex during hurricanes the highest wind speed is found to the right of the track price 1981 xie et al 2011 uhlhorn et al 2014 which leads to an asymmetric pattern in the hydrodynamics including strong currents and waves in a shoreward direction to the right but relatively weak winds currents and waves to the left the current fields in fig 7b illustrate the offshore southward southeastward currents from atchafalaya bay after joining together with the strong alongshore currents from the eastern coastal louisiana where they moved southeastward continuously into the open gulf the highly intensified alongshore and offshore currents were capable of transporting large amounts of sediment far from where they originally deposited wave current interactions were not considered in this study but previous studies have highlighted the importance of wave induced littoral currents and undertows as well as their effects on sediment transport uchiyama et al 2010 stated that the littoral currents caused by wave breaking are maximized near the topographic bar and that the sediment transport induced by wave current interactions in coastal regions is important for sandbar migration hoefel and elgar 2003 hsu et al 2006 olabarrieta et al 2011 found that the wave generated current patterns varied greatly in the inlet zone in addition wave current interactions have critical effects on the horizontal and vertical structure of fresh water plumes which is important for coastal sedimentation rong et al 2014 in order to examine this asymmetric pattern as well as its impact on sediment transport we grouped and averaged the modeling results according to their sides relative to the track after gustav s landfall 16 00 00 utc september 1 fig 11 waves play a vital role in sediment resuspension during the shoaling of a hurricane thornton and guza 1983 miles et al 2015 the maximum significant wave heights 7 m simulated by the model occurred in the eastern sector figs 7a and 11b due to the strong winds and shoreward wave piling up figs 7a and 11a at the vortex center the wave height dropped to less than 2 m with a greatly reduced wind speed 15 m s fig 11a and b by contrast the surface currents were greatly intensified in the center of the vortex and they were generally stronger on the east side 0 6 1 3 m s than the west side 0 2 1 3 m s fig 11c several studies have emphasized that the sediment transport during hurricanes is mainly due to resuspension caused by increased bottom shear stress ogston and sternberg 1999 keen and glenn 2002 miles et al 2015 according to our simulation the bottom shear stress induced by waves was higher than that by currents where it reached 3 6 pa to the east both the wave and current induced shear stresses increased near the center of the vortex due to the strong hydrodynamics and relatively small water depth fig 11d e and f the high shear stress to the east led to high ssc and severe erosion figs 7b d 11g and h the maximum erosion was 0 13 m in the eastern sector and the ssc in both the surface and bottom layers peaked at the same location 15 2 and 12 0 g l respectively the spatial distribution pattern confirmed that the previously deposited sediments were the main source of the high ssc during the hurricane 3 5 suspended sediment flux ssf to assess the ssf during gustav we calculated the depth integrated and time averaged august 30 september 9 2008 ssf using the velocity and ssc as follows 3 s s f i 1 n s s c i u i h i where ssf is the suspended sediment flux unit kg m s ssci and ui are the ssc unit g l and current speed unit m s in the i th layers respectively n is the number of vertical layers 36 in this study and h represents the thickness of each layer unit m the ssf was along the coastline and convergent along the inner shelf to the west of the hurricane track the ssf was higher to the right of the track than the left mainly due to the high ssc around the delta fig 12 the maximum ssf was located to the south and southeast of the mississippi river delta where it reached 11 kg m s erosion deposition and sediment transport mainly occurred over the inner shelf 50 m fig 12 as the water depth increased to 200 m the net erosion deposition became trivial 1 cm thereby indicating that offshore sediment transport out of the shelf was limited in contrast to the results obtained by xu et al 2016 for katrina and rita in 2005 gustav induced less offshore transport to deep water 200 m strong offshore ssf was simulated over the wide and gentle continental shelf south and southwest off the mississippi river delta the ssf kept decreasing until the shelf break was reached a depo center with a thickness of 14 cm was simulated to the southwest of the hurricane track two sources were identified for this hurricane driven deposition comprising sediments eroded from 1 the south of the mississippi river delta and 2 the broad louisiana texas shelf in the northwest according to our ssf estimation the first source deltaic provided more sediment because 1 sufficient material was deposited near the delta lobe and 2 energetic ocean conditions to the right of the hurricane track another depo center was found southeast of the mississippi river delta between the 50 m and 200 m isobaths this elongated deposition was formed by the offshore transport of sediments from the inner shelf however we advise caution as both the ssf and post hurricane deposition estimations were relatively conservative because 10 of the gustav induced resuspension was still present in the water column fig 8 the approach of hurricane ike made it very difficult to estimate the total ssf induced by gustav previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of the fluvial sediments will settle over the inner shelf and offshore transport is limited under normal conditions e g xu et al 2011 during hurricane events such as karina and rita in 2005 the hurricane driven accumulation can be five times larger than the annual sediment supply from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers and even 10 times greater compared with the annual long term accumulation during non storm periods goñi et al 2007 based on our simulation the mean post hurricane deposition in coastal louisiana water depth 100 m was 4 0 cm which was 3 2 to 26 times of the 210pb derived annual accumulated thickness 0 15 1 24 cm osterman et al 2009 4 conclusions in this study we adapted the coawst modeling system to the gulf of mexico to study the variations in the ocean conditions and sediment dynamics during hurricane gustav in 2008 the favorable model data comparisons obtained including the sea level significant wave height wind speed air pressure and surface sediment distribution confirmed the feasibility of using a coupled model to investigate physical and sedimentary conditions during a hurricane event water stratification on the inner shelf was completely destroyed by vertical mixing after gustav s landfall large amounts of sediments were remobilized and brought to the surface layer 1000 mg l eight days after landfall sub surface stratification appeared again but its intensity was less than that before gustav landed the hydrodynamics exhibited great spatial variability due to the asymmetric wind field stronger bottom shear stress and currents in the eastern sector resulted in massive sediment resuspension and transport severe seabed erosion strong bottom shear stress and high ssc were found where the peak wave energy dissipation rate occurred the calculated ssf reached 11 kg m s during the hurricane s passage and the direction of the ssf was convergent to the vortex center the post hurricane deposition rate was 3 2 26 times of that during normal ocean conditions two depo centers were simulated with a maximum thickness of 14 cm after the passage of hurricane gustav acknowledgments research support

24107,in this study the coupled ocean atmosphere wave and sediment transport coawst modeling system was employed to explore sediment dynamics in the northern gulf of mexico during hurricane gustav in 2008 the performance of the model was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively against in situ and remote sensing measurements respectively after gustav s landfall in coastal louisiana the maximum significant wave heights reached more than 8 m offshore and they decreased quickly as it moved toward the inner shelf where the vertical stratification was largely destroyed alongshore currents were dominant westward on the eastern sector of the hurricane track and offshoreward currents prevailed on the western sector high suspended sediment concentrations 1000 mg l were confined to the inner shelf at surface layers and the simulated high concentrations at the bottom layer extended to the 200 m isobaths the stratification was restored one week after landfall although not fully the asymmetric hurricane winds induced stronger hydrodynamics in the eastern sector which led to severe erosion the calculated suspended sediment flux ssf was convergent to the hurricane center and the maximum ssf was simulated near the south and southeast of the mississippi river delta the averaged post hurricane deposition over the louisiana shelf was 4 0 cm which was 3 2 26 times higher than the annual accumulation rate under normal weather conditions keywords coawst cohesive sediment gulf of mexico sediment flux 1 introduction the mississippi river is the seventh largest river globally in terms of its sediment flux meade and moody 2010 allison et al 2012 where it delivers 115 mt of sediments per year to the northern gulf of mexico ngom the combined high fluvial sediment discharge relatively steady sea level and modest wave and tide energy have resulted in the relatively rapid progradation of the bird foot delta over the past 7500 years coleman et al 1998 xu et al 2011 the deposition of sediments in the mississippi delta has been highly localized and the accumulation rate is in the order of the cm yr level allison et al 2007 osterman et al 2009 the fluvial sediments settled quickly around the delta plain and only a small portion could reach the shelf break in normal conditions dail et al 2007 whereas under severe weather conditions such as tropical cyclones hurricanes the deposited sediments could be resuspended by intensified bottom shear stress and the thickness of the post hurricane deposition could be up to 19 cm goñi et al 2006 the ngom region is hit by hurricanes and tropical storms every 3 years on average keim et al 2007 records of event driven erosion and deposition have been captured based on sediment cores from coastal woodland to shelf break which exhibited upward fining sequences turner et al 2006 goñi et al 2006 2007 dail et al 2007 williams and flanagan 2009 liu et al 2011 radionuclide analysis e g 7be 137cs 234th and 210 pb also indicates that the post hurricane deposition mainly comprised resuspended material from previously deposited sediments and that storm mudflows are capable of exporting sediments out of the delta front corbett et al 2004 allison et al 2005 goñi et al 2006 walsh et al 2006 in addition understanding shelf sediment transport processes during hurricanes is important in terms of coastal engineering and marine ecosystem for example in 1969 the strong storm waves associated with hurricane camille triggered landslides and damaged three oil platforms around the mississippi delta mcadoo et al 2000 more recently the mudslides induced by hurricane ivan 2004 and katrina 2005 caused severe damage to pipelines in the ngom nodine et al 2007 in addition from an ecosystem perspective the high precipitation caused by hurricanes can increase the export of dissolved organic matter and influence the biogeochemical processes and water quality in nearshore areas yoon and raymond 2012 hurricanes can induce dramatic changes in the water level chen et al 2008 sheng et al 2010 surface temperature shay et al 1992 walker et al 2005 vertical structure of the water column zambon et al 2014 and other variables hu and chen 2011 in addition changes in the ocean conditions can affect hurricanes and modulate their intensity and movement bender and ginis 2000 walker et al 2005 liu et al 2011 understanding the hydrodynamics during hurricane events as well as their impacts on sediment dynamics is still very challenging due to the difficulties related to obtaining in situ measurements lapetina and sheng 2015 remote sensing can capture the extension and development of elevated surface suspended sediments walker and hammack 2000 palaseanu lovejoy et al 2013 but the availability and quality of these data are largely compromised by thick clouds and water vapor numerical model is an alternative option for investigating ocean conditions and their impacts on sediment dynamics during hurricane events olabarrieta et al 2012 adapted the coupled ocean atmosphere wave and sediment transport coawst warner et al 2010 modeling system for hurricane ida and nor ida in the gulf of mexico during 2009 where they demonstrated that the asymmetry of the low pressure vortex were influenced mainly by wave induced sea surface roughness the wind speeds and wave heights became smaller due to feedback between the atmosphere and wind waves using parametric wind fields liu et al 2018 adapted a sediment transport model to delft3d lesser et al 2004 and simulated an average 4 cm thick post hurricane deposition in coastal wetlands after the landfall of hurricane gustav in 2008 under driving by wind fields from a parametric hurricane wind model xu et al 2016 adapted the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 haidvogel et al 2008 to the ngom for hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 and found that the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition were influenced by the hurricane tracks bed shear stress grain sizes and bathymetry in this study we employed numerical modeling to investigate the ocean conditions and sediment dynamics in the ngom during hurricane gustav which was the seventh tropical storm and the third hurricane in 2008 gustav first appeared as a tropical wave in the lesser antilles and grew quickly from a tropical depression to a hurricane in less than 12 h beven and kimberlain 2009 gustav reached its peak intensity upon landing in western cuba subsequently it gradually became weaker after entering the gulf of mexico because of increased wind shear and dry air intrusion forbes et al 2010 on september 1 2008 gustav made landfall near cocodrie louisiana as a category 2 hurricane it then decayed into a tropical storm during its slow movement across louisiana forbes et al 2010 using a three way ocean wave atmosphere coupled sediment transport model the objectives of this study were 1 to understand the spatial and temporal extent of the disruption of the hydrodynamics and deltaic deposits on a continental shelf e g the ngom due to land falling hurricane by using gustav as an example 2 to semi quantitatively evaluate the impact of a land falling hurricane on alongshore and cross shore sediment transport and 3 to examine the impacts of hydrodynamic asymmetry along the two sides of a hurricane on the sediment dynamics 2 model setup we adapted the open source coawst model warner et al 2008 and 2010 https woodshole er usgs gov operations modeling coawst to the gulf of mexico waters fig 1 coawst is an open source community model that incorporates three state of the art numerical models the weather research and forecasting model wrf v 3 7 1 skamarock et al 2005 roms svn 797 haidvogel et al 2008 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and

jones 1997 to support variable exchanges between different models in addition coawst provides a comprehensive matlab toolbox to prepare the necessary model inputs e g ocean initial and boundary conditions for the sediment module the community sediment transport modeling system cstms warner et al 2008 was integrated into the ocean model the sediment routines employed multiple algorithms to simulate suspended sediment transport and bed load transport and the incorporated seabed modules could track the stratigraphy morphology and seabed consolidation warner et al 2010 in this study we conducted an 11 day three way roms swan wrf coupled sediment transport simulation of hurricane gustav august 30 september 9 2008 details of the model setup are described in the following 2 1 ocean sediment transport model roms cstms the ocean model domain covered the entire gulf of mexico at a 5 km horizontal resolution we focused on the ngom region where the riverine and deltaic deposition is most abundant fig 1 vertically there were 36 terrain following sigma layers for an open boundary the orlanski type radiation condition was imposed combined with temperature and salinity nudging toward the hybrid coordinate ocean model solutions hycom ncoda glbu0 08 https hycom org 1 12 resolution chassignet et al 2003 a gradient boundary condition was applied to sediment tracers and the sea free surface depth averaged current velocity boundary conditions were specified according to flather 1976 tidal forcing was derived from the oregon state university osu tidal inversion software otis regional tidal solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 initial conditions sea level hydrodynamics temperature and salinity were extracted from the hycom reanalysis for august 30 2008 water discharge and sediment concentration data for 39 rivers were retrieved from usgs gages http nwis waterdata usgs gov and specified at the land ocean boundary the temperature field was nudged to the hycom derived

input and the percentage of each component was based on measurements by mickey et al 2015 sediment fractions on the seabed were extracted from historical surficial grain size data provided by the usseabed project buczkowski 2006 fig 2 to achieve an equilibrium initial condition for sediment fields we first performed a two way coupled swan roms with cstms simulation starting from january 1 1993 and then extracted the model output on august 30 2008 as the initial sediment condition more details of the model setup are given in supplementary files the sediment model was parameterized according to two previous ngom sediment modeling studies by xu et al 2011 2016 table 1 considering the high percentage of cohesive particles in the study region and intensive seafloor scour during hurricanes balsam and beeson 2003 ellwood et al 2006 dail et al 2007 teague et al 2007 turner et al 2007 we set 40 sediment layers with a total thickness of 1 m 2 5 cm for each to resolve the sediment bed variability we applied the cohesive algorithm so the critical shear stress of the sediment layers increased downward by following an asymptotic line to represent the effect of self weight consolidation parchure and mehta 1985 rinehimer et al 2008 the equilibrium critical shear stress profile was designed as follows 1 τ c r k e x p log m k 1 t c r o f f t c r s l p where τ cr k is the bed critical shear stress in layer k m k 1 is the total bed mass from the top sediment layer to layer k 1 and t c r o f f and t c r s l p are unitless constants we constructed the τ cr k profile according to rinehimer et al 2008 in order to represent sediment resuspension see fig 3 2 2 wave model swan the swan model was employed to simulate the wind wave generation and propagation processes swan is based on a eulerian formulation of the discrete spectral balance of action density that accounts for refractive propagation over arbitrary wind and current fields booij et al 1999 chen et al 2005 in our simulations the swan model shared the same grid as the roms model and its surface wind was fed by the atmospheric model the ratio of the maximum individual wave height relative to the depth was 0 73 and the proportionality coefficient of the rate of dissipation was 1 0 bottom friction was calculated using the formulations given by madsen et al 1988 2 3 atmospheric model wrf wrf arw core version 3 7 1 was employed to represent atmospheric conditions skamarock et al 2005 the wrf grid dimension was 429 by 429 with 6 km horizontal resolution fig 1 the single moment six class microphysics scheme was implemented which features water vapor cloud water cloud ice rain snow and graupel hong and lim 2006 the rapid radiative transfer model for general circulation models rrtmg shortwave and longwave schemes iacono et al 2008 was employed to compute the longwave and shortwave radiation physics where it was called every 6 min on the grid the eta similarity scheme janjic 2002 and unified noah land surface model tewari et al 2004 were selected the wrf model was initialized using the 1 global forecasting system http www emc ncep noaa gov gfs developed by the national centers for environmental prediction http www ncep noaa gov to obtain satisfactory initial conditions we ran wrf alone starting at 00 00 00 utc august 29 after spin up for 24 h the tropical cyclone was well formed and balanced with other fields after initialization the era interim atmospheric model result era interim https www ecmwf int en research climate reanalysis era interim was applied as the boundary condition no nudging or data assimilation was used in the three way coupled simulation 2 4 model coupling model coupling and interpolation were performed using mct and scrip as part of the coawst model in our setup roms sent the sea surface temperature to wrf and the sea surface height ssh and vertically averaged currents to swan our simulation employed a wave current bottom boundary layer model ssw bbl madsen 1994 which considered the effect of wave enhanced bottom stress on the momentum bottom boundary condition for the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the bottom roughness comprised the sum of the grain roughness sediment transport roughness and bedform roughness wrf and swan then sent the atmospheric forcing heat flux and sea surface stress and sea surface wave parameters e g significant wave height wavelength relative peak period and dissipation energy to roms surface winds from wrf were used by swan to calculate the significant wave height and wave period which were then used to estimate the sea surface roughness in wrf taylor and yelland 2001 the sediment concentration was not included in the water density equation morphological changes due to sediment were not considered in order to avoid instability in our model exchanges of the variables among the three models occurred at an interval of 600 s we designed several experiments to verify the sensitivity of the model to wave current interactions during the hurricane simulation including the three dimensional vortex force and the bernoulli head wave breaking induced accelerations and turbulence injection and wave enhanced vertical viscosity mixing uchiyama et al 2010 olabarrieta et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 the wind speed significant wave height and water level were evaluated quantitatively in each test based on the willmott model skill willmott 1982 and the results did not indicate any substantial differences model skill difference 0 01 when wave current interactions were included in addition we conducted a domain wide comparison of the current speed significant wave heights and suspended sediment concentrations ssc and only found very trivial differences the limited effect of wave current interactions may be attributed to the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the coastal area where wave driven littoral currents and undertows were most salient this study focused mainly on the sediment dynamics on the ngom shelf so our analysis was based on the results from the benchmark run where the aforementioned wave current interaction processes were not incorporated 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration we compared the outputs of the three models against observations to evaluate the performance of our hurricane simulation as shown in fig 4 the model simulated hurricane track agreed well with the observed track the model simulated track diverted slightly to the west after september 1 and it resulted in a westward shift of the landfall location by 30 km the model s simulations of the wind speed air pressure significant wave height and sea level captured the observed variations at the national data buoy center buoy stations and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa tidal gauges see fig 1 for the locations of the tidal gauges and buoy stations during the hurricane the data correlation coefficients for the model observation comparison ranged from 0 81 to 0 98 as gustav approached the wind speed fig 5 a b and c and significant wave height fig 5d e and f increased sharply whereas the air pressure dropped substantially fig 5g h and i changes in the sea level were largely localized depending on the quadrant relative to the hurricane at stations 8 735 180 and 8 727 520 to the east of the hurricane track the sea level increased by 0 5 1 1 m during the passage of the hurricane fig 5k and l and a higher frequency signal was found at station 8 772 447 to the west of the hurricane fig 5j the good agreement between the model and observations allowed us to be confident that the coupled model was capable of reproducing hurricane induced changes in the ocean conditions no in situ ssc measurements were available during gustav so we qualitatively compared the surface ssc simulated by the model with a partially cloud free modis terra image obtained at 16 30 00 utc on september 2 2008 fig 6 no quantitative comparison was conducted because attempts to derive ssc from the modis images failed due to their poor quality we analyzed a large amount of satellite raw data and the image in fig 6 had the best quality the model and satellite image indicated high turbidity in the waters west of the bird foot delta the ssc decreased sharply toward the outer shelf in the south compared with the modis image the extension of the ssc simulated using the model was more widespread we attributed this discrepancy to 1 the availability of satellite data only one snap shot was available which may or may not have represented the in situ conditions for a relatively long period e g up to hours 2 the sensitivity of the model to different parameters especially the settling velocity which requires further study nevertheless our model was capable of capturing the southeastward sediment plume along the southern limit of the high turbid water in addition the storm layer thickness simulated by the model was comparable to that reported in previous studies where it was usually less than 20 cm keen et al 2004 allison et al 2005 goñi et al 2006 2007 palinkas et al 2013 xu et al 2016 3 2 ocean conditions and suspended sediment distributions the simulated wind speed reached more than 40 m s when gustav made landfall the wind direction varied substantially in different quadrants relative to the vortex northerly wind to the west and southerly wind to the east fig 7 a the wind speed decreased sharply after moving away from the center of the vortex the maximum wave height occurred to the east of the hurricane track where it reached more than 8 m fig 7a in coastal areas water depths 20 m the wave heights dropped sharply to less than 2 5 m even in the presence of strong winds 35 m s fig 7a this pattern was very similar to that reported by stone et al 1995 and xu et al 2016 which could be explained by the peak wave energy dissipation around the 25 30 m contours on the mississippi river subaqueous delta previous studies reported a positive correlation between wave dissipation and sediment resuspension during hurricane events which would be further strengthened in the mississippi delta due to the soft and muddy seafloor sheremet et al 2005 elgar and raubenheimer 2008 the currents exhibited great spatial variability in different quadrants relative to the hurricane track during strong winds fig 7b alongshelf currents were prevalent to the east of the track and they flowed toward the west the speed of these alongshelf currents could be up to 2 1 m s fig 7b by contrast to the west the currents turned to a south and southeastward offshoreward direction with a speed of 1 2 m s strong bottom shear stress 6 pa was found near the bird foot delta where the water depth was shallower than 50 m fig 7b during gustav the highest simulated ssc reached 10 000 mg l in both the surface and bottom layers on the shelf the spatial limits of high turbidity water ssc 1000 mg l largely followed the 50 m isobaths at the surface layer and 200 m isobaths for the bottom layer figs 7c and 7d the distribution of the high surface ssc matched that of the strong bottom shear stress while high bottom ssc was prevalent especially over the shelf between 89 w and 93 w we calculated the temporal variation in the spatial ngom averaged bottom shear stress induced by currents and waves and the total bed thickness the wave and current induced bottom shear stresses increased dramatically after september 1 and reached their peak values 0 64 n m2 and 0 20 n m2 respectively when gustav made landfall subsequently the bottom shear stress recovered to normal conditions within 2 days the maximum spatial averaged erosion depth in the ngom was 2 cm and 50 of the resuspended sediments settled back to the seabed by around 10 00 00 utc on september 3 fig 8 after 60 h more the percentage reached 80 on september 9 90 of the resuspended sediments had returned to the seabed soon after another major hurricane called ike entered the ngom and made landfall in texas on september 13 2008 3 3 variations in vertical structure during gustav the wind speed and wave height began to increase from 00 00 00 utc on august 31 before reaching their peak values around 16 00 00 utc on september 1 and then returning to normal conditions around 00 00 00 utc on september 9 fig 5 we extracted the temperature salinity and ssc fields along the 50 m isobath transect the position is shown in fig 1b at these three times to plot their vertical structures in the pre during and post hurricane stages respectively fig 9 we used the brunt väisälä frequency bvf to estimate the intensity and depth of the pycnocline fig 9 the mean bvf at a given depth n is given by 2 n g ρ d ρ d z where g 9 81 m s2 is the acceleration due to gravity ρ is the spatial mean potential density of the water along the 50 m isobath transect at a certain depth and d ρ d z is the vertical potential density gradient we excluded water density variations due to ssc and the estimated bvf only represented the vertical stratification induced by the water itself and not by the water sediment mixture as shown in fig 9a before the landfall of gustav the water was well stratified and the temperature dropped gradually with the depth from 32 c to 20 c the water temperature was low 25 c near the southwest pass of the mississippi delta which connects to the shelf water through a submarine canyon the salinity increased with depth where it ranged from 26 to 38 psu fig 9d low salinity water was found mostly around the mississippi river mouth due to the large input of freshwater high ssc 100 mg l was simulated at the bottom close to the mississippi river mouth fig 9g bvf calculations identified a strong pycnocline in the sub surface layer 7 m below surface fig 10 another salient density stratification with higher intensity was detected near the bottom the transect averaged ssc was maximized at the bottom with a magnitude of 100 mg l after the landing of gustav the transect averaged temperature decreased by 2 c 9b stratification was largely destroyed due to strong vertical mixing fig 9e the only exception was at the west end 150 km away from the landing site freshwater from the atchafalaya bay flushed offshore and generated a low salinity transect which was 150 km wide and 40 m deep fig 9e walker 2001 ssc increased dramatically with the hurricane s passage and reached more than 1000 mg l in the water column figs 9h and 10 compared with the pre hurricane stage the sub surface pycnocline was thoroughly destroyed whereas the strength of the near bottom density stratification remained largely unchanged fig 10 the ssc profile exhibited limited vertical variation with a mean value of 830 mg l throughout the water column one week after gustav landed 00 00 00 utc september 9 the sea surface temperature had not recovered from the hurricane induced cooling fig 9c the low salinity river plume near the mississippi river s southwest pass could be identified again fig 9f the surface ssc decreased dramatically after gustav landed but a higher ssc remained at the bottom than that in the pre hurricane stage fig 9i a weak sub surface pycnocline was found and the transect averaged ssc decreased throughout the water column although it was still higher than that in the pre hurricane stage fig 10 the sediment and temperature were still different from those in the pre hurricane stage but more than 90 of the resuspended sediments had already settled on the seabed before another hurricane called ike 2008 entered the gulf of mexico and induced another round of resuspension therefore the post hurricane condition in this study did not represent 100 restoration 3 4 asymmetric transport during the hurricane highly intensified short term events e g hurricanes floods and winter storms are capable of substantially disrupting shelf deposition liu and fearn 1993 turner et al 2006 a unique feature of hurricane induced sediment transport is the asymmetry on different sides of the vortex during hurricanes the highest wind speed is found to the right of the track price 1981 xie et al 2011 uhlhorn et al 2014 which leads to an asymmetric pattern in the hydrodynamics including strong currents and waves in a shoreward direction to the right but relatively weak winds currents and waves to the left the current fields in fig 7b illustrate the offshore southward southeastward currents from atchafalaya bay after joining together with the strong alongshore currents from the eastern coastal louisiana where they moved southeastward continuously into the open gulf the highly intensified alongshore and offshore currents were capable of transporting large amounts of sediment far from where they originally deposited wave current interactions were not considered in this study but previous studies have highlighted the importance of wave induced littoral currents and undertows as well as their effects on sediment transport uchiyama et al 2010 stated that the littoral currents caused by wave breaking are maximized near the topographic bar and that the sediment transport induced by wave current interactions in coastal regions is important for sandbar migration hoefel and elgar 2003 hsu et al 2006 olabarrieta et al 2011 found that the wave generated current patterns varied greatly in the inlet zone in addition wave current interactions have critical effects on the horizontal and vertical structure of fresh water plumes which is important for coastal sedimentation rong et al 2014 in order to examine this asymmetric pattern as well as its impact on sediment transport we grouped and averaged the modeling results according to their sides relative to the track after gustav s landfall 16 00 00 utc september 1 fig 11 waves play a vital role in sediment resuspension during the shoaling of a hurricane thornton and guza 1983 miles et al 2015 the maximum significant wave heights 7 m simulated by the model occurred in the eastern sector figs 7a and 11b due to the strong winds and shoreward wave piling up figs 7a and 11a at the vortex center the wave height dropped to less than 2 m with a greatly reduced wind speed 15 m s fig 11a and b by contrast the surface currents were greatly intensified in the center of the vortex and they were generally stronger on the east side 0 6 1 3 m s than the west side 0 2 1 3 m s fig 11c several studies have emphasized that the sediment transport during hurricanes is mainly due to resuspension caused by increased bottom shear stress ogston and sternberg 1999 keen and glenn 2002 miles et al 2015 according to our simulation the bottom shear stress induced by waves was higher than that by currents where it reached 3 6 pa to the east both the wave and current induced shear stresses increased near the center of the vortex due to the strong hydrodynamics and relatively small water depth fig 11d e and f the high shear stress to the east led to high ssc and severe erosion figs 7b d 11g and h the maximum erosion was 0 13 m in the eastern sector and the ssc in both the surface and bottom layers peaked at the same location 15 2 and 12 0 g l respectively the spatial distribution pattern confirmed that the previously deposited sediments were the main source of the high ssc during the hurricane 3 5 suspended sediment flux ssf to assess the ssf during gustav we calculated the depth integrated and time averaged august 30 september 9 2008 ssf using the velocity and ssc as follows 3 s s f i 1 n s s c i u i h i where ssf is the suspended sediment flux unit kg m s ssci and ui are the ssc unit g l and current speed unit m s in the i th layers respectively n is the number of vertical layers 36 in this study and h represents the thickness of each layer unit m the ssf was along the coastline and convergent along the inner shelf to the west of the hurricane track the ssf was higher to the right of the track than the left mainly due to the high ssc around the delta fig 12 the maximum ssf was located to the south and southeast of the mississippi river delta where it reached 11 kg m s erosion deposition and sediment transport mainly occurred over the inner shelf 50 m fig 12 as the water depth increased to 200 m the net erosion deposition became trivial 1 cm thereby indicating that offshore sediment transport out of the shelf was limited in contrast to the results obtained by xu et al 2016 for katrina and rita in 2005 gustav induced less offshore transport to deep water 200 m strong offshore ssf was simulated over the wide and gentle continental shelf south and southwest off the mississippi river delta the ssf kept decreasing until the shelf break was reached a depo center with a thickness of 14 cm was simulated to the southwest of the hurricane track two sources were identified for this hurricane driven deposition comprising sediments eroded from 1 the south of the mississippi river delta and 2 the broad louisiana texas shelf in the northwest according to our ssf estimation the first source deltaic provided more sediment because 1 sufficient material was deposited near the delta lobe and 2 energetic ocean conditions to the right of the hurricane track another depo center was found southeast of the mississippi river delta between the 50 m and 200 m isobaths this elongated deposition was formed by the offshore transport of sediments from the inner shelf however we advise caution as both the ssf and post hurricane deposition estimations were relatively conservative because 10 of the gustav induced resuspension was still present in the water column fig 8 the approach of hurricane ike made it very difficult to estimate the total ssf induced by gustav previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of the fluvial sediments will settle over the inner shelf and offshore transport is limited under normal conditions e g xu et al 2011 during hurricane events such as karina and rita in 2005 the hurricane driven accumulation can be five times larger than the annual sediment supply from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers and even 10 times greater compared with the annual long term accumulation during non storm periods goñi et al 2007 based on our simulation the mean post hurricane deposition in coastal louisiana water depth 100 m was 4 0 cm which was 3 2 to 26 times of the 210pb derived annual accumulated thickness 0 15 1 24 cm osterman et al 2009 4 conclusions in this study we adapted the coawst modeling system to the gulf of mexico to study the variations in the ocean conditions and sediment dynamics during hurricane gustav in 2008 the favorable model data comparisons obtained including the sea level significant wave height wind speed air pressure and surface sediment distribution confirmed the feasibility of using a coupled model to investigate physical and sedimentary conditions during a hurricane event water stratification on the inner shelf was completely destroyed by vertical mixing after gustav s landfall large amounts of sediments were remobilized and brought to the surface layer 1000 mg l eight days after landfall sub surface stratification appeared again but its intensity was less than that before gustav landed the hydrodynamics exhibited great spatial variability due to the asymmetric wind field stronger bottom shear stress and currents in the eastern sector resulted in massive sediment resuspension and transport severe seabed erosion strong bottom shear stress and high ssc were found where the peak wave energy dissipation rate occurred the calculated ssf reached 11 kg m s during the hurricane s passage and the direction of the ssf was convergent to the vortex center the post hurricane deposition rate was 3 2 26 times of that during normal ocean conditions two depo centers were simulated with a maximum thickness of 14 cm after the passage of hurricane gustav acknowledgments research support

24108,the eddy resolved ocean circulation model riamom lee et al 2003 is used to analyze seasonal variability of mesoscale circulation in the tatar strait of the japan sea the model domain is a vast area including the northern japan sea okhotsk sea and adjacent region in the pacific ocean a numerical experiment with a horizontal 1 18 resolution has been carried out under realistic meteorological conditions from the ecmwf era 40 reanalysis with restoring of surface temperature and salinity the simulated seasonal variability of both the current system and mesoscale eddy dynamics in the tatar strait is in a good agreement with temperature and salinity distributions of oceanographic observation data collected during various seasons and years two general circulation regimes in the strait have been found the circulation regime changes from summer to winter due to seasonal change of the north asian monsoon on a synoptic time scale the similar change of the circulation regime occurs due to change of the southeastern wind to the northwestern one when the meteorological situation with an anticyclone over the okhotsk sea changes to that with a strong cyclone the lagrangian maps illustrate seasonal changes in direction of the main currents and in polarity and location of mesoscale eddies in the strait keywords numerical circulation model riamom the tatar strait of the japan sea lagrangian maps 1 introduction the tatar strait is a vast area in the northern part of the japan sea over the northern shelf and the tatar trough in the bottom topography that is a meridional extension of the deep japan basin fig 1 the strait also known as the gulf of tartary on a map in 1851 connects the amur liman and the sakhalin gulf of the okhotsk sea with the northern japan sea through the narrow 7 40 km and shallow 7 3 10 m nevelskoy strait the depth on the axis of the tatar trough decreases from 1773 m at the southern boundary of the strait to 10 m at its northern boundary near the nevelskoy strait the southern boundary of the tatar strait is a line between the belkin cape 45 49 n 137 42 e of the eurasian continent and the kuznetsov cape 46 03 n 141 55 e of the sakhalin island fig 1 the meridional extent of the tatar and nevelskoy straits is about 700 km and 56 km respectively it is known that the amur river run off into the amur liman impacts on the thermohaline structure of the tatar strait and adjacent japan sea area due to water exchange through the nevelskoy strait significant interdecadal and interannual variability in salinity in the tatar strait and adjacent deep sea area as well as the relationship between anomalies in the amur river discharge and salinity along 47 n has been found by ponomarev et al 2009 seasonal variability of mesoscale circulation in the strait and hydrophysical characteristics have been studied by using direct measurements of the current velocity temperature and salinity pishchalnik et al 2003 danchenkov 2004 shevchenko and chastikov 2006 by calculating dynamic topography at the sea surface dyakov 2006 and by numerical simulation as it has been shown by pishchalnik et al 2003 and pishchal nik et al 2009 a cyclonic circulation prevails in the tatar strait the stable current system includes the cold northern liman shrenk current along the continental shelf break and the southern current of transformed subtropical water along the eastern deep tatar trough slope adjacent to the shelf of the sakhalin island the current along the shelf is suggested to be unstable the estimation of geostrophic currents using temperature and salinity observations from 1997 to 2003 along the standard section across the strait from the slepikovsky cape of the sakhalin island to the cape gold at the continent shows the cold southward western sakhalin current along the western shelf of the sakhalin island in fall spring and even in summer shevchenko and chastikov 2006 in fall cold water occupies a thick upper layer near the sakhalin island that is a characteristic feature of this current in the cold season the dynamic topography at 30 db calculated by dyakov 2006 by using temperature and salinity profiles obtained in the oceanographic survey in june 9 22 1988 also shows the southward west sakhalin current and anticyclonic eddies in the offshore area of the strait while the similar dynamic topography in june 1994 does not show this current and estimated eddies over the tatar trough axis are cyclonic the satellite measurements of the sea surface height ssh anomaly in the altimetric aviso data contain significant errors in the entire coastal zone about 30 km wide www aviso altimetry fr in addition calculations of geostrophic currents by using the ssh gradient in areas with a sea depth of 100 m or less is doubtful the width of the main currents along the coast and along the strait axis does not exceed 35 km namely these currents determine the large scale circulation in the northern part of the tatar strait and its seasonal variability including averaging over a long period the aviso data can determine only an average direction of currents in the narrow strait due to inflow of okhotsk sea waters into the tatar strait through the nevelskoy strait taking into account these arguments and the horizontal resolution of the aviso data 1 4 1 4 the main system of currents and water circulation in the northern part of the tatar strait cannot be correctly reproduced using the altimetry data the principal change in barotropic circulation in the tatar strait under various wind forcing has been catched by barotropic models with a realistic bottom topography ponomarev and yurasov 1994 the southward east sakhalin current forms in barotropic models under forcing of the northwestern winter monsoon or due to similar meteorological situation with the northwestern wind when the anticyclonic gyre develops in the northern part of the strait the large scale circulation in the tatar strait has been simulated with the bergen university oceanic model bom in the σ coordinate system pishchal nik et al 2010 based on monthly mean temperature and salinity fields from pishchal nik et al 2009 the model does not simulate a southward current along the western shelf of the sakhalin island in the cold season due to the low resolution of 10 km along the x axis and 40 km along the y axis and increased horizontal viscosity winter sea ice duration in the northern tatar strait area varies from 40 to 80 days and it varies in its southern part from 140 to 170 days it is due to ice cover breaking by tides and its removal from the northern shelf to the southern area by the northwestern wind forcing and southern currents the ice thickness in the northern part can reach 1 5 m during the cold season and from year to year the ice coverage can vary considerably in space and time in dependence on atmospheric circulation patterns and wind forcing it was shown by martin et al 1992 that large polynias form in the northern tatar strait due to a strong northern wind forcing with the polynya size depending on the speed of wind a significant role of ice production in the polynya in the bottom water formation was discussed in that paper in addition to the dense water formation in the polynias it was suggested by martin and kawase 1998 that the southern ice advection and a freshwater inflow due to melting of ice in the southern tatar strait in january march is a driver of the liman current in winter while fresh water of the amur river inflow into the tatar strait is a driver of the liman current from april to november based on the analyses of the high resolution satellite observations martin et al 1995 also found a drift of ice to the north during the period of weak winds at the same time the high resolution radar satellite observations by the ers 1 sar martin et al 1995 as well as the nvisat asar and alos palsar observations mitnik and khazanova 2012 show similar polynias and areas with different kinds of ice in the tatar strait there are strips of about 140 km in length and 40 km in width martin et al 1995 as well as mesoscale eddy like structures and long strips of ice with low and high roughness mitnik and khazanova 2012 oriented along the sakhalin island shelf from the nevelskoy strait fairway to the south the main goal of this paper is to study seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale circulation in the tatar strait using the eddy resolved riam ocean model output from 1991 to 2000 when there were enough hydrographic observations to verify the simulation results the model includes realistic 3d numerical simulation during ten years with the 1 18 horizontal resolution over the strait nested in the coarser 1 6 resolution riamom for a vast area including the north japan sea okhotsk sea and adjacent region in the pacific ocean fayman and yoon 2012 2 model description the riamom has been developed at the research institute for applied mechanics of the kyushu university lee et al 2003 it is a 3d z coordinate primitive equation ogcm with a free surface boundary condition for the sea surface high the model is based on 3d nonlinear primitive equations assuming hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations no slip boundary condition is applied at all the sidewalls and the sea bottom the external gravity waves require much smaller time steps especially for the deep ocean a mode splitting method is adopted to avoid this problem i e the governing equation is divided into vertically integrated and structure equations blumberg and mellor 1987 the model also adopts the modified split quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinetics msquick scheme webb et al 1998 the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient is calculated using the mixed layer scheme by noh and jin kim 1999 the isopycnal diffusion with eddy parametrization by gent and mcwilliams 1990 is used the time filtering by shuman 1957 is adopted to avoid computational splitting in time permitting a longer barotropic time step the time integration is executed using the leapfrog scheme the time step for the barotropic and baroclinic components of the current velocity is 5 and 200 s correspondingly the finite differencing is based on the arakawa b grid system horizontally and allows partial stepping for the bottom cell vertically adcroft et al 1997 momentum conservation is implemented by the generalized arakawa scheme ishizaki and motoi 1999 momentum diffusion is given by the fourth order difference the so called slant advection effect is adopted to represent correctly vertical advection of the horizontal momentum along the steep bottom topography ishizaki and motoi 1999 the model is controlled by the message passing interface program which was designed for a 2d parallel communication and implemented for an efficient parallel computing with supercomputer machines the whole values calculated at each cpu are communicated in the buffer zone the numerical calculations were performed at the supercomputing division and information technology center university of tokyo and at the shared far eastern computing resource center iacp feb ras vladivostok the model domain is bounded by the area 129 e 165 e and 40 n 65 n the horizontal grid intervals are 1 18 in both latitudinal and longitudinal directions and the maximum number of vertical levels is 70 the vertical grid intervals are from 10 to 125 m from the surface to 2500 m depth and 250 m below 2000 m the model bottom topography is based on the gebco one minute grid the data for initial conditions and boundary conditions along the southern and eastern open boundaries are taken from simulation results obtained using the pacific ocean 1 6 riamom

in the tatar strait in winter with different kinds of ice including forming large polynias given the complexity of the sea ice modeling problem and the problem of simulation in the narrow tatar and nevelskoy straits and the adjacent okhotsk sea area we use a restoring of surface temperature and salinity observation data in numerical experiments with the circulation model taking into account the influence of ice with various concentration on the momentum heat and salt fluxes at the sea water surface the riamom was run using the standard relaxation method by barnier 1998 for restoring of surface salinity and temperature from the observation data surface salinity and temperature were taken from the world ocean atlas 2001 boyer et al 2005 and noaa optimum interpolation data respectively we have performed numerical experiments without and with sst and sss restoring comparison of the results obtained has shown that the restoring improves the accuracy and smoothness of circulation pattern without changing its structure see figs 1s 4s in supplementary material we have also used the simple method for assimilation of sea ice concentration from the satellite observation data noaa national climatic data center to calculate the heat salt and momentum fluxes at the water surface under ice with different values of its concentration these fluxes were considered to be proportional to the concentration of sea ice the increase in sea water salinity due to a brine rejection during the growth of sea ice from december to february and the decrease in surface water salinity during melting of ice in march april are taken into account by a restoring of observed surface salinity from the world ocean atlas using the data on concentration of sea ice taken from the noaa national climatic data center the wind stress the heat and fresh water fluxes are recalculated in accordance with eqs 1 3 the model sst is assimilated using the satellite sst from the noaa national centers for environmental information eq 1 the model sss is assimilated from the world ocean atlas 2001 eq 2 we use the 5 days averaged ice concentration ice sst wind velocity at 10 m above the surface heat flux and ep flux in the model run from january 1 1991 to december 31 2000 fig 2 other external fields are monthly averaged the riamom outputs for each day from 1991 to 2000 are analyzed in this study the simulated current velocity temperature and salinity fields are compared to observation data for this period when there were enough hydrographic observations to verify the simulation results the width of the tatar strait at its southern border is 328 km where the maximal depth reaches 1773 m while the width is only 40 km at the northern border with the depth of 10 m fig 1 therefore the large scale circulation models elaborated for the japan sea with a 10 km resolution yoon 1982 cannot describe fine structure of the current system and eddies in the tatar strait a 5 km horizontal resolution with 70 vertical levels used here are enough to simulate mesoscale circulation in the model domain including the northern part of the japan sea and the tatar strait 3 seasonal variability of the mesoscale circulation the interannual variability of the multi scale current system in the tatar strait is shown in fig 2 in terms of the simulated current velocity in the 2nd modeled layer at 15 m depth averaged from 1991 to 2000 the northward western sakhalin current of transformed subtropical water and the southward cold liman current are typical mesoscale features in summer on seasonal fig 3 and monthly fig 4 time scales both the currents form over the tatar trough slopes the liman current over the western slope is more stable and stronger than the northward western sakhalin current along the western sakhalin coast it is useful to compute the locations of stationary points with zero velocity and impose them on the velocity field a standard stability analysis allows to specify stagnation elliptic and hyperbolic points the motion around which is stable and unstable respectively the elliptic points are situated mainly at the centers of eddies and circulations where rotation prevails over deformation the motion around them is stable and circular the hyperbolic points situated mainly between and around eddies where deformation prevails over rotation are unstable ones with one direction along which waters converge to such a point and the other direction along which they diverge the liman current as a western boundary current over the trough slope slightly intensifies in the process of strengthening of vertical density stratification during the warm period of year and summer monsoon fig 4 the stable cyclonic eddies with the centers at elliptic points marked by the down oriented triangles in fig 4 occur over the tatar trough axis mainly in the warm period they are associated with the mesoscale cyclonic vortex street formed in the central area of the cyclonic gyre over the tatar trough between the southward liman current and northward western sakhalin current generated due to forcing of the southern and southeastern winds and cyclonic wind stress curl over the tatar strait that is most typical in the warm period from may to october the prevailing water transport though the nevelskoy strait in the warm season is directed from the japan sea into the amur liman of the okhotsk sea that is in accordance with previous studies based on observation and simulation results pishchalnik et al 2003 fresh water from the amur river mouth is transported from the amur liman into the adjacent area of the okhotsk sea sakhalin gulf and then to the south along the eastern shelf of the sakhalin island water transport from the japan sea into the okhotsk sea through the soya la pérouse strait is large in summer and fall with a maximum in summer that is in a good agreement with observations saveliev et al 2002 the current system and mesoscale circulations change significantly from month to month during fall fig 5 a c the changes occur at first in the northeastern tatar strait shallows and then in the most of the tatar strait area to the north of 49 n it is because of changes in the monsoon direction from the southeastern wind to the western northwestern and northern ones causing water cooling and ice formation the liman current intensifies in the tatar strait along its western slope reaching a maximum in november fig 5 c when the wind forcing is high and sea ice is mobile due to low concentration and thickness of ice the velocities in the near surface layer can reach 35 40 cm s in the southern part of the strait in november due to increasing of the wind velocity and change in the total ekman transport in the upper boundary layer from the southward direction to the southwestward and westward ones it leads to increase in the ssh and to a gradient current along the steep continental slope the mesoscale cyclonic eddies form in the offshore region to the east of the liman current their centers are shown by the down oriented triangles in fig 5 at the same time the anticyclonic circulation and anticyclonic eddies with the centers shown in fig 5 by the up oriented triangles are greatly enhanced in the northeastern tatar strait area to the north of 49 n and east of 141 e during cold seasons from the second half of october after changing of the summer monsoon to the winter one from october to december the anticyclonic eddies intensify and the southward current appears over the western coast of the sakhalin island and eastern tatar trough slope fig 5 b d the seasonal mean total transport through the nevelskoy strait in fall and winter is directed from the amur liman to the tatar strait i e from the okhotsk sea to the japan sea the mesoscale anticyclonic vorticity with the center at the up oriented elliptic stagnation point between 50 n and 51 n and around 141 5 e forms during the cold period in the northeastern tatar strait shallows adjacent to the nevelskoy strait it is clearly seen in monthly averaged current velocity fields in figs 5 and 6 both the large scale and mesoscale circulations in the tatar strait in the cold period are principally different as compared to those in the warm season two southward currents form over both the eastern and western shelf breaks of the tatar strait in winter and spring figs 3b and c the southward current along the western shelf of the sakhalin island develops from october to november when concentration and thickness of sea ice are not especially large fig 5 b and c the southward western sakhalin current becomes much stronger than the liman current in winter and early spring figs 5 d and 6 a c the liman current weakens during the cold season from december to april in the cold season the anticyclonic mesoscale eddies are generated over the northeastern slope of the tatar trough to the west of the southward western sakhalin current while cyclonic mesoscale eddies form at the western side of the trough in the liman current region the anticyclonic eddies are larger and more stable than the cyclonic ones therefore the anticyclones are more clearly seen in the modeled velocity fields averaged over 10 years fig 3 c and d the northward countercurrent over the axis of the tatar trough forms between the anticyclonic and cyclonic mesoscale vortex streets in the beginning of the cold season from september to november fig 5 a c the northward ice drift under a weak wind in the northern part of the tatar strait found by martin et al 1995 seems to be closely related to the northward countercurrent along the tatar strait axis in our simulation in the cold season thus the seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale circulation are closely related to annual cycle of the north asian monsoon which changes its direction from the northwestern one in the cold season fig 2 a b and d causing water cooling and ice formation to the southeastern one in summer fig 2 c the averaged wind velocity and sst shown in fig 2 are calculated based on daily mean values of those gridded characteristics used in the numerical model experiment as an external wind forcing and the assimilated sst respectively the principal features of the simulated current system and mesoscale eddies being typical for the cold period of year are confirmed by hydrographic observations in the late hydrological spring in june 1988 the geostrophic currents at the sea surface were calculated by dyakov 2006 by using temperature salinity and density profiles from the oceanographic survey in the tatar strait in late june 1988 and in late september 1987 the anticyclonic eddies in the eastern part of the tatar strait and the southward western sakhalin current have been found in terms of dynamic topography at the sea surface in a geostrophic approximation seasonal variability of the vertical structure of simulated and observed circulation patterns in march 1991 and june 1994 is clearly seen in zonal vertical sections of temperature t and salinity s shown in figs 7 and 8 correspondingly the simulated t and s sections along 49 83 n in figs 7 a and d cross the simulated liman current along the continental shelf slope the left side of the section mesoscale cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies and the southward western sakhalin current the right side of the section the observed temperature fig 7 b and salinity fig 7 d distributions show similar vertical structures differences in values of salinity are small being in the range from 0 to 0 2 psu differences in values of temperature are in the range from 10 c to 20 c the simulated temperature is higher than the observed one the differences in temperature is due to a low heat flux at the sea water surface when we set ice concentration from the satellite observation and use linear dependence of the heat flux on the ice concentration eq 1 in our numerical experiment heat advection from the south leads to an increase in water temperature on the other side a cooling due to the surface heat flux and convection processes in winter is not enough nevertheless the difference in temperature is not large due assimilation of the observed sst in the model run despite a temperature lag in the model results its patterns in the vertical sections are similar to observation data the model and observed t and s patterns correspond to each other and to the system of simulated currents and eddies horizontal resolution of observations was only 6 ctd stations in this section model resolution is about 30 grid points therefore the simulated t and s patterns are much smoother than the observed ones principal features of simulated temperature fig 8 a and salinity fig 8 c related to the circulation patterns in june 1994 also correspond to observations along 49 n in the warm season the warm saline water transported by the northward western sakhalin current from the south and low salinity cold water transported from the north by the liman current are clearly seen in simulation fig 8 a and c and observation fig 8 b and d the difference between simulated and observed values of temperature and salinity is related to increased role of horizontal and vertical mixing processes in the model in the beginning of the warm season 4 lagrangian analysis of mesoscale features in the tatar strait in this section we consider principal mesoscale features in the tatar strait from the lagrangian point of view by using maps of lagrangian indicators for a recent review of this approach see papers by prants 2013 prants 2014 and monograph by prants et al 2017 trajectories of passive particles inside the 2nd model layer are computed by solving 2d advection equations 5 d λ d t u λ φ t d φ d t v λ φ t where u and v are angular zonal and meridional velocities φ and λ are latitude and longitude respectively bicubical spatial interpolation and third order lagrangian polynomials in time are used to compute trajectories by integrating the advection equations with a fourth order runge kutta scheme in order to track where water parcels came from to the study area it is seeded at a fixed date with a large number of synthetic particles whose trajectories are computed backward in time for a fixed period of time prants 2015 marking by different colors particles which crossed the northern

for a given period in time in the past d r e arccos sin ϕ 0 sin ϕ f cos ϕ 0 cos ϕ f cos λ f λ 0 one gets a so called drift or lagrangian d map re is the earth radius in km prants et al 2013 budyansky et al 2015 prants et al 2015 we introduce here a new kind of lagrangian maps which seems to be more suitable for tracking vortex structures than the lyapunov drift and rotational maps used before the lagrangian indicator 6 l 0 t u 2 v 2 d t is computed backward in time for each particle in the area for a period of time t and its value is coded by a gradation of the grey color the quantity l is computed in geographic minutes as a result such a l map visualizes not only the very vortex structure but also a history of water masses to be involved in the vortical motion in the past the origin d and l lagrangian maps have been computed daily from january 1 1991 to december 31 2000 inspecting them one can observe and document strengthening and weakening of the currents and generation transformation and decay of eddies in the study area fig 9 is a backward in time origin map combined with the d map illustrating a strengthening of the southward western sakhalin current along the eastern coast of the strait and of the northward countercurrent in the central part in the cold period the pink color on this map codes the particles entered the area from the north for 120 days in the past starting from january 12 1998 the yellow color codes the particles entered the area from the south for that period of time the gray particles stayed in the area for the whole 120 day period in the past but displaced to different distances from their initial positions the white color codes those particles which came to the land for the integration period and have been removed from the consideration to get a more clear pattern of vortex streets and to visualize the history and origin of water masses to be involved in the vortical motion in the past we computed a l map backward in time for 30 days fig 9 b shows the vortex street in the tatar strait in the cold season consisting of a number of mesoscale cyclones with the centers approximately along the 141 e meridian shown by the green down oriented triangles the vortex street consisting of a number of mesoscale anticyclones with the centers approximately along 141 5 e shown by the red up oriented triangles and the northward countercurrent over the tatar trough in between the l map presents much more clearly the vortex contours and a water exchange between different eddies and between a given eddy and its surroundings for example the belts of a dark gray water around each of the anticyclones mean that this water was winding onto the eddies for 30 days in the past the 8 like belt of the dark gray water between and around those eddies shows a pathway along which the eddies exchange the water the l map in fig 9 b allows one even to recognize that the cyclone with the center at around 50 7 n 141 e interacted actively with the northward countercurrent in the central part of the strait but not with those anticyclones the narrow light gray strip in fig 9 b with a large gradient of l at its edges forms a local front and separates this current from the western periphery of the anticyclone centered at 49 8 n 141 6 e in the warm period the western sakhalin current transports transformed subtropical water to the north along the western coast of sakhalin a typical pattern is shown in fig 10 a the backward in time origin map combined with the d map on september 5 1994 shows the western sakhalin current by pink and the liman current by yellow the backward in time l map on the same date in fig 10 b demonstrates typical vortex structures in the warm period a mesoscale anticyclonic vorticity with the center at around 51 n 141 5 e in the northeastern tatar strait shallows adjacent to the nevelskoy strait an anticyclonic vortex street close to the western coast of sakhalin and a cyclonic vortex street in the central part over the tatar trough between the liman and western sakhalin current the anticyclonic eddies in the warm period are smaller than those in the cold season and are situated closer to the sakhalin western coast to verify these simulated results we show in fig 10 c a track of the surface drifter no 67169 with the imposed aviso velocity field we have found in the database http aoml noaa gov phod dac only one drifter reached the study area in summer 2007 it has been advected to the north along the sakhalin western coast being involved time to time in a clockwise rotation around the anticyclonic eddies to be present nearby the coast at that time an analysis of the vorticity balance in a vertically integrated vorticity equation for the study area can be found in supplementary material 5 conclusions we have studied seasonal and synoptic variability of the current system and mesoscale circulations in the tatar strait using the eddy resolved riam ocean model output from 1991 to 2000 the large scale and mesoscale circulations have been shown in the eulerian and lagrangian representations to be cardinally different in the cold and warm seasons the seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale circulation is explained by an annual cycle of the north asian monsoon which changes its direction from the northwestern one in the cold season causing water cooling and ice formation to the southeastern one in summer in the cold season the two southward currents form over both the shelf breaks of the tatar strait the western sakhalin current along the eastern break and the liman current along the western break the western sakhalin current develops from october to november and is much stronger than the liman current in winter and early spring the liman current weakens during the cold season from december to april in the cold season anticyclonic mesoscale eddies are generated over the northeastern slope of the tatar trough forming an anticyclonic vortex street while cyclonic mesoscale eddies form in the western side of the trough forming a cyclonic vortex street the anticyclonic eddies are larger and more stable than the cyclonic ones the northward countercurrent over the axis of the tatar trough forms between the anticyclonic and cyclonic mesoscale vortex streets in the beginning of the cold season from september to november mean total transport through the nevelskoy strait in fall and winter is directed from the amur liman of the okhotsk sea to the tatar strait of the japan sea in the warm season the western sakhalin current is rather weak and transports transformed subtropical water to the north the southward liman current is comparatively strong in summer a mesoscale cyclonic vortex street forms in the central area over the tatar trough a mesoscale anticyclonic vorticity forms during the warm period in the northeastern tatar strait shallows adjacent to the nevelskoy strait an anticyclonic vortex street forms along the western coast of sakhalin the anticyclonic eddies are smaller in the cold season and closer to the sakhalin coast the prevailing water transport though the nevelskoy strait is directed from the japan sea to the amur liman of the okhotsk sea the simulated seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale eddy dynamics in the tatar strait have been found to be in a good agreement with the high resolution satellite data and temperature and salinity distributions from the hydrographic observation data collected in various seasons and years in particular the vertical sections of modeled and observed temperature and salinity correlate well with each other the riamom simulation results with restoring of temperature and salinity at the sea surface and assimilation of ice concentration satellite data are generally consistent with the temperature and salinity observation data in the tatar strait the simulated system of currents and mesoscale eddies under ice in the northern part of the tatar strait does not significantly depends on an inaccuracy in simulated absolute values of temperature and salinity development of methods for assimilation of observational data on concentration and thickness of sea ice is a perspective and challenging task for more accurate parametrization of heat and salt fluxes in the ocean circulation models

24108,the eddy resolved ocean circulation model riamom lee et al 2003 is used to analyze seasonal variability of mesoscale circulation in the tatar strait of the japan sea the model domain is a vast area including the northern japan sea okhotsk sea and adjacent region in the pacific ocean a numerical experiment with a horizontal 1 18 resolution has been carried out under realistic meteorological conditions from the ecmwf era 40 reanalysis with restoring of surface temperature and salinity the simulated seasonal variability of both the current system and mesoscale eddy dynamics in the tatar strait is in a good agreement with temperature and salinity distributions of oceanographic observation data collected during various seasons and years two general circulation regimes in the strait have been found the circulation regime changes from summer to winter due to seasonal change of the north asian monsoon on a synoptic time scale the similar change of the circulation regime occurs due to change of the southeastern wind to the northwestern one when the meteorological situation with an anticyclone over the okhotsk sea changes to that with a strong cyclone the lagrangian maps illustrate seasonal changes in direction of the main currents and in polarity and location of mesoscale eddies in the strait keywords numerical circulation model riamom the tatar strait of the japan sea lagrangian maps 1 introduction the tatar strait is a vast area in the northern part of the japan sea over the northern shelf and the tatar trough in the bottom topography that is a meridional extension of the deep japan basin fig 1 the strait also known as the gulf of tartary on a map in 1851 connects the amur liman and the sakhalin gulf of the okhotsk sea with the northern japan sea through the narrow 7 40 km and shallow 7 3 10 m nevelskoy strait the depth on the axis of the tatar trough decreases from 1773 m at the southern boundary of the strait to 10 m at its northern boundary near the nevelskoy strait the southern boundary of the tatar strait is a line between the belkin cape 45 49 n 137 42 e of the eurasian continent and the kuznetsov cape 46 03 n 141 55 e of the sakhalin island fig 1 the meridional extent of the tatar and nevelskoy straits is about 700 km and 56 km respectively it is known that the amur river run off into the amur liman impacts on the thermohaline structure of the tatar strait and adjacent japan sea area due to water exchange through the nevelskoy strait significant interdecadal and interannual variability in salinity in the tatar strait and adjacent deep sea area as well as the relationship between anomalies in the amur river discharge and salinity along 47 n has been found by ponomarev et al 2009 seasonal variability of mesoscale circulation in the strait and hydrophysical characteristics have been studied by using direct measurements of the current velocity temperature and salinity pishchalnik et al 2003 danchenkov 2004 shevchenko and chastikov 2006 by calculating dynamic topography at the sea surface dyakov 2006 and by numerical simulation as it has been shown by pishchalnik et al 2003 and pishchal nik et al 2009 a cyclonic circulation prevails in the tatar strait the stable current system includes the cold northern liman shrenk current along the continental shelf break and the southern current of transformed subtropical water along the eastern deep tatar trough slope adjacent to the shelf of the sakhalin island the current along the shelf is suggested to be unstable the estimation of geostrophic currents using temperature and salinity observations from 1997 to 2003 along the standard section across the strait from the slepikovsky cape of the sakhalin island to the cape gold at the continent shows the cold southward western sakhalin current along the western shelf of the sakhalin island in fall spring and even in summer shevchenko and chastikov 2006 in fall cold water occupies a thick upper layer near the sakhalin island that is a characteristic feature of this current in the cold season the dynamic topography at 30 db calculated by dyakov 2006 by using temperature and salinity profiles obtained in the oceanographic survey in june 9 22 1988 also shows the southward west sakhalin current and anticyclonic eddies in the offshore area of the strait while the similar dynamic topography in june 1994 does not show this current and estimated eddies over the tatar trough axis are cyclonic the satellite measurements of the sea surface height ssh anomaly in the altimetric aviso data contain significant errors in the entire coastal zone about 30 km wide www aviso altimetry fr in addition calculations of geostrophic currents by using the ssh gradient in areas with a sea depth of 100 m or less is doubtful the width of the main currents along the coast and along the strait axis does not exceed 35 km namely these currents determine the large scale circulation in the northern part of the tatar strait and its seasonal variability including averaging over a long period the aviso data can determine only an average direction of currents in the narrow strait due to inflow of okhotsk sea waters into the tatar strait through the nevelskoy strait taking into account these arguments and the horizontal resolution of the aviso data 1 4 1 4 the main system of currents and water circulation in the northern part of the tatar strait cannot be correctly reproduced using the altimetry data the principal change in barotropic circulation in the tatar strait under various wind forcing has been catched by barotropic models with a realistic bottom topography ponomarev and yurasov 1994 the southward east sakhalin current forms in barotropic models under forcing of the northwestern winter monsoon or due to similar meteorological situation with the northwestern wind when the anticyclonic gyre develops in the northern part of the strait the large scale circulation in the tatar strait has been simulated with the bergen university oceanic model bom in the σ coordinate system pishchal nik et al 2010 based on monthly mean temperature and salinity fields from pishchal nik et al 2009 the model does not simulate a southward current along the western shelf of the sakhalin island in the cold season due to the low resolution of 10 km along the x axis and 40 km along the y axis and increased horizontal viscosity winter sea ice duration in the northern tatar strait area varies from 40 to 80 days and it varies in its southern part from 140 to 170 days it is due to ice cover breaking by tides and its removal from the northern shelf to the southern area by the northwestern wind forcing and southern currents the ice thickness in the northern part can reach 1 5 m during the cold season and from year to year the ice coverage can vary considerably in space and time in dependence on atmospheric circulation patterns and wind forcing it was shown by martin et al 1992 that large polynias form in the northern tatar strait due to a strong northern wind forcing with the polynya size depending on the speed of wind a significant role of ice production in the polynya in the bottom water formation was discussed in that paper in addition to the dense water formation in the polynias it was suggested by martin and kawase 1998 that the southern ice advection and a freshwater inflow due to melting of ice in the southern tatar strait in january march is a driver of the liman current in winter while fresh water of the amur river inflow into the tatar strait is a driver of the liman current from april to november based on the analyses of the high resolution satellite observations martin et al 1995 also found a drift of ice to the north during the period of weak winds at the same time the high resolution radar satellite observations by the ers 1 sar martin et al 1995 as well as the nvisat asar and alos palsar observations mitnik and khazanova 2012 show similar polynias and areas with different kinds of ice in the tatar strait there are strips of about 140 km in length and 40 km in width martin et al 1995 as well as mesoscale eddy like structures and long strips of ice with low and high roughness mitnik and khazanova 2012 oriented along the sakhalin island shelf from the nevelskoy strait fairway to the south the main goal of this paper is to study seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale circulation in the tatar strait using the eddy resolved riam ocean model output from 1991 to 2000 when there were enough hydrographic observations to verify the simulation results the model includes realistic 3d numerical simulation during ten years with the 1 18 horizontal resolution over the strait nested in the coarser 1 6 resolution riamom for a vast area including the north japan sea okhotsk sea and adjacent region in the pacific ocean fayman and yoon 2012 2 model description the riamom has been developed at the research institute for applied mechanics of the kyushu university lee et al 2003 it is a 3d z coordinate primitive equation ogcm with a free surface boundary condition for the sea surface high the model is based on 3d nonlinear primitive equations assuming hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations no slip boundary condition is applied at all the sidewalls and the sea bottom the external gravity waves require much smaller time steps especially for the deep ocean a mode splitting method is adopted to avoid this problem i e the governing equation is divided into vertically integrated and structure equations blumberg and mellor 1987 the model also adopts the modified split quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinetics msquick scheme webb et al 1998 the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient is calculated using the mixed layer scheme by noh and jin kim 1999 the isopycnal diffusion with eddy parametrization by gent and mcwilliams 1990 is used the time filtering by shuman 1957 is adopted to avoid computational splitting in time permitting a longer barotropic time step the time integration is executed using the leapfrog scheme the time step for the barotropic and baroclinic components of the current velocity is 5 and 200 s correspondingly the finite differencing is based on the arakawa b grid system horizontally and allows partial stepping for the bottom cell vertically adcroft et al 1997 momentum conservation is implemented by the generalized arakawa scheme ishizaki and motoi 1999 momentum diffusion is given by the fourth order difference the so called slant advection effect is adopted to represent correctly vertical advection of the horizontal momentum along the steep bottom topography ishizaki and motoi 1999 the model is controlled by the message passing interface program which was designed for a 2d parallel communication and implemented for an efficient parallel computing with supercomputer machines the whole values calculated at each cpu are communicated in the buffer zone the numerical calculations were performed at the supercomputing division and information technology center university of tokyo and at the shared far eastern computing resource center iacp feb ras vladivostok the model domain is bounded by the area 129 e 165 e and 40 n 65 n the horizontal grid intervals are 1 18 in both latitudinal and longitudinal directions and the maximum number of vertical levels is 70 the vertical grid intervals are from 10 to 125 m from the surface to 2500 m depth and 250 m below 2000 m the model bottom topography is based on the gebco one minute grid the data for initial conditions and boundary conditions along the southern and eastern open boundaries are taken from simulation results obtained using the pacific ocean 1 6 riamom

in the tatar strait in winter with different kinds of ice including forming large polynias given the complexity of the sea ice modeling problem and the problem of simulation in the narrow tatar and nevelskoy straits and the adjacent okhotsk sea area we use a restoring of surface temperature and salinity observation data in numerical experiments with the circulation model taking into account the influence of ice with various concentration on the momentum heat and salt fluxes at the sea water surface the riamom was run using the standard relaxation method by barnier 1998 for restoring of surface salinity and temperature from the observation data surface salinity and temperature were taken from the world ocean atlas 2001 boyer et al 2005 and noaa optimum interpolation data respectively we have performed numerical experiments without and with sst and sss restoring comparison of the results obtained has shown that the restoring improves the accuracy and smoothness of circulation pattern without changing its structure see figs 1s 4s in supplementary material we have also used the simple method for assimilation of sea ice concentration from the satellite observation data noaa national climatic data center to calculate the heat salt and momentum fluxes at the water surface under ice with different values of its concentration these fluxes were considered to be proportional to the concentration of sea ice the increase in sea water salinity due to a brine rejection during the growth of sea ice from december to february and the decrease in surface water salinity during melting of ice in march april are taken into account by a restoring of observed surface salinity from the world ocean atlas using the data on concentration of sea ice taken from the noaa national climatic data center the wind stress the heat and fresh water fluxes are recalculated in accordance with eqs 1 3 the model sst is assimilated using the satellite sst from the noaa national centers for environmental information eq 1 the model sss is assimilated from the world ocean atlas 2001 eq 2 we use the 5 days averaged ice concentration ice sst wind velocity at 10 m above the surface heat flux and ep flux in the model run from january 1 1991 to december 31 2000 fig 2 other external fields are monthly averaged the riamom outputs for each day from 1991 to 2000 are analyzed in this study the simulated current velocity temperature and salinity fields are compared to observation data for this period when there were enough hydrographic observations to verify the simulation results the width of the tatar strait at its southern border is 328 km where the maximal depth reaches 1773 m while the width is only 40 km at the northern border with the depth of 10 m fig 1 therefore the large scale circulation models elaborated for the japan sea with a 10 km resolution yoon 1982 cannot describe fine structure of the current system and eddies in the tatar strait a 5 km horizontal resolution with 70 vertical levels used here are enough to simulate mesoscale circulation in the model domain including the northern part of the japan sea and the tatar strait 3 seasonal variability of the mesoscale circulation the interannual variability of the multi scale current system in the tatar strait is shown in fig 2 in terms of the simulated current velocity in the 2nd modeled layer at 15 m depth averaged from 1991 to 2000 the northward western sakhalin current of transformed subtropical water and the southward cold liman current are typical mesoscale features in summer on seasonal fig 3 and monthly fig 4 time scales both the currents form over the tatar trough slopes the liman current over the western slope is more stable and stronger than the northward western sakhalin current along the western sakhalin coast it is useful to compute the locations of stationary points with zero velocity and impose them on the velocity field a standard stability analysis allows to specify stagnation elliptic and hyperbolic points the motion around which is stable and unstable respectively the elliptic points are situated mainly at the centers of eddies and circulations where rotation prevails over deformation the motion around them is stable and circular the hyperbolic points situated mainly between and around eddies where deformation prevails over rotation are unstable ones with one direction along which waters converge to such a point and the other direction along which they diverge the liman current as a western boundary current over the trough slope slightly intensifies in the process of strengthening of vertical density stratification during the warm period of year and summer monsoon fig 4 the stable cyclonic eddies with the centers at elliptic points marked by the down oriented triangles in fig 4 occur over the tatar trough axis mainly in the warm period they are associated with the mesoscale cyclonic vortex street formed in the central area of the cyclonic gyre over the tatar trough between the southward liman current and northward western sakhalin current generated due to forcing of the southern and southeastern winds and cyclonic wind stress curl over the tatar strait that is most typical in the warm period from may to october the prevailing water transport though the nevelskoy strait in the warm season is directed from the japan sea into the amur liman of the okhotsk sea that is in accordance with previous studies based on observation and simulation results pishchalnik et al 2003 fresh water from the amur river mouth is transported from the amur liman into the adjacent area of the okhotsk sea sakhalin gulf and then to the south along the eastern shelf of the sakhalin island water transport from the japan sea into the okhotsk sea through the soya la pérouse strait is large in summer and fall with a maximum in summer that is in a good agreement with observations saveliev et al 2002 the current system and mesoscale circulations change significantly from month to month during fall fig 5 a c the changes occur at first in the northeastern tatar strait shallows and then in the most of the tatar strait area to the north of 49 n it is because of changes in the monsoon direction from the southeastern wind to the western northwestern and northern ones causing water cooling and ice formation the liman current intensifies in the tatar strait along its western slope reaching a maximum in november fig 5 c when the wind forcing is high and sea ice is mobile due to low concentration and thickness of ice the velocities in the near surface layer can reach 35 40 cm s in the southern part of the strait in november due to increasing of the wind velocity and change in the total ekman transport in the upper boundary layer from the southward direction to the southwestward and westward ones it leads to increase in the ssh and to a gradient current along the steep continental slope the mesoscale cyclonic eddies form in the offshore region to the east of the liman current their centers are shown by the down oriented triangles in fig 5 at the same time the anticyclonic circulation and anticyclonic eddies with the centers shown in fig 5 by the up oriented triangles are greatly enhanced in the northeastern tatar strait area to the north of 49 n and east of 141 e during cold seasons from the second half of october after changing of the summer monsoon to the winter one from october to december the anticyclonic eddies intensify and the southward current appears over the western coast of the sakhalin island and eastern tatar trough slope fig 5 b d the seasonal mean total transport through the nevelskoy strait in fall and winter is directed from the amur liman to the tatar strait i e from the okhotsk sea to the japan sea the mesoscale anticyclonic vorticity with the center at the up oriented elliptic stagnation point between 50 n and 51 n and around 141 5 e forms during the cold period in the northeastern tatar strait shallows adjacent to the nevelskoy strait it is clearly seen in monthly averaged current velocity fields in figs 5 and 6 both the large scale and mesoscale circulations in the tatar strait in the cold period are principally different as compared to those in the warm season two southward currents form over both the eastern and western shelf breaks of the tatar strait in winter and spring figs 3b and c the southward current along the western shelf of the sakhalin island develops from october to november when concentration and thickness of sea ice are not especially large fig 5 b and c the southward western sakhalin current becomes much stronger than the liman current in winter and early spring figs 5 d and 6 a c the liman current weakens during the cold season from december to april in the cold season the anticyclonic mesoscale eddies are generated over the northeastern slope of the tatar trough to the west of the southward western sakhalin current while cyclonic mesoscale eddies form at the western side of the trough in the liman current region the anticyclonic eddies are larger and more stable than the cyclonic ones therefore the anticyclones are more clearly seen in the modeled velocity fields averaged over 10 years fig 3 c and d the northward countercurrent over the axis of the tatar trough forms between the anticyclonic and cyclonic mesoscale vortex streets in the beginning of the cold season from september to november fig 5 a c the northward ice drift under a weak wind in the northern part of the tatar strait found by martin et al 1995 seems to be closely related to the northward countercurrent along the tatar strait axis in our simulation in the cold season thus the seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale circulation are closely related to annual cycle of the north asian monsoon which changes its direction from the northwestern one in the cold season fig 2 a b and d causing water cooling and ice formation to the southeastern one in summer fig 2 c the averaged wind velocity and sst shown in fig 2 are calculated based on daily mean values of those gridded characteristics used in the numerical model experiment as an external wind forcing and the assimilated sst respectively the principal features of the simulated current system and mesoscale eddies being typical for the cold period of year are confirmed by hydrographic observations in the late hydrological spring in june 1988 the geostrophic currents at the sea surface were calculated by dyakov 2006 by using temperature salinity and density profiles from the oceanographic survey in the tatar strait in late june 1988 and in late september 1987 the anticyclonic eddies in the eastern part of the tatar strait and the southward western sakhalin current have been found in terms of dynamic topography at the sea surface in a geostrophic approximation seasonal variability of the vertical structure of simulated and observed circulation patterns in march 1991 and june 1994 is clearly seen in zonal vertical sections of temperature t and salinity s shown in figs 7 and 8 correspondingly the simulated t and s sections along 49 83 n in figs 7 a and d cross the simulated liman current along the continental shelf slope the left side of the section mesoscale cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies and the southward western sakhalin current the right side of the section the observed temperature fig 7 b and salinity fig 7 d distributions show similar vertical structures differences in values of salinity are small being in the range from 0 to 0 2 psu differences in values of temperature are in the range from 10 c to 20 c the simulated temperature is higher than the observed one the differences in temperature is due to a low heat flux at the sea water surface when we set ice concentration from the satellite observation and use linear dependence of the heat flux on the ice concentration eq 1 in our numerical experiment heat advection from the south leads to an increase in water temperature on the other side a cooling due to the surface heat flux and convection processes in winter is not enough nevertheless the difference in temperature is not large due assimilation of the observed sst in the model run despite a temperature lag in the model results its patterns in the vertical sections are similar to observation data the model and observed t and s patterns correspond to each other and to the system of simulated currents and eddies horizontal resolution of observations was only 6 ctd stations in this section model resolution is about 30 grid points therefore the simulated t and s patterns are much smoother than the observed ones principal features of simulated temperature fig 8 a and salinity fig 8 c related to the circulation patterns in june 1994 also correspond to observations along 49 n in the warm season the warm saline water transported by the northward western sakhalin current from the south and low salinity cold water transported from the north by the liman current are clearly seen in simulation fig 8 a and c and observation fig 8 b and d the difference between simulated and observed values of temperature and salinity is related to increased role of horizontal and vertical mixing processes in the model in the beginning of the warm season 4 lagrangian analysis of mesoscale features in the tatar strait in this section we consider principal mesoscale features in the tatar strait from the lagrangian point of view by using maps of lagrangian indicators for a recent review of this approach see papers by prants 2013 prants 2014 and monograph by prants et al 2017 trajectories of passive particles inside the 2nd model layer are computed by solving 2d advection equations 5 d λ d t u λ φ t d

for a given period in time in the past d r e arccos sin ϕ 0 sin ϕ f cos ϕ 0 cos ϕ f cos λ f λ 0 one gets a so called drift or lagrangian d map re is the earth radius in km prants et al 2013 budyansky et al 2015 prants et al 2015 we introduce here a new kind of lagrangian maps which seems to be more suitable for tracking vortex structures than the lyapunov drift and rotational maps used before the lagrangian indicator 6 l 0 t u 2 v 2 d t is computed backward in time for each particle in the area for a period of time t and its value is coded by a gradation of the grey color the quantity l is computed in geographic minutes as a result such a l map visualizes not only the very vortex structure but also a history of water masses to be involved in the vortical motion in the past the origin d and l lagrangian maps have been computed daily from january 1 1991 to december 31 2000 inspecting them one can observe and document strengthening and weakening of the currents and generation transformation and decay of eddies in the study area fig 9 is a backward in time origin map combined with the d map illustrating a strengthening of the southward western sakhalin current along the eastern coast of the strait and of the northward countercurrent in the central part in the cold period the pink color on this map codes the particles entered the area from the north for 120 days in the past starting from january 12 1998 the yellow color codes the particles entered the area from the south for that period of time the gray particles stayed in the area for the whole 120 day period in the past but displaced to different distances from their initial positions the white color codes those particles which came to the land for the integration period and have been removed from the consideration to get a more clear pattern of vortex streets and to visualize the history and origin of water masses to be involved in the vortical motion in the past we computed a l map backward in time for 30 days fig 9 b shows the vortex street in the tatar strait in the cold season consisting of a number of mesoscale cyclones with the centers approximately along the 141 e meridian shown by the green down oriented triangles the vortex street consisting of a number of mesoscale anticyclones with the centers approximately along 141 5 e shown by the red up oriented triangles and the northward countercurrent over the tatar trough in between the l map presents much more clearly the vortex contours and a water exchange between different eddies and between a given eddy and its surroundings for example the belts of a dark gray water around each of the anticyclones mean that this water was winding onto the eddies for 30 days in the past the 8 like belt of the dark gray water between and around those eddies shows a pathway along which the eddies exchange the water the l map in fig 9 b allows one even to recognize that the cyclone with the center at around 50 7 n 141 e interacted actively with the northward countercurrent in the central part of the strait but not with those anticyclones the narrow light gray strip in fig 9 b with a large gradient of l at its edges forms a local front and separates this current from the western periphery of the anticyclone centered at 49 8 n 141 6 e in the warm period the western sakhalin current transports transformed subtropical water to the north along the western coast of sakhalin a typical pattern is shown in fig 10 a the backward in time origin map combined with the d map on september 5 1994 shows the western sakhalin current by pink and the liman current by yellow the backward in time l map on the same date in fig 10 b demonstrates typical vortex structures in the warm period a mesoscale anticyclonic vorticity with the center at around 51 n 141 5 e in the northeastern tatar strait shallows adjacent to the nevelskoy strait an anticyclonic vortex street close to the western coast of sakhalin and a cyclonic vortex street in the central part over the tatar trough between the liman and western sakhalin current the anticyclonic eddies in the warm period are smaller than those in the cold season and are situated closer to the sakhalin western coast to verify these simulated results we show in fig 10 c a track of the surface drifter no 67169 with the imposed aviso velocity field we have found in the database http aoml noaa gov phod dac only one drifter reached the study area in summer 2007 it has been advected to the north along the sakhalin western coast being involved time to time in a clockwise rotation around the anticyclonic eddies to be present nearby the coast at that time an analysis of the vorticity balance in a vertically integrated vorticity equation for the study area can be found in supplementary material 5 conclusions we have studied seasonal and synoptic variability of the current system and mesoscale circulations in the tatar strait using the eddy resolved riam ocean model output from 1991 to 2000 the large scale and mesoscale circulations have been shown in the eulerian and lagrangian representations to be cardinally different in the cold and warm seasons the seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale circulation is explained by an annual cycle of the north asian monsoon which changes its direction from the northwestern one in the cold season causing water cooling and ice formation to the southeastern one in summer in the cold season the two southward currents form over both the shelf breaks of the tatar strait the western sakhalin current along the eastern break and the liman current along the western break the western sakhalin current develops from october to november and is much stronger than the liman current in winter and early spring the liman current weakens during the cold season from december to april in the cold season anticyclonic mesoscale eddies are generated over the northeastern slope of the tatar trough forming an anticyclonic vortex street while cyclonic mesoscale eddies form in the western side of the trough forming a cyclonic vortex street the anticyclonic eddies are larger and more stable than the cyclonic ones the northward countercurrent over the axis of the tatar trough forms between the anticyclonic and cyclonic mesoscale vortex streets in the beginning of the cold season from september to november mean total transport through the nevelskoy strait in fall and winter is directed from the amur liman of the okhotsk sea to the tatar strait of the japan sea in the warm season the western sakhalin current is rather weak and transports transformed subtropical water to the north the southward liman current is comparatively strong in summer a mesoscale cyclonic vortex street forms in the central area over the tatar trough a mesoscale anticyclonic vorticity forms during the warm period in the northeastern tatar strait shallows adjacent to the nevelskoy strait an anticyclonic vortex street forms along the western coast of sakhalin the anticyclonic eddies are smaller in the cold season and closer to the sakhalin coast the prevailing water transport though the nevelskoy strait is directed from the japan sea to the amur liman of the okhotsk sea the simulated seasonal variability of the current system and mesoscale eddy dynamics in the tatar strait have been found to be in a good agreement with the high resolution satellite data and temperature and salinity distributions from the hydrographic observation data collected in various seasons and years in particular the vertical sections of modeled and observed temperature and salinity correlate well with each other the riamom simulation results with restoring of temperature and salinity at the sea surface and assimilation of ice concentration satellite data are generally consistent with the temperature and salinity observation data in the tatar strait the simulated system of currents and mesoscale eddies under ice in the northern part of the tatar strait does not significantly depends on an inaccuracy in simulated absolute values of temperature and salinity development of methods for assimilation of observational data on concentration and thickness of sea ice is a perspective and challenging task for more accurate parametrization of heat and salt fluxes in the ocean circulation models

24109,in ocean wave modelling accurately computing the evolution of the wind wave spectrum depends on the source terms and the spectral bandwidth used the wave dissipation rate source term which spectrally quantifies wave breaking and other dissipative processes remains poorly understood including the spectral bandwidth needed to capture the essential model physics the observational study of sutherland and melville 2015a investigated the relative dissipation rate contributions of breaking waves from large scale whitecaps to microbreakers they concluded that a large fraction of wave energy was dissipated by microbreakers however in strong contrast with their findings our analysis of their data and other recent data sets shows that for young seas microbreakers and small whitecaps contribute only a small fraction of the total breaking wave dissipation rate for older seas we find microbreakers and small whitecaps contribute a large fraction of the breaking wave dissipation rate but this is only a small fraction of the total dissipation rate which is now dominated by non breaking contributions hence for all the wave age conditions observed microbreakers make an insignificant contribution to the total wave dissipation rate in the wave boundary layer we tested the sensitivity of the results to the sm15a whitecap analysis methodology by transforming the sm15a breaking data using our breaking crest processing methodology this resulted in the small scale breaking waves making an even smaller contribution to the total wave dissipation rate and so the result is independent of the breaker processing methodology comparison with other near surface total tke dissipation rate observations also support this conclusion these contributions to the spectral dissipation rate in ocean wave models are small and need not be explicitly resolved 1 introduction the evolution of the wave height spectrum is generally modelled via the radiative transfer equation komen et al 1994 assuming deep water and a slowly varying current φ t u c g φ s w a v e s i n s n l s d s where φ k θ is the directional wave spectrum c g is the group velocity and u is the current the total source term swave sin snl sds where sin is the atmospheric input spectral source term snl is the nonlinear spectral transfer source term representing nonlinear wave wave interactions and sds is the total spectral dissipation rate sds is comprised of a breaking wave contribution s d s b r and a wave dissipation rate component s d s n b associated with allied turbulent boundary layer processes other than breaking waves the latter becomes dominant during old wind sea conditions an important aspect of these three primary source terms is the spectral bandwidth needed to properly capture the underlying physics there is extensive literature on the spectral distribution of the wind input and nonlinear spectral interactions but the relative importance of different wave scales in the wave breaking dissipation rate source term s d s b r has remained elusive the recently developed measurement capability of imaging and analysing microbreakers reported by sutherland and melville 2013 and used in sutherland and melville 2015a hereafter sm15a has made it possible to investigate their relative importance in the dissipation rate source term sds 1 1 breaking wave scales unlike whitecaps breaking gravity capillary and gravity wavelets which do not entrain air have been referred to as microscale breakers hereafter microbreakers e g phillips and banner 1974 in fresh water their wavelengths are reported to range from o 0 05 0 7 m caulliez 2011 salinity and surface tension may modify the breaking induced aeration process possibly influencing reported microscale breaker

the two centre panels in fig 2 of gemmrich et al 2013 confirms the presence of small whitecaps with speeds below 1 m s for representative young and old wind sea conditions note that the whitecap speeds were assigned according to initial breaker front speed from that figure c 1 m s is seen to be a generous upper limit for the speed of microbreakers and the highest whitecap counts were found for 1 c 2 m s with 0 c 1 m s and 2 c 3 m s not much smaller summed over all wave ages given the observed co existence of small whitecaps with microbreakers for c 1 m s we define microbreakers as breaking waves with speed c 1 m s which are predominantly non air entraining assuming the linear dispersion relation this corresponds to wavelengths λ 0 64 m and intrinsic frequencies f 1 55 hz these wavelengths are approximate as the dispersion relation may not be exact for breaking crests see appendix a small air entraining breaking waves hereafter small whitecaps are defined here as those with 1 c 2 m s 0 64 λ 2 56 m and 0 8 f 1 55 hz note that the c 2 m s threshold was chosen by sm15a in their fig 7 replotted in fig 1 to quantify the dissipation rate of contributions from microbreakers the present study aims to review the latest measurements of this poorly understood high wavenumber aspect of the sea surface microstructure and assess its importance for the turbulent dissipation rate εtot in air sea interfacial physics and modelling it is well recognised that turbulent kinetic energy is injected sporadically at the wind driven sea surface under active wave breaking conditions e g craig and banner 1994 melville 1994 terray et al 1996 tke dissipation rates εtot have been linked to air sea gas transfer rates zappa et al 2007 and to sea spray production rates veron 2015 the breaker scale bandwidth and spatio temporal frequencies depend primarily on wind speed and wave age young wind seas experience a higher probability of breaking of longer waves which decreases as the wind seas age for old seas the predominant breaking scale transitions towards small whitecaps and microbreakers gemmrich et al 2013 the spectral distribution of breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r c contributions to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer is not known accurately as robust direct measurements are presently not available understanding the physics and quantifying the total wave dissipation rate s d s k d k in the upper ocean including the wave boundary layer has attracted considerable interest over recent decades the turbulent kinetic energy tke dissipation rate profile ε z decreases rapidly with depth z below the surface and ɛ t o t 20 η ɛ z d z the depth integration of ε z over the wave boundary layer since we are unable to directly measure the wave dissipation rates sds and s d s b r the total tke dissipation rate εtot is used as the best measured estimate of the total wave dissipation rate sds gemmrich 2010 zappa et al 2016 schwendeman et al 2014 who all assumed sds s d s b r there has also been ongoing debate on how well the wave boundary layer is described by turbulent wall layer scaling for which the local tke dissipation rate εwl z at mean depth z below the ocean surface is given by ɛ w l z u w 3 κ z where κ 0 41 is the von karman constant u w is the water side friction velocity e g terray et al 1996 however recent consensus strongly favours a breaking wave enhanced layer for a range of conditions where the near surface tke dissipation rate ε z exceeds the wall layer estimate εwl z by a considerable margin section 1 in sm15a presents a state of the art account of this extensive literature as a lead in to their paper describing their recent measurements and findings on this challenging topic briefly new insights are emerging as a result of novel measurement techniques and analyses reported in recent field investigations sm15a wang et al 2013 these studies have provided comprehensive results for a broad range of open water wind and sea state conditions that link refined subsurface dissipation rate measurements novel surface dissipation rate measurements and co located surface wind and wave properties e g gemmrich 2010 schwendeman et al 2014 sm15a this includes spectrally resolved measurements of whitecap kinematics from which spectral breaking wave dissipation rates s d s b r c can be estimated using phillips 1985 hereafter p85 spectral breaking wave framework and its recent refinements e g banner and morison 2010 romero et al 2012 hereafter r12 these studies revisit key open questions including the dependence of the depth integrated tke dissipation rate εtot on wind speed and wave age with a special focus on the contribution made by breaking waves throughout this paper we use the term wave age to denote the mean wave age cm u parameter adopted in sm15a where u is the wind friction velocity and cm is a characteristic measure of the wind wave speed this wave age was considered in section 2c of sm15a to be more closely related to the breaking wind waves than the usual spectral peak wave age cp u which can be representative of swell here cm g ωm where g is gravity and ωm is the mean frequency computed from the frequency spectrum s ηη ω as ω m 0 ω s η η ω d ω 0 s η η ω d ω in this context the relative importance of the different scales of breaking waves from large whitecaps to microbreakers has emerged as a new element in their recent measurements investigating active whitecap coverage schwendeman and thomson 2015 reported lower correlation with dissipation rate than with wind or wave conditions with residuals showing a strong negative trend with wave age they suggested that the discrepancy is likely due to the increased influence of microbreakers in older wind seas referencing sm15a for justification in this paper we focus on the important issue of the relative contributions of the different breaking wave scales to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer and how this changes for different wave ages based on the recent comprehensive study of sm15a our study investigates the relative importance of the contribution of microbreakers and small whitecaps this topic is of central importance as wave breaking is a key air sea interaction process whose sea surface expression in the form of whitecapping or microbreaking is currently under active investigation in global sea state models it is important to know the shortest resolved wave scale that should be included explicitly or parametrically in order to capture the dominant physics currently ncep s wavewatch iii operational frequencies range from 0 035 hz to 0 96 hz chawla et al 2013 the corresponding speed of 0 96 hz waves is 1 63 m s also there are several important scientific processes and applications associated with this phenomenon including fundamental air sea interfacial fluxes and the utilisation of breaking wave signatures as a remote sensing tool for inferring these fluxes we reanalysed the data of sm15a supplemented by the near zero fetch lake michigan data of wang et al 2013 hereafter w13 this provided new insights on the subsurface dissipation rates ε z of microbreakers and small whitecaps in greater isolation in their more recent data analysis sensitivity study wang and liao 2016 hereafter w16 revisits the same near zero fetch data reported in w13 sm15a suggests and w16 concurs referencing sm15a to justify that the high dissipation rate level observed within o 100 mm of the sea surface is consistent with a large fraction of the wave energy dissipation rate sds being attributed to microbreakers in this paper we review the relative contributions of microbreakers and small whitecaps to the breaking s d s b r and total sds wave dissipation rates in the wave boundary layer 2 key results from sutherland and melville 2015a sm15a combines their novel infrared geometric kinematic breaking wave crest length spectral density measurements λ c from sutherland and melville 2013 with parametric spectral breaking strength coefficients from spectral wind wave modelling r12 to infer the dissipation rate s d s b r c contribution from breaking wave scales ranging from large whitecaps to microbreakers these results are described and reported in detail in sm15a while the breaking front imagery allows extraction of directional distributions of λ c θ the results presented are for the azimuthally integrated distribution λ c 0 2 π c λ c θ d θ the integrated dissipation rate contribution from all resolved breaking wave scales is given by the fifth moment of λ c weighted by the spectral breaking strength coefficient b according to s d s b r s d s b r c d c ρ w g b c 5 λ c d c p85 banner and morison 2010 r12 sm15a where ρw is the water density and g is the gravitational acceleration figs 6 7 and 16 in sm15a provide the basis for our analysis as they contain the data relevant to assessing the relative importance of the microbreaker and small whitecap contributions to both the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r and total wave dissipation rate sds the data from fig 7 in sm15a are redrawn in fig 1 below this figure shows the cumulative integral of the spectral breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r c normalised by the total breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r for each measured wave age case it should be noted that this figure only addresses contributions relative to the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r not to the total wave dissipation rate sds a second key figure underpinning our analysis is fig 16 in sm15a redrawn as fig 2 this shows the measured tke dissipation rate integrated over the top 20 m of the ocean εtot plotted against the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r integrated over all resolved wave scales for a range of wave ages from developing wind seas to old swell as seen on the left side of fig 2 where the total tke dissipation rate εtot is much larger than the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r for old seas there is a contribution to the tke dissipation rate εtot in the wave boundary layer not directly related to breaking but from other hydrodynamical processes these include the influence of surface waves on the reynolds shear and normal stresses from the subsurface turbulence and resulting energy transfer between the waves and the turbulence this is important in quantifying the wave energy dissipation rate s d s n b due to the interaction between non breaking waves and turbulence which is a source of wave damping additional to wave breaking other non breaking sources of turbulence are discussed in sm15a section 6b the recent paper by guo and shen 2014 includes a comprehensive literature review of this topic in the more complex oceanic context sullivan and mcwilliams 2010 highlighted the need to include langmuir turbulence larger wavenumber bandwidth and directional spreading of the surface waves in the non breaking dissipation rate s d s n b contributions in the present paper the background wave dissipation rate s d s n b is taken as that arising from all sources other than turbulence actively injected by breaking waves the key challenges investigated in this paper are to quantify as the seas evolve i the fractional contribution of breaking waves to the total wave dissipation rate sds ii the relative importance of microbreakers and of small whitecaps to the breaking s d s b r and total sds wave dissipation rates 3 reanalysis of the data in section 2 of sutherland and melville 2015a fig 3 indicates that for the high tke dissipation rates εtot in developing wind seas right side of plot wave breaking accounts for almost all of the total tke dissipation rate εtot however for old wind seas left side of plot wave breaking contributes only a small fraction of the total tke dissipation rate εtot using this data the fraction of the dissipation rate contributed by wave breaking s d s b r to the total dissipation rate εtot is plotted against the wave age in fig 4 in fig 4 it is seen that for the younger wind seas the mean breaking dissipation rates inferred from measurements modelling account for the total measured tke dissipation rate εtot within the error bars reported in sm15a however as the seas age this fraction decreases until it becomes insignificant 5 the black dashed line in fig 4 is a linear least squares fit to the sm15a data this data and the fitted black dashed curve extend above the physically allowable maximum value of 1 likely due to measurement modelling uncertainties for our subsequent analysis we replaced the dashed black curve by the solid red line fit which asymptotes to just below 1 a key aspect of fig 1 fig 7 in sm15a is that it does not show the absolute levels for the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r for each of the wave age cases however this information is essential to assess the relative importance of different wave breaking scales to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer we were able to extract this information from the b weighted fifth moment spectra of λ c provided in fig 6 d of sm15a which we integrated this figure is redrawn as fig 5 and was used to plot the cumulative breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r c as a fraction of the total wave breaking dissipation rate εtot in fig 6 in fig 6 d of sm15a the breaking wave dissipation rate is defined as s d s b r c b c 5λ c m3 s 4 in this figure the breaking crest length spectral density λ c was measured in three different field experiments the breaking strength coefficient b is a function of the spectral saturation b unlike in p85 where b was assumed constant we used the same breaking strength formulation as sm15a so that any difference in conclusions does not depend on the choice of b here b b b is calculated following the spectral saturation based breaking strength parameterisation developed by r12 described by eq 5 in sm15a in fig 5 the line colours and corresponding average wave age bins are the same as used in fig 1 while this data is quite noisy due to the variability of b b it is readily integrated to obtain a reasonable estimate of the mean total dissipation rate for each of the average wave age bins in fig 1 using the data in fig 6a together with the average cm u for each bin and the red curve fit in fig 4 the corresponding average total wave dissipation rate sds was calculated for each of the average wave age bins plotted in fig 5 the breaking wave dissipation rate was plotted as a fraction of the total wave dissipation rate against breaker speed c for the wave age bins in figs 1 and 5 and is shown in fig 6b fig 6 highlights the following key points i for young seas the integrated breaking dissipation rate s d s b r is a large percentage of the total dissipation rate sds whereas for old seas it is only a small fraction of the total dissipation rate sds ii for young seas the larger scale breaking waves make a substantial relative contribution to the total wave dissipation rate whereas for old seas only the small breaking waves contribute to the total dissipation rate hence for old wind seas the larger scale breaking waves make a negligible contribution to the wave dissipation rate this can also be seen in fig 5 iii for old seas breaking waves only make a small 10 contribution to the total wave dissipation rate with microbreakers only making a very small contribution also for young seas microbreakers c 1 m s contribute 8 and microbreakers together with small whitecaps c 2 m s make up 26 of the total wave dissipation rate to elucidate further the relative contribution to the total wave dissipation rate made by all breaking wave fronts with speeds below a particular speed the low wave speed results in fig 6 were extracted and replotted in fig 7 fig 7 is a centrepiece figure for this paper and encapsulates some of the major findings which are based on the methodology of sm15a i microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 0 5 and 1 0 m s never contribute more than 3 and 8 of the total wave dissipation rate sds respectively ii small whitecaps plus microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 1 5 and 2 m s never contribute more than about 16 and 26 respectively to the total wave dissipation rate sds iii these contributions reduce to less than 5 for old seas where active breaking only plays a small role in the total wave dissipation rate sds 4 sensitivity to breaking wave image processing methodology this section highlights the results of our alternative λ c extraction methodology described in detail in appendix a we review in detail the sensitivity of the main findings in section 3 of sm15a to the measured λ c processing methodology in brief during active breaking a breaker crest front slows down to about half its initial velocity kleiss and melville 2011 fig 13c gemmrich et al 2013 fig 1 this intrinsic unsteadiness results in a significant difference in the λ c distributions from each method because each method assigns a different velocity to a given detected breaking front in appendix a we describe in detail how our methodology assigns the initial speed of each breaker corrected to the intrinsic speed of the underlying wave in determining the λ c contribution for that breaking event however sm15a assigns the instantaneous speed determined at each video time step of each individual slowing breaking crest front length and builds the λ c distribution from these different speed bins this method progressively assigns the later stages of each evolving breaking crest front length to slower speed bins as the breaker slows down overall this biases their derived λ c distribution to lower wave speeds repeating the calculations in section 3 above using our corrected alternatively processed λ c distribution leads to the results in fig 8 clearly fig 8 not only parallels the results shown in fig 7 and conclusions based on the λ c methodology of sm15a but further diminishes the role of the microbreakers using our transformed λ c i microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 0 5 and 1 0 m s never contribute more than 1 and 3 of the total wave dissipation rate sds respectively ii small whitecaps combined with microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 1 5 and 2 m s never contribute more than about 6 and 15 respectively iii these contributions reduce to less than 2 for old seas where active breaking only plays a small role in the total wave dissipation rate sds thus comparing the results in figs 7 and 8 indicates that both methodologies lead to the same conclusion that microscale breakers never contribute significantly to the total wave dissipation rate sds for any wave age with our λ c methodology strongly supporting these conclusions 5 comparison with near surface total dissipation rate observations it is of fundamental interest to relate these ir imagery based and visible breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r estimates with the measured total tke dissipation rate εtot from vertical profiles in the open ocean wave boundary layer sm15a provides a comprehensive data set of the latter comprising both fixed and floating aquadopp deployments for a range of wind and sea state conditions ranging from developing to very mature seas to complement their subsurface measurements a novel surface vorticity approach using ir piv measurements sutherland and melville 2015b hereafter sm15b was used to quantify the total tke dissipation rate εtot at the air sea interface the sm15a subsurface measurements approached within o 70 mm of the sea surface leaving a shallow but energetically significant near surface layer with no measurements in this unresolved layer a strong increase in the tke dissipation rate ε z towards the surface is required to match to the sm15a ir measured surface levels does the dissipation rate from microbreakers and or small whitecaps explain this high near surface dissipation rate we investigate this further by collating results from two studies where the tke dissipation rate εtot from microbreakers and small whitecaps was measured in isolation from the longer waves and background subsurface dissipation rate ε z present in open ocean studies as such they are able to capture the order of magnitude of the contributions to the total wave dissipation rate sds from the very short breakers when they are at the spectral peak for wind speeds corresponding to the open ocean tke dissipation rate εtot data as shown below fig 9 shows the sm15a open ocean tke dissipation rate ε z profiles with depth for the wide range of wind speed and wave age conditions observed also shown superposed in fig 9 are two additional data sets of w13 and siddiqui and loewen 2007 hereafter sl07 that provide significant insight on the indicative strength of the microbreaker and small whitecap contributions to the subsurface tke dissipation rate ε z profile with depth when suitably integrated over depth their relative contribution to the total tke dissipation rate εtot in the wave boundary layer can then be estimated the detailed study of sl07 is included as it used simultaneous dpiv digital particle image velocimetry and infrared imagery to investigate the tke dissipation rate ε z profile in near surface flows immediately below laboratory wind waves at a fetch of 5 5 m and wind speeds from 4 5 to 11 m s u10 6 3 to 18 6 m s these conditions produced short steep microbreakers with wavelengths from 60 mm to 180 mm the depth integrated tke dissipation rate εtot was found to be significantly greater than would occur in a comparable rough wall layer flow the closest field counterparts to the sl07 laboratory study are by w13 and w16 which adapted the sl07 dpiv technique for use in open waters profiles of tke dissipation rate ε z were measured in a field experiment in lake michigan under a near zero fetch condition for different wind speeds and a short open water fetch condition for a single low wind speed condition they were able to measure the structure of turbulence in the wave boundary layer to obtain tke dissipation rate ε z data up to the instantaneous water surface using a free floating underwater miniature dpiv system their surface following configuration allowed measurements of the aqueous side turbulence statistics in the topmost layer immediately below the water surface down to a local depth of 150 mm different data analysis methods to estimate the tke dissipation rate ε z were compared which yielded consistent tke dissipation rate ε z profiles within reasonable scatter bounds tke dissipation rate ε z profiles were measured for a variety of wind and wave conditions w16 suggested that the strong surface skin layer dissipation rate may be attributed to microbreaking referencing sm15a suggested that 20 90 of the surface dissipation could be attributed to the non air entraining breakers and its downward transport in the water column for reference table 1 summarises the key properties of the lake michigan and laboratory data sets discussed here fig 9 shows the large contrast between the sm15a open ocean profile data in comparison with the w13 lake michigan data and the sl07 laboratory data at the same depth for similar wind speeds for illustration for the u10 12 m s data at a common depth of 0 1 m the open ocean tke dissipation rate ε z level is o 30 times stronger than both the lake michigan near zero fetch data and the laboratory data this trend is observed for all the wind speeds shown the collation of the available subsurface tke dissipation rate ε z profile results from these lake laboratory and open ocean data sets shown in fig 9 can be displayed for specific wind speed bands this more clearly highlights the relative importance of microbreaker and small whitecap contributions to the observed tke dissipation rate ε z profile in the open ocean wave boundary layer the figures provide a valuable complementary basis for verifying results and conclusions based on the breaking wave analysis these figures highlight key differences between typical tke dissipation rate ε z profiles in laboratory and extremely short fetch open water conditions for corresponding wind speeds for each of the wind speed bands shown the indicative contributions of the near zero fetch data are both lower in strength and shallower in depth by 1 5 2 orders of magnitude however the low wind speed band 4 m s is only about 1 order of magnitude lower integrated values for these tke dissipation rate ε z profile data in the upper 100 mm of the surface layer for the microscale breaker and small whitecap dissipation rate contributions are shown in fig 11 a to be able to make meaningful comparisons with the sm15a results the data was extrapolated to 20 m depth following the sm15a section 6a methodology which assumed a depth dependence of z 2 the cumulative depth integrals of these extrapolations are shown in fig 11b these profiles are used to estimate the total tke dissipation rate εtot from each of the lake michigan field data sets for different wind speed cases these total tke dissipation rate εtot levels were then compared with the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r estimates for different short breaking wave bandwidths based on the results described in section 3 above fig 12 shows the relationship between wind speed and wave age for the sm15a data the black line shows a fitted curve which was used to transform the cumulative results in fig 6a to be a function of wind speed rather than wave age since the w13 data were collected at near zero fetch there are no larger waves and the breaking waves are only microbreakers small whitecaps hence it is impractical to plot the data against wave age using the black curve in fig 12 we transformed the sm15a data in fig 6a together with the breaker s d s b r and measured tke dissipation rate εtot data from fig 3 to show their wind speed dependence this is plotted in fig 13 which encapsulates the main results of this study on the relative importance of microbreakers and small whitecaps to the upper ocean dissipation rate εtot for the range of wind speed conditions observed in sm15a fig 13 compares the relative levels of the total dissipation rate in i the uppermost 20 m of the ocean ii from microscale and small whitecaps at near zero fetch extrapolated to 20 m depth iii from all resolved breaking wave scales iv from microbreakers c 1 m s and v from microbreakers and small whitecaps c 2 m s fig 13 shows that the overall ordering of these contributions is both plausible and self consistent it is seen that the integrated dissipation rate from all breaking waves s d s b r cyan line matches the total dissipation rate εtot red line for the youngest sea conditions where the wind speeds were higher this progressively reduces towards the lower wind speed older sea states where the background turbulence level from other sources increasingly dominates over the whole range of observations the microbreaker dissipation rate fractional contribution blue line is seen to be o 1 while the combined fractional contribution of microbreakers and small whitecaps with c 2 m s is typically 5 with our alternative processing methodology see fig 8 these contributions are halved the comparable breaking wave dissipation rates reported in sm15a are shown for microbreakers c 1 m s and for microbreakers and small whitecaps c 2 m s the elevated data point at u 3 m s is a single measurement in the lake at a short but finite fetch 1 2 km where the background dissipation rate s d s n b exceeded the breaking wave contribution s d s b r 6 sources of uncertainty several sources of uncertainty underpin the results in the complex suite of measurements and analyses utilised by sm15a these are discussed in sm15a or in various allied papers by these authors and their collaborators for example fig 16 in sm15a documents the uncertainty in their integrated dissipation rate εtot measurements which can be up to one order of magnitude fig 10 in sm15b provides relative uncertainty estimates associated with the estimation of the surface dissipation rate ε z kleiss and melville 2011 discuss various uncertainties associated with extracting crest length spectral density distributions from sea surface visible imagery with sm13 providing a counterpart for infrared imagery this aspect includes the contentious issue of breaking front speed assignment for which uncertainty aspects are investigated in detail in appendix a in estimating spectral breaking wave dissipation rates s d s b r c a spectral breaking strength formulation is needed this quantity has a significant uncertainty as is evident from the paper by r12 we avoided this uncertainty by using the same spectral breaking strength data used by sm15a which was based on r12 however this quantity remains a source of significant uncertainty with a potentially large impact on breaking dissipation rate s d s b r estimates as pointed out in the discussion of fig 4 above note that these estimates ignore the contribution of parasitic capillary waves to the overall dissipation rate which none of the discussed methods are able to resolve there is also some uncertainty in the non wave related dissipation contribution to the total tke dissipation rate εtot as discussed in section 6b of sm15a 7 conclusions spectral representations of wave breaking physics are fundamental to modelling the evolution of natural wind wave spectra and air sea interfacial fluxes it is important to determine what frequencies need to be resolved in models to capture the necessary source term energy fluxes to this end we revisited the findings of recent field studies on surface and near surface tke dissipation rates ε z in the presence of breaking waves these novel studies embrace surface measurements of the contributions from microbreakers and small whitecaps and their relation to the subsurface tke measurements ε z using acoustic doppler and dpiv techniques immediately below the sea surface we reviewed the data analysis methodology used by sm15a which we used to assess the contribution of microbreakers wave speeds up to 1 m s and small whitecaps wave speeds from 1 2 m s to the total wave dissipation rate sds based on our analysis and the subsurface dpiv studies by w13 we conclude that the contributions of microbreakers and small whitecaps to the total wave dissipation rate sds during active wind wave generation conditions is far weaker than suggested by sm15a and is only ever of marginal importance more specifically for young developing wind seas the contributions of microbreakers to the total wave dissipation rate sds is small compared with the contribution from larger scale breakers for young developing wind seas the contributions of small whitecaps to the total wave dissipation rate sds depends on the breaking crest length processing methodology using sm15a methodology small whitecaps contribute up to 20 of the total dissipation rate sds while with our methodology this reduces to a maximum of 12 for low wind speeds old seas microbreakers and small whitecaps dominate the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r contribution however the non breaking dissipation rate s d s n b is an order of magnitude larger than the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r for high wind speeds young seas microbreakers and small whitecaps make a much smaller contribution to the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r uncertainty in the small breaking wave contributions c 2 m s to the total wave dissipation rate sds results from differences in breaker image processing techniques and uncertainty in the spectral breaking strength coefficient noting that the corresponding frequency for c 1 m s is 1 6 hz and for c 2 m s is 0 78 hz we estimate that the computational bandwidth used operationally in wavewatch iii which spans from 0 035 to 0 96 hz will capture at least 95 of the breaking wave dissipation rate the source of the observed elevated dissipation rate levels ε z in the uppermost 100 mm of the wave boundary layer remains to be determined overall in regard to the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r and total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer the contributions from microbreakers are negligible and from small whitecaps are secondary while they may well be important for other processes these wavenumber scales do not need to be resolved in

clearer appendix a impact of alternative λ c extraction methodology this appendix reviews the sensitivity of the main findings in section 3 of sm15a to the measured λ c processing methodology a 1 breaking wave scale three methods for analysing breaking wave video imagery are currently used to extract λ c from video of breaking waves at sea with the most appropriate method still to be decided during active breaking a breaker crest front slows down to about half its initial velocity kleiss and melville 2011 fig 13c gemmrich et al 2013 fig 1 this intrinsic unsteadiness results in a significant difference in the λ c distributions from each method because each method assigns a different velocity to a given detected breaking front we emphasize that the primary purpose of the λ c distribution in p85 was to provide the basis for an accurate unbiased estimate of the wave energy dissipation rate from breaking according to wave scale the p85 spectral breaking wave framework uses breaking front velocity c b to characterise the wave scale of each breaker analysed unsteady aspects of c b are not considered in p85 in building the λ c b distribution as this relates to the whitecap front behaviour as a spilling plume not to the scale of the wave that is breaking since an active breaker develops on a wave crest which travels at speed c p85 assumed cb c which is taken as the speed at which the whitecap front travels and determines the breaker scale this is the cb adopted by zappa et al 2012 gemmrich et al 2013 amongst others however further refinement is involved in relating cb to c as discussed in a 2 below sm15a section 3 used a different method kleiss and melville 2011 which bins the time dependent history of each breaker front according to its instantaneous velocity the instantaneous λ c contribution from each breaking front during its active lifetime is distributed to a bandwidth of slower velocity bins down to o 50 of its initial velocity the ensemble of these individual partitionings constitutes their λ c spectra full details are given in sutherland and melville 2013 and its supplementary annexe note that this methodology shifts their λ c to lower wave speeds causing a systematic bias of the breaking dissipation rate spectrum to the shorter wave scales assuming the linear dispersion relation this also results in a weighted redistribution of λ k the spectral breaking dissipation rate contribution from each breaker is redistributed from its initial breaking wavenumber to shorter scales up to o 4 times its initial wavenumber since the speed of the spilling crest front does not directly relate to the speed of each wave that is breaking this precludes the use of the linear dispersion relation to convert breaker speed to wavenumber if either λ c or λ k is used to estimate higher order moments such as sds via eq 4 in sm15a it also distorts the sds distribution a third method based on whitecap processing in the image spectral fft domain thomson and jessup 2007 was used by thomson et al 2009 while this method significantly reduces data analysis effort it is also influenced by breaker front slowdown and has windowing issues with aliasing beyond the measured bandwidth schwendeman et al 2014 this method is mentioned for reference only and not investigated here a 2 generic wave crest slowdown the generic crest speed slowdown mechanism banner et al 2014 clearly affects the initial breaker front speed allis 2013 chapter 7 fig 7 10 made frame by frame video measurements of breaking wave packets in a wave basin these show that the leading edge of 2d and 3d spilling breakers initially advances at a mean rate of 0 87 0 08 c 0 where c 0 is the equivalent linear wave speed of the underlying wave this observed generic breaking front speed of 0 87c 0 should be taken into account when assigning the correct wave speed scale c for the λ c extracted from video measurements the observed 13 mean speed reduction requires a 15 increase 1 0 87 1 15 in the initial speed attributed to a given breaking event to match the linear speed of the underlying wave this shifts the observed λ c distribution towards higher speeds this is important if the data is transformed to λ k distributions for comparison with standard spectral wave model output as it results in a systematic shift to o 30 lower wavenumbers after applying the generic slowdown correction determined by allis 2013 we now suppress the b subscript in cb and adopt c as the appropriate speed corrected measure of the wave scale with the corresponding spatial wavenumber k given by the linear dispersion relation in summary in physical space the assignment of speed c to a given breaker is found by tracing the breaking front speed sequence back to the speed of the initial breaking which is then increased by 15 to account for the generic crest slowdown a 3 impact on λ c spectra and resultant breaking dissipation rates this subsection assesses the impact of the two factors identified in a 1 and a 2 on the λ c distributions and on the allied results for spectral breaking dissipation rate contributions as shown in fig 6 a in section 3 of sm15a our first goal was to reconstruct as closely as possible the λ c spectra consistent with the p85 framework hereafter labelled λbl c denoting base line λ the instantaneous speed binned hereafter isb transformed λ c reported by sm15a hereafter labelled λis c cannot be inverted explicitly so we applied an iterative isb transformation to a set of trial λbl spectra to emulate the sm15a methodology described above this transformed baseline λ is labelled λtb c if the initial guess for the λbl c is correct then the λtb c will closely match the λis c the trial spectral function λbl c before modification by the sm15a isb process was modelled as having the form a1 λ bl c r c c n where r is an assumed spectral roll off function at slow wave speeds and c n is an assumed power law fall off that follows the measured overall trend forms for r and values for n were refined by successive iteration so that the isb transformed λtb c spectra matched as closely as possible the λis c spectra reported by sm15a derived from their measurements for each wave age banded case we formulated a base λbl c spectral function corresponding to the p85 framework as specified above eq a1 based on the measured breaker properties reported in fig 13 of kleiss and melville 2011 we applied a cosine weighted spectral function filter that redistributes the initial breaker crest speed c max from c max to 0 5c max peaking at about 0 75c max our equivalent λ spectral weighting starts at c max and redistributes the spectral density by a cosine window that varies from 0 5 at c max to 1 at 0 75c max and reduces to 0 5 at 0 5c max these weightings were then normalised so that their sum was 1 applying this window successively to our base spectrum λbl c starting at c max and moving sequentially towards slower speeds reshapes to lower speeds the initial base spectrum λbl c to the transformed baseline spectra λtb c for comparison with the λis c spectra shown fig 6 a of sm15a by successive iteration where the exponent n and the parameters in the function r eq a1 are tweaked a close correspondence was achieved between the λtb c and the corresponding λis c spectrum reported for each different wave age band in sm15a other choices of weighting distribution functions that spread the front speed over 0 5 to 1 only marginally altered the result further from allis 2013 ch 7 p 190 below fig 7 10 the observed breaker crest front speed c c is only 0 87 of the actual underlying linear wave speed and so the c dependence in λbl c needs to be replaced by c 1 15c 0 to match it to the actual wave speed of the underlying wave as described towards the end of the overview section above this speed correction is also applied to the λbl c spectra to produce a speed corrected baseline spectrum which is referred to as λbc c for baseline corrected fig a1 a and b shows typical examples of the four different spectra λis c λbl c λtb c and λbc c fig a1 a and b shows that the fit between λis c and λtb c is good for young seas and for most speeds for the older seas the noise in the observed λis c for larger values of c in older seas arises from a combination of low breaking probabilities in the peak region for older seas and a limited duration data record in the observations also λis c shows a significant shift of the spectral peak towards shorter slower waves relative to the baseline spectrum λbl c and its spectral peak level has increased this results from the speed binning of the slowing breaker fronts for each of these spectra the spectral fall off towards faster waves follows the reference c 6 dependence predicted by p85 also note that for all the λ c the peak values for the old seas are much lower than for the young seas fig a1 c and d show the fifth moment c 5λ c which underpins the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r sm15a eq 4 their matching plots are shown above in fig 10 the c 5 weighting has changed the spectral peak level differential between λis c and λbl c with the latter now exceeding the former note that after speed correction of λbl c to λbc c the difference between λbc c and λis c is about one order of magnitude for this case it is worth noting that the assessment of the contributions of breaking waves travelling in given speed bands depends on the λ c processing methodology as shown in fig a1 however the actual choice of the nominal speed bands e g c 1 m s for microbreakers does not depend on the λ c processing methodology fig a1 e and f shows the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r after multiplication by the breaking strength parameter b used in sm15a formulated following r12 here it is seen that breaking waves at the spectral peak of the wave height distribution dominate the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r for all four λ c distributions the λbc c breaking dissipation rate is higher in the peak region than λis c but lower for the smaller scale breakers this is also true for the old sea case except spectral peak breaking waves no longer dominate as the older sea peak wave breaking dissipation rates are much lower than for the young seas the cumulative breaking dissipation rate of s d s b r c results from λis c in fig a1 e and f can also be compared by constructing the corresponding normalised cumulative versions of the results these are plotted in fig a2 a and b for young seas in fig a2 a the cumulative dissipation rate of s d s b r c from breaking waves travelling at less than 2 m s is seen to be a small percentage of the total breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r note that the different λ c processing methods have a significant affect for the older wind sea case shown in fig a2 b the breaking waves travelling at speeds less than 2 m s contribute a large percentage of the total breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r it is worth re emphasising that this is only the dissipation rate from wave breaking and that for old seas the dissipation rate from breaking s d s b r is only a small fraction of the total wave dissipation rate sds fig a2 c shows the normalised cumulative dissipation rate due only to breaking s d s b r as a function of mean wave age based on our λbc c spectrum for comparison with the sm15a results based on their λis c spectrum shown in fig 1 above the difference between fig a2 c and d is that fig a2 c is normalised by the spectrally integrated dissipation rate due to breaking s d s b r whereas fig a2 d is normalised by the total wave dissipation rate sds from all sources for old seas red line in fig a2 c the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r is dominated by waves travelling slower than 2 m s but for fig a2 d the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r is a very small fraction of the total for younger seas blue lines fig a2 d shows that breaking is the dominant form of dissipation but waves travelling slower than 2 m s make up at most less than 20 of the total wave dissipation rate sds fig a2 d these results are summarised in fig 7b when fig 8 based on λbc c is compared with fig 7 based on λis c it is seen that the contributions in fig 8 are almost halved relative to fig 7 this indicates an even lower contribution of the microbreakers and small whitecaps to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer 
24109,in ocean wave modelling accurately computing the evolution of the wind wave spectrum depends on the source terms and the spectral bandwidth used the wave dissipation rate source term which spectrally quantifies wave breaking and other dissipative processes remains poorly understood including the spectral bandwidth needed to capture the essential model physics the observational study of sutherland and melville 2015a investigated the relative dissipation rate contributions of breaking waves from large scale whitecaps to microbreakers they concluded that a large fraction of wave energy was dissipated by microbreakers however in strong contrast with their findings our analysis of their data and other recent data sets shows that for young seas microbreakers and small whitecaps contribute only a small fraction of the total breaking wave dissipation rate for older seas we find microbreakers and small whitecaps contribute a large fraction of the breaking wave dissipation rate but this is only a small fraction of the total dissipation rate which is now dominated by non breaking contributions hence for all the wave age conditions observed microbreakers make an insignificant contribution to the total wave dissipation rate in the wave boundary layer we tested the sensitivity of the results to the sm15a whitecap analysis methodology by transforming the sm15a breaking data using our breaking crest processing methodology this resulted in the small scale breaking waves making an even smaller contribution to the total wave dissipation rate and so the result is independent of the breaker processing methodology comparison with other near surface total tke dissipation rate observations also support this conclusion these contributions to the spectral dissipation rate in ocean wave models are small and need not be explicitly resolved 1 introduction the evolution of the wave height spectrum is generally modelled via the radiative transfer equation komen et al 1994 assuming deep water and a slowly varying current φ t u c g φ s w a v e s i n s n l s d s where φ k θ is the directional wave spectrum c g is the group velocity and u is the current the total source term swave sin snl sds where sin is the atmospheric input spectral source term snl is the nonlinear spectral transfer source term representing nonlinear wave wave interactions and sds is the total spectral dissipation rate sds is comprised of a breaking wave contribution s d s b r and a wave dissipation rate component s d s n b associated with allied turbulent boundary layer processes other than breaking waves the latter becomes dominant during old wind sea conditions an important aspect of these three primary source terms is the spectral bandwidth needed to properly capture the underlying physics there is extensive literature on the spectral distribution of the wind input and nonlinear spectral interactions but the relative importance of different wave scales in the wave breaking dissipation rate source term s d s b r has remained elusive the recently developed measurement capability of imaging and analysing microbreakers reported by sutherland and melville 2013 and used in sutherland and melville 2015a hereafter sm15a has made it possible to investigate their relative importance in the dissipation rate source term sds 1 1 breaking wave scales unlike whitecaps breaking gravity capillary and gravity wavelets which do not entrain air have been referred to as microscale breakers hereafter microbreakers e g phillips and banner 1974 in fresh water their wavelengths are reported to range from o 0 05 0 7 m caulliez 2011 salinity and surface tension may modify the breaking induced aeration process possibly influencing reported microscale breaker

the two centre panels in fig 2 of gemmrich et al 2013 confirms the presence of small whitecaps with speeds below 1 m s for representative young and old wind sea conditions note that the whitecap speeds were assigned according to initial breaker front speed from that figure c 1 m s is seen to be a generous upper limit for the speed of microbreakers and the highest whitecap counts were found for 1 c 2 m s with 0 c 1 m s and 2 c 3 m s not much smaller summed over all wave ages given the observed co existence of small whitecaps with microbreakers for c 1 m s we define microbreakers as breaking waves with speed c 1 m s which are predominantly non air entraining assuming the linear dispersion relation this corresponds to wavelengths λ 0 64 m and intrinsic frequencies f 1 55 hz these wavelengths are approximate as the dispersion relation may not be exact for breaking crests see appendix a small air entraining breaking waves hereafter small whitecaps are defined here as those with 1 c 2 m s 0 64 λ 2 56 m and 0 8 f 1 55 hz note that the c 2 m s threshold was chosen by sm15a in their fig 7 replotted in fig 1 to quantify the dissipation rate of contributions from microbreakers the present study aims to review the latest measurements of this poorly understood high wavenumber aspect of the sea surface microstructure and assess its importance for the turbulent dissipation rate εtot in air sea interfacial physics and modelling it is well recognised that turbulent kinetic energy is injected sporadically at the wind driven sea surface under active wave breaking conditions e g craig and banner 1994 melville 1994 terray et al 1996 tke dissipation rates εtot have been linked to air sea gas transfer rates zappa et al 2007 and to sea spray production rates veron 2015 the breaker scale bandwidth and spatio temporal frequencies depend primarily on wind speed and wave age young wind seas experience a higher probability of breaking of longer waves which decreases as the wind seas age for old seas the predominant breaking scale transitions towards small whitecaps and microbreakers gemmrich et al 2013 the spectral distribution of breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r c contributions to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer is not known accurately as robust direct measurements are presently not available understanding the physics and quantifying the total wave dissipation rate s d s k d k in the upper ocean including the wave boundary layer has attracted considerable interest over recent decades the turbulent kinetic energy tke dissipation rate profile ε z decreases rapidly with depth z below the surface and ɛ t o t 20 η ɛ z d z the depth integration of ε z over the wave boundary layer since we are unable to directly measure the wave dissipation rates sds and s d s b r the total tke dissipation rate εtot is used as the best measured estimate of the total wave dissipation rate sds gemmrich 2010 zappa et al 2016 schwendeman et al 2014 who all assumed sds s d s b r there has also been ongoing debate on how well the wave boundary layer is described by turbulent wall layer scaling for which the local tke dissipation rate εwl z at mean depth z below the ocean surface is given by ɛ w l z u w 3 κ z where κ 0 41 is the von karman constant u w is the water side friction velocity e g terray et al 1996 however recent consensus strongly favours a breaking wave enhanced layer for a range of conditions where the near surface tke dissipation rate ε z exceeds the wall layer estimate εwl z by a considerable margin section 1 in sm15a presents a state of the art account of this extensive literature as a lead in to their paper describing their recent measurements and findings on this challenging topic briefly new insights are emerging as a result of novel measurement techniques and analyses reported in recent field investigations sm15a wang et al 2013 these studies have provided comprehensive results for a broad range of open water wind and sea state conditions that link refined subsurface dissipation rate measurements novel surface dissipation rate measurements and co located surface wind and wave properties e g gemmrich 2010 schwendeman et al 2014 sm15a this includes spectrally resolved measurements of whitecap kinematics from which spectral breaking wave dissipation rates s d s b r c can be estimated using phillips 1985 hereafter p85 spectral breaking wave framework and its recent refinements e g banner and morison 2010 romero et al 2012 hereafter r12 these studies revisit key open questions including the dependence of the depth integrated tke dissipation rate εtot on wind speed and wave age with a special focus on the contribution made by breaking waves throughout this paper we use the term wave age to denote the mean wave age cm u parameter adopted in sm15a where u is the wind friction velocity and cm is a characteristic measure of the wind wave speed this wave age was considered in section 2c of sm15a to be more closely related to the breaking wind waves than the usual spectral peak wave age cp u which can be representative of swell here cm g ωm where g is gravity and ωm is the mean frequency computed from the frequency spectrum s ηη ω as ω m 0 ω s η η ω d ω 0 s η η ω d ω in this context the relative importance of the different scales of breaking waves from large whitecaps to microbreakers has emerged as a new element in their recent measurements investigating active whitecap coverage schwendeman and thomson 2015 reported lower correlation with dissipation rate than with wind or wave conditions with residuals showing a strong negative trend with wave age they suggested that the discrepancy is likely due to the increased influence of microbreakers in older wind seas referencing sm15a for justification in this paper we focus on the important issue of the relative contributions of the different breaking wave scales to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer and how this changes for different wave ages based on the recent comprehensive study of sm15a our study investigates the relative importance of the contribution of microbreakers and small whitecaps this topic is of central importance as wave breaking is a key air sea interaction process whose sea surface expression in the form of whitecapping or microbreaking is currently under active investigation in global sea state models it is important to know the shortest resolved wave scale that should be included explicitly or parametrically in order to capture the dominant physics currently ncep s wavewatch iii operational frequencies range from 0 035 hz to 0 96 hz chawla et al 2013 the corresponding speed of 0 96 hz waves is 1 63 m s also there are several important scientific processes and applications associated with this phenomenon including fundamental air sea interfacial fluxes and the utilisation of breaking wave signatures as a remote sensing tool for inferring these fluxes we reanalysed the data of sm15a supplemented by the near zero fetch lake michigan data of wang et al 2013 hereafter w13 this provided new insights on the subsurface dissipation rates ε z of microbreakers and small whitecaps in greater isolation in their more recent data analysis sensitivity study wang and liao 2016 hereafter w16 revisits the same near zero fetch data reported in w13 sm15a suggests and w16 concurs referencing sm15a to justify that the high dissipation rate level observed within o 100 mm of the sea surface is consistent with a large fraction of the wave energy dissipation rate sds being attributed to microbreakers in this paper we review the relative contributions of microbreakers and small whitecaps to the breaking s d s b r and total sds wave dissipation rates in the wave boundary layer 2 key results from sutherland and melville 2015a sm15a combines their novel infrared geometric kinematic breaking wave crest length spectral density measurements λ c from sutherland and melville 2013 with parametric spectral breaking strength coefficients from spectral wind wave modelling r12 to infer the dissipation rate s d s b r c contribution from breaking wave scales ranging from large whitecaps to microbreakers these results are described and reported in detail in sm15a while the breaking front imagery allows extraction of directional distributions of λ c θ the results presented are for the azimuthally integrated distribution λ c 0 2 π c λ c θ d θ the integrated dissipation rate contribution from all resolved breaking wave scales is given by the fifth moment of λ c weighted by the spectral breaking strength coefficient b according to s d s b r s d s b r c d c ρ w g b c 5 λ c d c p85 banner and morison 2010 r12 sm15a where ρw is the water density and g is the gravitational acceleration figs 6 7 and 16 in sm15a provide the basis for our analysis as they contain the data relevant to assessing the relative importance of the microbreaker and small whitecap contributions to both the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r and total wave dissipation rate sds the data from fig 7 in sm15a are redrawn in fig 1 below this figure shows the cumulative integral of the spectral breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r c normalised by the total breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r for each measured wave age case it should be noted that this figure only addresses contributions relative to the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r not to the total wave dissipation rate sds a second key figure underpinning our analysis is fig 16 in sm15a redrawn as fig 2 this shows the measured tke dissipation rate integrated over the top 20 m of the ocean εtot plotted against the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r integrated over all resolved wave scales for a range of wave ages from developing wind seas to old swell as seen on the left side of fig 2 where the total tke dissipation rate εtot is much larger than the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r for old seas there is a contribution to the tke dissipation rate εtot in the wave boundary layer not directly related to breaking but from other hydrodynamical processes these include the influence of surface waves on the reynolds shear and normal stresses from the subsurface turbulence and resulting energy transfer between the waves and the turbulence this is important in quantifying the wave energy dissipation rate s d s n b due to the interaction between non breaking waves and turbulence which is a source of wave damping additional to wave breaking other non breaking sources of turbulence are discussed in sm15a section 6b the recent paper by guo and shen 2014 includes a comprehensive literature review of this topic in the more complex oceanic context sullivan and mcwilliams 2010 highlighted the need to include langmuir turbulence larger wavenumber bandwidth and directional spreading of the surface waves in the non breaking dissipation rate s d s n b contributions in the present paper the background wave dissipation rate s d s n b is taken as that arising from all sources other than turbulence actively injected by breaking waves the key challenges investigated in this paper are to quantify as the seas evolve i the fractional contribution of breaking waves to the total wave dissipation rate sds ii the relative importance of microbreakers and of small whitecaps to the breaking s d s b r and total sds wave dissipation rates 3 reanalysis of the data in section 2 of sutherland and melville 2015a fig 3 indicates that for the high tke dissipation rates εtot in developing wind seas right side of plot wave breaking accounts for almost all of the total tke dissipation rate εtot however for old wind seas left side of plot wave breaking contributes only a small fraction of the total tke dissipation rate εtot using this data the fraction of the dissipation rate contributed by wave breaking s d s b r to the total dissipation rate εtot is plotted against the wave age in fig 4 in fig 4 it is seen that for the younger wind seas the mean breaking dissipation rates inferred from measurements modelling account for the total measured tke dissipation rate εtot within the error bars reported in sm15a however as the seas age this fraction decreases until it becomes insignificant 5 the black dashed line in fig 4 is a linear least squares fit to the sm15a data this data and the fitted black dashed curve extend above the physically allowable maximum value of 1 likely due to measurement modelling uncertainties for our subsequent analysis we replaced the dashed black curve by the solid red line fit which asymptotes to just below 1 a key aspect of fig 1 fig 7 in sm15a is that it does not show the absolute levels for the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r for each of the wave age cases however this information is essential to assess the relative importance of different wave breaking scales to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer we were able to extract this information from the b weighted fifth moment spectra of λ c provided in fig 6 d of sm15a which we integrated this figure is redrawn as fig 5 and was used to plot the cumulative breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r c as a fraction of the total wave breaking dissipation rate εtot in fig 6 in fig 6 d of sm15a the breaking wave dissipation rate is defined as s d s b r c b c 5λ c m3 s 4 in this figure the breaking crest length spectral density λ c was measured in three different field experiments the breaking strength coefficient b is a function of the spectral saturation b unlike in p85 where b was assumed constant we used the same breaking strength formulation as sm15a so that any difference in conclusions does not depend on the choice of b here b b b is calculated following the spectral saturation based breaking strength parameterisation developed by r12 described by eq 5 in sm15a in fig 5 the line colours and corresponding average wave age bins are the same as used in fig 1 while this data is quite noisy due to the variability of b b it is readily integrated to obtain a reasonable estimate of the mean total dissipation rate for each of the average wave age bins in fig 1 using the data in fig 6a together with the average cm u for each bin and the red curve fit in fig 4 the corresponding average total wave dissipation rate sds was calculated for each of the average wave age bins plotted in fig 5 the breaking wave dissipation rate was plotted as a fraction of the total wave dissipation rate against breaker speed c for the wave age bins in figs 1 and 5 and is shown in fig 6b fig 6 highlights the following key points i for young seas the integrated breaking dissipation rate s d s b r is a large percentage of the total dissipation rate sds whereas for old seas it is only a small fraction of the total dissipation rate sds ii for young seas the larger scale breaking waves make a substantial relative contribution to the total wave dissipation rate whereas for old seas only the small breaking waves contribute to the total dissipation rate hence for old wind seas the larger scale breaking waves make a negligible contribution to the wave dissipation rate this can also be seen in fig 5 iii for old seas breaking waves only make a small 10 contribution to the total wave dissipation rate with microbreakers only making a very small contribution also for young seas microbreakers c 1 m s contribute 8 and microbreakers together with small whitecaps c 2 m s make up 26 of the total wave dissipation rate to elucidate further the relative contribution to the total wave dissipation rate made by all breaking wave fronts with speeds below a particular speed the low wave speed results in fig 6 were extracted and replotted in fig 7 fig 7 is a centrepiece figure for this paper and encapsulates some of the major findings which are based on the methodology of sm15a i microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 0 5 and 1 0 m s never contribute more than 3 and 8 of the total wave dissipation rate sds respectively ii small whitecaps plus microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 1 5 and 2 m s never contribute more than about 16 and 26 respectively to the total wave dissipation rate sds iii these contributions reduce to less than 5 for old seas where active breaking only plays a small role in the total wave dissipation rate sds 4 sensitivity to breaking wave image processing methodology this section highlights the results of our alternative λ c extraction methodology described in detail in appendix a we review in detail the sensitivity of the main findings in section 3 of sm15a to the measured λ c processing methodology in brief during active breaking a breaker crest front slows down to about half its initial velocity kleiss and melville 2011 fig 13c gemmrich et al 2013 fig 1 this intrinsic unsteadiness results in a significant difference in the λ c distributions from each method because each method assigns a different velocity to a given detected breaking front in appendix a we describe in detail how our methodology assigns the initial speed of each breaker corrected to the intrinsic speed of the underlying wave in determining the λ c contribution for that breaking event however sm15a assigns the instantaneous speed determined at each video time step of each individual slowing breaking crest front length and builds the λ c distribution from these different speed bins this method progressively assigns the later stages of each evolving breaking crest front length to slower speed bins as the breaker slows down overall this biases their derived λ c distribution to lower wave speeds repeating the calculations in section 3 above using our corrected alternatively processed λ c distribution leads to the results in fig 8 clearly fig 8 not only parallels the results shown in fig 7 and conclusions based on the λ c methodology of sm15a but further diminishes the role of the microbreakers using our transformed λ c i microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 0 5 and 1 0 m s never contribute more than 1 and 3 of the total wave dissipation rate sds respectively ii small whitecaps combined with microbreakers travelling at speeds less than 1 5 and 2 m s never contribute more than about 6 and 15 respectively iii these contributions reduce to less than 2 for old seas where active breaking only plays a small role in the total wave dissipation rate sds thus comparing the results in figs 7 and 8 indicates that both methodologies lead to the same conclusion that microscale breakers never contribute significantly to the total wave dissipation rate sds for any wave age with our λ c methodology strongly supporting these conclusions 5 comparison with near surface total dissipation rate observations it is of fundamental interest to relate these ir imagery based and visible breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r estimates with the measured total tke dissipation rate εtot from vertical profiles in the open ocean wave boundary layer sm15a provides a comprehensive data set of the latter comprising both fixed and floating aquadopp deployments for a range of wind and sea state conditions ranging from developing to very mature seas to complement their subsurface measurements a novel surface vorticity approach using ir piv measurements sutherland and melville 2015b hereafter sm15b was used to quantify the total tke dissipation rate εtot at the air sea interface the sm15a subsurface measurements approached within o 70 mm of the sea surface leaving a shallow but energetically significant near surface layer with no measurements in this unresolved layer a strong increase in the tke dissipation rate ε z towards the surface is required to match to the sm15a ir measured surface levels does the dissipation rate from microbreakers and or small whitecaps explain this high near surface dissipation rate we investigate this further by collating results from two studies where the tke dissipation rate εtot from microbreakers and small whitecaps was measured in isolation from the longer waves and background subsurface dissipation rate ε z present in open ocean studies as such they are able to capture the order of magnitude of the contributions to the total wave dissipation rate sds from the very short breakers when they are at the spectral peak for wind speeds corresponding to the open ocean tke dissipation rate εtot data as shown below fig 9 shows the sm15a open ocean tke dissipation rate ε z profiles with depth for the wide range of wind speed and wave age conditions observed also shown superposed in fig 9 are two additional data sets of w13 and siddiqui and loewen 2007 hereafter sl07 that provide significant insight on the indicative strength of the microbreaker and small whitecap contributions to the subsurface tke dissipation rate ε z profile with depth when suitably integrated over depth their relative contribution to the total tke dissipation rate εtot in the wave boundary layer can then be estimated the detailed study of sl07 is included as it used simultaneous dpiv digital particle image velocimetry and infrared imagery to investigate the tke dissipation rate ε z profile in near surface flows immediately below laboratory wind waves at a fetch of 5 5 m and wind speeds from 4 5 to 11 m s u10 6 3 to 18 6 m s these conditions produced short steep microbreakers with wavelengths from 60 mm to 180 mm the depth integrated tke dissipation rate εtot was found to be significantly greater than would occur in a comparable rough wall layer flow the closest field counterparts to the sl07 laboratory study are by w13 and w16 which adapted the sl07 dpiv technique for use in open waters profiles of tke dissipation rate ε z were measured in a field experiment in lake michigan under a near zero fetch condition for different wind speeds and a short open water fetch condition for a single low wind speed condition they were able to measure the structure of turbulence in the wave boundary layer to obtain tke dissipation rate ε z data up to the instantaneous water surface using a free floating underwater miniature dpiv system their surface following configuration allowed measurements of the aqueous side turbulence statistics in the topmost layer immediately below the water surface down to a local depth of 150 mm different data analysis methods to estimate the tke dissipation rate ε z were compared which yielded consistent tke dissipation rate ε z profiles within reasonable scatter bounds tke dissipation rate ε z profiles were measured for a variety of wind and wave conditions w16 suggested that the strong surface skin layer dissipation rate may be attributed to microbreaking referencing sm15a suggested that 20 90 of the surface dissipation could be attributed to the non air entraining breakers and its downward transport in the water column for reference table 1 summarises the key properties of the lake michigan and laboratory data sets discussed here fig 9 shows the large contrast between the sm15a open ocean profile data in comparison with the w13 lake michigan data and the sl07 laboratory data at the same depth for similar wind speeds for illustration for the u10 12 m s data at a common depth of 0 1 m the open ocean tke dissipation rate ε z level is o 30 times stronger than both the lake michigan near zero fetch data and the laboratory data this trend is observed for all the wind speeds shown the collation of the available subsurface tke dissipation rate ε z profile results from these lake laboratory and open ocean data sets shown in fig 9 can be displayed for specific wind speed bands this more clearly highlights the relative importance of microbreaker and small whitecap contributions to the observed tke dissipation rate ε z profile in the open ocean wave boundary layer the figures provide a valuable complementary basis for verifying results and conclusions based on the breaking wave analysis these figures highlight key differences between typical tke dissipation rate ε z profiles in laboratory and extremely short fetch open water conditions for corresponding wind speeds for each of the wind speed bands shown the indicative contributions of the near zero fetch data are both lower in strength and shallower in depth by 1 5 2 orders of magnitude however the low wind speed band 4 m s is only about 1 order of magnitude lower integrated values for these tke dissipation rate ε z profile data in the upper 100 mm of the surface layer for the microscale breaker and small whitecap dissipation rate contributions are shown in fig 11 a to be able to make meaningful comparisons with the sm15a results the data was extrapolated to 20 m depth following the sm15a section 6a methodology which assumed a depth dependence of z 2 the cumulative depth integrals of these extrapolations are shown in fig 11b these profiles are used to estimate the total tke dissipation rate εtot from each of the lake michigan field data sets for different wind speed cases these total tke dissipation rate εtot levels were then compared with the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r estimates for different short breaking wave bandwidths based on the results described in section 3 above fig 12 shows the relationship between wind speed and wave age for the sm15a data the black line shows a fitted curve which was used to transform the cumulative results in fig 6a to be a function of wind speed rather than wave age since the w13 data were collected at near zero fetch there are no larger waves and the breaking waves are only microbreakers small whitecaps hence it is impractical to plot the data against wave age using the black curve in fig 12 we transformed the sm15a data in fig 6a together with the breaker s d s b r and measured tke dissipation rate εtot data from fig 3 to show their wind speed dependence this is plotted in fig 13 which encapsulates the main results of this study on the relative importance of microbreakers and small whitecaps to the upper ocean dissipation rate εtot for the range of wind speed conditions observed in sm15a fig 13 compares the relative levels of the total dissipation rate in i the uppermost 20 m of the ocean ii from microscale and small whitecaps at near zero fetch extrapolated to 20 m depth iii from all resolved breaking wave scales iv from microbreakers c 1 m s and v from microbreakers and small whitecaps c 2 m s fig 13 shows that the overall ordering of these contributions is both plausible and self consistent it is seen that the integrated dissipation rate from all breaking waves s d s b r cyan line matches the total dissipation rate εtot red line for the youngest sea conditions where the wind speeds were higher this progressively reduces towards the lower wind speed older sea states where the background turbulence level from other sources increasingly dominates over the whole range of observations the microbreaker dissipation rate fractional contribution blue line is seen to be o 1 while the combined fractional contribution of microbreakers and small whitecaps with c 2 m s is typically 5 with our alternative processing methodology see fig 8 these contributions are halved the comparable breaking wave dissipation rates reported in sm15a are shown for microbreakers c 1 m s and for microbreakers and small whitecaps c 2 m s the elevated data point at u 3 m s is a single measurement in the lake at a short but finite fetch 1 2 km where the background dissipation rate s d s n b exceeded the breaking wave contribution s d s b r 6 sources of uncertainty several sources of uncertainty underpin the results in the complex suite of measurements and analyses utilised by sm15a these are discussed in sm15a or in various allied papers by these authors and their collaborators for example fig 16 in sm15a documents the uncertainty in their integrated dissipation rate εtot measurements which can be up to one order of magnitude fig 10 in sm15b provides relative uncertainty estimates associated with the estimation of the surface dissipation rate ε z kleiss and melville 2011 discuss various uncertainties associated with extracting crest length spectral density distributions from sea surface visible imagery with sm13 providing a counterpart for infrared imagery this aspect includes the contentious issue of breaking front speed assignment for which uncertainty aspects are investigated in detail in appendix a in estimating spectral breaking wave dissipation rates s d s b r c a spectral breaking strength formulation is needed this quantity has a significant uncertainty as is evident from the paper by r12 we avoided this uncertainty by using the same spectral breaking strength data used by sm15a which was based on r12 however this quantity remains a source of significant uncertainty with a potentially large impact on breaking dissipation rate s d s b r estimates as pointed out in the discussion of fig 4 above note that these estimates ignore the contribution of parasitic capillary waves to the overall dissipation rate which none of the discussed methods are able to resolve there is also some uncertainty in the non wave related dissipation contribution to the total tke dissipation rate εtot as discussed in section 6b of sm15a 7 conclusions spectral representations of wave breaking physics are fundamental to modelling the evolution of natural wind wave spectra and air sea interfacial fluxes it is important to determine what frequencies need to be resolved in models to capture the necessary source term energy fluxes to this end we revisited the findings of recent field studies on surface and near surface tke dissipation rates ε z in the presence of breaking waves these novel studies embrace surface measurements of the contributions from microbreakers and small whitecaps and their relation to the subsurface tke measurements ε z using acoustic doppler and dpiv techniques immediately below the sea surface we reviewed the data analysis methodology used by sm15a which we used to assess the contribution of microbreakers wave speeds up to 1 m s and small whitecaps wave speeds from 1 2 m s to the total wave dissipation rate sds based on our analysis and the subsurface dpiv studies by w13 we conclude that the contributions of microbreakers and small whitecaps to the total wave dissipation rate sds during active wind wave generation conditions is far weaker than suggested by sm15a and is only ever of marginal importance more specifically for young developing wind seas the contributions of microbreakers to the total wave dissipation rate sds is small compared with the contribution from larger scale breakers for young developing wind seas the contributions of small whitecaps to the total wave dissipation rate sds depends on the breaking crest length processing methodology using sm15a methodology small whitecaps contribute up to 20 of the total dissipation rate sds while with our methodology this reduces to a maximum of 12 for low wind speeds old seas microbreakers and small whitecaps dominate the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r contribution however the non breaking dissipation rate s d s n b is an order of magnitude larger than the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r for high wind speeds young seas microbreakers and small whitecaps make a much smaller contribution to the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r uncertainty in the small breaking wave contributions c 2 m s to the total wave dissipation rate sds results from differences in breaker image processing techniques and uncertainty in the spectral breaking strength coefficient noting that the corresponding frequency for c 1 m s is 1 6 hz and for c 2 m s is 0 78 hz we estimate that the computational bandwidth used operationally in wavewatch iii which spans from 0 035 to 0 96 hz will capture at least 95 of the breaking wave dissipation rate the source of the observed elevated dissipation rate levels ε z in the uppermost 100 mm of the wave boundary layer remains to be determined overall in regard to the breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r and total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer the contributions from microbreakers are negligible and from small whitecaps are secondary while they may well be important for other processes these wavenumber scales do not need to be resolved in

clearer appendix a impact of alternative λ c extraction methodology this appendix reviews the sensitivity of the main findings in section 3 of sm15a to the measured λ c processing methodology a 1 breaking wave scale three methods for analysing breaking wave video imagery are currently used to extract λ c from video of breaking waves at sea with the most appropriate method still to be decided during active breaking a breaker crest front slows down to about half its initial velocity kleiss and melville 2011 fig 13c gemmrich et al 2013 fig 1 this intrinsic unsteadiness results in a significant difference in the λ c distributions from each method because each method assigns a different velocity to a given detected breaking front we emphasize that the primary purpose of the λ c distribution in p85 was to provide the basis for an accurate unbiased estimate of the wave energy dissipation rate from breaking according to wave scale the p85 spectral breaking wave framework uses breaking front velocity c b to characterise the wave scale of each breaker analysed unsteady aspects of c b are not considered in p85 in building the λ c b distribution as this relates to the whitecap front behaviour as a spilling plume not to the scale of the wave that is breaking since an active breaker develops on a wave crest which travels at speed c p85 assumed cb c which is taken as the speed at which the whitecap front travels and determines the breaker scale this is the cb adopted by zappa et al 2012 gemmrich et al 2013 amongst others however further refinement is involved in relating cb to c as discussed in a 2 below sm15a section 3 used a different method kleiss and melville 2011 which bins the time dependent history of each breaker front according to its instantaneous velocity the instantaneous λ c contribution from each breaking front during its active lifetime is distributed to a bandwidth of slower velocity bins down to o 50 of its initial velocity the ensemble of these individual partitionings constitutes their λ c spectra full details are given in sutherland and melville 2013 and its supplementary annexe note that this methodology shifts their λ c to lower wave speeds causing a systematic bias of the breaking dissipation rate spectrum to the shorter wave scales assuming the linear dispersion relation this also results in a weighted redistribution of λ k the spectral breaking dissipation rate contribution from each breaker is redistributed from its initial breaking wavenumber to shorter scales up to o 4 times its initial wavenumber since the speed of the spilling crest front does not directly relate to the speed of each wave that is breaking this precludes the use of the linear dispersion relation to convert breaker speed to wavenumber if either λ c or λ k is used to estimate higher order moments such as sds via eq 4 in sm15a it also distorts the sds distribution a third method based on whitecap processing in the image spectral fft domain thomson and jessup 2007 was used by thomson et al 2009 while this method significantly reduces data analysis effort it is also influenced by breaker front slowdown and has windowing issues with aliasing beyond the measured bandwidth schwendeman et al 2014 this method is mentioned for reference only and not investigated here a 2 generic wave crest slowdown the generic crest speed slowdown mechanism banner et al 2014 clearly affects the initial breaker front speed allis 2013 chapter 7 fig 7 10 made frame by frame video measurements of breaking wave packets in a wave basin these show that the leading edge of 2d and 3d spilling breakers initially advances at a mean rate of 0 87 0 08 c 0 where c 0 is the equivalent linear wave speed of the underlying wave this observed generic breaking front speed of 0 87c 0 should be taken into account when assigning the correct wave speed scale c for the λ c extracted from video measurements the observed 13 mean speed reduction requires a 15 increase 1 0 87 1 15 in the initial speed attributed to a given breaking event to match the linear speed of the underlying wave this shifts the observed λ c distribution towards higher speeds this is important if the data is transformed to λ k distributions for comparison with standard spectral wave model output as it results in a systematic shift to o 30 lower wavenumbers after applying the generic slowdown correction determined by allis 2013 we now suppress the b subscript in cb and adopt c as the appropriate speed corrected measure of the wave scale with the corresponding spatial wavenumber k given by the linear dispersion relation in summary in physical space the assignment of speed c to a given breaker is found by tracing the breaking front speed sequence back to the speed of the initial breaking which is then increased by 15 to account for the generic crest slowdown a 3 impact on λ c spectra and resultant breaking dissipation rates this subsection assesses the impact of the two factors identified in a 1 and a 2 on the λ c distributions and on the allied results for spectral breaking dissipation rate contributions as shown in fig 6 a in section 3 of sm15a our first goal was to reconstruct as closely as possible the λ c spectra consistent with the p85 framework hereafter labelled λbl c denoting base line λ the instantaneous speed binned hereafter isb transformed λ c reported by sm15a hereafter labelled λis c cannot be inverted explicitly so we applied an iterative isb transformation to a set of trial λbl spectra to emulate the sm15a methodology described above this transformed baseline λ is labelled λtb c if the initial guess for the λbl c is correct then the λtb c will closely match the λis c the trial spectral function λbl c before modification by the sm15a isb process was modelled as having the form a1 λ bl c r c c n where r is an assumed spectral roll off function at slow wave speeds and c n is an assumed power law fall off that follows the measured overall trend forms for r and values for n were refined by successive iteration so that the isb transformed λtb c spectra matched as closely as possible the λis c spectra reported by sm15a derived from their measurements for each wave age banded case we formulated a base λbl c spectral function corresponding to the p85 framework as specified above eq a1 based on the measured breaker properties reported in fig 13 of kleiss and melville 2011 we applied a cosine weighted spectral function filter that redistributes the initial breaker crest speed c max from c max to 0 5c max peaking at about 0 75c max our equivalent λ spectral weighting starts at c max and redistributes the spectral density by a cosine window that varies from 0 5 at c max to 1 at 0 75c max and reduces to 0 5 at 0 5c max these weightings were then normalised so that their sum was 1 applying this window successively to our base spectrum λbl c starting at c max and moving sequentially towards slower speeds reshapes to lower speeds the initial base spectrum λbl c to the transformed baseline spectra λtb c for comparison with the λis c spectra shown fig 6 a of sm15a by successive iteration where the exponent n and the parameters in the function r eq a1 are tweaked a close correspondence was achieved between the λtb c and the corresponding λis c spectrum reported for each different wave age band in sm15a other choices of weighting distribution functions that spread the front speed over 0 5 to 1 only marginally altered the result further from allis 2013 ch 7 p 190 below fig 7 10 the observed breaker crest front speed c c is only 0 87 of the actual underlying linear wave speed and so the c dependence in λbl c needs to be replaced by c 1 15c 0 to match it to the actual wave speed of the underlying wave as described towards the end of the overview section above this speed correction is also applied to the λbl c spectra to produce a speed corrected baseline spectrum which is referred to as λbc c for baseline corrected fig a1 a and b shows typical examples of the four different spectra λis c λbl c λtb c and λbc c fig a1 a and b shows that the fit between λis c and λtb c is good for young seas and for most speeds for the older seas the noise in the observed λis c for larger values of c in older seas arises from a combination of low breaking probabilities in the peak region for older seas and a limited duration data record in the observations also λis c shows a significant shift of the spectral peak towards shorter slower waves relative to the baseline spectrum λbl c and its spectral peak level has increased this results from the speed binning of the slowing breaker fronts for each of these spectra the spectral fall off towards faster waves follows the reference c 6 dependence predicted by p85 also note that for all the λ c the peak values for the old seas are much lower than for the young seas fig a1 c and d show the fifth moment c 5λ c which underpins the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r sm15a eq 4 their matching plots are shown above in fig 10 the c 5 weighting has changed the spectral peak level differential between λis c and λbl c with the latter now exceeding the former note that after speed correction of λbl c to λbc c the difference between λbc c and λis c is about one order of magnitude for this case it is worth noting that the assessment of the contributions of breaking waves travelling in given speed bands depends on the λ c processing methodology as shown in fig a1 however the actual choice of the nominal speed bands e g c 1 m s for microbreakers does not depend on the λ c processing methodology fig a1 e and f shows the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r after multiplication by the breaking strength parameter b used in sm15a formulated following r12 here it is seen that breaking waves at the spectral peak of the wave height distribution dominate the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r for all four λ c distributions the λbc c breaking dissipation rate is higher in the peak region than λis c but lower for the smaller scale breakers this is also true for the old sea case except spectral peak breaking waves no longer dominate as the older sea peak wave breaking dissipation rates are much lower than for the young seas the cumulative breaking dissipation rate of s d s b r c results from λis c in fig a1 e and f can also be compared by constructing the corresponding normalised cumulative versions of the results these are plotted in fig a2 a and b for young seas in fig a2 a the cumulative dissipation rate of s d s b r c from breaking waves travelling at less than 2 m s is seen to be a small percentage of the total breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r note that the different λ c processing methods have a significant affect for the older wind sea case shown in fig a2 b the breaking waves travelling at speeds less than 2 m s contribute a large percentage of the total breaking wave dissipation rate s d s b r it is worth re emphasising that this is only the dissipation rate from wave breaking and that for old seas the dissipation rate from breaking s d s b r is only a small fraction of the total wave dissipation rate sds fig a2 c shows the normalised cumulative dissipation rate due only to breaking s d s b r as a function of mean wave age based on our λbc c spectrum for comparison with the sm15a results based on their λis c spectrum shown in fig 1 above the difference between fig a2 c and d is that fig a2 c is normalised by the spectrally integrated dissipation rate due to breaking s d s b r whereas fig a2 d is normalised by the total wave dissipation rate sds from all sources for old seas red line in fig a2 c the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r is dominated by waves travelling slower than 2 m s but for fig a2 d the breaking dissipation rate s d s b r is a very small fraction of the total for younger seas blue lines fig a2 d shows that breaking is the dominant form of dissipation but waves travelling slower than 2 m s make up at most less than 20 of the total wave dissipation rate sds fig a2 d these results are summarised in fig 7b when fig 8 based on λbc c is compared with fig 7 based on λis c it is seen that the contributions in fig 8 are almost halved relative to fig 7 this indicates an even lower contribution of the microbreakers and small whitecaps to the total wave dissipation rate sds in the wave boundary layer
