krill euphausia superba is the largest species of biological resources on earth and it is estimated a potential stock abundance of 100 million tons atkinson et al 2009 nowadays antarctic krill remains one of the largest underexploited stocks in the world nicol et al 2012 therefore there are potentials for further development and utilization antarctic krill is rich in protein and fat and is the largest renewable animal protein bank krill oil is of high quality with the effect of preventing disease and enhancing immune system costanzo et al 2016 sustainable utilization with sound management will ensure its long term contribution to the supply of healthy seafood or premium feed for cultured animals both are essential for a growing world population antarctic krill is mainly distributed in the waters around the edge of the continental shelf most of them live in the surface layer within 150 m kawaguchi and nicol 2007 and their swimming ability is not strong according to the living habits of antarctic krill the pelagic trawl aiming fishing method is mainly adopted at present atkinson et al 2008 commercial harvesting of antarctic krill started in the 1970s norway has dominated landing of antarctic krill since 2010 in 2014 norway landed about 166 000 tons of krill about 58 of total landing followed by republic of korea and china nicol and foster 2016 china started fishing for antarctic krill in 2009 the mismatching of trawler otter board and trawl has mainly led to low catch rate and energy efficiency which increases fuel consumption and cost of operation comprehensive understanding related to the antarctic krill trawl system would contribute to efficient utilization of the biological resources and lower environmental impact from the fishing operation the methods for studying hydrodynamic performance of fishing gear include model testing numerical simulation and full scale tests at sea nguyen et al 2015 hu et al 1995 analyzed mathematically the dynamic properties of a midwater trawl system which was composed of a trawler trawl net otter boards and warp the effects of changing towing speed and warp length on the system dynamics were demonstrated wan et al 2002a used the finite element method to analyze the static response of fishing nets and ropes in a uniform current solving the nonlinear equilibrium equation of flexible gear structure and calculating equilibrium configuration and tension distribution of longlines plane nets gillnets and a newly designed antarctic krill trawl in a uniform flow the accuracy of the numerical method was then verified by flume tank experiments wan et al 2002b 2004 2019 chen et al 2014 proposed a mathematical model based on lumped mass method to describe the behavior of trawl system in order to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of large mid water trawl system the effects of towing speed and warp length on net position and net opening spread and tension distribution of the trawl were studied and the accuracy of the mathematical model was verified by sea test priour and prada 2015 founded a trawl system based on finite element method the model of the net was founded according to a triangle element and the door was modeled by a rectangle the influence of catch weight on the performance of the trawl was studied by numerical simulation and the results of numerical simulation were verified by sea experiment su et al 2017 analyzed the effects of towing speed and warp length on the net position and net opening height by full scale measurement at sea as a vital component of trawl system the hydrodynamic performance of otter board has been elaborated by many researchers fukuda et al 1997 1999 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of a biplane type otter board based on model test in circulating water tank and analyzed the effect of aspect and camber ratio it was found the otter board at camber ratio of 15 had the maximum lift coefficient and the hydrodynamic performance of the biplane type otter board was better than that of the ordinary type yamasaki et al 2007 evaluated the hydrodynamic characteristics of the conventional otter board used in ise wan bay and a new designed high lift v type otter board by model tests and sea trials it was shown that the drag coefficient of the v type otter board was smaller and the lift drag ratio was larger than the conventional rectangular otter board balash et al 2015 developed a batwing otter board and its hydrodynamic performance was explored by flume model test it was found that the lift drag ratio was greater than 3 at low angle of attack 20 mchugh et al 2015 conducted experiments and compared the engineering and catching performances of the designed otter board termed the batwing against three conventional designs the results showed that the batwings had up to 86 and 18 less bottom contact and drag respectively compared to the conventional otter boards shen et al 2015 carried out flume experiments and investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of a hyper lift trawl door hltd which consisted of a cambered plate with two wing end plates with the leading edge modified into an airfoil shape in previous studies the hydrodynamic performances of a newly designed antarctic krill trawl without otter board and warp were analyzed for the limitation in the size of the flume tank wan et al 2019 however more work on the effects of otter board and warp needs to be done in order to study the hydrodynamic performance for example net position and spreading performance of the antarctic krill trawl system more comprehensively in this paper a muti wing vertical cambered otter board was developed and its hydrodynamic performance was studied by means of wind tunnel model test the numerical model of an antarctic krill trawl system composed of trawler cable otter board and trawl was established based on finite element method the hydrodynamic performance of the antarctic krill trawl system was explored by means of numerical simulation and full scale measurement at sea in addition the simulated results were compared with the experimental results in order to assess the validity of numerical simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 numerical method 2 1 1 description and modeling of the antarctic krill trawl a four panel diamond mesh antarctic krill trawl of 200 m 114 m was studied in this paper a 1 25 scale λ 25 model of the trawl was manufactured based on tauti s law with the small scale ratio λ 5 more detailed information of the full scale trawl the model trawl and the fishing vessel was provided in the previous paper wan et al 2019 the numerical model of antarctic krill trawl was established based on finite element method the trawl system is made up of nets legs warps and other gears for example otter boards the net is a regular reticulated structure that is composed of a series of mesh bars the cable can be divided into several segments both mesh bar and cable segment are considered as straight discrete elements fig 1 thus the whole trawl system is discretized into finite elements wang and shao 1997 if we call each end of the element a node accordingly the antarctic krill trawl can be modeled as an assembling of the discrete elements articulated at their nodes wan et al 2004 2 1 2 basic equation the total potential energy π of the discrete trawl system can be expressed as follows wan et al 2004 1 π i 1 f f i d i g 1 m t g l g d i l g 0 g 1 m l g 0 2 e a g t g 2 where f i is the equivalent nodal load on the ith node d i is the nodal displacement of the ith node t g is the axial force of the gth element l g0 is the initial length of the gth element l g is the length of the gth element after deformation a g is cross section area of the gth element e is the young s modulus of the material f is the nodal degree of freedom and m is the number of the element according to the principle of minimum potential energy the total potential energy becomes an absolute minimum when the system is under equilibrium state i e π d i 0 and π t g 0 in order to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equation the newton raphson method is adopted wan et al 2004 2 1 3 hydrodynamic loading model the structure is subjected to many loads under the action of water including those resulting from gravity weight and buoyancy hydrodynamic loads and other kinds of external actions the hydrodynamic load of the trawl is calculated as the sum of the hydrodynamic load acting on each element the hydrodynamic load acting on the element is calculated by the hydrodynamic loading model which is the truss model the cross flow principle is applied hoerner 1965 as shown in fig 2 the current velocity v is divided into two components the normal component v n and the tangential component v t the normal drag coefficient c n and the tangential drag coefficient c t are calculated as follows choc and casarella 1971 2 c n 1 1 4 r e n 0 50 30 r e n 2 33 10 5 3 c t π μ 0 55 r e n 1 2 0 084 r e n 2 3 c n and c t are calculated according to reynolds number re n where re n ρv n d μ ρ is the density of the fluid d is the diameter of the element μ is the coefficient of fluid viscosity the normal hydrodynamic load f n of the truss element is calculated as 4 f n 1 2 c n ρ d l v n v n where l is the length of the element the tangential hydrodynamic load f t has similar expression form 2 1 4 description and modeling of the otter board antarctic krill trawl belongs to pelagic single trawling net which needs to match the otter board with better hydrodynamic performance i e with larger lift coefficient for providing spreading force in horizontal direction and larger lift drag ratio for improving the energy utilization efficiency of the trawl and more appropriate weight for maintaining the trawl in a certain water layer based on the previous research a multi wing vertical cambered otter board was designed in this paper as shown in fig 3 a geometrically similar physical model scale 1 10 of the otter board was manufactured the main characteristic parameters were given in table 1 the camber ratio was defined as the ratio of the distance from mid arc to the chord to the length of the chord there were two deflectors d1 and d2 with the same camber ratio of 12 in addition the camber ratios of the main panels p1 and p2 were 15 and 12 respectively the installation angle α was defined as the angle between the chord and the horizontal direction the chords of the deflectors and main panels were 0 0625 m 0 0625 m 0 2105 m and 0 1250 m respectively and the distances between deflectors and main panels were 0 18b and 0 24b respectively with the distance between deflector and main panel of 0 18b the otter board shown in fig 4 is simplified to a rectangle in the model priour and prada 2015 the forces on the otter board are the weight 2900 kg buoyancy 231 kg and hydrodynamic forces drag force and lift force as follows 5 f d 1 2 c d ρ s v 2 6 f l 1 2 c l ρ s v 2 where f d and f l represent drag force and lift force of the otter board respectively c d and c l represent drag coefficient and lift coefficient of the otter board respectively s is the plane area of the otter board v is the towing speed the whole trawl system was scaled with the same ratio of the trawl model and mesh grouping method was employed in order to reduce computational complexity the method consisted of modeling a given number of actual meshes by a fictitious equivalent mesh the equivalent mesh had the same physical qualities as the actual meshes such as the projected area of the netting the specific mass the weight and so on li et al 2006 according to tauti s law the numerical simulation results were converted into the actual results most characteristic parameters were based on the actual fishing operation at sea and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the otter board were obtained from model test main characteristic parameters were provided in table 2 2 2 wind tunnel model test in order to obtain the drag coefficient and lift coefficient of the otter board a series of physical model tests were conducted at the nh 2 low speed wind tunnel at nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics china the basic setup of the wind tunnel model test was shown in fig 5 the size of the test section was 6 m length 2 5 m width 3 m height the otter board model was connected to the six component mechanical tower balance through a connecting rod the wind speed was set to 28 m s to ensure that the reynolds number 0 62 106 was in the self modeling area 103 107 and similar to the reynolds number in actual operation in that case the boundary layer separated steadily at the tip of the board edge forming vortices and the flow pattern was stable the hydrodynamic coefficient of the otter board will become constant strictly wang et al 2017 zhou and xu 2018 the angle of attack aoa of the otter board was set to 0 70 aoa changing from 0 to 50 with a step of 2 5 changing from 50 to 70 with a step of 5 2 3 sea trial sea trials were carried out in the area 48 and 58 in antarctic water fig 6 during march april 2016 and january march 2018 the fishing vessel was equipped with depth gauge dr 1050 and gps for net position and towing speed measurement the operation and tension measurement of warp were conducted by atw system 2 4 data processing the drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l of the otter board are calculated according to the follow formulas 7 c d 2 f d w ρ a s v w 2 8 c l 2 f l w ρ a s v w 2 where f dw and f lw represent drag force and lift force of the otter board model in wind tunnel test respectively ρ a is the density of the air 1 225 kg m3 s is the plane area of the otter board model v w is the wind speed in addition the lift drag ratio is defined as the ratio of lift coefficient to drag coefficient which represents the energy efficiency of the otter board the drag force of trawl model from numerical simulation can be converted to the value from measurement at sea however the converted drag force base on tauti s law is considerably larger than the measured drag forces because the drag coefficient of the trawl will change with the reynolds number therefore it is necessary to correct the model rule hu et al 2001 suggested that the velocity scale of modified tauti s law λ v can be express as 9 λ v λ n 1 2 n where n is the power of the reynolds number re with which the drag coefficient of the trawl varies detailed theoretical analysis can be found in the appendix in this paper it was assumed that the drag coefficient of the trawl c d was expressed as an exponential function of the reynolds number re based on the twine diameter by referring to the results fridman 1973 miyazaki and takahashi 1964 so then c d was 10 c d k re n where k is a function due to the mesh solidity re ρvd μ c d is calculated by the following formula hu and matuda 1991b 11 c d 2 r ρ s t v 2 where r is drag force of the trawl s t is total area of the twine 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic performance of the otter board drag coefficient lift coefficient and lift drag ratio of the otter board were shown in fig 7 it appeared quite clearly that the drag coefficient increased as the aoa increased and the lift coefficient increased firstly and then decreased as the aoa increased when the aoa was equal to 40 the lift coefficient reached the maximum value c l max 2 68 the lift drag ratio also presented a trend of increasing firstly and then decreasing and the maximum lift drag ratio was 4 13 when the aoa was 20 the working aoa of the otter board was inferred ranging from 20 to 30 to ensure greater lift force and lift drag ratio antarctic krill swimming ability is not strong so towing speed of trawl should not be too fast the trawlers for antarctic krill usually operate at towing speed of 2 3 kn under this condition the drag and lift force of the otter board were calculated according to eqs 5 and 6 where the hydrodynamic coefficient were obtained from wind tunnel model test the results were presented in fig 8 when aoa was equal to 30 the drag force of the otter board was about 13 kn and the lift force was about 46 kn at the towing speed of 3 kn 3 2 drag force the relationship of the drag coefficient c d of the trawl to reynolds number re was shown in fig 9 as can be seen from the result the drag coefficient of the trawl decreased with the increase of the reynolds number and n was equal to 0 25 the speed corresponding relationship between the model and the full scale was redefined according to the modified velocity scale based on that the converted drag force from numerical simulation was corrected the drag forces of the trawl from numerical simulation were compared with the simulated drag forces after correction and the drag forces from full scale measurement the results were shown in fig 10 it was obvious that the drag forces from numerical simulation were far greater than the measured values however the simulated values after correction were much closer to the measured values therefore it is necessary to correct the converted drag force according to the modified model rule after correction the drag forces were reduced by about 55 and the average relative error between the measured values and the simulated values was about 7 3 3 net position net position was defined as the position of the center of net opening and sea level was defined as 0 in the process of fishing operation antarctic krill is not always in the same water depth position the adjustment of net position corresponding to the distribution of antarctic krill will become one of the key technologies affecting the efficiency of fishing gear fig 11 showed the net position at different towing speeds when the warp length was 120 m it was worth noting that the numerical simulation results showed that the net position tended to rise with the increase of towing speed which could be seen from fig 12 the net position rose from 47 m to 31 m with the towing speed increasing from 2 1 kn to 3 kn the numerical simulation values varied basically within the range of the measured values and the average relative error between the experimental values and the simulated values was about 5 7 therefore the accuracy of the numerical simulation was verified 3 4 the relationships between the parameters of the numerical model the relationships between the parameters of the numerical model were shown in fig 13 the aoa of the otter board was 20 with the warp length of 120 m and the leg length of 80 m at the towing speed of 2 5 kn the relationships between the parameters were obtained when the trawl system became stable the geometries formed by warps and legs were approximately considered as isosceles triangle and isosceles trapezoid therefore the angle of warp θ 1 θ 5 and the angle of leg θ 2 θ 6 could be determined where sinθ 1 h 1 l 1 30 8 118 8 θ 1 15 sinθ 3 h 2 2l 2 10 6 2 79 θ 2 2θ 3 7 6 sinθ 4 h 3 2l 3 24 2 115 3 θ 5 2θ 4 12 sinθ 6 h 3 h 4 2l 4 24 15 3 2 78 9 θ 6 3 3 5 the effect of warp length on the behavior of krill trawl the effects of warp length leg length and aoa of otter board on the behavior of krill trawl net position spread of otter board and spreading performance of net opening were explored by means of numerical simulation the effects of the warp length on the behavior of the trawl were shown in fig 14 it could be seen that the towing speed and warp length had an obvious effect on the net position the net position declined with the increase of warp length and rose with the increase of the towing speed at the towing speed of 3 kn the net position declined from 24 m to 91 m with the warp length increasing from 100 m to 300 m the net position rose from 38 m to 24 m at the warp length of 100 m as the towing speed increased from 2 kn to 3 kn as the warp length increased the spread of otter board and the horizontal distance of wing end increased and the height of net opening decreased when the warp length increased from 100 m to 300 m at the towing speed of 3 kn the spread of otter board increased from 24 m to 46 m and the horizontal distance of wing end increased from 14 m to 21 m while the height of net opening decreased from 19 m to 14 m with the increase of the towing speed the spread of otter board and the horizontal distance of wing end increased but the height of net opening decreased as the towing speed increased from 2 kn to 3 kn at the warp length of 100 m the spread of otter board increased from 24 m to 27 m the horizontal distance of wing end increased from 13 m to 14 m the height of net opening decreased from 24 m to 19 m 3 6 the effect of leg length on the behavior of krill trawl the effects of the leg length on the hydrodynamic behavior were analyzed in fig 15 with the warp length of 120 m it was obvious that the leg length had little effect on the net position with the increase of the leg length the spread of otter board and the height of net opening increased however the horizontal distance of wing end decreased as the leg length increased when the leg length increased from 60 m to 100 m at the towing speed of 3 kn the spread of otter board increased from 30 m to 31 m and the height of net opening increased from 16 m to 19 m the horizontal distance of wing end decreased from 16 m to 14 m based on the above results the leg length was recommended to be 80 m in the fishing operation 3 7 the effect of aoa of otter board on the behavior of krill trawl the effect of the aoa of the otter board on the hydrodynamic behavior of the trawl system was studied fig 16 as can be seen the net position rose with the increase of the aoa as the aoa increased from 15 to 40 at the towing speed of 3 kn the net position rose from 29 m to 25 m the spread of otter board increased firstly and then decreased as the aoa increased and the maximum spread of the otter board occurred when the aoa was equal to 35 when the towing speed was 3 kn the spread of otter board increased from 31 m to 55 m with the aoa increasing from 15 to 35 with the increase of the aoa the height of net opening decreased and the horizontal distance of wing end increased the height of net opening decreased from 18 m to 12 m and the horizontal distance of wing end increased from 15 m to 23 m as the aoa increased from 15 to 40 however the changing trends of both the height of net opening and the horizontal distance of wing end with the increase of the aoa were decreasing 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper the hydrodynamic performance of an antarctic krill trawl system including trawler cable otter board and trawl was studied by means of numerical simulation and full scale measurement at sea a multi wing vertical cambered otter board was designed and its hydrodynamic characteristic was obtained through wind tunnel model test the modified tauti s law and the accuracy of the numerical simulation were verified by comparing the results of full scale trials during fishing operation with the numerical simulation results the hydrodynamic matching degree between the trawler the trawl and the otter board was analyzed the effects of the warp length the leg length the towing speed and the angle of attack of the otter board on the net position the spread of otter board the height of net opening and the horizontal distance of wing end were studied by numerical simulation the simulated drag force the simulated drag force after correction according to the modified tauti s law were compared with the drag force in sea trials the corrected values were reduced by about 55 and the mean relative error between the corrected values and the experimental values was about 7 the converted drags from the three scale nets 1 12 1 20 and 1 50 were larger than the measured value for the full scale net by 46 49 and 55 respectively while the velocity scale was corrected as for the presumed drag of three model nets with a different scale the averaged difference was smaller by about 10 than the observed values hu et al 2001 therefore the modified tauti s law was verified through wind tunnel model tests we obtained hydrodynamic performances and characteristics of the designed multi wing vertical cambered otter board the maximum lift coefficient of the otter board was 2 68 at aoa 40 and the maximum lift drag coefficient of the otter board was 4 13 at aoa 20 the hydrodynamic performance was compared with that of a vertical camber otter board with similar dimension used for antarctic krill trawl liu et al 2015 the maximum lift coefficient was about 1 4 at the aoa of 30 it was shown that the multi wing vertical cambered otter board had superior hydrodynamic performance for its larger critical aoa and higher lift coefficient and would be beneficial when applied to commercial fishing operations the matching degree on hydrodynamics between the trawler the trawl and the otter board was studied when aoa was equal to 30 the drag force of the otter board was about 13 kn at the towing speed of 3 kn so that the total drag force of otter boards was about 26 kn at that speed the total drag force of the trawl system was about 100 kn the drag force of the otter board accounted for about 30 of the total drag force of the system which was reasonable sterling 2000 in the previous work the drag force and the in pull force of the trawl and the towing force of the trawler were explored wan et al 2019 the lift force was about 46 kn at aoa of 30 at towing speed of 3 kn it should be noted that the lift force of the otter board was even more than twice the in pull force 18 kn which was explored in the previous study wan et al 2019 this may be due to the fact that a part of the in pull force was made up of the horizontal component of the tension of warp which was neglected in the flume model test for the limitation in the size of the flume tank therefore more work should be done on the matching of trawl and otter board the towing force was about 280 kn at towing speed of 3 kn which was larger than the total drag force of the trawl system about 100 kn the bridle tension increased during most of the hauls with the increase of catch weight priour and prada 2015 therefore the fishing vessel the trawl and the otter board matched well on hydrodynamics in the range of working aoa 20 30 the effect of the aoa on the hydrodynamic performance of the trawl system was explored it was found that the spread of otter board increased firstly and then decreased as the aoa increased and the maximum spread of the otter board occurred when the aoa was equal to 35 considering the matching of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the trawl system for example mainly the drag and lift forces of the otter board and the drag of the trawl and the towing force of the fishing vessel it was suggested that the optimal option of aoa was 30 under these conditions the otter board could be well spread with high lift drag ratio which was conducive to maintaining of the spreading performance of the trawl system and the improving energy efficiency the effects of the warp length the leg length and the towing speed on the net position the spread of otter board and the spreading performance of net opening were explored by numerical simulation the results showed that as the towing speed increased the height of net opening decreased at the towing speed of 3 kn aoa 25 the height of net opening was 14 m which corresponded well with the result in the previous study wan et al 2019 with the increase of the warp length the net position declined the changing rate of the net position with the warp length for pelagic trawl was uniform su et al 2017 and the net position could be adjusted by controlling the warp length huang 2001 as the leg length increased the height of net opening increased and the horizontal distance of wing end decreased zhou et al 2016 it was noted that the warp length could have an effect on the spread of net opening the spread of wing end increased with the increase of warp length hu and matuda 1991a the angle of warp changed with the increase of the warp length which resulted in decrease of the tension of the warp acting on the otter board and increase of the spread of otter board thus causing the change of the spread of net opening chen et al 2014 any change of each part of the trawl system would affect the performance of other part and the overall system and the hydrodynamic performances of trawl otter board and other structures should be studied systematically as a whole it was concluded that this paper can provide scientific guidance for antarctic krill trawl fishing operation credit authorship contribution statement rong wan

krill euphausia superba is the largest species of biological resources on earth and it is estimated a potential stock abundance of 100 million tons atkinson et al 2009 nowadays antarctic krill remains one of the largest underexploited stocks in the world nicol et al 2012 therefore there are potentials for further development and utilization antarctic krill is rich in protein and fat and is the

the waters around the edge of the continental shelf most of them live in the surface layer within 150 m kawaguchi and nicol 2007 and their swimming ability is not strong according to the living habits of antarctic krill the pelagic trawl aiming fishing method is mainly adopted at present atkinson et al 2008 commercial harvesting of antarctic krill started in the 1970s norway has dominated landing of antarctic krill since 2010 in 2014 norway landed about 166 000 tons of krill about 58 of total landing followed by republic of korea and china nicol and foster 2016 china started fishing for antarctic krill in 2009 the mismatching of trawler otter board and trawl has mainly led to low catch rate and energy efficiency which increases fuel consumption and cost of operation comprehensive

properties of a midwater trawl system which was composed of a trawler trawl net otter boards and warp the effects of changing towing speed and warp length on the system dynamics were demonstrated wan et al 2002a used the finite element method to analyze the static response of fishing nets and ropes in a uniform current solving the nonlinear equilibrium equation of flexible gear structure and calculating equilibrium configuration and tension distribution of longlines plane nets gillnets and a newly designed antarctic krill trawl in a uniform flow the accuracy of the numerical method was then verified by flume tank experiments wan et al 2002b 2004 2019 chen et al 2014 proposed a mathematical model based on lumped mass method to describe the behavior of trawl system in order to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of large mid water trawl system the effects of towing speed and warp length on net position and net opening spread and tension distribution of the trawl were studied and the accuracy of the mathematical model was verified by sea test priour and prada 2015 founded a trawl system based on finite element method the model of the net was founded according to a triangle element and the door was modeled by a rectangle the influence of catch weight on the performance of the trawl was studied by numerical simulation and the results of numerical simulation were verified by sea experiment su et al 2017 analyzed the effects of towing speed and warp length on the net position and net opening height by full scale measurement at sea as a vital component of trawl system the hydrodynamic performance of otter board has been elaborated by many researchers fukuda et al 1997 1999 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of a biplane type otter board based on model test in circulating water tank and analyzed the effect of aspect and camber ratio it was found the otter board at camber ratio of 15 had the maximum lift coefficient and the hydrodynamic performance of the biplane type otter board was better than that of the ordinary type yamasaki et al 2007 evaluated the hydrodynamic characteristics of the conventional otter board used in ise wan bay and a new designed high lift v type otter board by model tests and sea trials it was shown that the drag coefficient of the v type otter board was smaller and the lift drag ratio was larger than the conventional rectangular otter board balash et al 2015 developed a batwing otter board and its hydrodynamic performance was explored by flume model test it was found that the lift drag ratio was greater than 3 at low angle of attack 20 mchugh et al 2015 conducted experiments and compared the engineering and catching performances of the designed otter board termed the batwing against three conventional designs the results showed that the batwings had up to 86 and 18 less bottom contact and drag respectively compared to the conventional otter boards shen et al 2015 carried out flume experiments and investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of a hyper lift trawl door hltd which consisted of a cambered plate with two wing end plates with the leading edge modified into an airfoil shape in previous studies the hydrodynamic performances of a newly designed antarctic krill trawl without otter board and warp were analyzed for the limitation in the size of the flume tank wan et al 2019 however more work on the effects of otter board and warp needs to be done in order to study the hydrodynamic performance for example net position and spreading performance of the antarctic krill trawl system more comprehensively in this paper a muti wing vertical cambered otter board was developed and its hydrodynamic performance was studied by means of wind tunnel model test the numerical model of an antarctic krill trawl system composed of trawler cable otter board and trawl was established based on finite element method the hydrodynamic performance of the antarctic krill trawl system was explored by means of numerical simulation and full scale measurement at sea in addition the simulated results were compared with the experimental results in order to assess the validity of numerical simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 numerical method 2 1 1 description and modeling of the antarctic krill trawl a four panel diamond mesh antarctic krill trawl of 200 m 114 m was studied in this paper a 1 25 scale λ 25 model of the trawl was manufactured based on tauti s law with the small scale ratio λ 5 more detailed information of the full scale trawl the model trawl and the fishing vessel was provided in the previous paper wan et al 2019 the numerical model of antarctic krill trawl was established based on finite element method the trawl system is made up of nets legs warps and other gears for example otter boards the net is a regular reticulated structure that is composed of a series of mesh bars the cable can be divided into several segments both mesh bar and cable segment are considered as straight discrete elements fig 1 thus the whole trawl system is discretized into finite elements wang and shao 1997 if we call each end of the element a node accordingly the antarctic krill trawl can be modeled as an assembling of the discrete elements articulated at their nodes wan et al 2004 2 1 2 basic equation the total potential energy π of the discrete trawl system can be expressed as follows wan et al 2004 1 π i 1 f f i d i g 1 m t g l g d i l g 0 g 1 m l g 0 2 e a g t g 2 where f i is the equivalent nodal load on the ith node d i is the nodal displacement of the ith node t g is the axial force of the gth element l g0 is the initial length of the gth element l g is the length of the gth element after deformation a g is cross section area of the gth element e is the young s modulus of the material f is the nodal degree of freedom and m is the number of the element according to the principle of minimum potential energy the total potential energy becomes an absolute minimum when the system is under equilibrium state i e π d i 0 and π t g 0 in order to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equation the newton raphson method is adopted wan et al 2004 2 1 3 hydrodynamic loading model the structure is subjected to many loads under the action of water including those resulting from gravity weight and buoyancy hydrodynamic loads and other kinds of external actions the hydrodynamic load of the trawl is calculated as the sum of the hydrodynamic load acting on each element the hydrodynamic load acting on the element is calculated by the hydrodynamic loading model which is the truss model the cross flow principle is applied hoerner 1965 as shown in fig 2 the current velocity v is divided into two components the normal component v n and the tangential component v t the normal drag coefficient c n and the tangential drag coefficient c t are calculated as follows choc and casarella 1971 2 c n 1 1 4 r e n 0 50 30 r e n 2 33 10 5 3 c t π μ 0 55 r e n 1 2 0 084 r e n 2 3 c n and c t are calculated according to reynolds number re n where re n ρv n d μ ρ is the density of the fluid d is the diameter of the element μ is the coefficient of fluid viscosity the normal hydrodynamic load f n of the truss element is calculated as 4 f n 1 2 c n ρ d l v n v n where l is the length of the element the tangential hydrodynamic load f t has similar expression form 2 1 4 description and modeling of the otter board antarctic krill trawl belongs to pelagic single trawling net which needs to match the otter board with better hydrodynamic performance i e with larger lift coefficient for providing spreading force in horizontal direction and larger lift drag ratio for improving the energy utilization efficiency of the trawl and more appropriate weight for maintaining the trawl in a certain water layer based on the previous research a multi wing vertical cambered otter board was designed in this paper as shown in fig 3 a geometrically similar physical model scale 1 10 of the otter board was manufactured the main characteristic parameters were given in table 1 the camber ratio was defined as the ratio of the distance from mid arc to the chord to the length of the chord there were two deflectors d1 and d2 with the same camber ratio of 12 in addition the camber ratios of the main panels p1 and p2 were 15 and 12 respectively the installation angle α was defined as the angle between the chord and the horizontal direction the chords of the deflectors and main panels were 0 0625 m 0 0625 m 0 2105 m and 0 1250 m respectively and the distances between deflectors and main panels were 0 18b and 0 24b respectively with the distance between deflector and main panel of 0 18b the otter board shown in fig 4 is simplified to a rectangle in the model priour and prada 2015 the forces on the otter board are the weight 2900 kg buoyancy 231 kg and hydrodynamic forces drag force and lift force as follows 5 f d 1 2 c d ρ s v 2 6 f l 1 2 c l ρ s v 2 where f d and f l represent drag force and lift force of the otter board respectively c d and c l represent drag coefficient and lift coefficient of the otter board respectively s is the plane area of the otter board v is the towing speed the whole trawl system was scaled with the same ratio of the trawl model and mesh grouping method was employed in order to reduce computational complexity the method consisted of modeling a given number of actual meshes by a fictitious equivalent mesh the equivalent mesh had the same physical qualities as the actual meshes such as the projected area of the netting the specific mass the weight and so on li et al 2006 according to tauti s law the numerical simulation results were converted into the actual results most characteristic parameters were based on the actual fishing operation at sea and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the otter board were obtained from model test main characteristic parameters were provided in table 2 2 2 wind tunnel model test in order to obtain the drag coefficient and lift coefficient of the otter board a series of physical model tests were conducted at the nh 2 low speed wind tunnel at nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics china the basic setup of the wind tunnel model test was shown in fig 5 the size of the test section was 6 m length 2 5 m width 3 m height the otter board model was connected to the six component mechanical tower balance through a connecting rod the wind speed was set to 28 m s to ensure that the reynolds number 0 62 106 was in the self modeling area 103 107 and similar to the reynolds number in actual operation in that case the boundary layer separated steadily at the tip of the board edge forming vortices and the flow pattern was stable the hydrodynamic coefficient of the otter board will become constant strictly wang et al 2017 zhou and xu 2018 the angle of attack aoa of the otter board was set to 0 70 aoa changing from 0 to 50 with a step of 2 5 changing from 50 to 70 with a step of 5 2 3 sea trial sea trials were carried out in the area 48 and 58 in antarctic water fig 6 during march april 2016 and january march 2018 the fishing vessel was equipped with depth gauge dr 1050 and gps for net position and towing speed measurement the operation and tension measurement of warp were conducted by atw system 2 4 data processing the drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l of the otter board are calculated according to the follow formulas 7 c d 2 f d w ρ a s v w 2 8 c l 2 f l w ρ a s v w 2 where f dw and f lw represent drag force and lift force of the otter board model in wind tunnel test respectively ρ a is the density of the air 1 225 kg m3 s is the plane area of the otter board model v w is the wind speed in addition the lift drag ratio is defined as the ratio of lift coefficient to drag coefficient which represents the energy efficiency of the otter board the drag force of trawl model from numerical simulation can be converted to the value from measurement at sea however the converted drag force base on tauti s law is considerably larger than the measured drag forces because the drag coefficient of the trawl will change with the reynolds number therefore it is necessary to correct the model rule hu et al 2001 suggested that the velocity scale of modified tauti s law λ v can be express as 9 λ v λ n 1 2 n where n is the power of the reynolds number re with which the drag coefficient of the trawl varies detailed theoretical analysis can be found in the appendix in this paper it was assumed that the drag coefficient of the trawl c d was expressed as an exponential function of the reynolds number re based on the twine diameter by referring to the results fridman 1973 miyazaki and takahashi 1964 so then c d was 10 c d k re n where k is a function due to the mesh solidity re ρvd μ c d is calculated by the following formula hu and matuda 1991b 11 c d 2 r ρ s t v 2 where r is drag force of the trawl s t is total area of the twine 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic performance of the otter board drag coefficient lift coefficient and lift drag ratio of the otter board were shown in fig 7 it appeared quite clearly that the drag coefficient increased as the aoa increased and the lift coefficient increased firstly and then decreased as the aoa increased when the aoa was equal to 40 the lift coefficient reached the maximum value c l max 2 68 the lift drag ratio also presented a trend of increasing firstly and then decreasing and the maximum lift drag ratio was 4 13 when the aoa was 20 the working aoa of the otter board was inferred ranging from 20 to 30 to ensure greater lift force and lift drag ratio antarctic krill swimming ability is not strong so towing speed of trawl should not be too fast the trawlers for antarctic krill usually operate at towing speed of 2 3 kn under this condition the drag and lift force of the otter board were calculated according to eqs 5 and 6 where the hydrodynamic coefficient were obtained from wind tunnel model test the results were presented in fig 8 when aoa was equal to 30 the drag force of the otter board was about 13 kn and the lift force was about 46 kn at the towing speed of 3 kn 3 2 drag force the relationship of the drag coefficient c d of the trawl to reynolds number re was shown in fig 9 as can be seen from the result the drag coefficient of the trawl decreased with the increase of the reynolds number and n was equal to 0 25 the speed corresponding relationship between the model and the full scale was redefined according to the modified velocity scale based on that the converted drag force from numerical simulation was corrected the drag forces of the trawl from numerical simulation were compared with the simulated drag forces after correction and the drag forces from full scale measurement the results were shown in fig 10 it was obvious that the drag forces from numerical simulation were far greater than the measured values however the simulated values after correction were much closer to the measured values therefore it is necessary to correct the converted drag force according to the modified model rule after correction the drag forces were reduced by about 55 and the average relative error between the measured values and the simulated values was about 7 3 3 net position net position was defined as the position of the center of net opening and sea level was defined as 0 in the process of fishing operation antarctic krill is not always in the same water depth position the adjustment of net position corresponding to the distribution of antarctic krill will become one of the key technologies affecting the efficiency of fishing gear fig 11 showed the net position at different towing speeds when the warp length was 120 m it was worth noting that the numerical simulation results showed that the net position tended to rise with the increase of towing speed which could be seen from fig 12 the net position rose from 47 m to 31 m with the towing speed increasing from 2 1 kn to 3 kn the numerical simulation values varied basically within the range of the measured values and the average relative error between the experimental values and the simulated values was about 5 7 therefore the accuracy of the numerical simulation was verified 3 4 the relationships between the parameters of the numerical model the relationships between the parameters of the numerical model were shown in fig 13 the aoa of the otter board was 20 with the warp length of 120 m and the leg length of 80 m at the towing speed of 2 5 kn the relationships between the parameters were obtained when the trawl system became stable the geometries formed by warps and legs were approximately considered as isosceles triangle and isosceles trapezoid therefore the angle of warp θ 1 θ 5 and the angle of leg θ 2 θ 6 could be determined where sinθ 1 h 1 l 1 30 8 118 8 θ 1 15 sinθ 3 h 2 2l 2 10 6 2 79 θ 2 2θ 3 7 6 sinθ 4 h 3 2l 3 24 2 115 3 θ 5 2θ 4 12 sinθ 6 h 3 h 4 2l 4 24 15 3 2 78 9 θ 6 3 3 5 the effect of warp length on the behavior of krill trawl the effects of warp length leg length and aoa of otter board on the behavior of krill trawl net position spread of otter board and spreading performance of net opening were explored by means of numerical simulation the effects of the warp length on the behavior of the trawl were shown in fig 14 it could be seen that the towing speed and warp length had an obvious effect on the net position the net position declined with the increase of warp length and rose with the increase of the towing speed at the towing speed of 3 kn the net position declined from 24 m to 91 m with the warp length increasing from 100 m to 300 m the net position rose from 38 m to 24 m at the warp length of 100 m as the towing speed increased from 2 kn to 3 kn as the warp length increased the spread of otter board and the horizontal distance of wing end increased and the height of net opening decreased when the warp length increased from 100 m to 300 m at the towing speed of 3 kn the spread of otter board increased from 24 m to 46 m and the horizontal distance of wing end increased from 14 m to 21 m while the height of net opening decreased from 19 m to 14 m with the increase of the towing speed the spread of otter board and the horizontal distance of wing end increased but the height of net opening decreased as the towing speed increased from 2 kn to 3 kn at the warp length of 100 m the spread of otter board increased from 24 m to 27 m the horizontal distance of wing end increased from 13 m to 14 m the height of net opening decreased from 24 m to 19 m 3 6 the effect of leg length on the behavior of krill trawl the effects of the leg length on the hydrodynamic behavior were analyzed in fig 15 with the warp length of 120 m it was obvious that the leg length had little effect on the net position with the increase of the leg length the spread of otter board and the height of net opening increased however the horizontal distance of wing end decreased as the leg length increased when the leg length increased from 60 m to 100 m at the towing speed of 3 kn the spread of otter board increased from 30 m to 31 m and the height of net opening increased from 16 m to 19 m the horizontal distance of wing end decreased from 16 m to 14 m based on the above results the leg length was recommended to be 80 m in the fishing operation 3 7 the effect of aoa of otter board on the behavior of krill trawl the effect of the aoa of the otter board on the hydrodynamic behavior of the trawl system was studied fig 16 as can be seen the net position rose with the increase of the aoa as the aoa increased from 15 to 40 at the towing speed of 3 kn the net position rose from 29 m to 25 m the spread of otter board increased firstly and then decreased as the aoa increased and the maximum spread of the otter board occurred when the aoa was equal to 35 when the towing speed was 3 kn the spread of otter board increased from 31 m to 55 m with the aoa increasing from 15 to 35 with the increase of the aoa the height of net opening decreased and the horizontal distance of wing end increased the height of net opening decreased from 18 m to 12 m and the horizontal distance of wing end increased from 15 m to 23 m as the aoa increased from 15 to 40 however the changing trends of both the height of net opening and the horizontal distance of wing end with the increase of the aoa were decreasing 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper the hydrodynamic performance of an antarctic krill trawl system including trawler cable otter board and trawl was studied by means of numerical simulation and full scale measurement at sea a multi wing vertical cambered otter board was designed and its hydrodynamic characteristic was obtained through wind tunnel model test the modified tauti s law and the accuracy of the numerical simulation were verified by comparing the results of full scale trials during fishing operation with the numerical simulation results the hydrodynamic matching degree between the trawler the trawl and the otter board was analyzed the effects of the warp length the leg length the towing speed and the angle of attack of the otter board on the net position the spread of otter board the height of net opening and the horizontal distance of wing end were studied by numerical simulation the simulated drag force the simulated drag force after correction according to the modified tauti s law were compared with the drag force in sea trials the corrected values were reduced by about 55 and the mean relative error between the corrected values and the experimental values was about 7 the converted drags from the three scale nets 1 12 1 20 and 1 50 were larger than the measured value for the full scale net by 46 49 and 55 respectively while the velocity scale was corrected as for the presumed drag of three model nets with a different scale the averaged difference was smaller by about 10 than the observed values hu et al 2001 therefore the modified tauti s law was verified through wind tunnel model tests we obtained hydrodynamic performances and characteristics of the designed multi wing vertical cambered otter board the maximum lift coefficient of the otter board was 2 68 at aoa 40 and the maximum lift drag coefficient of the otter board was 4 13 at aoa 20 the hydrodynamic performance was compared with that of a vertical camber otter board with similar dimension used for antarctic krill trawl liu et al 2015 the maximum lift coefficient was about 1 4 at the aoa of 30 it was shown that the multi wing vertical cambered otter board had superior hydrodynamic performance for its larger critical aoa and higher lift coefficient and would be beneficial when applied to commercial fishing operations the matching degree on hydrodynamics between the trawler the trawl and the otter board was studied when aoa was equal to 30 the drag force of the otter board was about 13 kn at the towing speed of 3 kn so that the total drag force of otter boards was about 26 kn at that speed the total drag force of the trawl system was about 100 kn the drag force of the otter board accounted for about 30 of the total drag force of the system which was reasonable sterling 2000 in the previous work the drag force and the in pull force of the trawl and the towing force of the trawler were explored wan et al 2019 the lift force was about 46 kn at aoa of 30 at towing speed of 3 kn it should be noted that the lift force of the otter board was even more than twice the in pull force 18 kn which was explored in the previous study wan et al 2019 this may be due to the fact that a part of the in pull force was made up of the horizontal component of the tension of warp which was neglected in the flume model test for the limitation in the size of the flume tank therefore more work should be done on the matching of trawl and otter board the towing force was about 280 kn at towing speed of 3 kn which was larger than the total drag force of the trawl system about 100 kn the bridle tension increased during most of the hauls with the increase of catch weight priour and prada 2015 therefore the fishing vessel the trawl and the otter board matched well on hydrodynamics in the range of working aoa 20 30 the effect of the aoa on the hydrodynamic performance of the trawl system was explored it was found that the spread of otter board increased firstly and then decreased as the aoa increased and the maximum spread of the otter board occurred when the aoa was equal to 35 considering the matching of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the trawl system for example mainly the drag and lift forces of the otter board and the drag of the trawl and the towing force of the fishing vessel it was suggested that the optimal option of aoa was 30 under these conditions the otter board could be well spread with high lift drag ratio which was conducive to maintaining of the spreading performance of the trawl system and the improving energy efficiency the effects of the warp length the leg length and the towing speed on the net position the spread of otter board and the spreading performance of net opening were explored by numerical simulation the results showed that as the towing speed increased the height of net opening decreased at the towing speed of 3 kn aoa 25 the height of net opening was 14 m which corresponded well with the result in the previous study wan et al 2019 with the increase of the warp length the net position declined the changing rate of the net position with the warp length for pelagic trawl was uniform su et al 2017 and the net position could be adjusted by controlling the warp length huang 2001 as the leg length increased the height of net opening increased and the horizontal distance of wing end decreased zhou et al 2016 it was noted that the warp length could have an effect on the spread of net opening the spread of wing end increased with the increase of warp length hu and matuda 1991a the angle of warp changed with the increase of the warp length which resulted in decrease of the tension of the warp acting on the otter board and increase of the spread of otter board thus causing the change of the spread of net opening chen et al 2014 any change of each part of the trawl system would affect the performance of other part and the overall system and the hydrodynamic performances of trawl otter board and other structures should be studied systematically as a whole it was concluded that this paper can provide scientific guidance for antarctic krill trawl fishing operation credit authorship contribution statement rong wan

20406,in this present work an in house solver mpsdem sjtu is developed based on the improved moving particle semi implicit mps method and discrete element method dem the mps method is used to simulate the movement of the fluid while a more precise bond model which includes the rolling contact model is employed to analyse the dynamic responses of structures based on the boundary condition of mps a simple coupling scheme is proposed for the information exchange the pressure carried by mps particles is passed to the dem particles in turn the velocity and displacement information will be transferred from the solid domain to the fluid domain in order to improve the computation efficiency the parallel technique is introduced to the solver besides a partition technique pt is developed to avoid the misjudgment of the neighbor particles near the thin structures the dem based structural solver is firstly validated for simulating an oscillating cantilever plate then the coupling model is validated by comparison with benchmark tests such as hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic baffle the flood discharge with an elastic gate and dam break with an elastic plate the numerical results show good agreement with experimental data and other numerical results in addition the developed solver is successfully extended to tackle fsi problems with fracture keywords moving particle semi implicit method mps discrete element method dem fluid structure interaction fsi parallel technique partition technique mpsdem sjtu solver 1 introduction the fluid structure interaction fsi problems with violent free surface flows widely exist in ocean engineering field such as sloshing in a rolling tank with elastic baffles idelsohn et al 2008a ocean waves interacting with the sea ice floes zhang et al 2019 and the water impacting the ship bottom plate stenius et al 2011 the fluid dynamics applied by severe flows may lead to large deformations and even fractures of structures therefore it is necessary to investigate the fsi problems for the safety of the offshore structures although the experimental technologies have developed maturely and reliably these still have some unavoidable drawbacks experiments are usually time and money consuming in addition sometimes the experimental model sizes are much smaller than the actual sizes of objects therefore the accuracy of the experimental data may be affected due to the scale effect the numerical technique has developed fast in the past years and gradually formed complementary relationship with experimental techniques according to the treatment for interface of fluids and structures the numerical techniques for fsi problems can be divided into two main categories hwang et al 2014 the monolithic and the partitioned approaches for the former the fluid movement and the structure responses are solved with one system of governing equations for the latter the fluids and the structures are treated separately and the information is exchanged through the interpolation although the errors exist during the interpolation procedure the partition approaches are more simplified and flexible for the complex fsi problems which has attracted more attention of researchers considering the advantages of different methods for fluid and structure solution many coupling methods have been proposed for fsi problem the grid based methods are the mainstream approaches to simulate the flow field the high order schemes and the parallel strategy can be easily introduced to the grid based methods which can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of these methods the low accuracy and poor stability of the particle based methods always bothered the researchers and many corrective methods have been proposed to overcome those drawbacks tanaka and masunaga 2010 proposed a mixed source term for the poisson pressure equation ppe and a gradient model of momentum conservation khayyer and gotch 2010 2011 2012 did a series of work to improve the accuracy and stability of particle based methods high order schemes were proposed for laplacian model source term of poisson pressure equation ppe and gradient model of mps considering the errors bringed by the uneven distribution and the aggregation of the particles the optimized particle shifting scheme was also proposed by khayyer et al 2017 compared with traditional grid based methods the particle based method shows its advantages in capturing complex free surface especially for fragmentations and splashing besides the structures with large deformation and movement are hard to handle which may cause the distortion of the grids the distorted grids affect the accuracy of simulation and the mesh reconstruction is computationally expensive in the contrast it is easy for particle based methods to overcome these drawbacks there are no fixed topological relationships among lagrangian particles and the information exchange is not restricted to specific nodes therefore the particle methods have the potential to be applied to the severe fsi problems in recent years many structural analysis methods have been coupled with particle methods to investigate fsi problems yang et al 2012 coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method with finite element method fem the accuracy of coupling method was verified by comparison with the benchmark tests such as the sloshing with elastic baffle and flood discharge with elastic gate khayyer et al 2018a employed projection based incompressible sph isph method for simulation of fluid and developed a novel sph based structure model the fluid structure acceleration based fsa or the pressure integration pi coupling schemes were compared in detail the isph sph method was applied for the water entry of elastic wedge and panel khayyer et al 2021b further developed an isph hsph solver for simulation of fluid interacting with composite structures a hamiltonian sph hsph was developed for the structure analysis falahaty et al 2018 coupled moving least squares mls method and dual particle dynamics dpd structure model with moving particle semi implicit mps method respectively the mls mps model and dpd mps model were systematically compared through a series of numerical simulations chen et al 2019 developed an in house 3 d fsi solver mpsfem sjtu based on mps method and fem a kernel function based interpolation kfbi was introduced to handle the information exchange between mps boundary particles and fem grids the 3 d sloshing in the tank made of elastic material was investigated hu et al 2019 coupled sph and smoothed point interpolation method spim to simulate the sloshing in the tank with elastic baffle there was not a consistent one to one match between spim nodes and sph ghost particles physical qualities such as velocity displacement and force are exchanged using interpolation long et al 2016 introduced a particle element algorithm to isph fem and sph fem through some typical simulations the effectiveness of this algorithm was proved zhang et al 2020 used decoupled finite particle method dfpm and smoothed fem sfem to study the effect of the configuration of elastic baffles to the sloshing the virtual particle strategy was adopted to treat the interaction between the fluid and structures yang and zhang 2018 used mps method coupling with large eddy simulation les methods to study the interaction between the dam break flows and elastic baffles although both the fluid domain and elastic structures were modelled by mps methods the partitioned approach was adopted for the coupling discrete element method dem as another lagrangian particle based method can be used to describe the interaction among the solid bodies and has been widely applied to the engineering and nature field including the particle flows sakai et al 2012 multi rigid body interaction canelas et al 2016 deformation and fracture of structures wu et al 2016 2018 the real ocean environment is more complicated which includes interactions among fluids particles and structures compared with the solid part of afore mentioned fsi methods dem has the potential to tackle more complex ocean problems the response of elastic structures was usually simulated by dem with bonded particle model bpm which was firstly proposed by potyondy and cundall 2004 the moment induced by relative rotation between neighbouring dem particles is calculated through hooke s law jiang et al 2005 introduced a rolling contact model to the traditional bond model which assumed that there were countless springs in the bond between two neighbouring particles the basic concept of rolling contact model is similar with the bpm the rolling contact model was further modified to suit for the situation with large relative rotation by wang 2020 besides the force displacement contact law of dem was replaced by stress strain form the new bond model was successfully applied to simulate the large deformation and fracture of elastic structures zhao 2015 adopted only two subnormal springs to transmit a moment between two neighbouring particles several particle based methods have been coupled with dem to investigate the fsi problems there are two main models 7 disc and 9 disc for structures according to the arrangement of dem particles owen et al 2020 tang et al 2018 coupled sph and dem for the fsi problems neighbouring dem particles was joined together by two parallel springs which was a simplified version of rolling contact model for the stability of the structure dem particles were arranged as a hexagonal scheme 7 disc however it is difficult to configure sph boundary particles sun et al 2019a adopted 9 disc arrangement of dem particles and the bpm the mps dem method was used to investigate the influence of dam break flows to a floating deformable structure with moorings a more precise bond model containing the rolling contact model jiang et al 2005 is used to simulate the structural response in mpsdem sjtu solver the coupling schemes of mps sph with dem are not showed in detail in those works mentioned above in present work a simple coupling scheme is proposed and its stability and accuracy are checked in detail besides the stress field is presented in the structure of dem by which the area where its structure is prone to damage can be easily detect in addition some marine structures are very thin such as the ship hull shell and the hydraulic turbine blade the fluid on both sides of the thin structures will not interfere with each other the interaction between fluid and thick structures or the fluid only acting on one side of the structure can be simulated by previous sph dem and mps dem models however the effect of thin structures to the neighbor particle search have rarely been considered or mentioned to offset this vacancy a partition technique pt is established and implanted into the in house mpsdem sjtu solver due to the more accurate neighbouring particles search the force exerted on the structures is more accurate the elastic structures tend to be thin and the corresponding wall particles should be small therefore the total amount of particles will be large in the whole region with single resolution in order to improve the computational efficiency many approaches have been introduced to particle methods those approaches can be classified as multi resolution techniques parallel technique and gpu acceleration technique for multi resolution techniques the particles with small spacing are only arranged at the field that needs be focused on which reduces computational load and meets the requirements of local accuracy sun et al 2019b investigated a violent fluid structure dam break problem with multi phase δ sph methods and adaptive particle refinement apr the apr region was set around the elastic structure and the coarse particles were splitted into more fine particles when they entered the refinement region khayyer et al 2018b 2021a firstly introduced a multi resolution method into mps and isph sph methods to solve the hydro elastic fsi problem the elastic baffle was simulated by fine particles while the flow field was composed of coarse particles the key idea of parallel technique is to divide tasks into several parts and assign them to different cpu processors for processing at the same time marrone et al 2012 developed a parallel 3 d sph model which achieves a high parallel efficiency the wave pattern generated by a moving ship is successful captured as a new hardware gpu is in possession of more arithmetic logic units alu than cpu therefore gpu can achieve high floating point operations per second flops and deal with large amounts of data simultaneously chen and wan 2019a chen and wan 2019b introduced gpu acceleration technique to mps method and the speed up ratio can be up to 25 33 times compared with single cpu however gpu acceleration technique is not used as widely as multi cpu parallel technique in this paper the multi cpu parallel technique is introduced to the mps dem method which also lays a foundation for the application of multi gpu parallel technique in large scale flow simulation in present study an in house parallel solver mpsdem sjtu based on mps method and dem is developed to simulate fsi problems firstly the improved mps method the dem method the mps dem coupling scheme the parallel strategy and partition technique pt are presented briefly in the section of numerical simulations an oscillating cantilever plate is simulated to validate the dem part of developed solver then several numerical examples including the hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the flood discharge with an elastic gate sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic plate and dam break with an elastic plate are carried out to test the accuracy and performance of the mpsdem sjtu solver the parallel efficiency the convergency and the energy conservation properties of the mps dem solver are tested in the hydrostatic case in the cases with thin elastic structures the superiority of the pt for the neighbouring particles search near the thin structures is presented finally the mpsdem sjtu solver is successfully extended to simulate the fsi with fracture 2 numerical method 2 1 mps method for fluid simulation mps method was firstly proposed by koshizuka and oka 1996 for simulation of viscous incompressible fluid the governing equations of the fluid consist of mass conservation equation and momentum conservation equation given by 1 u 0 2 d u d t 1 ρ p ν 2 u g where the u t ρ p ν and g are the velocity vector time fluid density pressure kinematic viscosity of the fluid and gravity acceleration vector respectively the interaction among mps particles controlled by kernel function in order to avoid the singular point the kernel function introduced by zhang and wan 2012a is employed here 3 w r r e 0 85 r 0 15 r e 1 0 r r e 0 r e r where r is the distance between two particles and r e is the radius of the particle interaction the particle interaction models contain gradient model divergence model and laplacian model defined as 4 φ i d n 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i w r j r i 5 v i d n 0 j i u j u i r j r i r j r i 2 w r j r i 6 2 φ i 2 d n 0 λ j i φ j φ i w r j r i where φ is a physical quantity d is the number of space dimension n 0 is the initial particle density r is the position vector relative to origin λ is a parameter to make the increase of variance equal to the corresponding analytical solution koshizuka and oka 1996 given by 7 λ j i w r j r i r j r i 2 j i w r j r i pressure information carried by mps particles is obtained by solving the pressure poisson equation ppe in order to balance between stability and accuracy a mixed source method khayyer and gotoh 2011 tanaka and masunaga 2010 is adopted defined by 8 2 p k 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t u i γ ρ δ t 2 n i n 0 n 0 where p k 1 δ t u i and n are the pressure of the step k 1 time step temporal velocity and temporal particle density γ is a blending parameter whose value is set to be 0 01 in this paper 2 2 dem method for structure simulation in classical dem method the solid body is made of particles the motion of the particle is governed by newton s second law expressed as 9 m d v d t f c m g f int 10 i d ω d t m c t where m and i are the mass and the moment of inertia v and ω are the linear and angular velocity f c and m c t are the contact force and contact moment among solid particles f int is the hydrodynamics exerted on the solid particles the contact force is calculated based on the contact model which consists of springs dashpots and sliders the dem particles are regarded as soft spheres and they can overlap with each other the overlap is equal to the deformation of the springs the contact force f c can be decomposed into the normal component f c n and tangential component f c t both components consist of elastic force and damping force 11 f c n k n δ n d n δ v n 12 f c t k t δ t d t δ v t f c t μ f c n μ f c n δ v t δ v t f c t μ f c n where k d δ and δ v is the stiffness damping coefficient relative displacement and relative velocity μ is the friction coefficient μ f c n is the boundary of the transition from static friction to dynamic friction fig 1 shows the bonded particle model bpm potyondy and cundall 2004 with rolling contact model jiang et al 2005 the dpm consists of springs and dashpots the particles of the structure are packed in cubic form based on the beam theory the stiffness k n can be calculated as 13 k n a e l t l e l e t e where e is the young s modulus of the material a t and l are the cross sectional area thickness and length of beam element in 2 d case the thickness is the unit thickness the stiffness of spring in tangential direction can be estimated as 14 k t ν k n where ν is the poisson ratio the damping coefficient in normal and tangential direction can be calculated as wu et al 2016 15 d n 2 β n m k n 16 d t 2 β t m k t where β n and β t are parameters which are set to 0 2 the moment in the bpm is not only induced by the contact force in tangential direction but also caused by the relative rotation between two neighbouring dem particles the moment m c t induced by contact force in tangential direction is calculated as 17 m c t r f c t in order to transfer the moment caused by relative rotation between the dem particles the single spring in normal direction should be equivalent to countless springs with same stiffness k n k n 2 r these springs distribute uniformly between two particles the calculation of moment m c r is similar to the integral in wang 2020 given by 18 m c r 2 0 r r r δ θ k n d r 2 3 k n r 3 δ θ where r is the radius of dem particle and δ θ is the relative angle between the neighbouring dem particles 2 3 coupling of mps and dem in our previous study chen and wan 2019a multilayer mps particles are configured on the boundary pressures of wall particles which is near the fluid domain are solved by ppe fig 2 shows the arrangement of particles in this work fluids and solids are discretized at the same resolution therefore dem particles overlap with mps boundary particles these particles of the structure exhibit properties of both mps and dem a simple coupling scheme coupling scheme is proposed in this study the pressure of the wall particles can be obtained by solving ppe just like the fluid particles then the pressure is transferred from mps wall particles to corresponding dem particles the motion of dem particles follows the force displacement rather than stress strain law therefore the hydro force applied on each dem particle is focused the hydro force applied to the dem particles can be calculated as 19 f int p δ x n where p is the pressure of the corresponding mps wall particle δ x is the distance between the mps particles n is the normal direction the information of position and the velocity are transmitted from dem particles to mps boundary particles 20 x b x s 21 u b v s the sizes of time step for mps and dem are quite different due to the explicit scheme the time step size of dem commonly is set to a small value correspondingly a much larger time step for mps is adopted in order to keep the stability and efficiency of the coupling algorithm fig 3 shows the coupling strategy of mps and dem the dem iterates k times in one mps iteration loop the mps time step δ t mps should meet the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition given by 22 u max δ t mps δ l 0 c where u max is the maximum velocity of the fluid δ l 0 is the initial mps particle spacing c is the courant number the dem time step δ t dem is decided by the mass and the stiffness of the dem particle defined by 23 δ t d e m m k 2 4 free surface detection based on the asymmetric distribution of neighbouring particles near the free surface zhang and wan 2012b proposed an improved surface particle detection method whose basic concept is similar to that proposed by khayyer et al 2009 the surface particle detection method can effectively and accurately distinguish free surface particles from other particles fig 4 shows the sketch of free surface detection the detection criterion is given by 24 n i β n 0 25 f i d n 0 j i 1 r i r j r i r j w r j r i f i α f 0 where f is a vector which represents the asymmetry distribution of neighbouring particles f 0 is the f of the internal fluid particles at initial time parameters β and α are set to 0 8 and 0 9 respectively 2 5 neighbor particle search near the thin structure both the wall particles and fluid particles participate in the solution of the ppe fig 5 presents the sketch of the neighbor particles search near a very thin plate the fluid particles and wall particles on one side of the plate can be regarded as the neighbor particles of the particles on the other side of the plate which is not in accordance with the actual situation and affects the accuracy of the force calculation on the plate therefore it is necessary to prevent the particles on the one side of the plate become the neighbor particles of the particles from the other side additional judgement is added to the solver the basic concept can be founded in fig 5 the centers of two neighbor ghost particles are connected with grey lines if the connection red line of two neighbor particles intersects with one of the grey lines they are removed from the list of neighbor particle 2 6 fsi with fracture the maximum tensile stress σ max of the beam element can be derived as 26 σ max f c n a k n r δ θ the commonly used criterion the mohr coulomb mc wang 2020 for the fracture induced by the shear stress is given by 27 τ crit c μ f c n a k n r δ θ if the maximum stress exceeds the criterion the bonds are judged to be invalid and the neighbouring particles won t re bond again 28 σ max σ crit τ τ crit where τ is the shear stress in the bond σ crit and τ crit are the ultimate stress of fracture tensile strength and cohesion strength in the fsi problems with fracture the fluid may interact with the fracture surface therefore it is necessary to change the type of the mps boundary particles as shown in fig 6 once the bond of the dem particle is broken the corresponding mps ghost particle will become the wall particle 2 7 high performance strategy for mps dem mps particles have no topological relationship and can move freely with the fluid flows compared with traditional grid based method it is difficult to divide the whole mps calculational domain into sub domains of different processes the mps particles may transfer from one sub domain to another if the calculation domain is divided equally the difference in the number of particles between different subdomains may be too large which directly decrease the parallel efficiency a background grid method has been introduced to particle method the background grids marrone et al 2012 cover the whole calculation domain and serve two main purposes providing the reference frame for mps particles to find their neighbors and allocating the nearly equal number particles to different processes to achieve the load balance the concept of parallel strategy for the mps is presented in fig 7 the size of the sub domain will change with the movement of mps particles to make the number of the particles in processes remain approximately constant the cells near other processes belongs to buffer in which the information of adjacent processes exchanges the particles in the buffers not only simulate the flows in the local process but also provide boundary support for the adjacent processes the information carried by the mps particles of elastic structures also should be broadcast to all processors after every mps step if the structure fracture doesn t occur the neighbors of each dem particle will not change therefore the process of particle search which is the most time consuming step only takes place in the first time step because the dem particles won t transfer from one process to another as the mps particles the background grids which are used in the mps method is unnecessary for the structure analysis fig 8 shows the domain decomposition of the dem part a continuous beam is simply divided into four equal parts the particles close to other processes is in the buffer region where the information is exchanged 3 numerical simulations 3 1 validation of dem solver for structure dynamic analysis the dem solver is firstly used to simulate an oscillating cantilever plate fig 9 shows the sketch of the model the cantilever plate is 0 2 m long and 0 02 m thick at the beginning the plate without deformation is in the equilibrium position and the initial vertical velocity distribution of the plate is given by 29 v y x v y l c 0 f x f l 30 f x cos k l cosh k l cosh k x cos k x sin k l sinh k l sinh k x sin k x where v y l 0 01 is the initial vertical velocity at the free end of the plate k l is set to 1 875 for the fundamental mode c 0 is the velocity of sound which is decided by the properties of the material given by 31 c 0 k s ρ s where k s 3 25 10 6 n m 2 is the bulk modulus ρ s 1000 kg m 3 is the density of the plate parameters of the simulation are presented in table 1 fig 10 shows time histories of free end displacement of the plate it can be noted that results of simulations with different resolutions all agree well with the analytic solution showing good convergency performance of present solver the results obtained by different method are listed in table 2 results obtained by the present solver and by hwang et al 2014 are close to the analytic solution than those by other researchers fig 11 presents the stress distribution of the cantilever plate at t 0 57s which is smooth and consistent with the deformation 3 2 hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the convergence efficiency and stability of the mpsdem sjtu solver are investigated by the benchmark test of a hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the sketch of the model is presented in fig 12 the water column is 2 m high and 1 m wide which is confined in a tank the bottom of the tank is 0 05 m thick and made of elastic material table 3 shows detailed parameters of the simulation this case has been simulated by sph fem li et al 2015 isph sph khayyer et al 2018a and sph spim hu et al 2019 fig 13 shows the time history of the mid point displacement of the elastic plate obtained by different numerical methods and analytic solution deformation trends to be stable after some initial oscillations it can be observed that the time history curve obtained by mps dem is smoother than that obtained by sph fem li et al 2015 and closer to the analytic solution which implies that present solver is more stable additional simulations with t dp being 4 and 5 are also conducted fig 13 shows the results with different resolutions it can be noticed that those results are consistent showing the good convergent property of present coupling method it is noted that the pressure and stress field obtained by this solver are smooth and stable as shown in fig 14 the energy conservation features in the whole fsi system khayyer et al 2018a zhang et al 2021 of mpsdem sjtu solver is investigated the formulations of energy are given by 32 e t e t f e t s 33 e t s e k s e p s e e s 34 e t f e k f e p f where e t e t f and e t s are the total energy of whole fsi system fluid field and structure field respectively e k f and e p f are the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of fluid field e k s e p s and e e s are the kinetic energy gravitational potential energy and elastic strain energy of structure field the elastic strain energy of the bond model of dem is calculate as 35 e e s e e t c s e e s s e e m s 36 e e t c s 1 2 k n δ n 2 37 e e s s 1 2 k s δ s 2 38 e e m s 2 0 r 1 2 r δ θ r δ θ k n d r 2 3 k n r 3 δ θ 2 where e e t c s e e s s and e e m s are the strain energy caused by tension compression force in normal direction shear force and the moment induced by relative rotation the time histories of energy components in the fsi system are presents in fig 15 it can be noted that although there are some oscillations in the initial stage all the energy components except the kinetic energy of the fluid reach almost constant values before t 1s from fig 15 g and j the normalized total energy of the whole system decreases with the drop of fluid kinetic energy which indicates that the fluid kinetic energy takes mainly responsibility for the loss of total energy the normalized total energy and fluid kinetic energy reach constant values before t 10 s the loss of normalized total energy is about 0 025 at t 1 s and 0 054 at t 10 s in order to further eliminate the influence of fluid kinetic energy the time history of normalization for total energy minus fluid kinetic energy is also presented in fig 15 k after some initial oscillations the normalization for total energy minus fluid kinetic energy is maintain almost a constant value which implies that the drop of fluid kinetic energy doesn t caused by the energy exchange between structure and fluid the drop of fluid kinetic energy may because the pressure of the fluid field oscillates slightly and the velocity of fluid is not equal to zero at initial stage in general mpsdem sjtu solver has the characteristics of energy conservation the parallel efficiency of mpsdem sjtu is tested in this case it should be noted that the mpsdem sjtu solver runs on the high performance computing hpc cluster of cmhl group cpu of intel xeon e5 2680 v2 10 cores 2 80ghz node and ram 64 gb the percentages of the computation time for mps part and dem part are presented in fig 16 it can be noted that the dem part takes up nearly half of the total computation time this is a hydrostatic problem so the mps part of the solver has good stability and robustness even it runs with a larger time step the stiffness of the elastic plate is very large in order to meet the accuracy requirements the time step of dem is relatively small fig 17 shows the speed up ratio of the mps dem simulation it can be noticed that the efficiency is improved obviously when the number of gpus is less than 4 and an efficiency of 70 6 is achieved when the solver runs on 4 cpus however the efficiency is not further improved when the number of cpus reaches 6 that because the particles number of 2 d simulation is small and the communication time between cpus takes a large proportion of the whole simulation time in the future work the mpsdem sjtu solver will be further developed to solve 3 d fsi problems and the parallel technique will play a greater role 3 3 flood discharge with an elastic gate in this section a benchmark test carried out by antoci et al 2007 is selected to validate the accuracy of present solver the sketch of the model is showed in fig 18 the water is placed at the right side and an elastic gate is hung on the rigid wall the water column is 0 1 m wide and 0 14 m high the elastic gate is 0 005 m thick and 0 079 m high before the test starts there is no deformation of the gate because the water pressure force and external force provided by a baffle are balanced when the test starts the baffle is removed immediately under the action of water pressure the elastic gate deforms and its end moves parameters of the simulation can be founded in table 4 fig 19 presents some snapshots of experiment and their counterparts of the simulation some typical phenomena can be captured in both experiment and simulation before t 0 16s the water level near the elastic gate is lower than that near the right rigid wall after t 0 16 s the water level near the right rigid wall drops faster than that near the elastic gate in the simulation the pressure field of the fluid is smooth and obvious non physical oscillations can not be observed besides the stress field is provided tension and compression stress of the structure are in accordance with the actual situation figs 20 and 21 show the quantitative comparisons between the experiment antoci et al 2007 and simulation both the horizontal and vertical displacement of the free end of the gate first increase and then decrease with the drop of water level the displacement reaches the peak at around t 0 15 s the peak of horizontal displacement measured by simulation is slightly higher than experimental results this discrepancy may arise from the location of left wall there is no actual left wall in present simulation and the particles will be deleted once they are out of the calculation domain in general simulation results match well with experimental data showing the accuracy of present solver 3 4 sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic plate the simulation of periodic motion needs high stability of the solver the sloshing flows in a rolling rectangular tank with a thin elastic plate fixed in the middle of the bottom is simulated fig 22 shows the sketch of the model the rectangular tank is 0 609 m wide and 0 3445 m high the tank is partially filled with oil which is 0 1148 m deep the elastic plate is 0 004 m thick and its length is equal to the depth of the oil other parameters of simulation can be founded in table 5 tank rolls harmonically under the external excitation 39 θ θ a sin ω t where a is the amplitude of motion θ a 4 is the excitation frequency ω 5 188 rad s snapshots of moving tank obtained by mps dem and their corresponding experimental photos by idelsohn et al 2008a are shown in fig 23 the large deformation of the elastic plate can be observed with oil flowing in the tank when the tank rotates clockwise the oil on the left side flows over the plate the fluid pressure on the left side is obviously higher than that on the right side making the plate bend to the right the flow patterns and the bending curve of the plate in the simulation are consistent with those in the experiment the pressure stress fields are both smooth and non physical oscillations do not occur in the whole simulation the time histories of the free end displacement of the elastic plate are presented in fig 24 where the numerical results with and without pt technique are compared against the experimental data it can be noticed that the mpsdem sjtu solver with pt performs better than that without pt in terms of phase and peak value the time histories of pressure measured by probe is presented in the fig 25 the peak values of the pressure time histories obtained by the solver with pt obviously larger than that of the solver without pt the main reason is that the particles on the other side of the plate provide their pressure for the probe in the simulation without pt but those particles do not affect the probe in the actual situation therefore it is necessary to use the pt to avoid the interaction between the neighbor particles from different side of the plate in addition compared with the pressure measured on the rigid wall of a 2 d sloshing tank in previous work xie et al 2020 the pressure measured on the elastic plate does not oscillate more violently which also proves that mpsdem sjtu solver has the characteristics of better stability 3 5 dam break with an elastic baffle a sketch of the numerical model corresponding to the dam break with an elastic baffle in the front of the tank is presented in fig 26 the tank is 0 584 m wide the water column is 0 146 m wide and 0 292 m high which is placed at the left side of the tank the elastic baffle is 0 012 m thick and 0 08 m high which is 0 286 m away from the left wall of the tank the bottom of the baffle is fixed to the tank while the top is free other parameters of the simulation are presented in table 6 the snapshots of present numerical results are compared with those simulated by coupling method of mps and fem mitsume et al 2014 as shown in fig 27 when the dam break flows impact on the elastic baffle the obvious deformation occurs in the middle side of the baffle firstly then the free end moves fast to the right under the water pressure at t 0 15 s the water front runs out of the obstacle and an obvious tongue jet can be observed the displacement reaches the peak at around t 0 2 s with the drops of water level the water pressure applied on the baffle decreases resulting in a smaller deflection jet flow further collides the right literal wall some of fluid climbs up along the wall while the other moves downward the wall the deformation of structures and the shape of free surface by present solver are in good agreement with those by mitsume et al 2014 the pressure field is smoother in present simulation in addition the displacement time histories of the free end of the baffle obtained by mps dem are compared with the data of pfem idelsohn et al 2008b sph liu et al 2013 and mps fem mitsume et al 2014 as shown in fig 28 overall different results follow the same trend the negative displacement can be observed as the fluid reaches the baffle then the displacement increases sharply and reaches a peak at t 0 25 s due to the water reduction the displacement decreases gradually at t 0 6 s the water bouncing back from the wall reaches the right side of the baffle and the displacement abruptly decreases it can be seen that numerical oscillations exist in the study by mps fem which contributes to the non smooth variation of the displacement from the blue curve the same phenomenon can also be observed in the results by mps dem at t 0 2 s 3 6 dam break with a thin elastic plate the dam break flows impacting a thin elastic plate has been investigated by liao et al 2015 through the experiment and fdm dem coupling numerical method in this sub section the case is simulated by mps dem coupling method fig 29 shows the numerical model the tank is 0 8 m wide the water column is 0 2 m wide and 0 4 m high which is placed at the left side of the tank the elastic plate is 0 004 m thick and 0 09 m high which is 0 6 m away from the left wall of the tank the bottom of the plate is fixed to the bottom of the tank while the top is free other parameters of the simulation are presented in table 7 fig 30 shows some typical snapshots of the experiment liao et al 2015 and the simulation it can be found that the fluid flows along the plate without detachment during the whole impacting process in the experiment while an obvious gap can be observed between the fluid and the plate at t 0 30 s in the simulation this unphysical numerical phenomenon is discussed in detail by sun et al 2018 2019c 2020 sun et al 2018 proposed a tic technique for the sph method to handle the tensile instability which can capture the negative pressure near the interface due to the existence of negative pressure the fluid can absorb the plate for the whole stability of the simulation the conservative scheme is adopted in this paper the tic technique will be introduced to mps dem coupling method and the stability will be also considered in the future the pressure stress field provided by mpsdem sjtu solver has no unphysical gap and the shape of the plate at different instants are well matched with those of experiment the time histories of the horizontal displacement of the plate end are presented in fig 31 the mps dem results are compared against the fsi sph results sun et al 2019b and experimental data the overall trend of the results of mps dem with pt is in good agreement with experimental data however a strong reverse oscillation can be observed during the duration 0 4 t 0 7 in both fsi sph and mps dem results which has discrepancy with experimental data this phenomenon is not observed in the simulation by multi phase fsi sph sun et al 2019b due to the air cushion effect besides this case is also simulated by mps dem without pt its result agrees well with other results when the fluid does not arrive at the right side of the plate t 0 4 it can be noticed the reverse oscillation in the simulation of the mps dem without pt is not as strong as that of the mps dem with pt when t 0 8 the displacement histories measured by mps dem without pt do not drop as fast as other results these differences are due to that the particles at different side of the plate are added to the neighbor lists which reduces the pressure difference on two sides of the plate 3 7 fluid structure interaction with fracture in the complicated ocean environments marine structures are prone to failure under the action of extreme load in this sub section the mpsdem sjtu solver is extended to the simulation of fsi problems with structural fracture fig 32 presents the sketch of the model the water is placed at the right side the top of a thin elastic gate is fixed on the rigid wall while its bottom is free the water column is 0 089 m wide and 0 18 m high the thin elastic gate is 0 004 m thick and 0 079 m high other parameters of the simulation are presented in table 8 fig 33 presents simulation snapshots of fsi problem with fracture the dam break flows impact the thin elastic gate at t 0 133 s the gate deforms and the maximum tensile compression stress and shear stress can be found near the connection between the gate and rigid wall the gate broke at t 0 14 s and the position of the fracture is also around the connection the fracture end becomes free and the stress disappears which corresponds with the actual situation the broken gate moves forward under the action of flows some fluid climbs up the gate and forms a jet flow which impacts the fracture surface at t 0 2 s therefore it is necessary to change the type of the boundary particles the numerical results are reasonable which shows that mpsdem sjtu solver has the potential to tackle the fsi problems with fracture 4 conclusions in this paper the mps dem coupling method is developed to solve fsi problems the fluid field is modelled by mps while the deformations of the structures are simulated by dem the particles of the structures have characteristics of mps and dem information such as force velocity and displacement exchanging between mps and dem are achieved by interpolation in order to enhance the computational efficiency the parallel technique is introduced to the mps dem method the misjudgment of neighbor particles near the thin structures can not be ignored in some cases therefore the partition technique pt is proposed to remove the particles which are at different sides of the thin structures from the neighbor list the dem based structure model is validated firstly by simulating an oscillating cantilever plate the displacement time histories of the plate with different resolutions match well with the analytic solutions showing the good convergent performance of dem solver besides the stress field is continuous and smooth then the mps dem coupling method is used to solve some fsi problems with deformation such as the hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate flood discharge with an elastic gate sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic plate and dam break with an elastic plate the parallel efficiency is tested in the hydrostatic case and the running speed of the solver is improved obviously in the cases with thin structures the results provided by the solver with pt is more accurate than those by the solver without pt finally the developed solver is successfully extended to tackle the fsi problems with fracture in general the developed mpsdem sjtu solver can accurately solve the 2 d fsi problem with high performance in fact real ocean engineering problems are more complicated and 3 d effect can not be ignored however with the increase of the number of particles the computational speed will decrease sharply in the future 2 d mps dem method will be extended to 3 d gpu techniques and multi gpu techniques based on mpi techniques will be introduced to the mps dem method besides the fsi problem with fracture is only roughly simulated by present solver however the crack propagation is more complex the fracture dem model in present solver should be further

20406,in this present work an in house solver mpsdem sjtu is developed based on the improved moving particle semi implicit mps method and discrete element method dem the mps method is used to simulate the movement of the fluid while a more precise bond model which includes the rolling contact model is employed to analyse the dynamic responses of structures based on the boundary condition of mps a simple coupling scheme is proposed for the information exchange the pressure carried by mps particles is passed to the dem particles in turn the velocity and displacement information will be transferred from the solid domain to the fluid domain in order to improve the computation efficiency the parallel technique is introduced to the solver besides a partition technique pt is developed to avoid the misjudgment of the neighbor particles near the thin structures the dem based structural solver is firstly validated for simulating an oscillating cantilever plate then the coupling model is validated by comparison with benchmark tests such as hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic baffle the flood discharge with an elastic gate and dam break with an elastic plate the numerical results show good agreement with experimental data and other numerical results in addition the developed solver is successfully extended to tackle fsi problems with fracture keywords moving particle semi implicit method mps discrete element method dem fluid structure interaction fsi parallel technique partition technique mpsdem sjtu solver 1 introduction the fluid structure interaction fsi problems with violent free surface flows widely exist in ocean engineering field such as sloshing in a rolling tank with elastic baffles idelsohn et al 2008a ocean waves interacting with the sea ice floes zhang et al 2019 and the water impacting the ship bottom plate stenius et al 2011 the fluid dynamics applied by severe flows may lead to large deformations and even fractures of structures therefore it is necessary to investigate the fsi problems for the safety of the offshore structures although the experimental technologies have developed maturely and reliably these still have some unavoidable drawbacks experiments are usually time and money consuming in addition sometimes the experimental model sizes are much smaller than the actual sizes of objects therefore the accuracy of the experimental data may be affected due to the scale effect the numerical technique has developed fast in the past years and gradually formed complementary relationship with experimental techniques according to the treatment for interface of fluids and structures the numerical techniques for fsi problems can be divided into two main categories hwang et al 2014 the monolithic and the partitioned approaches for the former the fluid movement and the structure responses are solved with one system of governing equations for the latter the fluids and the structures are treated separately and the information is exchanged through the interpolation although the errors exist during the interpolation procedure the partition approaches are more simplified and flexible for the complex fsi problems which has attracted more attention of researchers considering the advantages of different methods for fluid and structure solution many coupling methods have been proposed for fsi problem the grid based methods are the mainstream approaches to simulate the flow field the high order schemes and the parallel strategy can be easily introduced to the grid based methods which can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of these methods the low accuracy and poor stability of the particle based methods always bothered the researchers and many corrective methods have been proposed to overcome those drawbacks tanaka and masunaga 2010 proposed a mixed source term for the poisson pressure equation ppe and a gradient model of momentum conservation khayyer and gotch 2010 2011 2012 did a series of work to improve the accuracy and stability of particle based methods high order schemes were proposed for laplacian model source term of poisson pressure equation ppe and gradient model of mps considering the errors bringed by the uneven distribution and the aggregation of the particles the optimized particle shifting scheme was also proposed by khayyer et al 2017 compared with traditional grid based methods the particle based method shows its advantages in capturing complex free surface especially for fragmentations and splashing besides the structures with large deformation and movement are hard to handle which may cause the distortion of the grids the distorted grids affect the accuracy of simulation and the mesh reconstruction is computationally expensive in the contrast it is easy for particle based methods to overcome these drawbacks there are no fixed topological relationships among lagrangian particles and the information exchange is not restricted to specific nodes therefore the particle methods have the potential to be applied to the severe fsi problems in recent years many structural analysis methods have been coupled with particle methods to investigate fsi problems yang et al 2012 coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method with finite element method fem the accuracy of coupling method was verified by comparison with the benchmark tests such as the sloshing with elastic baffle and flood discharge with elastic gate khayyer et al 2018a employed projection based incompressible sph isph method for simulation of fluid and developed a novel sph based structure model the fluid structure acceleration based fsa or the pressure integration pi coupling schemes were compared in detail the isph sph method was applied for the water entry of elastic wedge and panel khayyer et al 2021b further developed an isph hsph solver for simulation of fluid interacting with composite structures a hamiltonian sph hsph was developed for the structure analysis falahaty et al 2018 coupled moving least squares mls method and dual particle dynamics dpd structure model with moving particle semi implicit mps method respectively the mls mps model and dpd mps model were systematically compared through a series of numerical simulations chen et al 2019 developed an in house 3 d fsi solver mpsfem sjtu based on mps method and fem a kernel function based interpolation kfbi was introduced to handle the information exchange between mps boundary particles and fem grids the 3 d sloshing in the tank made of elastic material was investigated hu et al 2019 coupled sph and smoothed point interpolation method spim to simulate the sloshing in the tank with elastic baffle there was not a consistent one to one match between spim nodes and sph ghost particles physical qualities such as velocity displacement and force are exchanged using interpolation long et al 2016 introduced a particle element algorithm to isph fem and sph fem through some typical simulations the effectiveness of this algorithm was proved zhang et al 2020 used decoupled finite particle method dfpm and smoothed fem sfem to study the effect of the configuration of elastic baffles to the sloshing the virtual particle strategy was adopted to treat the interaction between the fluid and structures yang and zhang 2018 used mps method coupling with large eddy simulation les methods to study the interaction between the dam break flows and elastic baffles although both the fluid domain and elastic structures were modelled by mps methods the partitioned approach was adopted for the coupling discrete element method dem as another lagrangian particle based method can be used to describe the interaction among the solid bodies and has been widely applied to the engineering and nature field including the particle flows sakai et al 2012 multi rigid body interaction canelas et al 2016 deformation and fracture of structures wu et al 2016 2018 the real ocean environment is more complicated which includes interactions among fluids particles and structures compared with the solid part of afore mentioned fsi methods dem has the potential to tackle more complex ocean problems the response of elastic structures was usually simulated by dem with bonded particle model bpm which was firstly proposed by potyondy and cundall 2004 the moment induced by relative rotation between neighbouring dem particles is calculated through hooke s law jiang et al 2005 introduced a rolling contact model to the traditional bond model which assumed that there were countless springs in the bond between two neighbouring particles the basic concept of rolling contact model is similar with the bpm the rolling contact model was further modified to suit for the situation with large relative rotation by wang 2020 besides the force displacement contact law of dem was replaced by stress strain form the new bond model was successfully applied to simulate the large deformation and fracture of elastic structures zhao 2015 adopted only two subnormal springs to transmit a moment between two neighbouring particles several particle based methods have been coupled with dem to investigate the fsi problems there are two main models 7 disc and 9 disc for structures according to the arrangement of dem particles owen et al 2020 tang et al 2018 coupled sph and dem for the fsi problems neighbouring dem particles was joined together by two parallel springs which was a simplified version of rolling contact model for the stability of the structure dem particles were arranged as a hexagonal scheme 7 disc however it is difficult to configure sph boundary particles sun et al 2019a adopted 9 disc arrangement of dem particles and the bpm the mps dem method was used to investigate the influence of dam break flows to a floating deformable structure with moorings a more precise bond model containing the rolling contact model jiang et al 2005 is used to simulate the structural response in mpsdem sjtu solver the coupling schemes of mps sph with dem are not showed in detail in those works mentioned above in present work a simple coupling scheme is proposed and its stability and accuracy are checked in detail besides the stress field is presented in the structure of dem by which the area where its structure is prone to damage can be easily detect in addition some marine structures are very thin such as the ship hull shell and the hydraulic turbine blade the fluid on both sides of the thin structures will not interfere with each other the interaction between fluid and thick structures or the fluid only acting on one side of the structure can be simulated by previous sph dem and mps dem models however the effect of thin structures to the neighbor particle search have rarely been considered or mentioned to offset this vacancy a partition technique pt is established and implanted into the in house mpsdem sjtu solver due to the more accurate neighbouring particles search the force exerted on the structures is more accurate the elastic structures tend to be thin and the corresponding wall particles should be small therefore the total amount of particles will be large in the whole region with single resolution in order to improve the computational efficiency many approaches have been introduced to particle methods those approaches can be classified as multi resolution techniques parallel technique and gpu acceleration technique for multi resolution techniques the particles with small spacing are only arranged at the field that needs be focused on which reduces computational load and meets the requirements of local accuracy sun et al 2019b investigated a violent fluid structure dam break problem with multi phase δ sph methods and adaptive particle refinement apr the apr region was set around the elastic structure and the coarse particles were splitted into more fine particles when they entered the refinement region khayyer et al 2018b 2021a firstly introduced a multi resolution method into mps and isph sph methods to solve the hydro elastic fsi problem the elastic baffle was simulated by fine particles while the flow field was composed of coarse particles the key idea of parallel technique is to divide tasks into several parts and assign them to different cpu processors for processing at the same time marrone et al 2012 developed a parallel 3 d sph model which achieves a high parallel efficiency the wave pattern generated by a moving ship is successful captured as a new hardware gpu is in possession of more arithmetic logic units alu than cpu therefore gpu can achieve high floating point operations per second flops and deal with large amounts of data simultaneously chen and wan 2019a chen and wan 2019b introduced gpu acceleration technique to mps method and the speed up ratio can be up to 25 33 times compared with single cpu however gpu acceleration technique is not used as widely as multi cpu parallel technique in this paper the multi cpu parallel technique is introduced to the mps dem method which also lays a foundation for the application of multi gpu parallel technique in large scale flow simulation in present study an in house parallel solver mpsdem sjtu based on mps method and dem is developed to simulate fsi problems firstly the improved mps method the dem method the mps dem coupling scheme the parallel strategy and partition technique pt are presented briefly in the section of numerical simulations an oscillating cantilever plate is simulated to validate the dem part of developed solver then several numerical examples including the hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the flood discharge with an elastic gate sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic plate and dam break with an elastic plate are carried out to test the accuracy and performance of the mpsdem sjtu solver the parallel efficiency the convergency and the energy conservation properties of the mps dem solver are tested in the hydrostatic case in the cases with thin elastic structures the superiority of the pt for the neighbouring particles search near the thin structures is presented finally the mpsdem sjtu solver is successfully extended to simulate the fsi with fracture 2 numerical method 2 1 mps method for fluid simulation mps method was firstly proposed by koshizuka and oka 1996 for simulation of viscous incompressible fluid the governing equations of the fluid consist of mass conservation equation and momentum conservation equation given by 1 u 0 2 d u d t 1 ρ p ν 2 u g where the u t ρ p ν and g are the velocity vector time fluid density pressure kinematic viscosity of the fluid and gravity acceleration vector respectively the interaction among mps particles controlled by kernel function in order to avoid the singular point the kernel function introduced by zhang and wan 2012a is employed here 3 w r r e 0 85 r 0 15 r e 1 0 r r e 0 r e r where r is the distance between two particles and r e is the radius of the particle interaction the particle interaction models contain gradient model divergence model and laplacian model defined as 4 φ i d n 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i w r j r i 5 v i d n 0 j i u j u i r j r i r j r i 2 w r j r i 6 2 φ i 2 d n 0 λ j i φ j φ i w r j r i where φ is a physical quantity d is the number of space dimension n 0 is the initial particle density r is the position vector relative to origin λ is a parameter to make the increase of variance equal to the corresponding analytical solution koshizuka and oka 1996 given by 7 λ j i w r j r i r j r i 2 j i w r j r i pressure information carried by mps particles is obtained by solving the pressure poisson equation ppe in order to balance between stability and accuracy a mixed source method khayyer and gotoh 2011 tanaka and masunaga 2010 is adopted defined by 8 2 p k 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t u i γ ρ δ t 2 n i n 0 n 0 where p k 1 δ t u i and n are the pressure of the step k 1 time step temporal velocity and temporal particle density γ is a blending parameter whose value is set to be 0 01 in this paper 2 2 dem method for structure simulation in classical dem method the solid body is made of particles the motion of the particle is governed by newton s second law expressed as 9 m d v d t f c m g f int 10 i d ω d t m c t where m and i are the mass and the moment of inertia v and ω are the linear and angular velocity f c and m c t are the contact force and contact moment among solid particles f int is the hydrodynamics exerted on the solid particles the contact force is calculated based on the contact model which consists of springs dashpots and sliders the dem particles are regarded as soft spheres and they can overlap with each other the overlap is equal to the deformation of the springs the contact force f c can be decomposed into the normal component f c n and tangential component f c t both components consist of elastic force and damping force 11 f c n k n δ n d n δ v n 12 f c t k t δ t d t δ v t f c t μ f c n μ f c n δ v t δ v t f c t μ f c n where k d δ and δ v is the stiffness damping coefficient relative displacement and relative velocity μ is the friction coefficient μ f c n is the boundary of the transition from static friction to dynamic friction fig 1 shows the bonded particle model bpm potyondy and cundall 2004 with rolling contact model jiang et al 2005 the dpm consists of springs and dashpots the particles of the structure are packed in cubic form based on the beam theory the stiffness k n can be calculated as 13 k n a e l t l e l e t e where e is the young s modulus of the material a t and l are the cross sectional area thickness and length of beam element in 2 d case the thickness is the unit thickness the stiffness of spring in tangential direction can be estimated as 14 k t ν k n where ν is the poisson ratio the damping coefficient in normal and tangential direction can be calculated as wu et al 2016 15 d n 2 β n m k n 16 d t 2 β t m k t where β n and β t are parameters which are set to 0 2 the moment in the bpm is not only induced by the contact force in tangential direction but also caused by the relative rotation between two neighbouring dem particles the moment m c t induced by contact force in tangential direction is calculated as 17 m c t r f c t in order to transfer the moment caused by relative rotation between the dem particles the single spring in normal direction should be equivalent to countless springs with same stiffness k n k n 2 r these springs distribute uniformly between two particles the calculation of moment m c r is similar to the integral in wang 2020 given by 18 m c r 2 0 r r r δ θ k n d r 2 3 k n r 3 δ θ where r is the radius of dem particle and δ θ is the relative angle between the neighbouring dem particles 2 3 coupling of mps and dem in our previous study chen and wan 2019a multilayer mps particles are configured on the boundary pressures of wall particles which is near the fluid domain are solved by ppe fig 2 shows the arrangement of particles in this work fluids and solids are discretized at the same resolution therefore dem particles overlap with mps boundary particles these particles of the structure exhibit properties of both mps and dem a simple coupling scheme coupling scheme is proposed in this study the pressure of the wall particles can be obtained by solving ppe just like the fluid particles then the pressure is transferred from mps wall particles to corresponding dem particles the motion of dem particles follows the force displacement rather than stress strain law therefore the hydro force applied on each dem particle is focused the hydro force applied to the dem particles can be calculated as 19 f int p δ x n where p is the pressure of the corresponding mps wall particle δ x is the distance between the mps particles n is the normal direction the information of position and the velocity are transmitted from dem particles to mps boundary particles 20 x b x s 21 u b v s the sizes of time step for mps and dem are quite different due to the explicit scheme the time step size of dem commonly is set to a small value correspondingly a much larger time step for mps is adopted in order to keep the stability and efficiency of the coupling algorithm fig 3 shows the coupling strategy of mps and dem the dem iterates k times in one mps iteration loop the mps time step δ t mps should meet the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition given by 22 u max δ t mps δ l 0 c where u max is the maximum velocity of the fluid δ l 0 is the initial mps particle spacing c is the courant number the dem time step δ t dem is decided by the mass and the stiffness of the dem particle defined by 23 δ t d e m m k 2 4 free surface detection based on the asymmetric distribution of neighbouring particles near the free surface zhang and wan 2012b proposed an improved surface particle detection method whose basic concept is similar to that proposed by khayyer et al 2009 the surface particle detection method can effectively and accurately distinguish free surface particles from other particles fig 4 shows the sketch of free surface detection the detection criterion is given by 24 n i β n 0 25 f i d n 0 j i 1 r i r j r i r j w r j r i f i α f 0 where f is a vector which represents the asymmetry distribution of neighbouring particles f 0 is the f of the internal fluid particles at initial time parameters β and α are set to 0 8 and 0 9 respectively 2 5 neighbor particle search near the thin structure both the wall particles and fluid particles participate in the solution of the ppe fig 5 presents the sketch of the neighbor particles search near a very thin plate the fluid particles and wall particles on one side of the plate can be regarded as the neighbor particles of the particles on the other side of the plate which is not in accordance with the actual situation and affects the accuracy of the force calculation on the plate therefore it is necessary to prevent the particles on the one side of the plate become the neighbor particles of the particles from the other side additional judgement is added to the solver the basic concept can be founded in fig 5 the centers of two neighbor ghost particles are connected with grey lines if the connection red line of two neighbor particles intersects with one of the grey lines they are removed from the list of neighbor particle 2 6 fsi with fracture the maximum tensile stress σ max of the beam element can be derived as 26 σ max f c n a k n r δ θ the commonly used criterion the mohr coulomb mc wang 2020 for the fracture induced by the shear stress is given by 27 τ crit c μ f c n a k n r δ θ if the maximum stress exceeds the criterion the bonds are judged to be invalid and the neighbouring particles won t re bond again 28 σ max σ crit τ τ crit where τ is the shear stress in the bond σ crit and τ crit are the ultimate stress of fracture tensile strength and cohesion strength in the fsi problems with fracture the fluid may interact with the fracture surface therefore it is necessary to change the type of the mps boundary particles as shown in fig 6 once the bond of the dem particle is broken the corresponding mps ghost particle will become the wall particle 2 7 high performance strategy for mps dem mps particles have no topological relationship and can move freely with the fluid flows compared with traditional grid based method it is difficult to divide the whole mps calculational domain into sub domains of different processes the mps particles may transfer from one sub domain to another if the calculation domain is divided equally the difference in the number of particles between different subdomains may be too large which directly decrease the parallel efficiency a background grid method has been introduced to particle method the background grids marrone et al 2012 cover the whole calculation domain and serve two main purposes providing the reference frame for mps particles to find their neighbors and allocating the nearly equal number particles to different processes to achieve the load balance the concept of parallel strategy for the mps is presented in fig 7 the size of the sub domain will change with the movement of mps particles to make the number of the particles in processes remain approximately constant the cells near other processes belongs to buffer in which the information of adjacent processes exchanges the particles in the buffers not only simulate the flows in the local process but also provide boundary support for the adjacent processes the information carried by the mps particles of elastic structures also should be broadcast to all processors after every mps step if the structure fracture doesn t occur the neighbors of each dem particle will not change therefore the process of particle search which is the most time consuming step only takes place in the first time step because the dem particles won t transfer from one process to another as the mps particles the background grids which are used in the mps method is unnecessary for the structure analysis fig 8 shows the domain decomposition of the dem part a continuous beam is simply divided into four equal parts the particles close to other processes is in the buffer region where the information is exchanged 3 numerical simulations 3 1 validation of dem solver for structure dynamic analysis the dem solver is firstly used to simulate an oscillating cantilever plate fig 9 shows the sketch of the model the cantilever plate is 0 2 m long and 0 02 m thick at the beginning the plate without deformation is in the equilibrium position and the initial vertical velocity distribution of the plate is given by 29 v y x v y l c 0 f x f l 30 f x cos k l cosh k l cosh k x cos k x sin k l sinh k l sinh k x sin k x where v y l 0 01 is the initial vertical velocity at the free end of the plate k l is set to 1 875 for the fundamental mode c 0 is the velocity of sound which is decided by the properties of the material given by 31 c 0 k s ρ s where k s 3 25 10 6 n m 2 is the bulk modulus ρ s 1000 kg m 3 is the density of the plate parameters of the simulation are presented in table 1 fig 10 shows time histories of free end displacement of the plate it can be noted that results of simulations with different resolutions all agree well with the analytic solution showing good convergency performance of present solver the results obtained by different method are listed in table 2 results obtained by the present solver and by hwang et al 2014 are close to the analytic solution than those by other researchers fig 11 presents the stress distribution of the cantilever plate at t 0 57s which is smooth and consistent with the deformation 3 2 hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the convergence efficiency and stability of the mpsdem sjtu solver are investigated by the benchmark test of a hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the sketch of the model is presented in fig 12 the water column is 2 m high and 1 m wide which is confined in a tank the bottom of the tank is 0 05 m thick and made of elastic material table 3 shows detailed parameters of the simulation this case has been simulated by sph fem li et al 2015 isph sph khayyer et al 2018a and sph spim hu et al 2019 fig 13 shows the time history of the mid point displacement of the elastic plate obtained by different numerical methods and analytic solution deformation trends to be stable after some initial oscillations it can be observed that the time history curve obtained by mps dem is smoother than that obtained by sph fem li et al 2015 and closer to the analytic solution which implies that present solver is more stable additional simulations with t dp being 4 and 5 are also conducted fig 13 shows the results with different resolutions it can be noticed that those results are consistent showing the good convergent property of present coupling method it is noted that the pressure and stress field obtained by this solver are smooth and stable as shown in fig 14 the energy conservation features in the whole fsi system khayyer et al 2018a zhang et al 2021 of mpsdem sjtu solver is investigated the formulations of energy are given by 32 e t e t f e t s 33 e t s e k s e p s e e s 34 e t f e k f e p f where e t e t f and e t s are the total energy of whole fsi system fluid field and structure field respectively e k f and e p f are the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of fluid field e k s e p s and e e s are the kinetic energy gravitational potential energy and elastic strain energy of structure field the elastic strain energy of the bond model of dem is calculate as 35 e e s e e t c s e e s s e e m s 36 e e t c s 1 2 k n δ n 2 37 e e s s 1 2 k s δ s 2 38 e e m s 2 0 r 1 2 r δ θ r δ θ k n d r 2 3 k n r 3 δ θ 2 where e e t c s e e s s and e e m s are the strain energy caused by tension compression force in normal direction shear force and the moment induced by relative rotation the time histories of energy components in the fsi system are presents in fig 15 it can be noted that although there are some oscillations in the initial stage all the energy components except the kinetic energy of the fluid reach almost constant values before t 1s from fig 15 g and j the normalized total energy of the whole system decreases with the drop of fluid kinetic energy which indicates that the fluid kinetic energy takes mainly responsibility for the loss of total energy the normalized total energy and fluid kinetic energy reach constant values before t 10 s the loss of normalized total energy is about 0 025 at t 1 s and 0 054 at t 10 s in order to further eliminate the influence of fluid kinetic energy the time history of normalization for total energy minus fluid kinetic energy is also presented in fig 15 k after some initial oscillations the normalization for total energy minus fluid kinetic energy is maintain almost a constant value which implies that the drop of fluid kinetic energy doesn t caused by the energy exchange between structure and fluid the drop of fluid kinetic energy may because the pressure of the fluid field oscillates slightly and the velocity of fluid is not equal to zero at initial stage in general mpsdem sjtu solver has the characteristics of energy conservation the parallel efficiency of mpsdem sjtu is tested in this case it should be noted that the mpsdem sjtu solver runs on the high performance computing hpc cluster of cmhl group cpu of intel xeon e5 2680 v2 10 cores 2 80ghz node and ram 64 gb the percentages of the computation time for mps part and dem part are presented in fig 16 it can be noted that the dem part takes up nearly half of the total computation time this is a hydrostatic problem so the mps part of the solver has good stability and robustness even it runs with a larger time step the stiffness of the elastic plate is very large in order to meet the accuracy requirements the time step of dem is relatively small fig 17 shows the speed up ratio of the mps dem simulation it can be noticed that the efficiency is improved obviously when the number of gpus is less than 4 and an efficiency of 70 6 is achieved when the solver runs on 4 cpus however the efficiency is not further improved when the number of cpus reaches 6 that because the particles number of 2 d simulation is small and the communication time between cpus takes a large proportion of the whole simulation time in the future work the mpsdem sjtu solver will be further developed to solve 3 d fsi problems and the parallel technique will play a greater role 3 3 flood discharge with an elastic gate in this section a benchmark test carried out by antoci et al 2007 is selected to validate the accuracy of present solver the sketch of the model is showed in fig 18 the water is placed at the right side and an elastic gate is hung on the rigid wall the water column is 0 1 m wide and 0 14 m high the elastic gate is 0 005 m thick and 0 079 m high before the test starts there is no deformation of the gate because the water pressure force and external force provided by a baffle are balanced when the test starts the baffle is removed immediately under the action of water pressure the elastic gate deforms and its end moves parameters of the simulation can be founded in table 4 fig 19 presents some snapshots of experiment and their counterparts of the simulation some typical phenomena can be captured in both experiment and simulation before t 0 16s the water level near the elastic gate is lower than that near the right rigid wall after t 0 16 s the water level near the right rigid wall drops faster than that near the elastic gate in the simulation the pressure field of the fluid is smooth and obvious non physical oscillations can not be observed besides the stress field is provided tension and compression stress of the structure are in accordance with the actual situation figs 20 and 21 show the quantitative comparisons between the experiment antoci et al 2007 and simulation both the horizontal and vertical displacement of the free end of the gate first increase and then decrease with the drop of water level the displacement reaches the peak at around t 0 15 s the peak of horizontal displacement measured by simulation is slightly higher than experimental results this discrepancy may arise from the location of left wall there is no actual left wall in present simulation and the particles will be deleted once they are out of the calculation domain in general simulation results match well with experimental data showing the accuracy of present solver 3 4 sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic plate the simulation of periodic motion needs high stability of the solver the sloshing flows in a rolling rectangular tank with a thin elastic plate fixed in the middle of the bottom is simulated fig 22 shows the sketch of the model the rectangular tank is 0 609 m wide and 0 3445 m high the tank is partially filled with oil which is 0 1148 m deep the elastic plate is 0 004 m thick and its length is equal to the depth of the oil other parameters of simulation can be founded in table 5 tank rolls harmonically under the external excitation 39 θ θ a sin ω t where a is the amplitude of motion θ a 4 is the excitation frequency ω 5 188 rad s snapshots of moving tank obtained by mps dem and their corresponding experimental photos by idelsohn et al 2008a are shown in fig 23 the large deformation of the elastic plate can be observed with oil flowing in the tank when the tank rotates clockwise the oil on the left side flows over the plate the fluid pressure on the left side is obviously higher than that on the right side making the plate bend to the right the flow patterns and the bending curve of the plate in the simulation are consistent with those in the experiment the pressure stress fields are both smooth and non physical oscillations do not occur in the whole simulation the time histories of the free end displacement of the elastic plate are presented in fig 24 where the numerical results with and without pt technique are compared against the experimental data it can be noticed that the mpsdem sjtu solver with pt performs better than that without pt in terms of phase and peak value the time histories of pressure measured by probe is presented in the fig 25 the peak values of the pressure time histories obtained by the solver with pt obviously larger than that of the solver without pt the main reason is that the particles on the other side of the plate provide their pressure for the probe in the simulation without pt but those particles do not affect the probe in the actual situation therefore it is necessary to use the pt to avoid the interaction between the neighbor particles from different side of the plate in addition compared with the pressure measured on the rigid wall of a 2 d sloshing tank in previous work xie et al 2020 the pressure measured on the elastic plate does not oscillate more violently which also proves that mpsdem sjtu solver has the characteristics of better stability 3 5 dam break with an elastic baffle a sketch of the numerical model corresponding to the dam break with an elastic baffle in the front of the tank is presented in fig 26 the tank is 0 584 m wide the water column is 0 146 m wide and 0 292 m high which is placed at the left side of the tank the elastic baffle is 0 012 m thick and 0 08 m high which is 0 286 m away from the left wall of the tank the bottom of the baffle is fixed to the tank while the top is free other parameters of the simulation are presented in table 6 the snapshots of present numerical results are compared with those simulated by coupling method of mps and fem mitsume et al 2014 as shown in fig 27 when the dam break flows impact on the elastic baffle the obvious deformation occurs in the middle side of the baffle firstly then the free end moves fast to the right under the water pressure at t 0 15 s the water front runs out of the obstacle and an obvious tongue jet can be observed the displacement reaches the peak at around t 0 2 s with the drops of water level the water pressure applied on the baffle decreases resulting in a smaller deflection jet flow further collides the right literal wall some of fluid climbs up along the wall while the other moves downward the wall the deformation of structures and the shape of free surface by present solver are in good agreement with those by mitsume et al 2014 the pressure field is smoother in present simulation in addition the displacement time histories of the free end of the baffle obtained by mps dem are compared with the data of pfem idelsohn et al 2008b sph liu et al 2013 and mps fem mitsume et al 2014 as shown in fig 28 overall different results follow the same trend the negative displacement can be observed as the fluid reaches the baffle then the displacement increases sharply and reaches a peak at t 0 25 s due to the water reduction the displacement decreases gradually at t 0 6 s the water bouncing back from the wall reaches the right side of the baffle and the displacement abruptly decreases it can be seen that numerical oscillations exist in the study by mps fem which contributes to the non smooth variation of the displacement from the blue curve the same phenomenon can also be observed in the results by mps dem at t 0 2 s 3 6 dam break with a thin elastic plate the dam break flows impacting a thin elastic plate has been investigated by liao et al 2015 through the experiment and fdm dem coupling numerical method in this sub section the case is simulated by mps dem coupling method fig 29 shows the numerical model the tank is 0 8 m wide the water column is 0 2 m wide and 0 4 m high which is placed at the left side of the tank the elastic plate is 0 004 m thick and 0 09 m high which is 0 6 m away from the left wall of the tank the bottom of the plate is fixed to the bottom of the tank while the top is free other parameters of the simulation are presented in table 7 fig 30 shows some typical snapshots of the experiment liao et al 2015 and the simulation it can be found that the fluid flows along the plate without detachment during the whole impacting process in the experiment while an obvious gap can be observed between the fluid and the plate at t 0 30 s in the simulation this unphysical numerical phenomenon is discussed in detail by sun et al 2018 2019c 2020 sun et al 2018 proposed a tic technique for the sph method to handle the tensile instability which can capture the negative pressure near the interface due to the existence of negative pressure the fluid can absorb the plate for the whole stability of the simulation the conservative scheme is adopted in this paper the tic technique will be introduced to mps dem coupling method and the stability will be also considered in the future the pressure stress field provided by mpsdem sjtu solver has no unphysical gap and the shape of the plate at different instants are well matched with those of experiment the time histories of the horizontal displacement of the plate end are presented in fig 31 the mps dem results are compared against the fsi sph results sun et al 2019b and experimental data the overall trend of the results of mps dem with pt is in good agreement with experimental data however a strong reverse oscillation can be observed during the duration 0 4 t 0 7 in both fsi sph and mps dem results which has discrepancy with experimental data this phenomenon is not observed in the simulation by multi phase fsi sph sun et al 2019b due to the air cushion effect besides this case is also simulated by mps dem without pt its result agrees well with other results when the fluid does not arrive at the right side of the plate t 0 4 it can be noticed the reverse oscillation in the simulation of the mps dem without pt is not as strong as that of the mps dem with pt when t 0 8 the displacement histories measured by mps dem without pt do not drop as fast as other results these differences are due to that the particles at different side of the plate are added to the neighbor lists which reduces the pressure difference on two sides of the plate 3 7 fluid structure interaction with fracture in the complicated ocean environments marine structures are prone to failure under the action of extreme load in this sub section the mpsdem sjtu solver is extended to the simulation of fsi problems with structural fracture fig 32 presents the sketch of the model the water is placed at the right side the top of a thin elastic gate is fixed on the rigid wall while its bottom is free the water column is 0 089 m wide and 0 18 m high the thin elastic gate is 0 004 m thick and 0 079 m high other parameters of the simulation are presented in table 8 fig 33 presents simulation snapshots of fsi problem with fracture the dam break flows impact the thin elastic gate at t 0 133 s the gate deforms and the maximum tensile compression stress and shear stress can be found near the connection between the gate and rigid wall the gate broke at t 0 14 s and the position of the fracture is also around the connection the fracture end becomes free and the stress disappears which corresponds with the actual situation the broken gate moves forward under the action of flows some fluid climbs up the gate and forms a jet flow which impacts the fracture surface at t 0 2 s therefore it is necessary to change the type of the boundary particles the numerical results are reasonable which shows that mpsdem sjtu solver has the potential to tackle the fsi problems with fracture 4 conclusions in this paper the mps dem coupling method is developed to solve fsi problems the fluid field is modelled by mps while the deformations of the structures are simulated by dem the particles of the structures have characteristics of mps and dem information such as force velocity and displacement exchanging between mps and dem are achieved by interpolation in order to enhance the computational efficiency the parallel technique is introduced to the mps dem method the misjudgment of neighbor particles near the thin structures can not be ignored in some cases therefore the partition technique pt is proposed to remove the particles which are at different sides of the thin structures from the neighbor list the dem based structure model is validated firstly by simulating an oscillating cantilever plate the displacement time histories of the plate with different resolutions match well with the analytic solutions showing the good convergent performance of dem solver besides the stress field is continuous and smooth then the mps dem coupling method is used to solve some fsi problems with deformation such as the hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate flood discharge with an elastic gate sloshing flows in a rolling tank with a thin elastic plate and dam break with an elastic plate the parallel efficiency is tested in the hydrostatic case and the running speed of the solver is improved obviously in the cases with thin structures the results provided by the solver with pt is more accurate than those by the solver without pt finally the developed solver is successfully extended to tackle the fsi problems with fracture in general the developed mpsdem sjtu solver can accurately solve the 2 d fsi problem with high performance in fact real ocean engineering problems are more complicated and 3 d effect can not be ignored however with the increase of the number of particles the computational speed will decrease sharply in the future 2 d mps dem method will be extended to 3 d gpu techniques and multi gpu techniques based on mpi techniques will be introduced to the mps dem method besides the fsi problem with fracture is only roughly simulated by present solver however the crack propagation is more complex the fracture dem model in present solver should be further improved and validated credit authorship contribution statement fengze xie data curation writing original draft visualization investigation software validation weiwen zhao software data curation

20407,the single barge floatover method faces great challenges when it comes to the gigantic topsides and the substructures lack of sufficient slots the twin barge floatover system with large capacities and great flexibilities for various topsides and substructures would be a promising alternative for fixed and floating platforms this study experimentally investigates the dynamic responses of the floatover system in beam waves with the focus on one of the critical load transfer steps namely the topsides transfer operations onto the twin barge from a transportation barge three representative intermediate stages i e 0 50 and 100 stages were experimentally simulated results revealed that the upwind barge experienced larger motions than others attributed to the shielding effect results implied that the in between fluid resonant may have great influences on the motions the twin barge floatover system were subjected to six degree of freedom motions in beam random waves because of the unsymmetrical configurations the impact loads on mating units demonstrated that the lateral loads were quite considerable and they should be paid much attention the mooring force varied slightly and the tether lines bear large snap loads at the 0 stage the critical stage for different components were identified based on comparisons of loads at three stages keywords twin barge floatover beam seas three barges in side by side vertical and lateral loads on mating units tether line loads 1 introduction the floatover method has been widely used in the offshore topsides installation because of the cost and time efficiency generally the floatover method transports the topsides into the slot of the substructures and then transfers the topsides onto the substructures by the tide variation or the active jacking methods such as the hydraulic jacking methods and the stranding lifting methods although the floatover method has been applied oneill et al 2000 tahar et al 2006 wang et al 2010 kim et al 2019 the floatover installation still faces several technical issues for example the limited slot between the transportation barge and the substructures would lead to the frequent collisions and therefore threaten the floatover operations the strict sensitivity of the transfer operation to the weather window also constrains the application of the floatover installation in moderate and high sea state to circumvent the mentioned issues researchers and engineers developed various novel floatover methods to improve the applicability wang et al 2018 bai et al 2020a b geba et al 2017 koo et al 2010 beerendonk et al 2008 he et al 2020 among the methods the two barges floaters installation method gains much attention the twin barge floatover method with the large in between span can adopt various substructures from the structural point of view the twin barge floatover installation can eliminate the requirement of the slot of the substructures and thus be conducive to the platform structural design moreover the twin barge floatover method is a potential approach for the topsides installation of the floating and semi submersible platform the twin barge floatover concept is illustrated in fig 1 firstly the topsides are loaded out on the t shaped transportation barge from the quay when the transportation barge arrives in the vicinity of the substructures two identical installation barges are approaching to the moored transportation barge secondly by ballasting down the transportation barge the topsides are transferred and connected to the twin barge separating the topsides from the transportation barge then the twin barge is moored to the sea bed and the transportation barge is towed away thirdly once the available weather window is achieved the twin barge transfers the topsides onto the substructures by lowering the twin barge finally the separated two installation barges are towed away indicating the accomplishment of the topside floatover installation in the engineering practice the twin barge floatover system can employ two small multipurpose vessels as the installation barges that one of the tasks is the floatover without the special predesign of the installation barges in the twin barge floatover method the twin barge is elastically connected with the topsides by the hemisphere deck support unit dsu that can release the rotation of the installation barges and thus mitigate the bending on the topsides the proposed method employs a novel double duty leg mating unit lmu connecting the transportation barge with the topsides as well as mating the topsides with the jackets at different load transfer steps the kind of lmu reduces the fabricating cost and improves the installation efficiency in the process of the entire twin barge floatover installation the last two load transfer steps b and c as shown in fig 1 are the most critical and dangerous phases the third step c was investigated in our previous paper bai et al 2020b this study focuses on the second step investigating the motion and load characteristics of side by side three barges in topsides transfer operations regarding the dynamic responses of the floatover installation numerous studies have been carried out by field measurements numerical models and experimental tests in past decades as for the field measurement the visual monitor system the stress monitor system and the environment measurement system were applied to obtain the real time weather and mating information wu et al 2014 luo et al 2015 tian et al 2018 great numerical and experimental modeling efforts have been made to investigate the complex behaviors of the floatover installation paulling 1995 and kwak et al 2018 developed the time and frequency domain codes to analyze the steady state motion behavior of the floatover installation sun et al 2012 and chen et al 2014 2017 numerically analyzed the multiple body interaction and addressed the nonlinear impact loads on the mating units hu et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 employed the bifurcation diagram to describe the impact behavior of the barge deck system choi et al 2014 conducted the physical model test to investigate the barge motions and contact loads on mating units as for the twin barge catamaran floatover method koo et al 2010 investigated the dynamic of the topsides transferred from the catamaran onto the spar structures dessi and faiella 2019 carried out the experimental analysis of the seakeeping characteristics of the double barges without the consideration of the topside weights xu et al 2016 investigated the response of the three barges in close proximity from the literature survey provided earlier significant attempts have been made for the floatover operations most previous studies focused on scenario that the topsides were transferred from the floating single twin barges onto the fixed jackets few literatures are related to the multi body hydrodynamic response of the three floatover barges and the topsides considerable research efforts are required for extensions to problems involving the load transfer from the transportation barge onto the twin barge the interactions of the three barges in the side by side configuration and the contact loads on mating units in various load transfer stages are in urgent need of investigations which motivates this study the paper carried out the experimental modeling of the topsides load transfer operation from the transportation barge onto the twin barge in beam regular and random waves one striking feature of this study is to investigate the hydrodynamic response of the three floating barges during various load transfer operations the load transfer operations were represented by three intermediate stages i e 0 50 and 100 stages the motions of the three barges and the topsides were investigated together with the loads on the mating units and mooring lines the paper is constructed as follows in section 2 the experiment set up is detailed section 3 presents the experimental results and investigates the motion and load characteristic of the floatover installations in section 4 conclusions are drawn 2 experiment description 2 1 experimental set up the experimental tests were conducted at tianjin university tianjin china the wave basin was 45 m length 50 m width 1 8 m depth the model scale was 1 40 with the consideration of the water depth of the target area for the catamaran floatover operations the water depth was 0 55 m in the model test corresponding to the 22 m in full scale the beam wave was considered in this study fig 2 shows the snapshot of the floatover installation system in the wave basin the principal dimensions and properties of the three barges and the topside model are listed in table 1 fig 3 illustrates the layout of the floatover installation system the mating units i e dsus and lmus were designed to absorb the impact loads between the topsides and the twin barge during the mating operations the dsus and lmus were respectively installed on the deck of the twin barge and the t shaped barge the mating unit consisted of the shock cell including the stabbing pins and the receptacle the linear spring was utilized to simulate the elasticity of the mating units three different springs with different stiffness were installed under the receptacle of the mating units as listed in table 1 six load cells with the accuracy of 0 05 n were utilized to measure the contacts loads on the mating units the double duty lmu was the cone shape meaning that both the stabbing pins and the receptacles were the shape of cone to assemble and dismiss the twin barge with the topsides easily we designed the hemisphere shaped dsu to simulate the hinge connections the hinged connections of the dsu released the rotation degree suggesting that the barge 225 226 can rotate in the roll directions another advantage of the elastically connected twin barge floatover system over the rigidly connected twin barge system was that the rotatable mating units can mitigate the bending moment on the topsides five mooring lines were employed to positioned the t shaped barge as illustrated in fig 3 the loads on the mooring system were measured using a set of axial load cells located at the fairlead position the accuracy of the axial load cell was 0 05 n the twin barge was connected to the t shaped barge by four tether lines four tension transduces with the accuracy of 0 05 n were fixed in the end of the tethers to measure tether forces the stiffness of the mooring and tether line is listed in table 1 six sway fenders were installed at the port starboard of the t shaped barge and two surge fenders were installed at the middle of the barge to absorb the impact loads between the twin barge and the t shaped barge the stiffness of the fender is listed in table 1 the components including dsu lmu fenders mooring and tether were symmetrical installed the x and y coordinates of the anchors of the five mooring lines were m1 496 3 m 0 m m2 0 m 1026 2 m and m3 78 3 m 2601 5 m the coordinates of the attachment points of the tether lines were 132 3 m 20 1 m and 94 6 m 11 5 m for ls1 0 m 26 2 m and 16 8 m 54 2 m for ls3 respectively the coordinates of the surge fenders on the port side of the barge 228 were 9 m 22 m the coordinates of the sway fenders in the upwind side were 27 5 m 18 m 42 5 m 18 m and 57 5 m 18 m the coordinates of dsus were l1 73 5 m 38 m l2 57 5 m 38 m and l3 41 5 m 38 m respectively the coordinates of lmus were l4 73 5 m 12 m l5 57 5 m 12 m and l6 41 5 m 12 m respectively the gap between the barge 225 and barge 226 was 40 4 m and the gap between the barge 225 and the barge 228 was 2 28 m the distance from the bow of the barge 228 to the stern of the barge 225 was 78 2 m the motions of the three barges and the topsides were measured by the optical motion capture system that was equipped with three high resolution cameras with the sampling rate of 100 hz the accuracy was 0 1 mm for translations and 0 01 for rotations the test cases are listed in table 2 in the experiments the jonswap was employed to simulate the random waves with the parameter γ 3 3 the measured spectrum and the theoretical spectrum were compared as follows good agreements were obtained as shown in fig 4 the time durations of the random wave tests were about 15 min corresponding to 90 min in full scale each of the random wave tests was repeated three times with different seeds the statistical results were calculated from the three repeated tests 2 2 representative load transfer stages this study focuses on the phase that the topsides are transferred from the single transportation barge to the twin barge to depict the motion behavior and load characteristic of the focused load transfer phase three intermediate stages were selected two critical load transfer scenarios i e 0 load transfer stage and 100 load transfer stage that are associated with the impact loads on mating unites and the middle stage i e 50 load transfer stage were simulated fig 5 illustrates the three load transfer stages a 0 stage the stage represents the scenario that the initial contact between the topsides and the twin barge takes place the separated two barges are initially being mated with the topsides in which the twin barge starts to pick up the topsides loads the stabbing pins of the topsides are aligned with the receiving cone installed on the twin barge with zero clearances the twin barge interacts with the t shaped barge via the dsu under the wave loads this stage aims to demonstrate the dsu impact phenomenon on dsus and the motion behaviors of the twin barge b 50 stage the stage is the middle phase of the transfer operations 50 of the topside weights are transferred onto the twin barge by ballasting down the t shaped barge the stabbing pins of the topsides were partly inserted into the receptacles c 100 stage the stage demonstrates another critical scenario that the t shaped barge is initially separated from the topsides in this stage the stabbing pins are aligned with the docking cones installed on the t shaped barge deck with about zero gaps the twin barge picks up all topsides loads the t shaped barge moves in waves and interacts with the topsides via the lmus 3 result and discussion 3 1 regular wave test the regular wave tests were conducted to investigate the motion characteristic of the three barges and the topsides figs 6 7 and 8 show the heave and roll motion time series of the four bodies at three different stages in the wave of h 0 5 m t 11 s for the heave motions of the twin barge the barge 225 heave motion was slightly larger than the barge 226 heave motions and were out of phase with the barge 226 heave motion the side by side configuration of the twin barge in beam waves and the associated shielding effect contribute to the amplitude and phase difference it was found that the barge 228 heave motions were largely in phase with the topside heave motion at the three stages the topsides heave motions were always smallest compared with the three barges and the limited topsides heave motions were favorable for mating operations as for the roll motions it can be clearly seen that the four bodies were greatly synchronized at the 50 stage which was caused by the engagement of the mating units the twin barge and the barge 228 were largely unsynchronized in both amplitude and phase at 0 and 100 stages one can observe that the barge 228 roll motions increased about twofold from the 50 stage to the 100 stage it is speculated that the enlargement was due to the separations between the topside and the barge 228 the results indicated that the barge 228 was subjected to violent motions as the separations released the connect constraint with the topsides special attention should be paid to the barge 228 motions at the 100 stage which might lead to large impact loads on mating units for the twin barge the roll motions of the upwind barge 225 were about twice larger than those of the leeward barge 226 at 0 and 100 stages which was caused by the shielding effect fig 9 shows the motion raos of the four bodies at the 0 stage it can be seen that the heave and roll motions of the upwind barge 225 were always largest among the four bodies for the heave motions the peak frequency of the barge 225 was close to the pitch natural frequency of the barge 225 indicating the coupling of the heave and pitch motions it was interesting to find that the leeward barge 226 heave motions did not exhibit the resonant motions it is speculated to be caused by the mechanical connections and the shielding effect for the roll motions the roll rao of the barge 225 shows several peaks the third peak frequency corresponds to the natural roll frequency 0 163 hz of the barge 225 the second peak may be associated to a fluid gap resonance phenomenon of the in between water surface in the tests the twin barge was with a separation gap of 40 m generally when the gap was integral multiple of the half wavelength of the incident wave the in between water experiences near gap resonant motions it should be noted that a lot of factors influenced the gap resonance frequency including the breadth of the barge the draughts of two side by side barges the curvature of the barge bottom and the drift motions of the moored structures molin 2001 lewandowski 2008 wang 2011 gao 2020 it is thus difficult to evaluate the gap resonance frequency accurately roughly the gap resonance frequencies can be roughly calculated as the function of the ratio of the gap distance to the wavelength ω n 2 gk tanh kd n λ n 2 d n 1 2 where d 40 m is the gap distance between the twin barges λn is the wavelength associated with the nth gap resonance mode ω n is the frequency of the nth gap resonance mode g is the gravity acceleration k is the wavenumber based on the equations the first three modes are evaluated 0 136 hz for 1st gap resonance mode 0 198 hz for 2nd gap resonance mode and 0 242 hz for 3rd gap resonance mode from the roll motion results it was observed that the second frequency peaks shown in fig 9 were coincident with the 1st gap resonance mode the first peak was found at the frequency 0 11 hz one possible reason was the natural roll frequency 0 105 hz of the barge 228 figs 10 and 11 show the motion raos of the four bodies at the 50 and 100 stages respectively the heave and roll motions experienced a larger peak close to the natural roll frequency 0 105 hz of the barge 228 as the topsides were largely synchronized with the barge 228 which was illustrated in figs 5 7 the topsides roll motions had a great influence on the heave motions of the barge 225 226 vis the mating units particularly for the 50 stage in which the stabbing pins were inserted into the receptacles 3 2 irregular wave test 3 2 1 motions fig 12 shows the motion time series of the four bodies at the 0 stage in irregular wave hs 0 75 m tp 10 5 s the surge sway and yaw motions were dominated by the low frequency because of the unsymmetrical configurations considerable surge and yaw motions were observed in the beam waves the four bodies were largely synchronized in the yaw direction because of the connections of twin barges the upwind barge 225 sway motions were very slightly different from those of the leeward barge 226 it was found that the surge motions of the barge 225 and the barge 226 were always about 180 phase difference while the topsides and the barge 228 experienced slight surge motions the large antiphase surge amplitude of the barge 225 and the barge 226 was attributed to the synchronized yaw motions because of the shielding effect the larger roll heave and pitch motions of the upwind barge 225 than those of the barge 226 were found the motion behavior displayed the similar trend at the 50 and 100 stage which were not shown in the sections 3 2 2 loads on mating units the contact loads on mating units are of practical interests and are the basis of the design of mating units fig 13 shows the vertical loads histories and the corresponding spectra on the mating units l1 and l4 at the 0 stage the positions of the mating units l1 and l4 were labeled as in fig 3 the l1 was the hemisphere shaped dsu and was located close to the bow of the upwind barge 225 the l4 was the cone shaped lmu and was located close to the bow of the t shaped barge 228 the l1 bears a series of impulse loads suggesting that the stabbing pins were contacted with the receptacles at some instants the l4 loads varied continuously over time from the second column of fig 13 it was found that the loads on mating units were dominated by the wave frequency the low and high order components also displayed and were attributed to the nonlinear impacts fig 14 shows the vertical loads on the mating units l1 and l4 at the 50 stage at the middle stage both the twin barge and the t shaped barge bear about the half of topsides loads the loads only contained the wave frequency component as shown in the load spectra fig 15 shows the vertical loads on the mating units l1 and l4 at the 100 stage similar to the 0 stage the 100 stage induced the low and high order components with close inspection at the time series as shown in the first column of fig 13 the impulse loads generally occurred once per period and contained several higher order components at one impact event the collisions at the dsu at the 0 stage also contributed to the higher components of the lmu loads for investigating the variation of the l1 and l4 vertical loads at the three stages the maximum mean and minimum values were evaluated as illustrated in fig 16 it was as expected that the mean values of the l1 and the l4 associated with the transferred topsides weights increased and decreased respectively from the standard deviations subplot the vertical force slightly increased from 0 stage to 50 stage and slightly decreased from 50 stage to 100 stage the lateral loads on mating units are also important for the design of the twin barge floatover system fig 17 illustrates the lateral loads at various stages fig 18 shows the corresponding statistical results the l1 loads were always larger than the l4 loads similar to the vertical loads the lateral loads on l1 and l4 were subjected to the impulse loads at the 0 and 100 stages respectively it was caused by the occurrence of collisions it is observed that the lateral loads on the lmu l4 experienced nonzero mean values at the 0 stage it was attributed to the mean trim angle of the barge 228 the nonzero mean values were also displayed at the 50 and 100 stages as explained in fig 18 the nonzero mean values exhibited at the non collision scenarios the l1 was subjected to larger impact loads absolute values than the l4 at the three stages for both the maximum values and the mean values at the three stages the l1 experienced larger mean values at the 50 stage and the increasing standard deviations in contrast the hemisphere shaped mating unit l4 suffered large lateral loads at the 50 stage and decreased at the 0 and 100 stages it indicates that the hemisphere shaped mating units is worth paying close attention in the design and are likely to require great strengths 3 2 3 mooring and tether forces fig 19 shows the time series and corresponding spectra of the mooring and tether line loads at the 0 stage because the surge sway yaw motions were dominated by the low frequency drift motions as illustrated in fig 12 the mooring line were dominated by the low frequency force in which the mean drift forces were extracted the upwind mooring line m2 were as expected greater than the leeward m4 fortunately the mooring line forces varied slightly in contrast the tether lines experienced significant snap loads the large snap loads on the tether lines were caused by the relative motions between the twin barge and the t shaped barge the snap loads were generally dominated by the wave frequency different from the impact loads on mating units the snap loads on tether contained little higher order components it can be seen that the ls1 attached to the bow experienced larger loads than the ls3 that are attached to the stern fig 20 and fig 21 show the loads on mooring and tether line at the 50 and 100 stages respectively the mooring lines forces were mostly same as the 0 stage in contrast the tether line loads significantly reduced the maximum tether loads were more than 400 ton the 0 stage while the tether loads were less than 100 ton at the 50 stage the connection between the topsides and the twin barge dramatically decreased the relative motions between the twin barge and the t shaped barge which thus lead to the decrease of the tether loads at the 100 stage although the t shaped barge was separated from the topsides the limited in between gap between the twin barge constraint the motions of the t shaped barge the tether loads at the 100 stage was therefore not enlarged sharply statistical results of the mooring loads are shown in fig 22 the mooring forces were dominated by the mean drift forces from the bars it can be concluded that the mooring line varied slightly with the transferred loads fig 23 shows the statistical results of the tether loads the 0 stage was subjected to the larger mean tether loads with larger variations than the 50 and 100 stages the 50 stage bear the smallest mean tether loads and the smallest standard deviations from fig 23 b the maximum tether loads on the l1 at the 0 stage was about six and five times larger than those at the 0 and 100 stages respectively in engineering practice the large tether loads should be suppressed adding the tether lines between the twin barge or increase the hawser lines between the twin barge and the t shaped barge would be an efficient way to reduce the relative motion and thus alleviate the tether loads 3 2 4 fender forces fig 24 shows the time series of the sway fender loads and corresponding statistical results at the three stages the fender experienced the impulse loads at all three stages from comparisons of the maximum and standard values the 0 stage experienced the largest impact loads among the three stages and the 50 stage experienced the smallest impact loads from the views of the fender forces the 0 stage is much dangerous 3 2 5 summary the loads in the twin barge floatover installation were compared at the three stages the critical stage on the basis of the experimental results were identified as listed in table 3 the results show the different components reached their maximum values and largest deviations at different stages the design of different components should be based on different critical stages we would like to emphasize that the stage that experiences less maximum loads and deviations may be still important although the identified critical stage has been only concerned with the loads for instance the stage that introduced the larger local motions of the mating points would influence the feasibility of the mating operations although the stage may not lead to large loads it is suggested that those local effects at various stage should be also examined prior to the practical twin barge floatover operations 4 conclusions the complex hydrodynamic response of the topsides transfer operations from the t shaped barge onto the twin barge was experimentally investigated at three intermediated stages including 0 50 100 stages one striking feature is that the twin barge was connected by the hemisphere shaped mating units which aimed to reduce the bending on topsides and benefited the assemble and dismiss operations the loads on the mating units at the various stage together with the motions were investigated in detail the outcomes of the physical investigations can be summarized as follows regular wave tests were conduct to analyze the motion38 behavior of the four bodies results indicated that the shielding effect gave rise to the larger heave and roll motions of the upwind barge than those of the leeward barge the motions raos showed different peaks at three different stages at the 0 stages the motions raos of the four bodies reached the peaks at the natural roll frequency at the 100 stage the roll motions of the barge 225 228 exhibited the peaks at their natural resonate frequencies respectively it is speculated from the results that the first order gap resonance mode of the in between fluid of the twin barge might lead to the peak motion responses and the frequency slightly shifted as the increase of the transferred loads which were attributed to the draft variations of three barges random wave tests indicated that because of the unsymmetrical configurations of the three barges the four bodies experienced six degree motions in the beam waves in which the considerable yaw and surge motions were seen the vertical and lateral loads on mating units at three stages were investigated the significant lateral loads on mating units were found the mooring and tether line force results implied that the mooring line force varied insignificantly for three stages the tether lines bear great snap loads at the 0 stage and reduced sharply at 50 and 100 stages the 0 stage was identified as the most dangerous stage for the tether lines especially for the tether lines attached to the bow of the barge the hawsers and more tether lines are suggested to reduce the relative motions and thus mitigate the large snap loads on the tether lines on the basis of load results the critical stages for different components were summarized indicating that different components reached their maximum values and largest deviations in general the present experimental study provides better insights into the dynamic response of three barge in side by side configuration of the twin barge floatover system the results are meaningful to the design of engineering structures such as the mating units and tether lines insights related to multi bodies hydrodynamic and mechanical interactions by our analysis are however still relevant to the configuration of the specific twin barge system effect of gap fluid resonance on three barges particularly for the complex configuration with several different gaps i e the gaps between the twin barge the gaps between the t shaped barge and the twin barge needs to be studied in future research credit authorship contribution statement xiaodong bai methodology investigation formal analysis

20407,the single barge floatover method faces great challenges when it comes to the gigantic topsides and the substructures lack of sufficient slots the twin barge floatover system with large capacities and great flexibilities for various topsides and substructures would be a promising alternative for fixed and floating platforms this study experimentally investigates the dynamic responses of the floatover system in beam waves with the focus on one of the critical load transfer steps namely the topsides transfer operations onto the twin barge from a transportation barge three representative intermediate stages i e 0 50 and 100 stages were experimentally simulated results revealed that the upwind barge experienced larger motions than others attributed to the shielding effect results implied that the in between fluid resonant may have great influences on the motions the twin barge floatover system were subjected to six degree of freedom motions in beam random waves because of the unsymmetrical configurations the impact loads on mating units demonstrated that the lateral loads were quite considerable and they should be paid much attention the mooring force varied slightly and the tether lines bear large snap loads at the 0 stage the critical stage for different components were identified based on comparisons of loads at three stages keywords twin barge floatover beam seas three barges in side by side vertical and lateral loads on mating units tether line loads 1 introduction the floatover method has been widely used in the offshore topsides installation because of the cost and time efficiency generally the floatover method transports the topsides into the slot of the substructures and then transfers the topsides onto the substructures by the tide variation or the active jacking methods such as the hydraulic jacking methods and the stranding lifting methods although the floatover method has been applied oneill et al 2000 tahar et al 2006 wang et al 2010 kim et al 2019 the floatover installation still faces several technical issues for example the limited slot between the transportation barge and the substructures would lead to the frequent collisions and therefore threaten the floatover operations the strict sensitivity of the transfer operation to the weather window also constrains the application of the floatover installation in moderate and high sea state to circumvent the mentioned issues researchers and engineers developed various novel floatover methods to improve the applicability wang et al 2018 bai et al 2020a b geba et al 2017 koo et al 2010 beerendonk et al 2008 he et al 2020 among the methods the two barges floaters installation method gains much attention the twin barge floatover method with the large in between span can adopt various substructures from the structural point of view the twin barge floatover installation can eliminate the requirement of the slot of the substructures and thus be conducive to the platform structural design moreover the twin barge floatover method is a potential approach for the topsides installation of the floating and semi submersible platform the twin barge floatover concept is illustrated in fig 1 firstly the topsides are loaded out on the t shaped transportation barge from the quay when the transportation barge arrives in the vicinity of the substructures two identical installation barges are approaching to the moored transportation barge secondly by ballasting down the transportation barge the topsides are transferred and connected to the twin barge separating the topsides from the transportation barge then the twin barge is moored to the sea bed and the transportation barge is towed away thirdly once the available weather window is achieved the twin barge transfers the topsides onto the substructures by lowering the twin barge finally the separated two installation barges are towed away indicating the accomplishment of the topside floatover installation in the engineering practice the twin barge floatover system can employ two small multipurpose vessels as the installation barges that one of the tasks is the floatover without the special predesign of the installation barges in the twin barge floatover method the twin barge is elastically connected with the topsides by the hemisphere deck support unit dsu that can release the rotation of the installation barges and thus mitigate the bending on the topsides the proposed method employs a novel double duty leg mating unit lmu connecting the transportation barge with the topsides as well as mating the topsides with the jackets at different load transfer steps the kind of lmu reduces the fabricating cost and improves the installation efficiency in the process of the entire twin barge floatover installation the last two load transfer steps b and c as shown in fig 1 are the most critical and dangerous phases the third step c was investigated in our previous paper bai et al 2020b this study focuses on the second step investigating the motion and load characteristics of side by side three barges in topsides transfer operations regarding the dynamic responses of the floatover installation numerous studies have been carried out by field measurements numerical models and experimental tests in past decades as for the field measurement the visual monitor system the stress monitor system and the environment measurement system were applied to obtain the real time weather and mating information wu et al 2014 luo et al 2015 tian et al 2018 great numerical and experimental modeling efforts have been made to investigate the complex behaviors of the floatover installation paulling 1995 and kwak et al 2018 developed the time and frequency domain codes to analyze the steady state motion behavior of the floatover installation sun et al 2012 and chen et al 2014 2017 numerically analyzed the multiple body interaction and addressed the nonlinear impact loads on the mating units hu et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 employed the bifurcation diagram to describe the impact behavior of the barge deck system choi et al 2014 conducted the physical model test to investigate the barge motions and contact loads on mating units as for the twin barge catamaran floatover method koo et al 2010 investigated the dynamic of the topsides transferred from the catamaran onto the spar structures dessi and faiella 2019 carried out the experimental analysis of the seakeeping characteristics of the double barges without the consideration of the topside weights xu et al 2016 investigated the response of the three barges in close proximity from the literature survey provided earlier significant attempts have been made for the floatover operations most previous studies focused on scenario that the topsides were transferred from the floating single twin barges onto the fixed jackets few literatures are related to the multi body hydrodynamic response of the three floatover barges and the topsides considerable research efforts are required for extensions to problems involving the load transfer from the transportation barge onto the twin barge the interactions of the three barges in the side by side configuration and the contact loads on mating units in various load transfer stages are in urgent need of investigations which motivates this study the paper carried out the experimental modeling of the topsides load transfer operation from the transportation barge onto the twin barge in beam regular and random waves one striking feature of this study is to investigate the hydrodynamic response of the three floating barges during various load transfer operations the load transfer operations were represented by three intermediate stages i e 0 50 and 100 stages the motions of the three barges and the topsides were investigated together with the loads on the mating units and mooring lines the paper is constructed as follows in section 2 the experiment set up is detailed section 3 presents the experimental results and investigates the motion and load characteristic of the floatover installations in section 4 conclusions are drawn 2 experiment description 2 1 experimental set up the experimental tests were conducted at tianjin university tianjin china the wave basin was 45 m length 50 m width 1 8 m depth the model scale was 1 40 with the consideration of the water depth of the target area for the catamaran floatover operations the water depth was 0 55 m in the model test corresponding to the 22 m in full scale the beam wave was considered in this study fig 2 shows the snapshot of the floatover installation system in the wave basin the principal dimensions and properties of the three barges and the topside model are listed in table 1 fig 3 illustrates the layout of the floatover installation system the mating units i e dsus and lmus were designed to absorb the impact loads between the topsides and the twin barge during the mating operations the dsus and lmus were respectively installed on the deck of the twin barge and the t shaped barge the mating unit consisted of the shock cell including the stabbing pins and the receptacle the linear spring was utilized to simulate the elasticity of the mating units three different springs with different stiffness were installed under the receptacle of the mating units as listed in table 1 six load cells with the accuracy of 0 05 n were utilized to measure the contacts loads on the mating units the double duty lmu was the cone shape meaning that both the stabbing pins and the receptacles were the shape of cone to assemble and dismiss the twin barge with the topsides easily we designed the hemisphere shaped dsu to simulate the hinge connections the hinged connections of the dsu released the rotation degree suggesting that the barge 225 226 can rotate in the roll directions another advantage of the elastically connected twin barge floatover system over the rigidly connected twin barge system was that the rotatable mating units can mitigate the bending moment on the topsides five mooring lines were employed to positioned the t shaped barge as illustrated in fig 3 the loads on the mooring system were measured using a set of axial load cells located at the fairlead position the accuracy of the axial load cell was 0 05 n the twin barge was connected to the t shaped barge by four tether lines four tension transduces with the accuracy of 0 05 n were fixed in the end of the tethers to measure tether forces the stiffness of the mooring and tether line is listed in table 1 six sway fenders were installed at the port starboard of the t shaped barge and two surge fenders were installed at the middle of the barge to absorb the impact loads between the twin barge and the t shaped barge the stiffness of the fender is listed in table 1 the components including dsu lmu fenders mooring and tether were symmetrical installed the x and y coordinates of the anchors of the five mooring lines were m1 496 3 m 0 m m2 0 m 1026 2 m and m3 78 3 m 2601 5 m the coordinates of the attachment points of the tether lines were 132 3 m 20 1 m and 94 6 m 11 5 m for ls1 0 m 26 2 m and 16 8 m 54 2 m for ls3 respectively the coordinates of the surge fenders on the port side of the barge 228 were 9 m 22 m the coordinates of the sway fenders in the upwind side were 27 5 m 18 m 42 5 m 18 m and 57 5 m 18 m the coordinates of dsus were l1 73 5 m 38 m l2 57 5 m 38 m and l3 41 5 m 38 m respectively the coordinates of lmus were l4 73 5 m 12 m l5 57 5 m 12 m and l6 41 5 m 12 m respectively the gap between the barge 225 and barge 226 was 40 4 m and the gap between the barge 225 and the barge 228 was 2 28 m the distance from the bow of the barge 228 to the stern of the barge 225 was 78 2 m the motions of the three barges and the topsides were measured by the optical motion capture system that was equipped with three high resolution cameras with the sampling rate of 100 hz the accuracy was 0 1 mm for translations and 0 01 for rotations the test cases are listed in table 2 in the experiments the jonswap was employed to simulate the random waves with the parameter γ 3 3 the measured spectrum and the theoretical spectrum were compared as follows good agreements were obtained as shown in fig 4 the time durations of the random wave tests were about 15 min corresponding to 90 min in full scale each of the random wave tests was repeated three times with different seeds the statistical results were calculated from the three repeated tests 2 2 representative load transfer stages this study focuses on the phase that the topsides are transferred from the single transportation barge to the twin barge to depict the motion behavior and load characteristic of the focused load transfer phase three intermediate stages were selected two critical load transfer scenarios i e 0 load transfer stage and 100 load transfer stage that are associated with the impact loads on mating unites and the middle stage i e 50 load transfer stage were simulated fig 5 illustrates the three load transfer stages a 0 stage the stage represents the scenario that the initial contact between the topsides and the twin barge takes place the separated two barges are initially being mated with the topsides in which the twin barge starts to pick up the topsides loads the stabbing pins of the topsides are aligned with the receiving cone installed on the twin barge with zero clearances the twin barge interacts with the t shaped barge via the dsu under the wave loads this stage aims to demonstrate the dsu impact phenomenon on dsus and the motion behaviors of the twin barge b 50 stage the stage is the middle phase of the transfer operations 50 of the topside weights are transferred onto the twin barge by ballasting down the t shaped barge the stabbing pins of the topsides were partly inserted into the receptacles c 100 stage the stage demonstrates another critical scenario that the t shaped barge is initially separated from the topsides in this stage the stabbing pins are aligned with the docking cones installed on the t shaped barge deck with about zero gaps the twin barge picks up all topsides loads the t shaped barge moves in waves and interacts with the topsides via the lmus 3 result and discussion 3 1 regular wave test the regular wave tests were conducted to investigate the motion characteristic of the three barges and the topsides figs 6 7 and 8 show the heave and roll motion time series of the four bodies at three different stages in the wave of h 0 5 m t 11 s for the heave motions of the twin barge the barge 225 heave motion was slightly larger than the barge 226 heave motions and were out of phase with the barge 226 heave motion the side by side configuration of the twin barge in beam waves and the associated shielding effect contribute to the amplitude and phase difference it was found that the barge 228 heave motions were largely in phase with the topside heave motion at the three stages the topsides heave motions were always smallest compared with the three barges and the limited topsides heave motions were favorable for mating operations as for the roll motions it can be clearly seen that the four bodies were greatly synchronized at the 50 stage which was caused by the engagement of the mating units the twin barge and the barge 228 were largely unsynchronized in both amplitude and phase at 0 and 100 stages one can observe that the barge 228 roll motions increased about twofold from the 50 stage to the 100 stage it is speculated that the enlargement was due to the separations between the topside and the barge 228 the results indicated that the barge 228 was subjected to violent motions as the separations released the connect constraint with the topsides special attention should be paid to the barge 228 motions at the 100 stage which might lead to large impact loads on mating units for the twin barge the roll motions of the upwind barge 225 were about twice larger than those of the leeward barge 226 at 0 and 100 stages which was caused by the shielding effect fig 9 shows the motion raos of the four bodies at the 0 stage it can be seen that the heave and roll motions of the upwind barge 225 were always largest among the four bodies for the heave motions the peak frequency of the barge 225 was close to the pitch natural frequency of the barge 225 indicating the coupling of the heave and pitch motions it was interesting to find that the leeward barge 226 heave motions did not exhibit the resonant motions it is speculated to be caused by the mechanical connections and the shielding effect for the roll motions the roll rao of the barge 225 shows several peaks the third peak frequency corresponds to the natural roll frequency 0 163 hz of the barge 225 the second peak may be associated to a fluid gap resonance phenomenon of the in between water surface in the tests the twin barge was with a separation gap of 40 m generally when the gap was integral multiple of the half wavelength of the incident wave the in between water experiences near gap resonant motions it should be noted that a lot of factors influenced the gap resonance frequency including the breadth of the barge the draughts of two side by side barges the curvature of the barge bottom and the drift motions of the moored structures molin 2001 lewandowski 2008 wang 2011 gao 2020 it is thus difficult to evaluate the gap resonance frequency accurately roughly the gap resonance frequencies can be roughly calculated as the function of the ratio of the gap distance to the wavelength ω n 2 gk tanh kd n λ n 2 d n 1 2 where d 40 m is the gap distance between the twin barges λn is the wavelength associated with the nth gap resonance mode ω n is the frequency of the nth gap resonance mode g is the gravity acceleration k is the wavenumber based on the equations the first three modes are evaluated 0 136 hz for 1st gap resonance mode 0 198 hz for 2nd gap resonance mode and 0 242 hz for 3rd gap resonance mode from the roll motion results it was observed that the second frequency peaks shown in fig 9 were coincident with the 1st gap resonance mode the first peak was found at the frequency 0 11 hz one possible reason was the natural roll frequency 0 105 hz of the barge 228 figs 10 and 11 show the motion raos of the four bodies at the 50 and 100 stages respectively the heave and roll motions experienced a larger peak close to the natural roll frequency 0 105 hz of the barge 228 as the topsides were largely synchronized with the barge 228 which was illustrated in figs 5 7 the topsides roll motions had a great influence on the heave motions of the barge 225 226 vis the mating units particularly for the 50 stage in which the stabbing pins were inserted into the receptacles 3 2 irregular wave test 3 2 1 motions fig 12 shows the motion time series of the four bodies at the 0 stage in irregular wave hs 0 75 m tp 10 5 s the surge sway and yaw motions were dominated by the low frequency because of the unsymmetrical configurations considerable surge and yaw motions were observed in the beam waves the four bodies were largely synchronized in the yaw direction because of the connections of twin barges the upwind barge 225 sway motions were very slightly different from those of the leeward barge 226 it was found that the surge motions of the barge 225 and the barge 226 were always about 180 phase difference while the topsides and the barge 228 experienced slight surge motions the large antiphase surge amplitude of the barge 225 and the barge 226 was attributed to the synchronized yaw motions because of the shielding effect the larger roll heave and pitch motions of the upwind barge 225 than those of the barge 226 were found the motion behavior displayed the similar trend at the 50 and 100 stage which were not shown in the sections 3 2 2 loads on mating units the contact loads on mating units are of practical interests and are the basis of the design of mating units fig 13 shows the vertical loads histories and the corresponding spectra on the mating units l1 and l4 at the 0 stage the positions of the mating units l1 and l4 were labeled as in fig 3 the l1 was the hemisphere shaped dsu and was located close to the bow of the upwind barge 225 the l4 was the cone shaped lmu and was located close to the bow of the t shaped barge 228 the l1 bears a series of impulse loads suggesting that the stabbing pins were contacted with the receptacles at some instants the l4 loads varied continuously over time from the second column of fig 13 it was found that the loads on mating units were dominated by the wave frequency the low and high order components also displayed and were attributed to the nonlinear impacts fig 14 shows the vertical loads on the mating units l1 and l4 at the 50 stage at the middle stage both the twin barge and the t shaped barge bear about the half of topsides loads the loads only contained the wave frequency component as shown in the load spectra fig 15 shows the vertical loads on the mating units l1 and l4 at the 100 stage similar to the 0 stage the 100 stage induced the low and high order components with close inspection at the time series as shown in the first column of fig 13 the impulse loads generally occurred once per period and contained several higher order components at one impact event the collisions at the dsu at the 0 stage also contributed to the higher components of the lmu loads for investigating the variation of the l1 and l4 vertical loads at the three stages the maximum mean and minimum values were evaluated as illustrated in fig 16 it was as expected that the mean values of the l1 and the l4 associated with the transferred topsides weights increased and decreased respectively from the standard deviations subplot the vertical force slightly increased from 0 stage to 50 stage and slightly decreased from 50 stage to 100 stage the lateral loads on mating units are also important for the design of the twin barge floatover system fig 17 illustrates the lateral loads at various stages fig 18 shows the corresponding statistical results the l1 loads were always larger than the l4 loads similar to the vertical loads the lateral loads on l1 and l4 were subjected to the impulse loads at the 0 and 100 stages respectively it was caused by the occurrence of collisions it is observed that the lateral loads on the lmu l4 experienced nonzero mean values at the 0 stage it was attributed to the mean trim angle of the barge 228 the nonzero mean values were also displayed at the 50 and 100 stages as explained in fig 18 the nonzero mean values exhibited at the non collision scenarios the l1 was subjected to larger impact loads absolute values than the l4 at the three stages for both the maximum values and the mean values at the three stages the l1 experienced larger mean values at the 50 stage and the increasing standard deviations in contrast the hemisphere shaped mating unit l4 suffered large lateral loads at the 50 stage and decreased at the 0 and 100 stages it indicates that the hemisphere shaped mating units is worth paying close attention in the design and are likely to require great strengths 3 2 3 mooring and tether forces fig 19 shows the time series and corresponding spectra of the mooring and tether line loads at the 0 stage because the surge sway yaw motions were dominated by the low frequency drift motions as illustrated in fig 12 the mooring line were dominated by the low frequency force in which the mean drift forces were extracted the upwind mooring line m2 were as expected greater than the leeward m4 fortunately the mooring line forces varied slightly in contrast the tether lines experienced significant snap loads the large snap loads on the tether lines were caused by the relative motions between the twin barge and the t shaped barge the snap loads were generally dominated by the wave frequency different from the impact loads on mating units the snap loads on tether contained little higher order components it can be seen that the ls1 attached to the bow experienced larger loads than the ls3 that are attached to the stern fig 20 and fig 21 show the loads on mooring and tether line at the 50 and 100 stages respectively the mooring lines forces were mostly same as the 0 stage in contrast the tether line loads significantly reduced the maximum tether loads were more than 400 ton the 0 stage while the tether loads were less than 100 ton at the 50 stage the connection between the topsides and the twin barge dramatically decreased the relative motions between the twin barge and the t shaped barge which thus lead to the decrease of the tether loads at the 100 stage although the t shaped barge was separated from the topsides the limited in between gap between the twin barge constraint the motions of the t shaped barge the tether loads at the 100 stage was therefore not enlarged sharply statistical results of the mooring loads are shown in fig 22 the mooring forces were dominated by the mean drift forces from the bars it can be concluded that the mooring line varied slightly with the transferred loads fig 23 shows the statistical results of the tether loads the 0 stage was subjected to the larger mean tether loads with larger variations than the 50 and 100 stages the 50 stage bear the smallest mean tether loads and the smallest standard deviations from fig 23 b the maximum tether loads on the l1 at the 0 stage was about six and five times larger than those at the 0 and 100 stages respectively in engineering practice the large tether loads should be suppressed adding the tether lines between the twin barge or increase the hawser lines between the twin barge and the t shaped barge would be an efficient way to reduce the relative motion and thus alleviate the tether loads 3 2 4 fender forces fig 24 shows the time series of the sway fender loads and corresponding statistical results at the three stages the fender experienced the impulse loads at all three stages from comparisons of the maximum and standard values the 0 stage experienced the largest impact loads among the three stages and the 50 stage experienced the smallest impact loads from the views of the fender forces the 0 stage is much dangerous 3 2 5 summary the loads in the twin barge floatover installation were compared at the three stages the critical stage on the basis of the experimental results were identified as listed in table 3 the results show the different components reached their maximum values and largest deviations at different stages the design of different components should be based on different critical stages we would like to emphasize that the stage that experiences less maximum loads and deviations may be still important although the identified critical stage has been only concerned with the loads for instance the stage that introduced the larger local motions of the mating points would influence the feasibility of the mating operations although the stage may not lead to large loads it is suggested that those local effects at various stage should be also examined prior to the practical twin barge floatover operations 4 conclusions the complex hydrodynamic response of the topsides transfer operations from the t shaped barge onto the twin barge was experimentally investigated at three intermediated stages including 0 50 100 stages one striking feature is that the twin barge was connected by the hemisphere shaped mating units which aimed to reduce the bending on topsides and benefited the assemble and dismiss operations the loads on the mating units at the various stage together with the motions were investigated in detail the outcomes of the physical investigations can be summarized as follows regular wave tests were conduct to analyze the motion38 behavior of the four bodies results indicated that the shielding effect gave rise to the larger heave and roll motions of the upwind barge than those of the leeward barge the motions raos showed different peaks at three different stages at the 0 stages the motions raos of the four bodies reached the peaks at the natural roll frequency at the 100 stage the roll motions of the barge 225 228 exhibited the peaks at their natural resonate frequencies respectively it is speculated from the results that the first order gap resonance mode of the in between fluid of the twin barge might lead to the peak motion responses and the frequency slightly shifted as the increase of the transferred loads which were attributed to the draft variations of three barges random wave tests indicated that because of the unsymmetrical configurations of the three barges the four bodies experienced six degree motions in the beam waves in which the considerable yaw and surge motions were seen the vertical and lateral loads on mating units at three stages were investigated the significant lateral loads on mating units were found the mooring and tether line force results implied that the mooring line force varied insignificantly for three stages the tether lines bear great snap loads at the 0 stage and reduced sharply at 50 and 100 stages the 0 stage was identified as the most dangerous stage for the tether lines especially for the tether lines attached to the bow of the barge the hawsers and more tether lines are suggested to reduce the relative motions and thus mitigate the large snap loads on the tether lines on the basis of load results the critical stages for different components were summarized indicating that different components reached their maximum values and largest deviations in general the present experimental study provides better insights into the dynamic response of three barge in side by side configuration of the twin barge floatover system the results are meaningful to the design of engineering structures such as the mating units and tether lines insights related to multi bodies hydrodynamic and mechanical interactions by our analysis are however still relevant to the configuration of the specific twin barge system effect of gap fluid resonance on three barges particularly for the complex configuration with several different gaps i e the gaps between the

20408,the forces and moments on a uuv hull undergoing unsteady sway motions are analyzed using both traditional methods which integrate the pressure and shear stress at the wall and hydrodynamic impulse based methods which analyze the vortical structure of the flow around the body computational fluid dynamics simulations have been conducted of a body with a slenderness ratio of 8 5 at a reynolds number of 3 4 million undergoing a variety of sway maneuvers these include steady translations at incidence angles from 0 to 20 impulsive acceleration with varied initial incidence and sinusoidally oscillating sway over a range of frequencies and amplitudes the impulse based method is based on a body fixed non inertial frame used to analyze the vortical structures near the body it is demonstrated that this impulse based analysis provides a sensible decomposition of unsteady forces into those due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation and motion history motion history effects are seen to be primarily described by the lamb vector distribution around the body these effects decay towards the quasi steady limit at large times for impulsive motion and at low frequencies for sinusoidal motion this is demonstrated with the analysis of the impulse based force components and with visualizations of the vortex structures in the flow field a simplified form of the impulse based equations is derived and validated based on approximations from slender body theory keywords cfd hydrodynamic impulse flow history slender body nomenclature impulse analysis domain σ

velocity 1 introduction slender axisymmetric bodies are common throughout the marine and aerospace industries with examples ranging from aircraft fuselages to space launch vehicles to underwater vehicles and many more the design of these vehicles depends critically on understanding the fluid flow around them both in terms of the loading due to fluid forces and also in terms of the fluid structures in the vehicles vicinity this is especially true for unsteady flows where the transient development of the wake vorticity field is an unavoidable element of the physical description of the fluid forces as part of a long term effort to improve force estimation models for submarine maneuvering past works have focused on the flow over slender axisymmetric bodies in steady translation jeans et al 2009 and steady turning holloway and jeans 2020 zhang et al 2013 these bodies have been chosen to be representative of unappended submarine hulls and common unmanned underwater vehicle uuv geometries the flow around these bodies has been simulated with computational fluid dynamics cfd methods and the flow analyzed using a mid field formulation of the forces and moments based on the concept of hydrodynamic impulse the goal of the present work is to extend this methodology to include the effect of transient flow during submarine and uuv maneuvering the hydrodynamic forces during submarine maneuvering are traditionally evaluated by methods which integrate the pressure and shear stress fields on the bodies surface while familiar this description does not easily lend itself to the development of model expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments the role of added mass and unsteady circulation is unclear in this force formulation and the nonlinear coupling of the pressure and velocity fields renders model development challenging in contrast the use of a hydrodynamic impulse based analysis and concepts from vorticity dynamics to describe the fluid forces in terms of the surrounding vorticity field does not suffer from these shortcomings as discussed by lighthill 1986 the separation of unsteady circulation and added mass can be made clear in an impulse based force description the impulse based expressions are linear in the vorticity and velocity fields resulting in simplifications for model development doyle 2020 doyle et al 2019a holloway and jeans 2020 jeans et al 2009 finally the vortex description allows the use of geometric reasoning by basing the force description on the vortical structures which can be visualized in the flow field for these reasons an impulse based description of the hydrodynamic forces and moments provides a powerful tool for analyzing the role of unsteady flow effects in submarine and uuv maneuvering impulse based methods of calculating the force on a body have a long history and have been applied to a variety of flow problems the relationship between the time rate of change of the impulse and the force on a solid body was demonstrated by lamb 1895 for a solid body moving in an infinite field of ideal fluid this result was extended in saffman 1992 to inviscid flows containing vorticity and is extended further to viscous flows in finite domains in wu et al 2006 and noca et al 1999 which form the basis for the present work past applications of impulse methods to slender axisymmetric bodies holloway and jeans 2020 jeans et al 2009 have focused only on steady flows unsteady flows have been studied in two dimensions for both flat plates graham et al 2017 ostieri et al 2018 and cylinders kang et al 2018 liu et al 2014 noca 1997 noca et al 1997 1999 while three dimensional studies of unsteady flow have typically focused on flapping plates devoria et al 2014 li and lu 2012 and oscillating vertical cylinders wu et al 2007 holloway and jeans 2020 demonstrate the use of an impulse based analysis for steady viscous flow in finite rotating domains using variables expressed in a non inertial body fixed frame the present work will build on that presented in holloway and jeans 2020 by extending the impulse based analysis method to unsteady viscous flows in a finite accelerating domain again using body frame variables the goal of this paper is to analyze the force and moment on a slender axisymmetric body based on a uuv hull using both traditional and impulse based methods particular attention will be paid to quantifying the role of unsteadiness in the flow and the development of the component parts of the impulse based force description from the quasi steady limit to increasingly unsteady flows due to their prominent role in submarine maneuvering and control problems particular attention is paid to the lateral force and yawing moment this will be accomplished by first performing an analysis of steady translation in order to establish the quasi steady limit as a baseline for discussion this will be followed by the analysis of impulsive sway accelerations in order to identify relevant time scales for an impulse based description and to enhance our understanding of the physical origins of the different vortical components a variety of sinusoidally oscillating sway motions will then be analyzed in order to investigate the variation of these components with the kinematics of sway maneuvers the motions studied here have been chosen to be evocative of the classical analyses by wagner katz and plotkin 2001 wagner 1925 and theodorsen 1935 for thin airfoils in an effort to frame the discussion within the broader context of unsteady aerodynamics and hydrodynamics this analysis will conclude with the presentation of simplifications to the impulse equations derived using slender body theory which are suitable for practical calculations of the unsteady forces experienced by submarine hulls and uuvs during realistic maneuvers doyle 2020 doyle et al 2019a 2 impulse formulation of hydrodynamic forces the flow solution is developed in the non inertial body frame of reference and this is chosen as the frame of reference for the impulse formulation as well in the body frame the x axis is aligned with the longitudinal axis and positive towards the nose the lateral y axis points to the right when facing positive x and the normal or z axis forms a right handed coordinate system by pointing down the origin is placed at the center of buoyancy of the body this orientation corresponds to the standard axis for submarine dynamics problems a schematic diagram of the analysis and cfd domains is shown in fig 1 in order to ensure accuracy and economy the impulse analysis is restricted to a sub domain of the computational mesh which is close to the body and highly refined this sub domain is rectangular with boundaries placed at the bodies nose and tail in the axial direction four diameters away in the lateral direction and two diameters away in the normal direction the fluid containing volume will be denoted f the volume of the solid body b and the total volume of the analysis domain will then be f b the solid volume b is bounded by the surface b and the total volume is bounded by the surface σ so that the fluid volume f is bounded by s σ b with the analysis domain so defined significant vorticity only intersects with the rear surface of σ where it meets the tail wake plane denoted by w the impulse formulation used in this work will largely follow that presented by wu et al 2006 for the advection form with some simplifications based on the restricted maneuver kinematics and past experience with slender axisymmetric bodies from jeans et al 2009 and holloway and jeans 2020 with the analysis domain so defined the hydrodynamic impulse is defined as 2 1 i g p where g is the first moment of the vorticity field 2 2 g 1 2 r ω d and p is the momentum of the fluid displaced by the solid body 2 3 p b u d the vector r is the position vector in the inertial frame ω is the vorticity and u is the velocity of the solid body for an inertial domain of infinite extent which encompasses all regions of non zero vorticity the equation for the hydrodynamic force on the body would then be saffman 1992 2 4 f ρ d i d t similarly the hydrodynamic angular impulse is defined as 2 5 j h q where h is the second moment of the vorticity 2 6 h 1 2 r 2 ω d and q is the angular momentum of the fluid displaced by the body 2 7 q b r 2 u d finally for an inertial domain of infinite extent encompassing all vorticity the equation for the fluid dynamic moment on the body is then saffman 1992 2 8 m ρ d j d t the analysis domain defined above for the present problem will necessarily not contain all of the vorticity in the fluid domain both due to the truncation of the domain and also due to flow through the outlet boundary of the cfd domain for this reason additional terms are introduced to eqs 2 4 and 2 8 which account for the flux of vorticity across the boundary the resulting equations for the impulse based force and moment in a finite inertial domain can be given as 2 9 f ρ d i 0 d t ρ l 0 d ρ 1 2 σ n ˆ u 0 x 0 ω 0 x 0 n ˆ l 0 d s ρ b n ˆ 1 2 u 0 2 i u 0 u 0 d s f v and 2 10 m ρ d j 0 d t ρ x 0 l 0 d ρ 1 2 σ n ˆ u 0 x 0 2 ω 0 x 0 2 n ˆ l 0 d s ρ b n ˆ 1 2 u 0 2 i u 0 u 0 d s m v where l 0 ω 0 u 0 is the lamb vector and the subscript 0 is used here to denote an inertial quantity these expressions are consistent with those reported by noca 1997 although note that the domain motion at velocity u 0 has been included following previous experience with slender axisymmetric bodies in steady translation and steady rotation the viscous terms f v and m v are taken to be negligible holloway and jeans 2020 eqs 2 9 and 2 10 are derived by noca 1997 with the assumption of an inertial frame in order to apply them to the present problem they must be transformed to the non inertial body frame for the purposes of the present work the frame motion is restricted to including only linear acceleration and the effect of rotation is not included in the present analysis the impulse equations for the force and moment in the non inertial body frame are then written as 2 11 f ρ d i d t ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s 2 12 m ρ d j d t ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s full details on the frame transformation are available in doyle 2020 these equations then are consistent with the advection form described by wu et al 2006 and will form the basis of the present work the discussion which follows will focus on the evaluation of eqs 2 11 and 2 12 for the maneuvering of slender axisymmetric bodies in various modes of unsteady sway motion from quasi steady translation to impulsively started sway motion and finally to sinusoidal sway for the sake of brevity the full terms will not be written out but instead named as follows terms involving the fluid momentum displaced by the body i e p and q terms will be referred to as fluid body terms the terms involving g and h are named vorticity moment terms while i and j are named impulse terms finally those terms involving the volume integral of l are lamb terms while those involving the surface integral of l are wake terms 3 methodology 3 1 model geometry and computational domain the model geometry used in the present study is a slender axisymmetric body developed as a test bed for unmanned underwater vehicle uuv and submarine technologies at the national research council nrc lab in st john s newfoundland canada and referred to as phoenix azarsina et al 2008 the body is composed of three sections a half ellipsoidal nose constant diameter mid body and a parabolic tail section the profile of the phoenix geometry is given in fig 2 the overall geometry has a length of ℓ 1 724 m and a slenderness ratio of ℓ d 8 5 the center of buoyancy is located at λ ℓ 0 456 where λ is distance measured from the nose unless otherwise specified all moments are taken about the center of buoyancy the computational domain is rectangular the model is placed approximately two body lengths from the front or inlet face ten body lengths ahead of the rear or outlet face thirty diameters to the side walls 4 37 diameters from the bottom and 5 37 diameters from the top the computational mesh is block structured using hexahedral elements a schematic of the computational domain including longitudinal and lateral mesh sections near the body is shown in fig 3 the boundaries labeled in this figure correspond to slip walls on the top and bottom surfaces label 1 far field boundaries on the front and sides labeled 2 and 3 respectively and outflow on the rear surface label 4 the far field boundary consists of a time adjusting boundary which can switch between inlet and outlet as dictated by the maneuver kinematics no slip walls are applied on the hull surface and a low reynolds number wall treatment is used in the turbulence model i e a wall function is not applied the first cell height off of the wall for all cases averaged y 0 2 meshes were generated at three different refinement levels for the purposes of a mesh sensitivity study in the medium resolution case the total domain consists of 23 million computational cells the body surface is resolved at an average of d a b 0 13 cm 2 and the solution is advanced with a constant global time step of d t 0 0005 s prior comparisons with experimental testing doyle et al 2019b has demonstrated that this resolution gives a satisfactory balance of accuracy and run time and is the default resolution for all results unless otherwise specified details on all three resolutions are given in table 1 in the analysis of the model results use has been made of inviscid added mass coefficients for the phoenix geometry these coefficients have been generated using the open source panel code aircraft 3d panel method or apame filkovic 2018 the use of apame for generating the added mass coefficients of slender geometries has been previously validated by marshall 2017 and it s use to decompose the unsteady forces from cfd results has been demonstrated by doyle et al 2019b due to the focus on maneuvers in sway only the x u and y v coefficients are utilized here a panel density of thirty thousand panels was found to give a sufficiently converged result for these coefficients which have values of x u 6 91 e 4 and y v 1 67 e 2 when non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ ℓ 3 3 2 maneuver kinematics three types of sway maneuvers are presented in this work a sway maneuver in this context means any maneuver having a sway velocity v with zero rotation these maneuvers were selected in order to help elucidate the effect of unsteady flow on the forces and moments and will primarily be described with that goal in mind the baseline of comparison for any sway maneuver will be a steady translation at a constant angle of drift β where the drift angle is defined as 3 1 β tan 1 v u in keeping with conventions for underwater vehicles the vehicles nominal velocity is kept constant at u 0 2 m s so that all cases will have the same nominal reynolds number and dynamic pressure in the free stream steady translations were simulated at drift angles of 0 4 8 12 16 and 20 degrees previous research studies allen and perkins 1951 indicate that at angles of approximately 20 and below the wake vortices will be symmetrical and stable while at higher angles asymmetry and unsteady vortex shedding begin to occur as unsteady flow conditions during kinematically steady motions would potentially confound the goals of the present work drift angles are restricted to the range of 20 and below to ensure that a stable quasi steady equivalent flow can be defined for any unsteady flow condition the unsteadiness of a motion is parameterized by the reduced frequency k which is the ratio of the flow time scale to the unsteady time scale the exact definition of k will vary based on maneuver type the simplest unsteady sway maneuver is an impulsively started sway motion a simulation of an ideal impulse with satisfactory convergence of the flow field was not found to be practical and so the impulsive acceleration has here been approximated with a gaussian function of the form 3 2 v δ v 2 π t 1 2 exp t t 0 2 2 t 1 2 the constants t 0 and t 1 are here the peak acceleration time and pulse width respectively and are kept constant at t 0 3 0 s and t 1 100 d t 0 05 s the velocity change δ v is calculated to produce a 1 change in the angle of drift given an initial velocity or drift angle an annotated plot of eq 3 2 is shown in fig 4 five such impulsive maneuvers were simulated with initial incidences ranging from 0 to 20 these maneuvers are initialized from a steady translation result for the initial angle of drift and are run for a total of 6 s this duration was found for all cases to be sufficient to achieve a steady mean in the final second with variation of less than 1 which is taken to be sufficiently steady for the present work the steady force and moment on the body are known to be nonlinear with respect to drift angle jeans et al 2009 and so it was believed that the impulsive response would vary with differences in the initial drift as with the steady translation angles above 20 were not simulated due to concerns related to unsteady flow in the quasi steady configuration the reduced frequency for impulsive cases is defined as 3 3 k ℓ u t t and is equivalent to a non dimensional time the final sway maneuver investigated is oscillatory sway during oscillatory sway the vehicle will maintain a constant axial velocity with a sinusoidally oscillating sway velocity v t the simulation is initialized at the maximum velocity condition with zero acceleration a relaxation time is used during initialization in which the initial condition is maintained for 0 2 s in order to minimize the effect of the start up transient unsteady motion then begins at t 0 s with the sway velocity defined as 3 4 v t v 0 cos 2 π f t where f is the frequency of oscillation with this definition the angle of incidence will also vary in phase with the velocity while the sway acceleration will be 90 out of phase the reduced frequency for oscillatory motion is defined as the ratio of the flow over time to the period of oscillation t so that 3 5 k ℓ 2 u t the factor of 2 here is in keeping with the standards of the aeroelasticity community which typically takes the characteristic length to be the half chord of an airfoil seven cases of oscillatory sway have been examined for this work representing variations of the two parameters in eq 3 4 these are given in table 2 as with the steady translation cases angles higher than 20 are not investigated due to concerns about unsteadiness in the quasi steady wake the reduced frequency range used here was determined based on kinematic data for submarine maneuvering doyle 2020 which gave ranges of 0 11 k 0 16 for horizontal plane motions and 0 19 k 0 30 for vertical plane motions the low case of k 0 03 was chosen to illustrate the case of a nearly quasi steady oscillatory motion two complete cycles are simulated in all oscillatory cases 3 3 numerical method the simulations are conducted using the cfd code exn aero produced by envenio inc exn aero is a finite volume based cfd code which has been designed to make efficient use of hybrid multicore manycore architectures gerber et al 2013 it solves the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations written here in tensor form as 3 6 u i x i 0 and 3 7 ρ u i t ρ x j u j u i p x i x j μ μ t u i x j s i where the overbar represents a reynolds averaged quantity u i is the flow velocity p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity μ t is the turbulent viscosity and s i are volumetric source terms for simulations of unsteady motion the equations are solved in the body frame and the s i vector represents the inertial forces turbulent closure is provided by the 2006 wilcox k ω turbulence model wilcox 2006 3 8 ρ k t

σ d are model constants exn aero sets the model constant σ d in eq 3 9 to zero which disables the cross diffusion term all other model coefficients are as presented in wilcox 2006 exn aero solves eqs 3 6 through 3 9 iteratively using the simple c algorithm and an algebraic multigrid linear equation solver the equations are discretized with a second order backward euler method in time van leer differencing for the advection terms van leer 1975 and central differencing for diffusion terms within a time step the target mass flow convergence was 0 005 with an rms residual target of 1 0e 4 from the equation solver normalized by the cell flux coefficient achieved convergence varied by maneuver and is reported in the respective results section below 4 steady translation steady translations are the quasi steady equivalent of unsteady sway motions and thus serve as a base line with which to compare and contrast the unsteady flows for this reason a brief overview of the results for the flow around a slender body in steady translation is presented in steady translation the vorticity moment and fluid body terms are constant and the impulse equations reduce to wu et al 2006 4 1 f ρ v l d v ρ 2 w x n ˆ l d a for the force and 4 2 m ρ v x l d v ρ 2 w x 2 n ˆ l d a for the moment six steady translations with drift angles ranging from 0 to 20 were simulated steady simulations were run with d t 0 001 s for 5 s total starting from a uniform flow field for all cases this run time was sufficient for the force and moment data to achieve a steady mean value with a standard deviation of less than 1 for the final second steady translation cases achieved an average mass error of 0 007 1 7e 5 for the momentum residuals 1 5e 3 for the pressure residual and 1 1e 4 for the turbulent residuals these were taken to be suitably converged results grid sensitivity analysis was performed for the β 1 6 case using the procedure of celik et al 2008 the grid convergence indices gci were found to be 6 8 for the lateral force and 1 7 for the yawing moment with an apparent order of convergence of 1 2 and 4 1 respectively figs 5 and 6 plot a comparison of the lateral force and yawing moment estimated from these expressions with those calculated using integrations of the pressure and shear fields at the wall the agreement between the two methods is seen to be good with disagreement in all cases less than 4 at all angles of drift the wake terms in eqs 4 1 and 4 2 are found to be small in comparison to the volume integral in keeping with the results of holloway and jeans 2020 the force is then determined primarily through the volume integral of the lamb vector which in steady translation can be interpreted as representing the bound vorticity or the combined vorticity of the attached boundary layer and the cross flow vortex system saffman 1992 wu et al 2006 yang et al 2007 the sensitivity of the impulse based lateral force and yawing moment predictions to mesh refinement was studied for the case of steady translation at β 1 6 the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 the agreement between the two methods is generally good with a total variation of no more than 2 between the medium and fine mesh the grid convergence of the impulse method is however seen to be much more sensitive to mesh refinement than the pressure and shear based method with the impulse predictions appearing to diverge from the pressure and shear predictions for the lateral force while the yawing moment results do not display monotonic behavior these results suggest then that impulse based methods may require a higher degree of mesh refinement to achieve satisfactory grid convergence when compared to pressure and shear based methods regardless the agreement between the two methods is good and the medium resolution results are taken to be satisfactory for the present analysis in steady translation the flow topology is characterized by a pair of counter rotating vortices in the lee of the body these vortices grow in strength and size as the angle of drift increases and are fed by sheets of separated vorticity from the boundary layer which attach to the body via open topology separation lines visualizations of the lateral lamb vector distribution in the analysis domain are given in fig 9 fig 10 plots the resulting lateral force distributions on the body using both pressure and shear based methods and the impulse based method normalized by sin 2 β so that the results collapse towards a single curve also plotted is the potential flow prediction for the normalized lateral force at all angles so as to illustrate the effect of viscosity on the local forces the initial force peak on the nose is the result of the forward stagnation point on the body creating a high local pressure force which is increasingly in the lateral direction with increasing angle of drift this results in significant vorticity flux off of the body surface at the nose forming vortex rings which flow over the nose with a local vortex force in the lateral direction proportional to angle of drift i e a high lateral lamb vector this flow feature is not easily visualized in fig 9 as it is confined to the boundary layer which is quite thin on the nose notably regardless of whether a vorticity or pressure and shear stress description is used the force in this region follows the potential flow result indicating negligible viscous effects near the nose of the body on the mid body separation and the formation of cross flow vortices are clearly visible in fig 9 at angles of 8 and above this causes the pressure on the leeward surface to not fully recover in comparison with the windward surface again resulting in an increasingly positive local pressure force equivalently the separation sheet and cross flow vortices result in an increasingly positive net lateral lamb vector as drift angle increases this increasingly positive force on the mid body can be clearly observed in fig 10 as the cfd results increasingly diverge from the potential flow result as β increases at the tail the boundary layer separation suppresses the formation of the rear stagnation point which would be seen in an inviscid flow and which would serve to provide a downward force to cancel the forward stagnation point while negative forces are generated at the tail these are significantly weaker than would be predicted by potential flow theory as seen in fig 10 the equivalent vortex description here is that the presence of the separation and cross flow vortices generate positive vortex forces on the tail which partially cancel the negative forces generated by the rear stagnation point the result is a negative lamb vector and associated vortex force but which is weaker than the potential flow prediction these three features and their corresponding vortical descriptions then form the dominant mechanisms which generate the hydrodynamic force and moment on the body in steady translation taken together they represent important baseline features for the analysis of unsteady motion 5 impulsive sway all subsequent motions studied are unsteady and will utilize the full impulse equations as expressed in the non inertial frame these equations are repeated here for convenience as 5 1 f ρ d i d t ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s and 5 2 m ρ d j d t ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s in contrast to their steady equivalent unsteady motion is seen to directly involve the time rate of change of the impulse term as well as potential modifications of the lamb and wake terms from their steady equivalents the primary goal of this and the subsequent section will be to determine how these terms are modified from their quasi steady equivalents as a function of the vehicles acceleration and motion history five impulsive accelerations were simulated consisting of a unit change in the angle of drift with initial drift angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 the simulations were run with a time step of d t 0 0005 s for a total of 6 s with the peak acceleration at t 0 3 s the simulations were initialized from a steady simulation of the initial condition to ensure no transient due to initialization the simulations achieved an average mass error of 2 0e 7 an average momentum residual of 1 4e 6 an average pressure residual of 1 6e 4 and an average residual of 1 1e 5 for the turbulent variables traditional hull forces are output every time step while the data for the impulse based methods must be synthesized from the flow field which is sampled throughout the simulation the flow field is sampled at 100 d t before the acceleration 10 d t during the acceleration 50 d t during the transient up to t 1 7 and 100 d t for the remainder of the maneuver the simulated lateral force and yawing moment during the impulsive maneuver are plotted in figs 11 and 12 using both traditional methods based on the hull pressure and shear and the impulse based method given by eqs 2 11 and 2 12 time is here non dimensionalized by the convective timescale to highlight the motion history response so that t t u ℓ the agreement between the two methods is good in all cases being within the accuracy range of the steady translation cases echoing the classical analysis of wagner for flat plates katz and plotkin 2001 wagner 1925 two distinct features are seen in the lateral force response a high impulsive peak force occurs during the acceleration which corresponds to the inertia of the surrounding fluid this is followed by a slower build up of the force to the steady value at the new drift angle which is due to the establishment of the wake as the transient vorticity generated by the impulsive motion is washed along the body a similar response is seen for the yawing moment with a rapid initial overshoot followed by a slow decay the impulsive response is then characterized by two time scales an impulsive scale which corresponds to the duration of the acceleration and a circulatory timescale which corresponds to the motion history effects in order to better understand the unsteady behavior of the different components of the impulse equations these components are plotted individually in fig 13 for the lateral force during the β i 1 0 maneuver it is clear that using the present analysis method the inertial force is entirely contained in the impulse term while the effect of unsteady circulation is contained primarily in the lamb vector term with minor contributions from the wake and impulse terms this is an important decomposition of the different unsteady effects during motion and can be accomplished without the use of external information such as added mass coefficients the impulse term is compared directly to predictions for the lateral inviscid added mass force in fig 14 and is seen to have excellent agreement with the potential flow result the impulse term contains both the rate of change of fluid body momentum which responds exactly on the acceleration timescale and the rate of change of the vorticity moment the vorticity moment is strongly dominated by near wall vorticity which responds on the kinematic or acceleration timescale due to the no slip boundary condition on the wall the impulse term is then best associated with the creation of vorticity sheets on the body surface as a result of acceleration although the vorticity moment term does contain a small additional transient which persists after the acceleration these thin vortex sheets are well predicted by potential flow theory and this result demonstrates not only the efficacy of impulse based methods for decomposing unsteady forces but also that potential flow methods remain a good predictor for the added mass forces during impulsive sway these results were consistent across every impulsive maneuver simulated the lateral force impulse term then has a time scale associated with the acceleration due to it s association with the fluid inertia and can be taken as the expression of the added mass forces in the impulse equations in comparison fig 15 plots the lateral lamb vector term and the wake term for the same impulsive maneuver along with an unsteady residual which is the result of subtracting the inviscid added mass prediction from the total force as predicted by the pressure and shear based method it is clear that these terms require a time scale much longer than the acceleration in order to adjust to the new kinematics on the order of the convective timescale as with the steady translations the majority of the force in this comparison is due to the lamb vector term with additional small contributions from the wake term as well as the transient portion of the vorticity moment after the acceleration these forces are here associated with the unsteady circulatory forces which would include both the bound circulation of the body and the transient circulation shed into the wake as a result of the dynamic motion fig 16 plots the components of the yawing moment response for the same maneuver the impulse and wake terms of the yawing moment are here seen to respond only on the convective timescale while the lamb term is seen to have a two timescale response similar to the lateral added mass force for this class of bodies undergoing sway motion potential flow predicts negligible yaw coupling in sway the initial rise of the yawing moment lamb term occurs on a similar timescale to the acceleration however this is not due to added mass but instead can be attributed to an initial tendency towards the inviscid munk moment that relaxes on the convective timescale the munk moment is a quasi steady phenomenon which in potential flow theory is again associated with the presence of thin vortex sheets on the hull surface the strength of these sheets is distributed such that there is no net force on the body in inviscid flow as per d alembert s paradox but there is a net moment which is munk s moment these vortex sheets and their unsteady response will be discussed further below as with the lateral force these results are consistent for all impulsive maneuvers studied figs 17 and 18 plot normalized response functions or indicial functions from all five impulsive maneuvers for lateral force and yawing moment where 5 3 ϕ i t ϕ t ϕ 0 ϕ ϕ 0 in examining the force indicial function it is important to realize that all five maneuvers experienced a similar acceleration and hence similar added mass forces and so it is expected that when normalized by the final quasi steady force the added mass force becomes less significant at higher angles of drift in addition to the total indicial an unsteady residual has also been formed by removing the predictions from the potential flow model so that 5 4 y r e s y y v v and 5 5 n r e s n y v x u u v the residual aims to remove the added mass response from the total response so as to isolate the effect of motion history a comparison of the unsteady residual forces shows that the effect of the initial incidence on the circulatory transient is nonlinear in that the response varies depending on the initial condition the residual indicial functions have a timescale of t 1 for the unsteady circulation effects as initial incidence decreases the initial strength of the residual response is seen to increase with a shallower response later in the maneuver and vice versa as the initial incidence increases in all cases however the force residual response requires a significantly larger timescale than the acceleration this residual response is due entirely to motion history effects the moment indicial function also shows two distinct features the initial steep increase in the moment is a purely kinematic response to the change in angle of drift as per munk s moment rather than an added mass force the moment however then overshoots the quasi steady value and has a settling time in all cases with t 1 munks moment is known to overpredict the actual viscous moment in steady translation and the overshoot would appear to be related to the initial tendency towards the inviscid munk moment in response to the kinematic variation followed by a relaxation to the steady viscous value as circulatory effects decay if munk s moment is removed using the inviscid added mass coefficients a residual yawing moment is obtained which is similar in character to the residual lateral force as shown in fig 18 the moment response is best understood by examination of the transient force distributions force distributions at select times during the β i 1 0 maneuver are shown in fig 19 from this figure at t 0 00 it can be seen that the added mass has the effect of increasing the force distribution along the body in proportion to the local radius resulting in minimal net moment but considerable net force this effect quickly disappears and it can be seen from the remaining curves that by t 0 25 the majority of the body has already achieved the final force distribution with the effect of unsteadiness appearing to be confined to the tail region the force distribution is re plotted in fig 20 without the large positive contribution from the nose it is seen that the effect of transience is to create an initially more negative force on the tail which increases towards a steady value resulting in an initially increased yawing moment on the body which decays towards the steady value while this trend is present for all initial drift angles the portion of the body which is affected by the transient circulation grows with initial drift at low angles only the rear quarter is significantly effected from 0 75 λ l 1 0 at β i 5 this increases towards the nose with 0 4 λ l 1 0 at β i 1 5 this result is in keeping with the increased wake strength and circulation at higher angles of drift while the effect of the transience can be clearly seen in the force signals analyzed in this section visualizations of the flow field during the step maneuver show little variation due to the small overall change in incidence angle and so are not included here in order to test the robustness of these results and further explore the nonlinearity of the response functions three additional impulsive maneuvers were simulated which varied the impulse kinematics in the first a stronger tighter pulse is produced by lowering the timestep to d t 0 00025 s resulting in t 1 100 d t 0 025 s while maintaining the same δ v and hence generating a higher peak acceleration in the second a larger δ v is used such that the impulse will produce a δ β 2 change in drift while maintaining the baseline pulse width of t 1 0 05 s in the last a negative pulse is generated such that the maneuver starts at β i 1 1 and decelerates to β 1 0 which is the reverse of the β i 1 0 maneuver presented above all other setup and convergence details remain the same as the baseline cases all of these cases use a nominal β 1 0 as either the initial or final condition so that the natural comparison among the baseline cases is the β i 1 0 maneuver fig 21 compares the impulse term of the vortex based force equation with the potential flow prediction for the inviscid added mass in these four cases this both illustrates the difference in the acceleration between the four cases and also demonstrates that the impulse term is well predicted by the potential flow result in all cases a comparison of the indicial functions for these cases is shown in fig 22 for the lateral force and 23 for the yawing moment it can be seen that the negative pulse response function is identical to the baseline case while the thin and large pulses have minor variations for both the thin and large pulse the added mass force changes in response to the change in the acceleration as expected however there is negligible change in the circulatory transient the yawing moment response is seen to be essentially unaffected for all cases except the thin pulse which has minor variations in the development of it s munk like response due to the change in the kinematics in all cases the circulatory transient is essentially unaffected by changes in the impulsive acceleration the impulse response of the motion history effect is then concluded to be nonlinear in that it varies in response to changes in the initial incidence and hence the convective flow however it can be treated as locally linear for small variations about a given initial incidence 6 oscillating sway a series of seven simulations of the geometry undergoing oscillating dynamic sway were conducted with varying amplitude and frequency of sway motion the simulations were initialized from a uniform field however an initial relaxation period with constant kinematics was utilized in order to establish the initial flow field and reduce the effect of the startup transient achieved convergences for these cases averaged 0 4 for the mass error with an average normalized momentum residual of 4 3e 6 pressure residual of 1 2e 3 and turbulent residuals of 4 3e 5 grid sensitivity analysis was conducted on the k 0 12 β 0 1 5 case for the lateral force and yawing moment signal amplitude and phase the results showed good agreement with less then 1 variation across all three meshes however this variation was oscillatory in nature making it difficult to render conclusive statements regarding the grid uncertainty using the procedure of celik et al 2008 the lateral force was found to have gci s of 0 03 and 1 1 for amplitude and phase respectively with apparent orders of convergence of 7 5 and 2 8 respectively the yawing moment was found to have gci s of 0 02 and 0 05 for phase and amplitude with apparent orders of 7 7 and 6 0 the high level of agreement between the three meshes and the convergence statistics are believed to be due to the strong role played by the added mass in the forces and moments which is an essentially inviscid phenomenon and is believed to be less sensitive to the mesh properties in keeping with the findings of the validation study doyle et al 2019b and the steady translation maneuvers the medium resolution case was taken to be sufficient for the present work plotted in fig 24 is a comparison of the lateral force hysteresis during sway oscillation with β 0 1 5 from both pressure and shear based and impulse based methods across a range of frequencies in this figure the hysteresis loop is traversed in the clockwise direction starting at β 1 6 in the bottom left quadrant the collapse of the dynamic forces towards the quasi steady limit is clearly seen as k 0 similarly the predictions for the yawing moment signal from traditional and impulse based methods are shown in fig 25 the yawing moment has only a weak hysteresis in dynamic sway due to the lack of rotation and so the moment signals are instead plotted as non dimensionalized time signals for clarity the comparison between the two methods is slightly worse for the yawing moment with the impulse based method visibly under predicting the extreme moments figs 26 and 27 plot similar comparisons for the force hysteresis and moment signal during oscillating sway with k 0 12 and varying motion amplitude the agreement is again good with some error visible in the lateral force near β 0 and in the extremes of the yawing moment the force hysteresis is seen to be significant at all amplitudes however the shape of the hysteresis loop is seen to change with β 0 and to develop an increasingly sharp cusp as β 0 approaches 20 the mean error between the traditional and impulse based analysis for all cases is summarized in table 3 the mean error is defined as the root mean square deviation of the two methods normalized by the root mean square of the results from traditional pressure and shear based analysis i e 6 1 ϕ e r r ϕ t r a d ϕ i m p r m s ϕ t r a d r m s the error in the impulse based prediction is in all cases less than 10 but is also significantly higher than in the steady translation maneuvers this is believed to be due to errors in the impulse and wake components which are negligible in steady flow these components have a higher order of positional dependence when compared to their respective lamb terms which serves to amplify any error present in the vorticity and velocity fields this amplification increases the error in the impulse based force prediction despite similar levels of convergence in the field variables these same terms have quadratic position dependence for the moment prediction resulting in even higher levels of error for the yawing moment due to its relation with the moment arm this error will be dependent on the placement of the origin in the analysis introducing an artificial origin dependence in the force estimate as discussed in more detail by devoria et al 2014 fig 28 plots a comparison of the lateral force prediction from pressure and shear based and impulse based methods for the sinusoidal sway with k 0 12 and β 0 1 5 for the coarse medium and fine resolution simulations it can be seen that the forces and moments calculated from the pressure and shear fields are essentially independent of mesh resolution and time step size for this maneuver in contrast the impulse based method shows significant variation the medium and fine resolution simulations both accurately capture the hysteresis for the majority of the cycle with some discrepancy in the results near β t 0 where the fine resolution simulation more accurately reflects the traditional method the coarse mesh has significant discrepancies for a much larger portion of the cycle particularly at β t 1 6 it is important to note that the impulse based method uses flow field data which is sampled at a lower frequency than the time step i e that t o u t d t in all three cases the sampling rate was kept constant with t o u t 0 05 s down sampling of the impulse data did not significantly effect the force predictions indicating that the deviation between the pressure based and impulse based methods is insensitive to coarsening of the sampling frequency similar hysteresis curves are shown in fig 29 for the yawing moment similar to the lateral force there appears to be a concentration of grid dependent error in the vicinity of β 0 there is also additional sensitivity near the extrema at all resolutions which was only seen in the coarse resolution case for the lateral force previous experience doyle et al 2019b had indicated that the medium resolution case should be chosen as the baseline mesh and time resolution for the present study due to its balance of accuracy and computational economy for the prediction of the pressure and shear based hydrodynamic forces it is evident from these results that in unsteady flow the impulse based force prediction method is considerably more sensitive to mesh and time step refinement than the pressure based method and that best results would be obtained using higher spatial and temporal resolution an analysis of the components of eqs 2 11 and 2 12 reveals that the sensitivity to mesh refinement is primarily driven by variation of the wake terms as the wake terms are evaluated only on the wake plane it is possible then that this mesh sensitivity is local to this plane rather than global regardless it is likely that much of the discrepancy seen between traditional pressure and shear based results and impulse based results in figs 24 through 27 would be removed by using a higher resolution mesh and time step figs 30 through 32 plot the hysteresis of the lamb wake and impulse components of the lateral force fig 32 further plots the potential flow prediction for the lateral added mass force for comparison it is apparent that the impulse and wake components which are negligible in the quasi steady limit grow in importance with increasing k at k 0 03 the lamb term is the dominant force component while for all other cases the impulse term dominates the lamb term clearly decays to the quasi steady limit as k 0 and has significant hysteresis in all cases the shape of the hysteresis loops of the lamb and wake components are complex and change significantly with varying k these patterns are echoed by the lamb and wake components of the yawing moment for which the lamb component is the dominant contribution at all reduced frequencies the impulse component on the other hand is only significant to the lateral force and has an approximately elliptical hysteresis loop whose force axis grows with k the impulse component is again seen to be well approximated by the inviscid added mass the lateral vorticity moment g y is plotted in fig 33 for oscillatory sway at β 0 1 5 and is seen to be essentially quasi steady throughout the maneuver and to follow the potential flow result closely this is due to the dominance of the near wall vorticity in the vorticity moment calculation at high r e near the wall the vorticity field will adjust to the maneuver kinematics on the timescale of the acceleration in order to enforce the no slip condition this near wall vorticity is so strong that it dominates the effect of motion history which is felt primarily in the separated wake behind the body because of this dominance of the near wall vorticity field the hydrodynamic impulse term can be well approximated by potential flow theory which models the wall as an infinitely thin vortex sheet in an otherwise irrotational field as a result the lateral force impulse term is well approximated by the inviscid added mass and is not significantly affected by motion history unlike the lamb and wake terms the effect of the motion history on the lamb term can be seen both in the hysteresis of that component of the force and also in visualizations of the lamb vector field on the body fig 34 plots contours of the lamb vector in the analysis domain at β t 1 6 for varying k the k 0 03 case can be seen to closely agree with the steady translation result indicating quasi steady conditions for all other cases with k 0 12 significant variation is seen in comparison with the steady translation this is most pronounced in the rear quarter of the body over the tapered tail where the local positive lamb vector distribution in the separated wake is seen to be significantly deformed in comparison to the steady case this variation is seen to both increase in strength and spread up the body as k increases the equivalent instantaneous lamb vector distributions are plotted in fig 35 the deformation of the positive wake lamb appears here to be in conflict with the lamb distribution on the body which shows a pronounced growth in negative vorticity as k increases for the case of β t 1 6 shown here the contribution of the windward boundary layer to the lamb vector at the tail is strongly negative it is countered by the positive contribution of the leeward boundary layer and a variable but net positive contribution from the separated wake during dynamic motion the contribution of the leeward boundary layer is reduced due to delayed separation near the tail in comparison with the quasi steady case the net result is an increasingly negative lamb vector in the tail due to the reduced ability of the leeward boundary layer to cancel the windward as seen in fig 35 this is related to the increasingly inhibited pressure recovery on the lee of the body due to the separation of the wake in general similar process occur throughout the maneuver resulting in the large hysteresis of the lamb term seen in fig 30 the wake vortices make a small but significant contribution to the lamb vector particularly near the tail and in general are responsible for the lamb vector being sensitive to motion history effects in comparison the instantaneous distributions of the lateral vorticity moment are plotted in fig 36 for the same β t 1 6 condition note that the lateral vorticity moment term is given by 6 2 g y s x z ξ x ζ d s there is a significant spike in the vorticity moment at the nose owing to the large value of x in this region and the significant ζ component of vorticity generated by flow around the nose and forward stagnation point the mid body is then seen to have a nearly constant vorticity moment which is driven primarily by the z ξ term finally the tail again has a large x and significant ζ and generates a significant positive contribution notably only the tail is significantly affected by variation in k where there is seen to be a small increase in g y in proportion to reduced frequency while only the β t 1 6 case is shown here these results are typical of the vorticity moment throughout the maneuver the equivalent contours of the lateral vorticity moment in the analysis domain are plotted in fig 37 it can be seen that there is again significant variation in the shape of the contours on the tail of the body as with the lamb term notably however this variation is primarily in the z direction whereas the vorticity moment at the tail is dominated by the x ζ term further the separated wake s contribution to the vorticity moment is notably weaker than its contribution to the lamb vector for both the lamb vector and vorticity moment the wake vorticity field is modified by the motion history effect particularly in the region near the tail for the lamb vector however this is much more significant as the comparatively high fluid velocity in the wake region magnifies this effect and increases the significance of the separated vorticity in comparison with the attached flow near the wall where the velocity is low for the vorticity moment the position of the separated vorticity is not changed significantly enough to cause a large variation in the vorticity moment and the near wall vorticity remains dominant for these reasons the lamb distributions experience significant variation near the tail of the body as a result of motion history and the integrated lamb term has significant hysteresis and a convective time scale during unsteady motion the vorticity moment however responds on the time scale of the kinematics and is essentially quasi steady throughout the maneuver the inviscid added mass then remains a good predictor of the hydrodynamic impulse due to the dominance of the near wall vorticity in the vorticity moment field 7 slender body approximations in their work holloway and jeans 2020 demonstrated a set of approximations which can be applied to the steady translation equations 4 1 and 4 2 to simplify the impulse based force and moment expressions for slender bodies several of these approximations remain valid in the unsteady problem and can be used to simplify the unsteady equations 2 11 and 2 12 the unsteady problem introduces several additional terms in comparison with the steady translation problem and these terms can also be simplified for slender bodies as with the above analysis this discussion will be restricted to the lateral force and yawing moment only the exact lateral force expression is written as 7 1 y ρ d i y d t ρ l y d 1 2 ρ x τ w l y d a where use has been made of the alignment of the normal vector with the longitudinal axis i e n ˆ i ˆ and x t is the axial location of the tail plane following holloway and jeans 2020 the lamb term is then linearized based on the velocity of the vehicle u and the disturbance velocity of the flow u 7 2 ρ l d ρ ω u d ρ ω u u d ρ u ω d so that 7 3 ρ l y d ρ u ζ d applying the identity saffman 1992 7 4 ω d w ω n ˆ x d s eq 7 3 can be transformed to a wake integral of the slender body tail plane impulse 7 5 ρ l y d ρ u w z ξ d s ρ u i y t fig 38 plots a comparison of the exact lamb term y l hysteresis with the slender body approximation for the oscillating sway cases with β 0 1 5 and varying reduced frequency it can be seen that the exact lamb term is well approximated by the slender body expression from the quasi steady limit through to at least k 0 30 while holloway and jeans 2020 found that the wake term makes a negligible contribution to the lateral force in steady translation the results of section 6 demonstrate that it is significant during unsteady motion the wake term can be transformed by recognizing that both the wake term and the impulse term contain a positional dependence while the total force must be independent of position the lateral force calculated with the origin at the center of buoyancy can be equated to the force with the origin at the tail as 7 6 d i y c b d t 1 2 x τ w l y d s d i y t d t the lamb terms have here been canceled due to their independence of origin while the wake term about the tail is zero denoting the distance between the tail and the center of buoyancy as δ x τ x c b the tail plane vorticity moment can be written as 7 7 g t 1 2 x δ i ˆ ω d 1 2 x ω d δ i ˆ ω d g c b δ i ˆ 1 2 ω d the lateral hydrodynamic impulse about the tail can then be written as 7 8 d i y t d t d i y c b d t δ 1 2 d d t s ξ z d s where use has again been made of identity 7 4 on the final term the surface integral is recognized as the slender body tail plane impulse if eq 7 8 is substituted into eq 7 6 it can be seen that 7 9 δ d i y t d t x τ w l y d s note that unlike the lamb term no linearization is necessary to transform the wake term into a tail impulse term the total slender body lateral force can then be written as 7 10 y ρ d i y c b d t ρ u i y t ρ x τ 1 2 d i y t d t the subscript c b will be dropped for the remainder of this work note that a slender body approximation of the rate of change of the impulse term has not been attempted because it has been demonstrated that this term can be accurately approximated with the inviscid added mass fig 39 plots a comparison of the slender body approximation of the total lateral force from eq 7 10 with the exact lateral force from eq 7 1 for the β 0 1 5 oscillating sway cases as with the lamb vector term it can be seen that the slender body simplification provides a good approximation for the lateral force for the entire range of reduced frequencies the exact impulse expression for the yawing moment is 7 11 n ρ d j z d t ρ x l y y l x d ρ 1 2 w x 2 l y d s the lamb moment term is seen to be composed of two components one due to the axial distribution of the lateral load and the other the lateral distribution of the axial load holloway and jeans 2020 found that the axial loading term has a negligible contribution to the lamb moment for slender bodies in steady translation and turning fig 40 plots a comparison of the exact lamb moment with that calculated by neglecting the axial loading for the β 0 1 5 sinusoidal sway cases it can be seen that the lateral loading assumption continues to be a good approximation of the exact lamb term at all frequencies following holloway and jeans 2020 the lamb moment can be further simplified by transformation of the lateral loading term the velocity field is again decomposed into the body motion and fluid disturbance with the disturbance terms neglected as per the slender body assumptions the slender body lateral loading is then given by 7 12 ρ x l y d ρ u x ζ d v ρ u x τ x n x s x ζ d s d x v the surface integral is then re written as the axial derivative of a volume integral which can be transformed via the identity 7 4 as 7 13 ρ u x τ x n x s x ζ d s d x v ρ u x τ x n x x ζ d d x v ρ u x τ x n x x s x z ξ d s d x v finally eq 7 13 is integrated by parts to obtain 7 14 ρ u x τ x n x x s x z ξ d s d x v ρ u x τ x n i y o x d x x τ i y t where i y o is the lateral slender body impulse distribution along the body 7 15 i y o x s x z ξ d s v a x as with the lateral force holloway and jeans 2020 found that the wake term in the yawing moment equation was small in steady flow this is again not the case in unsteady conditions however it is noted that the body is slender and hence x y z the wake term can then be approximated as 7 16 w x 2 l y d s w x 2 l y d s x τ 2 w l y d s this is simply the moment of the wake term from the lateral force equation and the same arguments used to derive equation 7 6 would apply the final term of the yawing moment equations is the rate of change of the angular impulse term recall that the angular impulse can be decomposed into the second moment of the vorticity field and the angular momentum of the fluid displaced by the body so that j z h z q z for unsteady sway motion d q z d t 0 so that j z h z the second moment of the vorticity field can be approximated by the slender body expression 7 17 h z 1 2 x 2 ζ d 1 2 x t x n x 2 s x ζ d s d x as was done with the lamb moment term the surface integral can be replaced by the axial derivative of a volume integral so that 7 18 h z 1 2 x t x n x 2 x ζ d d x this volume integral can then be replaced again using identity 7 4 so that 7 19 h z 1 2 x t x n x 2 x s x z ξ d x this expression can be integrated by parts and simplified yielding the slender body simplification of the second vorticity moment as 7 20 h z 1 2 x t 2 i y t x t x n x g y x d x here g y is the slender lateral vorticity moment distribution defined as 7 21 g y x s x z ξ d s the angular impulse term can then be written as the time derivative of eq 7 20 7 22 d j z d t d h z d t 1 2 x t 2 d i y t d t d d t x t x n x g y x d x fig 41 plots a comparison of the exact and slender impulse term for the β 0 1 5 oscillating sway cases it can be seen that the slender approximation performs well for most cases although it begins to under predict the second peak amplitude at higher k the final expression for the slender body yawing moment is then 7 23 n ρ d d t x t x n x g y x d x ρ u x τ x n i y o x x τ i y t ρ x τ 2 d i y t d t fig 42 again plots a comparison of the exact yaw moment equation with the slender body simplification for the sinusoidal sway cases with β 0 1 5 it can be seen that the slender body approximation overpredicts the yawing moment at the extrema for the high reduced frequency cases with a maximum error of approximately 18 in the k 0 30 case root mean squared error for the slender approximations is under 10 for all cases the over prediction is most significant in the lamb moment term suggesting that the disturbance terms neglected by the slender body assumptions may become more significant at higher reduced frequencies for the range of reduced frequencies explored here however the slender body assumptions appear to provide an acceptable approximation to the exact yawing moment 8 summary and conclusions this study demonstrates the use of a body fixed non inertial framework for analyzing the fluid forces and moments on slender bodies in unsteady motion using the hydrodynamic impulse description of the flow field the impulse theory is based on an understanding of the vortical structures which evolve with the body it has been demonstrated that this formulation provides a number of advantages for the description of hydrodynamic forces including highlighting the relationship between flow structures and surface forces and a clear decomposition of unsteady effects into those due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation the final advantage that the formulation is linear in the vorticity field and therefore more amenable to empirical modeling will be explored in future work which aims to extend existing quasi steady models for submarine hull forces to include unsteady effects three maneuver types were explored in quasi steady translation the flow is dominated by the separation of the boundary layer and the formation of the cross flow vortices which result in increased force on the mid body and tail due to increased lateral circulation this corresponds to locally large values of the lamb vector term in an impulse based force description the lamb vector term is then the dominant component in steady translation during impulsive accelerations it was shown that there are two distinct time scales in the force response the added mass force was shown to act entirely through the vortical impulse and fluid body terms of the impulse equation and to have a timescale dictated by the kinematics this effect corresponds primarily to the creation of new vorticity sheets at the body surface in response to acceleration these sheets are then advected away from the body and downstream a process which acts primarily through the lamb vector term and has a time scale of approximately one flow over the body length this mechanism was seen to primarily effect the force distribution on the tail of the body resulting in a decrease in the local lateral force and an increase in the total yawing moment during the circulatory transient the impulse description was shown to provide a clear decomposition of the dynamic forces into those due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation unlike a traditional pressure and shear based description a series of seven sinusoidal oscillating sway maneuvers was examined it was seen that the impulse based force description is markedly more sensitive to mesh and time step resolution than the traditional force description for a given unsteady maneuver impulse based methods however were seen to still have good agreement with traditional methods for the majority of the maneuver where the methods disagree this discrepancy is concentrated in the low β and high acceleration portion of the maneuver impulse based methods were also seen to continue to provide an effective means of decomposing the transient force components into those primarily due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation and hence motion history this motion history component is contained primarily in the lamb vector term with minor contributions from the wake term and the vorticity moment term the motion history effect was clearly seen to grow in proportion to k and to reduce to the quasi steady solution in the low k limit this was demonstrated both by examination of the hysteresis behavior with decreasing k and with visualizations of the lamb vector field in all cases studied the impulse based description of the flow provides a clear mechanism to decompose the forces into the different transient effects which occur during submarine maneuvering this provides a strong basis for the development of approximate force models for transient submarine maneuvering as it allows different modeling approaches to be pursued for each component as a final step it was shown that approximations from slender body theory remain valid for unsteady flows and result in simplified impulse based force expressions these expressions are believed to be particularly well suited to the development of unsteady force prediction models due to the clear separation of unsteady effects future work will aim to enhance this database of sway cases by extending it to include additional maneuver kinematics and geometries and to use this enhanced database and the simplified force expressions to develop a force prediction model for fully transient submarine maneuvering problems credit authorship contribution statement r doyle methodology validation formal analysis investigation

20408,the forces and moments on a uuv hull undergoing unsteady sway motions are analyzed using both traditional methods which integrate the pressure and shear stress at the wall and hydrodynamic impulse based methods which analyze the vortical structure of the flow around the body computational fluid dynamics simulations have been conducted of a body with a slenderness ratio of 8 5 at a reynolds number of 3 4 million undergoing a variety of sway maneuvers these include steady translations at incidence angles from 0 to 20 impulsive acceleration with varied initial incidence and sinusoidally oscillating sway over a range of frequencies and amplitudes the impulse based method is based on a body fixed non inertial frame used to analyze the vortical structures near the body it is demonstrated that this impulse based analysis provides a sensible decomposition of unsteady forces into those due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation and motion history motion history effects are seen to be primarily described by the lamb vector distribution around the body these effects decay towards the quasi steady limit at large times for impulsive motion and at low frequencies for sinusoidal motion this is demonstrated with the analysis of the impulse based force components and with visualizations of the vortex structures in the flow field a simplified form of the impulse based equations is derived and validated based on approximations from slender body theory keywords cfd hydrodynamic impulse flow history slender body nomenclature impulse analysis domain σ

velocity 1 introduction slender axisymmetric bodies are common throughout the marine and aerospace industries with examples ranging from aircraft fuselages to space launch vehicles to underwater vehicles and many more the design of these vehicles depends critically on understanding the fluid flow around them both in terms of the loading due to fluid forces and also in terms of the fluid structures in the vehicles vicinity this is especially true for unsteady flows where the transient development of the wake vorticity field is an unavoidable element of the physical description of the fluid forces as part of a long term effort to improve force estimation models for submarine maneuvering past works have focused on the flow over slender axisymmetric bodies in steady translation jeans et al 2009 and steady turning holloway and jeans 2020 zhang et al 2013 these bodies have been chosen to be representative of unappended submarine hulls and common unmanned underwater vehicle uuv geometries the flow around these bodies has been simulated with computational fluid dynamics cfd methods and the flow analyzed using a mid field formulation of the forces and moments based on the concept of hydrodynamic impulse the goal of the present work is to extend this methodology to include the effect of transient flow during submarine and uuv maneuvering the hydrodynamic forces during submarine maneuvering are traditionally evaluated by methods which integrate the pressure and shear stress fields on the bodies surface while familiar this description does not easily lend itself to the development of model expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments the role of added mass and unsteady circulation is unclear in this force formulation and the nonlinear coupling of the pressure and velocity fields renders model development challenging in contrast the use of a hydrodynamic impulse based analysis and concepts from vorticity dynamics to describe the fluid forces in terms of the surrounding vorticity field does not suffer from these shortcomings as discussed by lighthill 1986 the separation of unsteady circulation and added mass can be made clear in an impulse based force description the impulse based expressions are linear in the vorticity and velocity fields resulting in simplifications for model development doyle 2020 doyle et al 2019a holloway and jeans 2020 jeans et al 2009 finally the vortex description allows the use of geometric reasoning by basing the force description on the vortical structures which can be visualized in the flow field for these reasons an impulse based description of the hydrodynamic forces and moments provides a powerful tool for analyzing the role of unsteady flow effects in submarine and uuv maneuvering impulse based methods of calculating the force on a body have a long history and have been applied to a variety of flow problems the relationship between the time rate of change of the impulse and the force on a solid body was demonstrated by lamb 1895 for a solid body moving in an infinite field of ideal fluid this result was extended in saffman 1992 to inviscid flows containing vorticity and is extended further to viscous flows in finite domains in wu et al 2006 and noca et al 1999 which form the basis for the present work past applications of impulse methods to slender axisymmetric bodies holloway and jeans 2020 jeans et al 2009 have focused only on steady flows unsteady flows have been studied in two dimensions for both flat plates graham et al 2017 ostieri et al 2018 and cylinders kang et al 2018 liu et al 2014 noca 1997 noca et al 1997 1999 while three dimensional studies of unsteady flow have typically focused on flapping plates devoria et al 2014 li and lu 2012 and oscillating vertical cylinders wu et al 2007 holloway and jeans 2020 demonstrate the use of an impulse based analysis for steady viscous flow in finite rotating domains using variables expressed in a non inertial body fixed frame the present work will build on that presented in holloway and jeans 2020 by extending the impulse based analysis method to unsteady viscous flows in a finite accelerating domain again using body frame variables the goal of this paper is to analyze the force and moment on a slender axisymmetric body based on a uuv hull using both traditional and impulse based methods particular attention will be paid to quantifying the role of unsteadiness in the flow and the development of the component parts of the impulse based force description from the quasi steady limit to increasingly unsteady flows due to their prominent role in submarine maneuvering and control problems particular attention is paid to the lateral force and yawing moment this will be accomplished by first performing an analysis of steady translation in order to establish the quasi steady limit as a baseline for discussion this will be followed by the analysis of impulsive sway accelerations in order to identify relevant time scales for an impulse based description and to enhance our understanding of the physical origins of the different vortical components a variety of sinusoidally oscillating sway motions will then be analyzed in order to investigate the variation of these components with the kinematics of sway maneuvers the motions studied here have been chosen to be evocative of the classical analyses by wagner katz and plotkin 2001 wagner 1925 and theodorsen 1935 for thin airfoils in an effort to frame the discussion within the broader context of unsteady aerodynamics and hydrodynamics this analysis will conclude with the presentation of simplifications to the impulse equations derived using slender body theory which are suitable for practical calculations of the unsteady forces experienced by submarine hulls and uuvs during realistic maneuvers doyle 2020 doyle et al 2019a 2 impulse formulation of hydrodynamic forces the flow solution is developed in the non inertial body frame of reference and this is chosen as the frame of reference for the impulse formulation as well in the body frame the x axis is aligned with the longitudinal axis and positive towards the nose the lateral y axis points to the right when facing positive x and the normal or z axis forms a right handed coordinate system by pointing down the origin is placed at the center of buoyancy of the body this orientation corresponds to the standard axis for submarine dynamics problems a schematic diagram of the analysis and cfd domains is shown in fig 1 in order to ensure accuracy and economy the impulse analysis is restricted to a sub domain of the computational mesh which is close to the body and highly refined this sub domain is rectangular with boundaries placed at the bodies nose and tail in the axial direction four diameters away in the lateral direction and two diameters away in the normal direction the fluid containing volume will be denoted f the volume of the solid body b and the total volume of the analysis domain will then be f b the solid volume b is bounded by the surface b and the total volume is bounded by the surface σ so that the fluid volume f is bounded by s σ b with the analysis domain so defined significant vorticity only intersects with the rear surface of σ where it meets the tail wake plane denoted by w the impulse formulation used in this work will largely follow that presented by wu et al 2006 for the advection form with some simplifications based on the restricted maneuver kinematics and past experience with slender axisymmetric bodies from jeans et al 2009 and holloway and jeans 2020 with the analysis domain so defined the hydrodynamic impulse is defined as 2 1 i g p where g is the first moment of the vorticity field 2 2 g 1 2 r ω d and p is the momentum of the fluid displaced by the solid body 2 3 p b u d the vector r is the position vector in the inertial frame ω is the vorticity and u is the velocity of the solid body for an inertial domain of infinite extent which encompasses all regions of non zero vorticity the equation for the hydrodynamic force on the body would then be saffman 1992 2 4 f ρ d i d t similarly the hydrodynamic angular impulse is defined as 2 5 j h q where h is the second moment of the vorticity 2 6 h 1 2 r 2 ω d and q is the angular momentum of the fluid displaced by the body 2 7 q b r 2 u d finally for an inertial domain of infinite extent encompassing all vorticity the equation for the fluid dynamic moment on the body is then saffman 1992 2 8 m ρ d j d t the analysis domain defined above for the present problem will necessarily not contain all of the vorticity in the fluid domain both due to the truncation of the domain and also due to flow through the outlet boundary of the cfd domain for this reason additional terms are introduced to eqs 2 4 and 2 8 which account for the flux of vorticity across the boundary the resulting equations for the impulse based force and moment in a finite inertial domain can be given as 2 9 f ρ d i 0 d t ρ l 0 d ρ 1 2 σ n ˆ u 0 x 0 ω 0 x 0 n ˆ l 0 d s ρ b n ˆ 1 2 u 0 2 i u 0 u 0 d s f v and 2 10 m ρ d j 0 d t ρ x 0 l 0 d ρ 1 2 σ n ˆ u 0 x 0 2 ω 0 x 0 2 n ˆ l 0 d s ρ b n ˆ 1 2 u 0 2 i u 0 u 0 d s m v where l 0 ω 0 u 0 is the lamb vector and the subscript 0 is used here to denote an inertial quantity these expressions are consistent with those reported by noca 1997 although note that the domain motion at velocity u 0 has been included following previous experience with slender axisymmetric bodies in steady translation and steady rotation the viscous terms f v and m v are taken to be negligible holloway and jeans 2020 eqs 2 9 and 2 10 are derived by noca 1997 with the assumption of an inertial frame in order to apply them to the present problem they must be transformed to the non inertial body frame for the purposes of the present work the frame motion is restricted to including only linear acceleration and the effect of rotation is not included in the present analysis the impulse equations for the force and moment in the non inertial body frame are then written as 2 11 f ρ d i d t ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s 2 12 m ρ d j d t ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s full details on the frame transformation are available in doyle 2020 these equations then are consistent with the advection form described by wu et al 2006 and will form the basis of the present work the discussion which follows will focus on the evaluation of eqs 2 11 and 2 12 for the maneuvering of slender axisymmetric bodies in various modes of unsteady sway motion from quasi steady translation to impulsively started sway motion and finally to sinusoidal sway for the sake of brevity the full terms will not be written out but instead named as follows terms involving the fluid momentum displaced by the body i e p and q terms will be referred to as fluid body terms the terms involving g and h are named vorticity moment terms while i and j are named impulse terms finally those terms involving the volume integral of l are lamb terms while those involving the surface integral of l are wake terms 3 methodology 3 1 model geometry and computational domain the model geometry used in the present study is a slender axisymmetric body developed as a test bed for unmanned underwater vehicle uuv and submarine technologies at the national research council nrc lab in st john s newfoundland canada and referred to as phoenix azarsina et al 2008 the body is composed of three sections a half ellipsoidal nose constant diameter mid body and a parabolic tail section the profile of the phoenix geometry is given in fig 2 the overall geometry has a length of ℓ 1 724 m and a slenderness ratio of ℓ d 8 5 the center of buoyancy is located at λ ℓ 0 456 where λ is distance measured from the nose unless otherwise specified all moments are taken about the center of buoyancy the computational domain is rectangular the model is placed approximately two body lengths from the front or inlet face ten body lengths ahead of the rear or outlet face thirty diameters to the side walls 4 37 diameters from the bottom and 5 37 diameters from the top the computational mesh is block structured using hexahedral elements a schematic of the computational domain including longitudinal and lateral mesh sections near the body is shown in fig 3 the boundaries labeled in this figure correspond to slip walls on the top and bottom surfaces label 1 far field boundaries on the front and sides labeled 2 and 3 respectively and outflow on the rear surface label 4 the far field boundary consists of a time adjusting boundary which can switch between inlet and outlet as dictated by the maneuver kinematics no slip walls are applied on the hull surface and a low reynolds number wall treatment is used in the turbulence model i e a wall function is not applied the first cell height off of the wall for all cases averaged y 0 2 meshes were generated at three different refinement levels for the purposes of a mesh sensitivity study in the medium resolution case the total domain consists of 23 million computational cells the body surface is resolved at an average of d a b 0 13 cm 2 and the solution is advanced with a constant global time step of d t 0 0005 s prior comparisons with experimental testing doyle et al 2019b has demonstrated that this resolution gives a satisfactory balance of accuracy and run time and is the default resolution for all results unless otherwise specified details on all three resolutions are given in table 1 in the analysis of the model results use has been made of inviscid added mass coefficients for the phoenix geometry these coefficients have been generated using the open source panel code aircraft 3d panel method or apame filkovic 2018 the use of apame for generating the added mass coefficients of slender geometries has been previously validated by marshall 2017 and it s use to decompose the unsteady forces from cfd results has been demonstrated by doyle et al 2019b due to the focus on maneuvers in sway only the x u and y v coefficients are utilized here a panel density of thirty thousand panels was found to give a sufficiently converged result for these coefficients which have values of x u 6 91 e 4 and y v 1 67 e 2 when non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ ℓ 3 3 2 maneuver kinematics three types of sway maneuvers are presented in this work a sway maneuver in this context means any maneuver having a sway velocity v with zero rotation these maneuvers were selected in order to help elucidate the effect of unsteady flow on the forces and moments and will primarily be described with that goal in mind the baseline of comparison for any sway maneuver will be a steady translation at a constant angle of drift β where the drift angle is defined as 3 1 β tan 1 v u in keeping with conventions for underwater vehicles the vehicles nominal velocity is kept constant at u 0 2 m s so that all cases will have the same nominal reynolds number and dynamic pressure in the free stream steady translations were simulated at drift angles of 0 4 8 12 16 and 20 degrees previous research studies allen and perkins 1951 indicate that at angles of approximately 20 and below the wake vortices will be symmetrical and stable while at higher angles asymmetry and unsteady vortex shedding begin to occur as unsteady flow conditions during kinematically steady motions would potentially confound the goals of the present work drift angles are restricted to the range of 20 and below to ensure that a stable quasi steady equivalent flow can be defined for any unsteady flow condition the unsteadiness of a motion is parameterized by the reduced frequency k which is the ratio of the flow time scale to the unsteady time scale the exact definition of k will vary based on maneuver type the simplest unsteady sway maneuver is an impulsively started sway motion a simulation of an ideal impulse with satisfactory convergence of the flow field was not found to be practical and so the impulsive acceleration has here been approximated with a gaussian function of the form 3 2 v δ v 2 π t 1 2 exp t t 0 2 2 t 1 2 the constants t 0 and t 1 are here the peak acceleration time and pulse width respectively and are kept constant at t 0 3 0 s and t 1 100 d t 0 05 s the velocity change δ v is calculated to produce a 1 change in the angle of drift given an initial velocity or drift angle an annotated plot of eq 3 2 is shown in fig 4 five such impulsive maneuvers were simulated with initial incidences ranging from 0 to 20 these maneuvers are initialized from a steady translation result for the initial angle of drift and are run for a total of 6 s this duration was found for all cases to be sufficient to achieve a steady mean in the final second with variation of less than 1 which is taken to be sufficiently steady for the present work the steady force and moment on the body are known to be nonlinear with respect to drift angle jeans et al 2009 and so it was believed that the impulsive response would vary with differences in the initial drift as with the steady translation angles above 20 were not simulated due to concerns related to unsteady flow in the quasi steady configuration the reduced frequency for impulsive cases is defined as 3 3 k ℓ u t t and is equivalent to a non dimensional time the final sway maneuver investigated is oscillatory sway during oscillatory sway the vehicle will maintain a constant axial velocity with a sinusoidally oscillating sway velocity v t the simulation is initialized at the maximum velocity condition with zero acceleration a relaxation time is used during initialization in which the initial condition is maintained for 0 2 s in order to minimize the effect of the start up transient unsteady motion then begins at t 0 s with the sway velocity defined as 3 4 v t v 0 cos 2 π f t where f is the frequency of oscillation with this definition the angle of incidence will also vary in phase with the velocity while the sway acceleration will be 90 out of phase the reduced frequency for oscillatory motion is defined as the ratio of the flow over time to the period of oscillation t so that 3 5 k ℓ 2 u t the factor of 2 here is in keeping with the standards of the aeroelasticity community which typically takes the characteristic length to be the half chord of an airfoil seven cases of oscillatory sway have been examined for this work representing variations of the two parameters in eq 3 4 these are given in table 2 as with the steady translation cases angles higher than 20 are not investigated due to concerns about unsteadiness in the quasi steady wake the reduced frequency range used here was determined based on kinematic data for submarine maneuvering doyle 2020 which gave ranges of 0 11 k 0 16 for horizontal plane motions and 0 19 k 0 30 for vertical plane motions the low case of k 0 03 was chosen to illustrate the case of a nearly quasi steady oscillatory motion two complete cycles are simulated in all oscillatory cases 3 3 numerical method the simulations are conducted using the cfd code exn aero produced by envenio inc exn aero is a finite volume based cfd code which has been designed to make efficient use of hybrid multicore manycore architectures gerber et al 2013 it solves the

3 6 through 3 9 iteratively using the simple c algorithm and an algebraic multigrid linear equation solver the equations are discretized with a second order backward euler method in time van leer differencing for the advection terms van leer 1975 and central differencing for diffusion terms within a time step the target mass flow convergence was 0 005 with an rms residual target of 1 0e 4 from the equation solver normalized by the cell flux coefficient achieved convergence varied by maneuver and is reported in the respective results section below 4 steady translation steady translations are the quasi steady equivalent of unsteady sway motions and thus serve as a base line with which to compare and contrast the unsteady flows for this reason a brief overview of the results for the flow around a slender body in steady translation is presented in steady translation the vorticity moment and fluid body terms are constant and the impulse equations reduce to wu et al 2006 4 1 f ρ v l d v ρ 2 w x n ˆ l d a for the force and 4 2 m ρ v x l d v ρ 2 w x 2 n ˆ l d a for the moment six steady translations with drift angles ranging from 0 to 20 were simulated steady simulations were run with d t 0 001 s for 5 s total starting from a uniform flow field for all cases this run time was sufficient for the force and moment data to achieve a steady mean value with a standard deviation of less than 1 for the final second steady translation cases achieved an average mass error of 0 007 1 7e 5 for the momentum residuals 1 5e 3 for the pressure residual and 1 1e 4 for the turbulent residuals these were taken to be suitably converged results grid sensitivity analysis was performed for the β 1 6 case using the procedure of celik et al 2008 the grid convergence indices gci were found to be 6 8 for the lateral force and 1 7 for the yawing moment with an apparent order of convergence of 1 2 and 4 1 respectively figs 5 and 6 plot a comparison of the lateral force and yawing moment estimated from these expressions with those calculated using integrations of the pressure and shear fields at the wall the agreement between the two methods is seen to be good with disagreement in all cases less than 4 at all angles of drift the wake terms in eqs 4 1 and 4 2 are found to be small in comparison to the volume integral in keeping with the results of holloway and jeans 2020 the force is then determined primarily through the volume integral of the lamb vector which in steady translation can be interpreted as representing the bound vorticity or the combined vorticity of the attached boundary layer and the cross flow vortex system saffman 1992 wu et al 2006 yang et al 2007 the sensitivity of the impulse based lateral force and yawing moment predictions to mesh refinement was studied for the case of steady translation at β 1 6 the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 the agreement between the two methods is generally good with a total variation of no more than 2 between the medium and fine mesh the grid convergence of the impulse method is however seen to be much more sensitive to mesh refinement than the pressure and shear based method with the impulse predictions appearing to diverge from the pressure and shear predictions for the lateral force while the yawing moment results do not display monotonic behavior these results suggest then that impulse based methods may require a higher degree of mesh refinement to achieve satisfactory grid convergence when compared to pressure and shear based methods regardless the agreement between the two methods is good and the medium resolution results are taken to be satisfactory for the present analysis in steady translation the flow topology is characterized by a pair of counter rotating vortices in the lee of the body these vortices grow in strength and size as the angle of drift increases and are fed by sheets of separated vorticity from the boundary layer which attach to the body via open topology separation lines visualizations of the lateral lamb vector distribution in the analysis domain are given in fig 9 fig 10 plots the resulting lateral force distributions on the body using both pressure and shear based methods and the impulse based method normalized by sin 2 β so that the results collapse towards a single curve also plotted is the potential flow prediction for the normalized lateral force at all angles so as to illustrate the effect of viscosity on the local forces the initial force peak on the nose is the result of the forward stagnation point on the body creating a high local pressure force which is increasingly in the lateral direction with increasing angle of drift this results in significant vorticity flux off of the body surface at the nose forming vortex rings which flow over the nose with a local vortex force in the lateral direction proportional to angle of drift i e a high lateral lamb vector this flow feature is not easily visualized in fig 9 as it is confined to the boundary layer which is quite thin on the nose notably regardless of whether a vorticity or pressure and shear stress description is used the force in this region follows the potential flow result indicating negligible viscous effects near the nose of the body on the mid body separation and the formation of cross flow vortices are clearly visible in fig 9 at angles of 8 and above this causes the pressure on the leeward surface to not fully recover in comparison with the windward surface again resulting in an increasingly positive local pressure force equivalently the separation sheet and cross flow vortices result in an increasingly positive net lateral lamb vector as drift angle increases this increasingly positive force on the mid body can be clearly observed in fig 10 as the cfd results increasingly diverge from the potential flow result as β increases at the tail the boundary layer separation suppresses the formation of the rear stagnation point which would be seen in an inviscid flow and which would serve to provide a downward force to cancel the forward stagnation point while negative forces are generated at the tail these are significantly weaker than would be predicted by potential flow theory as seen in fig 10 the equivalent vortex description here is that the presence of the separation and cross flow vortices generate positive vortex forces on the tail which partially cancel the negative forces generated by the rear stagnation point the result is a negative lamb vector and associated vortex force but which is weaker than the potential flow prediction these three features and their corresponding vortical descriptions then form the dominant mechanisms which generate the hydrodynamic force and moment on the body in steady translation taken together they represent important baseline features for the analysis of unsteady motion 5 impulsive sway all subsequent motions studied are unsteady and will utilize the full impulse equations as expressed in the non inertial frame these equations are repeated here for convenience as 5 1 f ρ d i d t ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s and 5 2 m ρ d j d t ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s in contrast to their steady equivalent unsteady motion is seen to directly involve the time rate of change of the impulse term as well as potential modifications of the lamb and wake terms from their steady equivalents the primary goal of this and the subsequent section will be to determine how these terms are modified from their quasi steady equivalents as a function of the vehicles acceleration and motion history five impulsive accelerations were simulated consisting of a unit change in the angle of drift with initial drift angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 the simulations were run with a time step of d t 0 0005 s for a total of 6 s with the peak acceleration at t 0 3 s the simulations were initialized from a steady simulation of the initial condition to ensure no transient due to initialization the simulations achieved an average mass error of 2 0e 7 an average momentum residual of 1 4e 6 an average pressure residual of 1 6e 4 and an average residual of 1 1e 5 for the turbulent variables traditional hull forces are output every time step while the data for the impulse based methods must be synthesized from the flow field which is sampled throughout the simulation the flow field is sampled at 100 d t before the acceleration 10 d t during the acceleration 50 d t during the transient up to t 1 7 and 100 d t for the remainder of the maneuver the simulated lateral force and yawing moment during the impulsive maneuver are plotted in figs 11 and 12 using both traditional methods based on the hull pressure and shear and the impulse based method given by eqs 2 11 and 2 12 time is here non dimensionalized by the convective timescale to highlight the motion history response so that t t u ℓ the agreement between the two methods is good in all cases being within the accuracy range of the steady translation cases echoing the classical analysis of wagner for flat plates katz and plotkin 2001 wagner 1925 two distinct features are seen in the lateral force response a high impulsive peak force occurs during the acceleration which corresponds to the inertia of the surrounding fluid this is followed by a slower build up of the force to the steady value at the new drift angle which is due to the establishment of the wake as the transient vorticity generated by the impulsive motion is washed along the body a similar response is seen for the yawing moment with a rapid initial overshoot followed by a slow decay the impulsive response is then characterized by two time scales an impulsive scale which corresponds to the duration of the acceleration and a circulatory timescale which corresponds to the motion history effects in order to better understand the unsteady behavior of the different components of the impulse equations these components are plotted individually in fig 13 for the lateral force during the β i 1 0 maneuver it is clear that using the present analysis method the inertial force is entirely contained in the impulse term while the effect of unsteady circulation is contained primarily in the lamb vector term with minor contributions from the wake and impulse terms this is an important decomposition of the different unsteady effects during motion and can be accomplished without the use of external information such as added mass coefficients the impulse term is compared directly to predictions for the lateral inviscid added mass force in fig 14 and is seen to have excellent agreement with the potential flow result the impulse term contains both the rate of change of fluid body momentum which responds exactly on the acceleration timescale and the rate of change of the vorticity moment the vorticity moment is strongly dominated by near wall vorticity which responds on the kinematic or acceleration timescale due to the no slip boundary condition on the wall the impulse term is then best associated with the creation of vorticity sheets on the body surface as a result of acceleration although the vorticity moment term does contain a small additional transient which persists after the acceleration these thin vortex sheets are well predicted by potential flow theory and this result demonstrates not only the efficacy of impulse based methods for decomposing unsteady forces but also that potential flow methods remain a good predictor for the added mass forces during impulsive sway these results were consistent across every impulsive maneuver simulated the lateral force impulse term then has a time scale associated with the acceleration due to it s association with the fluid inertia and can be taken as the expression of the added mass forces in the impulse equations in comparison fig 15 plots the lateral lamb vector term and the wake term for the same impulsive maneuver along with an unsteady residual which is the result of subtracting the inviscid added mass prediction from the total force as predicted by the pressure and shear based method it is clear that these terms require a time scale much longer than the acceleration in order to adjust to the new kinematics on the order of the convective timescale as with the steady translations the majority of the force in this comparison is due to the lamb vector term with additional small contributions from the wake term as well as the transient portion of the vorticity moment after the acceleration these forces are here associated with the unsteady circulatory forces which would include both the bound circulation of the body and the transient circulation shed into the wake as a result of the dynamic motion fig 16 plots the components of the yawing moment response for the same maneuver the impulse and wake terms of the yawing moment are here seen to respond only on the convective timescale while the lamb term is seen to have a two timescale response similar to the lateral added mass force for this class of bodies undergoing sway motion potential flow predicts negligible yaw coupling in sway the initial rise of the yawing moment lamb term occurs on a similar timescale to the acceleration however this is not due to added mass but instead can be attributed to an initial tendency towards the inviscid munk moment that relaxes on the convective timescale the munk moment is a quasi steady phenomenon which in potential flow theory is again associated with the presence of thin vortex sheets on the hull surface the strength of these sheets is distributed such that there is no net force on the body in inviscid flow as per d alembert s paradox but there is a net moment which is munk s moment these vortex sheets and their unsteady response will be discussed further below as with the lateral force these results are consistent for all impulsive maneuvers studied figs 17 and 18 plot normalized response functions or indicial functions from all five impulsive maneuvers for lateral force and yawing moment where 5 3 ϕ i t ϕ t ϕ 0 ϕ ϕ 0 in examining the force indicial function it is important to realize that all five maneuvers experienced a similar acceleration and hence similar added mass forces and so it is expected that when normalized by the final quasi steady force the added mass force becomes less significant at higher angles of drift in addition to the total indicial an unsteady residual has also been formed by removing the predictions from the potential flow model so that 5 4 y r e s y y v v and 5 5 n r e s n y v x u u v the residual aims to remove the added mass response from the total response so as to isolate the effect of motion history a comparison of the unsteady residual forces shows that the effect of the initial incidence on the circulatory transient is nonlinear in that the response varies depending on the initial condition the residual indicial functions have a timescale of t 1 for the unsteady circulation effects as initial incidence decreases the initial strength of the residual response is seen to increase with a shallower response later in the maneuver and vice versa as the initial incidence increases in all cases however the force residual response requires a significantly larger timescale than the acceleration this residual response is due entirely to motion history effects the moment indicial function also shows two distinct features the initial steep increase in the moment is a purely kinematic response to the change in angle of drift as per munk s moment rather than an added mass force the moment however then overshoots the quasi steady value and has a settling time in all cases with t 1 munks moment is known to overpredict the actual viscous moment in steady translation and the overshoot would appear to be related to the initial tendency towards the inviscid munk moment in response to the kinematic variation followed by a relaxation to the steady viscous value as circulatory effects decay if munk s moment is removed using the inviscid added mass coefficients a residual yawing moment is obtained which is similar in character to the residual lateral force as shown in fig 18 the moment response is best understood by examination of the transient force distributions force distributions at select times during the β i 1 0 maneuver are shown in fig 19 from this figure at t 0 00 it can be seen that the added mass has the effect of increasing the force distribution along the body in proportion to the local radius resulting in minimal net moment but considerable net force this effect quickly disappears and it can be seen from the remaining curves that by t 0 25 the majority of the body has already achieved the final force distribution with the effect of unsteadiness appearing to be confined to the tail region the force distribution is re plotted in fig 20 without the large positive contribution from the nose it is seen that the effect of transience is to create an initially more negative force on the tail which increases towards a steady value resulting in an initially increased yawing moment on the body which decays towards the steady value while this trend is present for all initial drift angles the portion of the body which is affected by the transient circulation grows with initial drift at low angles only the rear quarter is significantly effected from 0 75 λ l 1 0 at β i 5 this increases towards the nose with 0 4 λ l 1 0 at β i 1 5 this result is in keeping with the increased wake strength and circulation at higher angles of drift while the effect of the transience can be clearly seen in the force signals analyzed in this section visualizations of the flow field during the step maneuver show little variation due to the small overall change in incidence angle and so are not included here in order to test the robustness of these results and further explore the nonlinearity of the response functions three additional impulsive maneuvers were simulated which varied the impulse kinematics in the first a stronger tighter pulse is produced by lowering the timestep to d t 0 00025 s resulting in t 1 100 d t 0 025 s while maintaining the same δ v and hence generating a higher peak acceleration in the second a larger δ v is used such that the impulse will produce a δ β 2 change in drift while maintaining the baseline pulse width of t 1 0 05 s in the last a negative pulse is generated such that the maneuver starts at β i 1 1 and decelerates to β 1 0 which is the reverse of the β i 1 0 maneuver presented above all other setup and convergence details remain the same as the baseline cases all of these cases use a nominal β 1 0 as either the initial or final condition so that the natural comparison among the baseline cases is the β i 1 0 maneuver fig 21 compares the impulse term of the vortex based force equation with the potential flow prediction for the inviscid added mass in these four cases this both illustrates the difference in the acceleration between the four cases and also demonstrates that the impulse term is well predicted by the potential flow result in all cases a comparison of the indicial functions for these cases is shown in fig 22 for the lateral force and 23 for the yawing moment it can be seen that the negative pulse response function is identical to the baseline case while the thin and large pulses have minor variations for both the thin and large pulse the added mass force changes in response to the change in the acceleration as expected however there is negligible change in the circulatory transient the yawing moment response is seen to be essentially unaffected for all cases except the thin pulse which has minor variations in the development of it s munk like response due to the change in the kinematics in all cases the circulatory transient is essentially unaffected by changes in the impulsive acceleration the impulse response of the motion history effect is then concluded to be nonlinear in that it varies in response to changes in the initial incidence and hence the convective flow however it can be treated as locally linear for small variations about a given initial incidence 6 oscillating sway a series of seven simulations of the geometry undergoing oscillating dynamic sway were conducted with varying amplitude and frequency of sway motion the simulations were initialized from a uniform field however an initial relaxation period with constant kinematics was utilized in order to establish the initial flow field and reduce the effect of the startup transient achieved convergences for these cases averaged 0 4 for the mass error with an average normalized momentum residual of 4 3e 6 pressure residual of 1 2e 3 and turbulent residuals of 4 3e 5 grid sensitivity analysis was conducted on the k 0 12 β 0 1 5 case for the lateral force and yawing moment signal amplitude and phase the results showed good agreement with less then 1 variation across all three meshes however this variation was oscillatory in nature making it difficult to render conclusive statements regarding the grid uncertainty using the procedure of celik et al 2008 the lateral force was found to have gci s of 0 03 and 1 1 for amplitude and phase respectively with apparent orders of convergence of 7 5 and 2 8 respectively the yawing moment was found to have gci s of 0 02 and 0 05 for phase and amplitude with apparent orders of 7 7 and 6 0 the high level of agreement between the three meshes and the convergence statistics are believed to be due to the strong role played by the added mass in the forces and moments which is an essentially inviscid phenomenon and is believed to be less sensitive to the mesh properties in keeping with the findings of the validation study doyle et al 2019b and the steady translation maneuvers the medium resolution case was taken to be sufficient for the present work plotted in fig 24 is a comparison of the lateral force hysteresis during sway oscillation with β 0 1 5 from both pressure and shear based and impulse based methods across a range of frequencies in this figure the hysteresis loop is traversed in the clockwise direction starting at β 1 6 in the bottom left quadrant the collapse of the dynamic forces towards the quasi steady limit is clearly seen as k 0 similarly the predictions for the yawing moment signal from traditional and impulse based methods are shown in fig 25 the yawing moment has only a weak hysteresis in dynamic sway due to the lack of rotation and so the moment signals are instead plotted as non dimensionalized time signals for clarity the comparison between the two methods is slightly worse for the yawing moment with the impulse based method visibly under predicting the extreme moments figs 26 and 27 plot similar comparisons for the force hysteresis and moment signal during oscillating sway with k 0 12 and varying motion amplitude the agreement is again good with some error visible in the lateral force near β 0 and in the extremes of the yawing moment the force hysteresis is seen to be significant at all amplitudes however the shape of the hysteresis loop is seen to change with β 0 and to develop an increasingly sharp cusp as β 0 approaches 20 the mean error between the traditional and impulse based analysis for all cases is summarized in table 3 the mean error is defined as the root mean square deviation of the two methods normalized by the root mean square of the results from traditional pressure and shear based analysis i e 6 1 ϕ e r r ϕ t r a d ϕ i m p r m s ϕ t r a d r m s the error in the impulse based prediction is in all cases less than 10 but is also significantly higher than in the steady translation maneuvers this is believed to be due to errors in the impulse and wake components which are negligible in steady flow these components have a higher order of positional dependence when compared to their respective lamb terms which serves to amplify any error present in the vorticity and velocity fields this amplification increases the error in the impulse based force prediction despite similar levels of convergence in the field variables these same terms have quadratic position dependence for the moment prediction resulting in even higher levels of error for the yawing moment due to its relation with the moment arm this error will be dependent on the placement of the origin in the analysis introducing an artificial origin dependence in the force estimate as discussed in more detail by devoria et al 2014 fig 28 plots a comparison of the lateral force prediction from pressure and shear based and impulse based methods for the sinusoidal sway with k 0 12 and β 0 1 5 for the coarse medium and fine resolution simulations it can be seen that the forces and moments calculated from the pressure and shear fields are essentially independent of mesh resolution and time step size for this maneuver in contrast the impulse based method shows significant variation the medium and fine resolution simulations both accurately capture the hysteresis for the majority of the cycle with some discrepancy in the results near β t 0 where the fine resolution simulation more accurately reflects the traditional method the coarse mesh has significant discrepancies for a much larger portion of the cycle particularly at β t 1 6 it is important to note that the impulse based method uses flow field data which is sampled at a lower frequency than the time step i e that t o u t d t in all three cases the sampling rate was kept constant with t o u t 0 05 s down sampling of the impulse data did not significantly effect the force predictions indicating that the deviation between the pressure based and impulse based methods is insensitive to coarsening of the sampling frequency similar hysteresis curves are shown in fig 29 for the yawing moment similar to the lateral force there appears to be a concentration of grid dependent error in the vicinity of β 0 there is also additional sensitivity near the extrema at all resolutions which was only seen in the coarse resolution case for the lateral force previous experience doyle et al 2019b had indicated that the medium resolution case should be chosen as the baseline mesh and time resolution for the present study due to its balance of accuracy and computational economy for the prediction of the pressure and shear based hydrodynamic forces it is evident from these results that in unsteady flow the impulse based force prediction method is considerably more sensitive to mesh and time step refinement than the pressure based method and that best results would be obtained using higher spatial and temporal resolution an analysis of the components of eqs 2 11 and 2 12 reveals that the sensitivity to mesh refinement is primarily driven by variation of the wake terms as the wake terms are evaluated only on the wake plane it is possible then that this mesh sensitivity is local to this plane rather than global regardless it is likely that much of the discrepancy seen between traditional pressure and shear based results and impulse based results in figs 24 through 27 would be removed by using a higher resolution mesh and time step figs 30 through 32 plot the hysteresis of the lamb wake and impulse components of the lateral force fig 32 further plots the potential flow prediction for the lateral added mass force for comparison it is apparent that the impulse and wake components which are negligible in the quasi steady limit grow in importance with increasing k at k 0 03 the lamb term is the dominant force component while for all other cases the impulse term dominates the lamb term clearly decays to the quasi steady limit as k 0 and has significant hysteresis in all cases the shape of the hysteresis loops of the lamb and wake components are complex and change significantly with varying k these patterns are echoed by the lamb and wake components of the yawing moment for which the lamb component is the dominant contribution at all reduced frequencies the impulse component on the other hand is only significant to the lateral force and has an approximately elliptical hysteresis loop whose force axis grows with k the impulse component is again seen to be well approximated by the inviscid added mass the lateral vorticity moment g y is plotted in fig 33 for oscillatory sway at β 0 1 5 and is seen to be essentially quasi steady throughout the maneuver and to follow the potential flow result closely this is due to the dominance of the near wall vorticity in the vorticity moment calculation at high r e near the wall the vorticity field will adjust to the maneuver kinematics on the timescale of the acceleration in order to enforce the no slip condition this near wall vorticity is so strong that it dominates the effect of motion history which is felt primarily in the separated wake behind the body because of this dominance of the near wall vorticity field the hydrodynamic impulse term can be well approximated by potential flow theory which models the wall as an infinitely thin vortex sheet in an otherwise irrotational field as a result the lateral force impulse term is well approximated by the inviscid added mass and is not significantly affected by motion history unlike the lamb and wake terms the effect of the motion history on the lamb term can be seen both in the hysteresis of that component of the force and also in visualizations of the lamb vector field on the body fig 34 plots contours of the lamb vector in the analysis domain at β t 1 6 for varying k the k 0 03 case can be seen to closely agree with the steady translation result indicating quasi steady conditions for all other cases with k 0 12 significant variation is seen in comparison with the steady translation this is most pronounced in the rear quarter of the body over the tapered tail where the local positive lamb vector distribution in the separated wake is seen to be significantly deformed in comparison to the steady case this variation is seen to both increase in strength and spread up the body as k increases the equivalent instantaneous lamb vector distributions are plotted in fig 35 the deformation of the positive wake lamb appears here to be in conflict with the lamb distribution on the body which shows a pronounced growth in negative vorticity as k increases for the case of β t 1 6 shown here the contribution of the windward boundary layer to the lamb vector at the tail is strongly negative it is countered by the positive contribution of the leeward boundary layer and a variable but net positive contribution from the separated wake during dynamic motion the contribution of the leeward boundary layer is reduced due to delayed separation near the tail in comparison with the quasi steady case the net result is an increasingly negative lamb vector in the tail due to the reduced ability of the leeward boundary layer to cancel the windward as seen in fig 35 this is related to the increasingly inhibited pressure recovery on the lee of the body due to the separation of the wake in general similar process occur throughout the maneuver resulting in the large hysteresis of the lamb term seen in fig 30 the wake vortices make a small but significant contribution to the lamb vector particularly near the tail and in general are responsible for the lamb vector being sensitive to motion history effects in comparison the instantaneous distributions of the lateral vorticity moment are plotted in fig 36 for the same β t 1 6 condition note that the lateral vorticity moment term is given by 6 2 g y s x z ξ x ζ d s there is a significant spike in the vorticity moment at the nose owing to the large value of x in this region and the significant ζ component of vorticity generated by flow around the nose and forward stagnation point the mid body is then seen to have a nearly constant vorticity moment which is driven primarily by the z ξ term finally the tail again has a large x and significant ζ and generates a significant positive contribution notably only the tail is significantly affected by variation in k where there is seen to be a small increase in g y in proportion to reduced frequency while only the β t 1 6 case is shown here these results are typical of the vorticity moment throughout the maneuver the equivalent contours of the lateral vorticity moment in the analysis domain are plotted in fig 37 it can be seen that there is again significant variation in the shape of the contours on the tail of the body as with the lamb term notably however this variation is primarily in the z direction whereas the vorticity moment at the tail is dominated by the x ζ term further the separated wake s contribution to the vorticity moment is notably weaker than its contribution to the lamb vector for both the lamb vector and vorticity moment the wake vorticity field is modified by the motion history effect particularly in the region near the tail for the lamb vector however this is much more significant as the comparatively high fluid velocity in the wake region magnifies this effect and increases the significance of the separated vorticity in comparison with the attached flow near the wall where the velocity is low for the vorticity moment the position of the separated vorticity is not changed significantly enough to cause a large variation in the vorticity moment and the near wall vorticity remains dominant for these reasons the lamb distributions experience significant variation near the tail of the body as a result of motion history and the integrated lamb term has significant hysteresis and a convective time scale during unsteady motion the vorticity moment however responds on the time scale of the kinematics and is essentially quasi steady throughout the maneuver the inviscid added mass then remains a good predictor of the hydrodynamic impulse due to the dominance of the near wall vorticity in the vorticity moment field 7 slender body approximations in their work holloway and jeans 2020 demonstrated a set of approximations which can be applied to the steady translation equations 4 1 and 4 2 to simplify the impulse based force and moment expressions for slender bodies several of these approximations remain valid in the unsteady problem and can be used to simplify the unsteady equations 2 11 and 2 12 the unsteady problem introduces several additional terms in comparison with the steady translation problem and these terms can also be simplified for slender bodies as with the above analysis this discussion will be restricted to the lateral force and yawing moment only the exact lateral force expression is written as 7 1 y ρ d i y d t ρ l y d 1 2 ρ x τ w l y d a where use has been made of the alignment of the normal vector with the longitudinal axis i e n ˆ i ˆ and x t is the axial location of the tail plane following holloway and jeans 2020 the lamb term is then linearized based on the velocity of the vehicle u and the disturbance velocity of the flow u 7 2 ρ l d ρ ω u d ρ ω u u d ρ u ω d so that 7 3 ρ l y d ρ u ζ d applying the identity saffman 1992 7 4 ω d w ω n ˆ x d s eq 7 3 can be transformed to a wake integral of the slender body tail plane impulse 7 5 ρ l y d ρ u w z ξ d s ρ u i y t fig 38 plots a comparison of the exact lamb term y l hysteresis with the slender body approximation for the oscillating sway cases with β 0 1 5 and varying reduced frequency it can be seen that the exact lamb term is well approximated by the slender body expression from the quasi steady limit through to at least k 0 30 while holloway and jeans 2020 found that the wake term makes a negligible contribution to the lateral force in steady translation the results of section 6 demonstrate that it is significant during unsteady motion the wake term can be transformed by recognizing that both the wake term and the impulse term contain a positional dependence while the total force must be independent of position the lateral force calculated with the origin at the center of buoyancy can be equated to the force with the origin at the tail as 7 6 d i y c b d t 1 2 x τ w l y d s d i y t d t the lamb terms have here been canceled due to their independence of origin while the wake term about the tail is zero denoting the distance between the tail and the center of buoyancy as δ x τ x c b the tail plane vorticity moment can be written as 7 7 g t 1 2 x δ i ˆ ω d 1 2 x ω d δ i ˆ ω d g c b δ i ˆ 1 2 ω d the lateral hydrodynamic impulse about the tail can then be written as 7 8 d i y t d t d i y c b d t δ 1 2 d d t s ξ z d s where use has again been made of identity 7 4 on the final term the surface integral is recognized as the slender body tail plane impulse if eq 7 8 is substituted into eq 7 6 it can be seen that 7 9 δ d i y t d t x τ w l y d s note that unlike the lamb term no linearization is necessary to transform the wake term into a tail impulse term the total slender body lateral force can then be written as 7 10 y ρ d i y c b d t ρ u i y t ρ x τ 1 2 d i y t d t the subscript c b will be dropped for the remainder of this work note that a slender body approximation of the rate of change of the impulse term has not been attempted because it has been demonstrated that this term can be accurately approximated with the inviscid added mass fig 39 plots a comparison of the slender body approximation of the total lateral force from eq 7 10 with the exact lateral force from eq 7 1 for the β 0 1 5 oscillating sway cases as with the lamb vector term it can be seen that the slender body simplification provides a good approximation for the lateral force for the entire range of reduced frequencies the exact impulse expression for the yawing moment is 7 11 n ρ d j z d t ρ x l y y l x d ρ 1 2 w x 2 l y d s the lamb moment term is seen to be composed of two components one due to the axial distribution of the lateral load and the other the lateral distribution of the axial load holloway and jeans 2020 found that the axial loading term has a negligible contribution to the lamb moment for slender bodies in steady translation and turning fig 40 plots a comparison of the exact lamb moment with that calculated by neglecting the axial loading for the β 0 1 5 sinusoidal sway cases it can be seen that the lateral loading assumption continues to be a good approximation of the exact lamb term at all frequencies following holloway and jeans 2020 the lamb moment can be further simplified by transformation of the lateral loading term the velocity field is again decomposed into the body motion and fluid disturbance with the disturbance terms neglected as per the slender body assumptions the slender body lateral loading is then given by 7 12 ρ x l y d ρ u x ζ d v ρ u x τ x n x s x ζ d s d x v the surface integral is then re written as the axial derivative of a volume integral which can be transformed via the identity 7 4 as 7 13 ρ u x τ x n x s x ζ d s d x v ρ u x τ x n x x ζ d d x v ρ u x τ x n x x s x z ξ d s d x v finally eq 7 13 is integrated by parts to obtain 7 14 ρ u x τ x n x x s x z ξ d s d x v ρ u x τ x n i y o x d x x τ i y t where i y o is the lateral slender body impulse distribution along the body 7 15 i y o x s x z ξ d s v a x as with the lateral force holloway and jeans 2020 found that the wake term in the yawing moment equation was small in steady flow this is again not the case in unsteady conditions however it is noted that the body is slender and hence x y z the wake term can then be approximated as 7 16 w x 2 l y d s w x 2 l y d s x τ 2 w l y d s this is simply the moment of the wake term from the lateral force equation and the same arguments used to derive equation 7 6 would apply the final term of the yawing moment equations is the rate of change of the angular impulse term recall that the angular impulse can be decomposed into the second moment of the vorticity field and the angular momentum of the fluid displaced by the body so that j z h z q z for unsteady sway motion d q z d t 0 so that j z h z the second moment of the vorticity field can be approximated by the slender body expression 7 17 h z 1 2 x 2 ζ d 1 2 x t x n x 2 s x ζ d s d x as was done with the lamb moment term the surface integral can be replaced by the axial derivative of a volume integral so that 7 18 h z 1 2 x t x n x 2 x ζ d d x this volume integral can then be replaced again using identity 7 4 so that 7 19 h z 1 2 x t x n x 2 x s x z ξ d x this expression can be integrated by parts and simplified yielding the slender body simplification of the second vorticity moment as 7 20 h z 1 2 x t 2 i y t x t x n x g y x d x here g y is the slender lateral vorticity moment distribution defined as 7 21 g y x s x z ξ d s the angular impulse term can then be written as the time derivative of eq 7 20 7 22 d j z d t d h z d t 1 2 x t 2 d i y t d t d d t x t x n x g y x d x fig 41 plots a comparison of the exact and slender impulse term for the β 0 1 5 oscillating sway cases it can be seen that the slender approximation performs well for most cases although it begins to under predict the second peak amplitude at higher k the final expression for the slender body yawing moment is then 7 23 n ρ d d t x t x n x g y x d x ρ u x τ x n i y o x x τ i y t ρ x τ 2 d i y t d t fig 42 again plots a comparison of the exact yaw moment equation with the slender body simplification for the sinusoidal sway cases with β 0 1 5 it can be seen that the slender body approximation overpredicts the yawing moment at the extrema for the high reduced frequency cases with a maximum error of approximately 18 in the k 0 30 case root mean squared error for the slender approximations is under 10 for all cases the over prediction is most significant in the lamb moment term suggesting that the disturbance terms neglected by the slender body assumptions may become more significant at higher reduced frequencies for the range of reduced frequencies explored here however the slender body assumptions appear to provide an acceptable approximation to the exact yawing moment 8 summary and conclusions this study demonstrates the use of a body fixed non inertial framework for analyzing the fluid forces and moments on slender bodies in unsteady motion using the hydrodynamic impulse description of the flow field the impulse theory is based on an understanding of the vortical structures which evolve with the body it has been demonstrated that this formulation provides a number of advantages for the description of hydrodynamic forces including highlighting the relationship between flow structures and surface forces and a clear decomposition of unsteady effects into those due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation the final advantage that the formulation is linear in the vorticity field and therefore more amenable to empirical modeling will be explored in future work which aims to extend existing quasi steady models for submarine hull forces to include unsteady effects three maneuver types were explored in quasi steady translation the flow is dominated by the separation of the boundary layer and the formation of the cross flow vortices which result in increased force on the mid body and tail due to increased lateral circulation this corresponds to locally large values of the lamb vector term in an impulse based force description the lamb vector term is then the dominant component in steady translation during impulsive accelerations it was shown that there are two distinct time scales in the force response the added mass force was shown to act entirely through the vortical impulse and fluid body terms of the impulse equation and to have a timescale dictated by the kinematics this effect corresponds primarily to the creation of new vorticity sheets at the body surface in response to acceleration these sheets are then advected away from the body and downstream a process which acts primarily through the lamb vector term and has a time scale of approximately one flow over the body length this mechanism was seen to primarily effect the force distribution on the tail of the body resulting in a decrease in the local lateral force and an increase in the total yawing moment during the circulatory transient the impulse description was shown to provide a clear decomposition of the dynamic forces into those due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation unlike a traditional pressure and shear based description a series of seven sinusoidal oscillating sway maneuvers was examined it was seen that the impulse based force description is markedly more sensitive to mesh and time step resolution than the traditional force description for a given unsteady maneuver impulse based methods however were seen to still have good agreement with traditional methods for the majority of the maneuver where the methods disagree this discrepancy is concentrated in the low β and high acceleration portion of the maneuver impulse based methods were also seen to continue to provide an effective means of decomposing the transient force components into those primarily due to added mass and those due to unsteady circulation and hence motion history this motion history component is contained primarily in the lamb vector term with minor contributions from the wake term and the vorticity moment term the motion history effect was clearly seen to grow in proportion to k and to reduce to the quasi steady solution in the low k limit this was demonstrated both by examination of the hysteresis behavior with decreasing k and with visualizations of the lamb vector field in all cases studied the impulse based description of the flow provides a clear mechanism to decompose the forces into the different transient effects which occur during submarine maneuvering this provides a strong basis for the development of approximate force models for transient submarine maneuvering as it allows different modeling approaches to be pursued for each component as a final step it was shown that approximations from slender body theory remain valid for unsteady flows and result in simplified impulse based force expressions these expressions are believed to be particularly well suited to the development of unsteady force prediction models due to the clear separation of unsteady effects future work will aim to enhance this database of sway cases by extending it to include additional maneuver kinematics and geometries and to use this enhanced database and the simplified force expressions to develop a force prediction model for fully transient submarine maneuvering problems credit authorship contribution statement r doyle methodology validation formal analysis investigation

20409,this paper investigates dynamic responses and buckling of a 10 mw monopile offshore wind turbine owt subjected to multiple environmental loadings including earthquake wind wave and current the finite element model fem of the support structure is developed in ansys to obtain relatively accurate and reliable structural responses the soil structure interaction ssi effects are represented using a set of lateral nonlinear springs and a vertical nonlinear spring the ssi effects on the eigenmodes of the support structure are examined the time series of wind and wave loads are respectively calculated using fast and aqwa and then fed into ansys as external loads to perform the seismic analysis the structural responses and local damage characteristics of the 10 mw owt have been studied the results indicate that the wind wave and current loads in the fore aft direction have a significant effect on the seismic responses of the owt it is therefore the turbulent wind wave and current loadings cannot be ignored when performing a seismic analysis of owts as a result of buckling the change of environmental load will lead to a transition between buckling modes these findings provide useful insights for the design of monopile offshore wind turbines keywords offshore wind turbines dynamic response buckling analysis turbulent wind wave current earthquake 1 introduction development and utilization of fossil fuels are slowing down due to their limited remaining reserves on the earth the need for developing renewable energy has become more pronounced as one of the fastest growing renewable energy resources wind energy has been experiencing a rapid development in the past decades yan et al 2019 the global wind energy council gwec released the 2019 annual wind report stating that the wind sector keeps strikingly rising the newly installed capacity of wind energy has overtook that of fossil fuels for the first time in many mature and emerging markets in 2018 it has been witnessed in 2018 the wind installed capacity up to 591 gw globally consisting of the newly installed wind capacity of 51 3 gw in the meantime the amount of annual new installations is expected to be more than 55 gw until 2023 gwecglobal wind energy council 2018 these estimations reasonably take into account the new technologies in wind turbine systems and the mature wind resources in offshore sites including the southeast of china and the west coastal areas of the usa it is noted that these areas are in proximity to the pacific seismic belts and are thus prone to earthquake hazards yang et al 2018 owts operating in these locations are exposed to wind wave current and earthquake loadings the coupling effects have been growing with the increase of structural scale of owts ding et al 2019 the tower height of 10 mw offshore wind turbine has exceeded 100 m mathias et al 2017 it is necessary to assess the safety issues of support structures subjected to various loads including earthquake excitations unlike land based wind turbines owts suffer from wave and current loads as well an efficient and accurate method is needed to address the above problems many methods of coupling model were used to study structural responses of wind turbines subjected to earthquakes during normal operation in recent years santangelo et al 2016 considered that the response spectrum analysis was incapable of solving aerodynamic damping and foundation flexibility the earthquake wind induced responses of a 5 mw wind turbine was studied by using the uncoupled time domain method to reduce the computational cost the results showed that the uncoupled analyses implemented in the time domain yields acceptable results otoniel 2010 presented an efficiently simplified multi body method to model a three bladed horizontal axis wind turbine with 16 degrees of freedom the method considered aerodynamic and structural damping and gyroscopic effects the results showed that the influence of seismic load on the tower was severe the modes associated with the lateral motion of wind turbine were more susceptible to larger intensity earthquakes since the aerodynamic damping was negligible in this direction because of the existence of aerodynamic damping the effect of it in wind turbines is calculated using the simplified multi body systems in fast jonkman and buhl 2005 asareh et al 2016 and prowell et al 2011 developed a seismic module within fast to examine the coupled effect of wind and seismic loads the improved fast was used to investigate the relationships between earthquake intensity and structural responses yang et al 2018 developed and validated a numerical analysis framework naf for seismic analysis of owts based on fast the results indicated that the aeroelastic effects reduces the tower displacement due to the dissipation of earthquake excitation energy in the inflow direction by the turbulent wind it is noted that the above studies based on fast had the advantages of accuracy and efficiency but lack the ability to study local buckling of wind turbines while the fem can bridge the gap of research techniques bazeos et al 2002 studied the stability and seismic behavior of a prototype steel tower of a 450 kw wind turbine a refined finite element shell model was established to evaluate the overall and local structural performance the local buckling phenomenon indicated that the transient buckling analysis is necessary for specifically critical locations of wind turbine s structures patil et al 2016 developed an elaborate fem of the tower of vestas 1 65 mw wind turbine to examine its structural dynamics and local buckling under intense ground motions it was found that the wind turbine was most vulnerable to yielding buckling and overturning in earthquake events of an earthquake sadowski et al 2017 investigated the seismic responses of a 1 5 mw wind turbine using the fem in abaqus it was found that the tower exhibited a high stiffness however the wind turbine could collapse because the tower deformation induced by the earthquake loadings exceed the material elastic threshold by developing a highly unstable plastic hinge therefore the fem is very useful and necessary to study the seismic behavior of wind turbines however aerodynamic loads of a wind turbine increase exponentially with the rotor size the foundation of the fixed wind turbine typically penetrates into seabed to obtain sufficient stability the property of offshore soil is different from that of terrestrial soils austin and jerath 2017 more specifically the seabed soil surface is a thicker layer of silt composed of marine biological excrement accumulation and quicksand the ssi effects is that soil stiffness of the soft layer varies with structural deformation and it results in variation of structural natural frequency bhattacharya 2014 evangelos et al 2019 in ma and zhang 2016 the necessity of ssi on dynamic response of a 5 mw owt modelled using the fem under seismic loading was studied in yang et al 2019 the influence on seismic dynamic response of a 5 mw owt was further discussed the ssi in each degree of freedom of the fixed foundation was considered using the multi body model the coupling effect between seabed soil and pile is usually represented by three models coupled springs cs distributed springs ds and apparent fixity af the interaction between the seabed soil and pile was modelled as a rigid or linear elastic contact in some studies gao et al 2010 voormeeren et al 2014 arundhuti et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 ye and wang 2015 these studies have confirmed that dynamic responses on the surface exhibit nonlinear changes in both the horizontal and vertical directions of soil increasing the damping of the owt support structure and decreasing the natural frequency in this case the relative displacement between the soil and the structure exacerbates the change of soil stiffness in an earthquake event the soil reaction forces have highly nonlinear characteristics associated with the structural deformation difference ibsen and liingaard 2006 ju and huang 2019 yang et al 2017 yeter et al 2019 investigated the influence of uncertainties that were involved in modelling the linear ssi using p y curves for predicting dynamic structural responses of a monopile owt the support structure of the owt was modelled as shell 93 type element the ssi model was described using the winkler spring model that used the soil reaction forces associated the soil to define the stiffness of the linear springs during the wind turbine development from 5 0 mw to 10 0 mw the blade length increased by 26 m the output power increases and the supporting structure is adjusted accordingly the tower height increases by 29 m the bottom diameter of the tower increases by 2 3 m the first order natural frequency of the tower decreases by 21 9 and the structure s dynamic characteristics also change significantly mathias et al 2017 the support structure length of owts need to be adjusted according to the water depth and soil mechanical properties of the installed area so it is necessary to accurately evaluate the dynamic characteristics of it under the consideration of soil flexibility when an earthquake occurs the considerable energy released by crustal displacement is transmitted to the surface through the soil in shear wave and longitudinal wave after reaching the surface the energy is transferred to the wind turbine pile foundation through soil and pile foundation interaction the amount of energy is bound to be significantly different due to the significant difference in each soil mechanical properties in the seabed the soil movement during the actual earthquakes are adopted as the seismic loads and the energy of movement transfer to the structure by ssi model is in line with the actual process under earthquakes kim et al 2014 baran et al 2018 on the view of the above an accurate nonlinear ssi model is needed to study the dynamic response of owt supported structures under earthquakes the present study investigates the dynamic responses of a 10 mw owt supported by a monopile foundation subjected to combined wind wave and earthquake loadings an accurate nonlinear winkler model is established in the commercial finite element software ansys to examined ssi effects of the owt a sophisticated shell model of the soil pile tower system is developed the modal calculation results of the soil pile tower system are obtained and compared with reference values to validate the fem established in this study the time varying wind and wave loads are calculated using fast and aqwa respectively and then applied on the structure as external forces the buckling analysis is performed to capture the precise transient dynamic responses of the owt by considering nonlinearity of the material the structural responses and local damage characteristics of 10 mw owt subjected to the combined environmental loadings are studied and discussed the results and conclusion of this study are expected to offer valuable reference to the design and optimization of owts installed in earthquake prone sites 2 description of the wind turbine model 2 1 monopile model in 2012 the technical university of denmark dtu cooperated with vestas a famous danish wind power enterprise to carry out the light rotor project and a reference wind turbine rotor with a capacity of 10 mw was designed bak et al 2012 the blade length is 86 47 m accordingly the tower hub and nacelle were designed to form the original dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 in this paper the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine is adopted for the case study the water depth of the installed wind turbine is 20 m and the foundation pile is 38 m the specific parameters and structural model of the dtu reference wind turbine are presented in table 1 and fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the owt is designed for 20 m water depth and the length of foundation pile is 38 m the foundation pile is divided into 6 parts with unequal lengths based on the soil properties in a site off china s eastern southern coast the transition pile consists of a 30 m long structure in seawater and a 16 m long connecting structure with tower the wall thickness of the tower decreases linearly with the height the outer diameter and the wall thickness of the tower base are 7665 mm and 34 mm respectively the diameter and the wall thickness at the tower top are 5500 mm and 26 mm respectively detailed parameters of the support structure are shown in fig 1 ref mathias et al 2017 the material of the support system is a709 high strength steel the young s modulus is 210 gpa and poisson ratio is 0 3 the yield limit is 380 mpa the steel density of wind turbine support structure is 7850 kg m3 the structural paint flanges bolts and welding point masses were not built during computation in order to ensure that the mass of the structure is consistent with the actual the effective density is modified to 8500 kg m3 asce awearp 2014 kim et al 2014 yan et al 2019 2 2 model verification in order to validate the fem established in this study the modal analysis of the owt is performed the multi body model of hub and rotor are established by beam element when the wind load is calculated in fast the fem of nacelle is established base on shell element the hub and the rotor are replaced by mass points and moment of inertia when the modal and dynamic analysis is calculated in ansys the center of mass of nacelle and rotor are indicated in fig 2 the wind load acts on the center of mass and the direction of it is along the rotor axis as shown in fig 3 the natural frequencies of the tower are obtained and compared against reference results as presented in table 2 it can be seen that the frequencies of the first fore aft and side side modes of the owt predicted in this study are very close to the reference results for instance the natural frequencies of the 1st fore aft mode is 0 0 predicted by this study are identical with those in the reference a relatively larger deviation is observed in the 2nd fore aft mode frequency the reason is that the connection structures are not considered in the reference however the absolute errors between the present and reference results are lower than 5 therefore the comparison has confirmed that the fem is well established 3 methodology of the seismic analysis a 3d fem of the owt is developed the tower and monopile are modelled as shell elements the pile soil interaction effect is modelled using a nonlinear winkler approach the aerodynamic loads on the blades are calculated using fast and then applied at fem established in ansys 3 1 modelling of structural dynamics a finite difference procedure is utilized in ansys by discretizing time over the history of dynamic action and reaction to address the time dependent dynamic problems for a single degree of freedom sdof system the dynamic governing equation of time domain motion for a multi degree of freedom mdof can be derived by 1 m u t c u t k u t f t where m c and k are mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively u t u t and u t are nodal acceleration velocity and displacement respectively f t is the time dependent applied force vector the direct numerical integration of dynamic equilibrium equations is the most general approach for solving the dynamic equation of motion to obtain structural dynamic response a 3d fem of the wind turbine support structure is modelled with each model comprising of nacelle tower transition piece and foundation pile they are meshed with shell elements the mesh size of support structure is 0 2 m and 0 6 m and the mesh at each component connection is refined to 0 1 m as shown in fig 4 the number of elements and nodes is 40926 and 41130 respectively 3 2 soil structure interaction model the nonlinear winkler model is used to describe the interaction between the pile and soil the stiffness of the nonlinear springs in the horizontal and vertical direction are determined based on the p y and the q z curves

structure and foundation interaction must be treated jointly because the survivability criteria for the support structure at seabed level and tower top are different table 3 the mechanical properties of the soil are very different from the steel pile foundation the structural stability of an owt is produced by the deeply embedded pile foundation for a long term operation the dynamic characteristics of the pile foundation are significantly affected by the seabed soil to obtain a preliminary understanding of ssi effects a modal analysis of the owt with the flexible foundation modelled using the winkler approach is performed the natural frequencies of the first and second modes in both fore aft and side side directions are obtained and compared with a without ssi model as presented in table 4 it is observed that the natural frequencies of the ssi model are smaller than those of the rigid model no ssi a relative deviation of 7 8 is produced on the 1st mode a larger error over 23 between the 2nd mode frequencies of the rigid and flexible foundation models is observed this implies that the natural modes of the owt are significantly influenced by the ssi effects fig 7 presents the vibration shapes of the owts with the rigid and flexible foundations the ssi effects have a weak influence on the 1st vibration shapes the 2nd vibration shapes are different on tower top and nacelle 4 environmental conditions as shown in fig 8 owts suffer from turbulent wind wave current and earthquake loading in order to consider the coupled effects of the environmental loads the aerodynamic forces due to wind and the hydrodynamic loads due to wave and current are respectively calculated using fast and aqwa the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads are then fed into the fem established in ansys as external forces in the fast model the turbulent wind field has a size of 250 m 236 m to cover the rotor the rotor thrust acting on the hub is predicted in fast wave and current loads are calculated using the morison s equation in aqwa the seismic load acting on the pile is determined in ansys by defining the ground motion displacement and stiffness of the springs sections 4 1 to 4 3 presents relevant descriptions of the environmental loadings 4 1 turbulent wind the paper employed the kaimal wind spectrum model to generate the turbulent wind field the spectral

nacelle of the fem developed in ansys 4 2 wave and current the support structure is a cylindrical pile the hydrodynamic forces acting on a cylinder in an oscillatory flow condition can be efficiently calculated using the morison s equation as given in eq 10 sumer and fredsøe 1997 10 f wave π 4 ρ c m d 2 u wave t 1 2 ρ d c d u wave t u wave t where u wave t is the wave induced particle velocity u

moskowitz p m spectrum of above wave condition 4 3 ground motions to study seismic behavior of the 10 mw owt the ground motions with different peaks of ground displacement pgd are selected pacific earthquake engine the ground displacements were recorded at three different stations chy 036 chy 047 and tcu 071 in the chi chi earthquake with a richter magnitude of 7 62 m the pgd of the ground motions are 7 77 cm 17 81 cm and 68 84 cm respectively the spectral displacements and time varying curves of the horizontal and vertical components of the earthquake are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively the seismic load of ground motion displacement can accurately describe the process of seismic energy delivered from soil to pile when the seismic load is defined in the code the target matching is usually carried out for the acceleration time domain curve but there is no target spectrum for displacement time domain curve in the code we choose the ground displacements which were recorded by three different stations the chi chi earthquake have a richter magnitude of 7 62 m the displacement time domain curves by different seismic station have the same displacement spectrum as shown in fig 11 it is shown that the same seismic time domain curves recorded by different stations don t need to be matched by target spectra 5 results and discussions to examine the effects of turbulent wind wave current and earthquake loads on the owt this study has conducted 13 simulations under different loading combinations as presented in table 5 three earthquake records are considered regarding the wind loads the rated wind speed 11 4 m s and cut out wind speed 25 0 m s are considered two wave conditions are examined to represent the normal and severe wave conditions the significant wave heights and periods are 4 m and 7 2 s 7 3 m and 11 1 s respectively it is noted that the earthquake is assumed to occur at 40th second for each load case the simulation duration is 100 s and the load step is 0 02 s several substeps are added for each loads step according to the variation of the transient loads for accelerating the convergence the load step is divided into several substeps the maximum and maximum substeps are 2 and 20 respectively the computational time of each simulation is about 28 h on a work station with a cpu of 32 cores structural responses and buckling of the owt under the combined loads are analyzed for each load case in table 5 section 5 1 analyzes the effects of each environmental loading on the dynamic responses of the owt the tower top displacement and stress and strain energy of the entire wind turbine system in time domain are presented in order to investigate the stress distribution along the circumference of the tower at different heights the circumference probe angle is defined in fig 13 the wind direction is set as 0 5 1 dynamic analysis 5 1 1 effect of earthquake loadings fig 14 presents tower top displacement stress and strain energy of the entire wind turbine system subjected to different earthquake loads the mean speed of the turbulent wind is 11 4 m s the significant wave height and period are 4 m and 7 2 s respectively the earthquake is occurred at the 40th s in the first 20 s of start up each response has a large fluctuation range due to the transient behavior caused by the wind wave current loads afterwards the responses vary in a relatively smaller range along with the stable operation of the owt the structural responses of the owt has been rapidly increased by the earthquake loadings the tower top displacement is influenced more significantly by the earthquake loads compared to the stress and strain energy the response time series of tower top displacement at x y and z direction was decomposed to study the increased reasons the results show that top displacement of the tower occurs a reciprocating motion in x direction and the displacement in y and z caused by wind and wave loads are smaller than seismic loads the reason for this phenomenon is that although the intensity of the wind and wave loads are not stable the main flow direction is dominant the intensity of seismic loads component in each direction are determined by shear and compressional wave and they are not the dominant direction the displacement increases in the x and y directions are greater than that in the z direction this indicates that the lateral displacement of the tower is more sensitive to the earthquake loading pgd for seismic loads from case 2 to case 4 decreases successively but the strain energy and stress of case 4 are larger than that in case 2 combine fig 12 with this phenomenon the reason is that the seismic pgd of case 4 is smaller but the duration is long and the displacement for the ground motions in x and y directions is larger because of the wind and wave load the maximum value in case 4 appears between 80 s 90 s therefore when study the seismic response of the owt the lateral response of the structure caused by shear wave and wind and wave loads happen at same time should be paid attention stress of the tower in case 2 through case 4 are shown in fig 15 at its peak time instant the stress distribution of the supporting structure in the z direction shows a nonlinear increase from top to bottom turbulent wind direction is identical with the position of the probe path 0 the maximum of stress appears at path 0 and path 6 because of turbulent wind from case 1 with the earthquake in case 2 4 the maximum stress is in between 0 and 50 or between 200 and 250 in the circumferential direction and rotates counterclockwise base on the displacement and strain energy of the tower the displacement is similar to the 1st mode the strain energy greater than 1980 kj is located at 26 m above the bottom flange of the tower it was found that the tower displacement increases sharply with the startup process the earthquake induced increase of tower displacement is mainly dominated by the 1st mode the earthquake causes the phenomenon of strain energy accumulated at tower bottom comparing case 1 and 4 it was found that the displacement of tower caused by the earthquake is proportional to the strain energy increment combine figs 14 16 seismic shear wave causes obvious changes in structural displacement and strain energy and the study of the tower fore aft displacement should consider the aerodynamic effect 5 1 2 effect of turbulent wind loadings fig 17 presents the time domain responses of the entire wind turbine system under different mean speed turbulent wind loads the pgd of the ground motion is 68 84 cm the significant wave height and period are 4 m and spectral peak 7 2 s respectively the mean wind speeds of case 2 9 and 10 are 11 4 m s 0 m s and 25 0 m s the top displacement presented irregularity motion in the fore aft direction the response fluctuation range at the rated wind speed is higher since the aerodynamic load is the largest in the rated condition the tower dynamic responses increase instantly after the earthquake occurs and the top displacements of y and z direction have little difference of each examined case this phenomenon proves that the top displacement of x direction was most affected by wind loads rotor thrust caused by wind load in case 10 is weaker than that of case 2 so the tower responses are relatively smaller but the responses of case 10 are larger than those in case 2 after the earthquake occurs the responses in case 2 are even less than those in case 9 this phenomenon proves that the aerodynamic damping significant impacts on the responses of the tower under earthquakes strong wind loads may weaken the tower response while weak wind loads may aggravate it the stress distributions of the tower in case 2 case 9 and case 10 are shown in fig 18 at the time instant when the stress achieves its peak the stress distributions of the tower are close under different wind conditions the maximum stress is 0 and 180 in the circumferential direction and rotates counterclockwise it is found that the stress distribution change of the tower is mainly determined by the seismic load the fluctuation range of case 10 is larger than those in case 2 and case 9 the fluctuation ranges of the stress in case 9 and case 2 are close this phenomenon proves that when higher than the rated wind speed the aerodynamic load is smaller than the rated wind speed when an earthquake occurs the tower stress effected by aerodynamic damping more obvious with larger of wind load the tower displacement and strain energy contours before and after the earthquake are contrasted in fig 19 before the earthquake the peak displacement in case 2 is significantly higher than that in cases 9 and case 10 it was found that the structural displacement caused by low wind speed after the earthquake the displacement of case 2 decreases compared and the relevant responses in cases 9 and case 10 increased significantly the displacement of case 10 is higher than that in cases 2 and case 9 it was found that the aerodynamic load can effectively reduce the amplitude of tower displacement this phenomenon proves that the aerodynamic load can also effectively alleviate the strain energy and accelerate the energy dissipation of the structure after the structure is subjected to an earthquake 5 1 3 effect of wave and current loadings fig 20 presents the tower top displacement stress and strain energy of the entire wind turbine system subjected to different wave loads the mean speed of the turbulent wind is 11 4 m s the pgd of the ground motion is 68 84 cm before the earthquake the wave loads have a little effect on the structure as confirmed by the identical responses this means that the structural responses of owt are dominated by the wind load after the earthquake occurred the influence of the wave loads on the dynamic responses increase the difference between of the displacements of the case 2 and case 13 is small when the wave load is small but when the waves and currents intensify the structure response under earthquakes also intensifies the stress distributions of the support structure of the examined cases are presented for a specific moment when the stress achieves its peak over the simulation there is no significant difference between the stress distributions but the stress of case 6 has a significant increase the maximum node stress value is 236 4 mpa the corresponding values in case 2 and 13 are only 191 2 mpa and 196 6 mpa respectively considering the different susceptibility of the support structure to wave loads and the influence caused by the increase of sea depth the wave loads cannot be ignored before implementing detailed standards for owts the displacement and strain energy contours of the structure are given in fig 22 the wave loads only have a particular effect on the response of case 6 at the 61st s this phenomenon proves that the influence of tower displacement is small with changing of wave loads the strain energy accumulation position remains at 26 m above the bottom flange of the tower the distribution difference of strain energy is pronounced the strain energy over 1980 kj of case 6 is more obviously greater than case 2 and case 13 it was found that wave loads have a more significant impact on the tower strain energy the strain energy of tower bottom significant changed with impact of wave and current loads the multi body model may ignore this point the seismic energy is transferred from pile foundation to tower top therefore it is concluded that the wave load affects seismic energy transfer which produces the dynamic response of the owt 5 2 local buckling analysis this section focuses on the buckling analysis of the area where the strain energy and stress are concentrated after the earthquake considering that the buckling analysis requires a high quality of the overall mesh through the submodeling function in mechanical module the transient analysis results obtained in the previous section are applied as the boundary condition in the buckling analysis to closely analyze the high risk areas afterwards the data of the structure area designated as the sub model is interpolated the buckling analysis is a technique used to determine the buckling load the critical load at which the structure becomes unstable and the buckling mode shape the characteristic shape related to the structure s buckling response first the time domain response curves of the tower displacement acceleration stress and wind turbine strain energy after the earthquake are presented in fig 21 the diagrams x 1 in the 12 diagrams are under the normal load condition the diagrams x 2 are the structural dynamic responses under high wave load and normal wind load case 6 case 7 and case 8 fig 21 x 3 are the structural dynamic responses under high wind load and ordinary wave load it can be seen from fig 23 that the dynamic responses of the owt have an overall increasing trend with the change of the loads this phenomenon proves that it is necessary to consider the combination effects of turbulent wind wave and current load comparing cases 2 4 and cases 6 8 the response amplitudes increase with the change of wave load except for acceleration comparing cases 2 4 and cases 10 12 the structure suffers from low wind load with turbulent wind speed increases but the dynamic response of earthquake increases the above phenomena have proved that the change and superposition of multiple loads lead to the response uncertainty therefore many aspects should be considered in the seismic analysis of owt it is found that the acceleration response of the owt mainly depends on the seismic load as given in fig 23 the pgd of the ground motion in case 3 case 7 and case 11 is 17 81 cm the amplitude of time domain response is high under the earthquake as a result the acceleration exhibits a short term and rapid increase the others cases release slow seismic energy and the displacement fluctuation lasts for a long time but the amplitude is small resulting in continuous acceleration fluctuations the others dynamic responses also show the same phenomenon the defect factor is found at 26 m height of the tower where the stress and strain energies are concentrated because the tower does not produce buckling under this loading condition the buckling analysis is based on the first three buckling modes of the structure under the above load conditions in fig 24 in fig 24 the local buckling contours and the color bar in the red frame match are presented the viewing angle of each contour is the direction of the turbulent wind the buckling of each mode and the distribution position of the deformation in the circumferential direction changed with different loads the deformation of mode 2 deformation is similar to that of mode 3 in case 7 case 10 11 and case 12 the mode 1 is close to mode 2 in other cases this phenomenon proves that the load condition causes the changes in the dynamic characteristics and damage form of owt if a buckling occurs the buckling deformation in circumferential distribution of different load conditions may be different therefore the optimized anti buckling design for monopile wind turbines should adopt circular structure at vulnerable sites 6 conclusions in this study effects of various environmental loads including earthquake excitations on the dynamic responses of a 10 mw owt have been investigated a high fidelity fem of the support structure is development in ansys the nonlinear ssi effects are examined using the winkler springs whose stiffness is defined using p y and q z curves the time varying wind and wave loads are calculated in fast and aqwa respectively and then are applied at the hub height and the monopile in the ansys s model the ground motion displacements of three records of the chi chi earthquake event are used the structural responses and local damage characteristics of the 10 mw owt are obtained through the sophisticated fem based on the results and discussions described previously the conclusions are given as follows 1 the ssi model of a 10 mw owt is examined to obtain relatively accurate and reliable responses of the owt subjected to multiple loadings the frequencies of the first fore aft and side side modes are very close to the reference results it indicates that the fem of the owt has been well developed the natural frequencies and vibration modes of the support structure with and without ssi effects are predicted and compared the significant difference between the results indicates that the vibration characteristics of the owt are significantly influenced by the ssi effects 2 the dynamic response of the owt has a large fluctuation range due to the transient behavior caused by the wind wave current loads the structural responses are dominated by the loads in the fore aft direction the earthquake loadings cause rapid increases in the responses of both fore aft and side side directions but the response in the side side and vertical directions caused by wind and wave loads are smaller than that induced by the seismic loads the fore aft direction wave loads and aerodynamic effect are more significant 3 thirteen different environmental loading conditions are examined to investigate the influence of environmental load on the seismic behavior of the owt three group comparisons with different loading combinations are made the results indicate each one of the environmental loads change will increase or decrease the seismic responses even for wave loads it also indicates that seismic analysis of an owt should consider the changes of aerodynamic effect on tower top displacement response and changes of stress at the supporting structure by wave and current loads it implies that turbulent wind load and wave load cannot be ignored when studying the seismic dynamic responses of owts 4 variation of environment loads not only causes the difference of seismic responses but also produces a buckling of the support structure according to the time domain responses of the seismic analysis it is found that the location of the support structure prone to buckling is identical to the positions with concentrated stress and strain energy the buckling analysis of each case indicates that the change of environmental load will lead to a transition of damage form with increases of the environmental load seismic loads produce change in the buckling mode at the circumferential

20409,this paper investigates dynamic responses and buckling of a 10 mw monopile offshore wind turbine owt subjected to multiple environmental loadings including earthquake wind wave and current the finite element model fem of the support structure is developed in ansys to obtain relatively accurate and reliable structural responses the soil structure interaction ssi effects are represented using a set of lateral nonlinear springs and a vertical nonlinear spring the ssi effects on the eigenmodes of the support structure are examined the time series of wind and wave loads are respectively calculated using fast and aqwa and then fed into ansys as external loads to perform the seismic analysis the structural responses and local damage characteristics of the 10 mw owt have been studied the results indicate that the wind wave and current loads in the fore aft direction have a significant effect on the seismic responses of the owt it is therefore the turbulent wind wave and current loadings cannot be ignored when performing a seismic analysis of owts as a result of buckling the change of environmental load will lead to a transition between buckling modes these findings provide useful insights for the design of monopile offshore wind turbines keywords offshore wind turbines dynamic response buckling analysis turbulent wind wave current earthquake 1 introduction development and utilization of fossil fuels are slowing down due to their limited remaining reserves on the earth the need for developing renewable energy has become more pronounced as one of the fastest growing renewable energy resources wind energy has been experiencing a rapid development in the past decades yan et al 2019 the global wind energy council gwec released the 2019 annual wind report stating that the wind sector keeps strikingly rising the newly installed capacity of wind energy has overtook that of fossil fuels for the first time in many mature and emerging markets in 2018 it has been witnessed in 2018 the wind installed capacity up to 591 gw globally consisting of the newly installed wind capacity of 51 3 gw in the meantime the amount of annual new installations is expected to be more than 55 gw until 2023 gwecglobal wind energy council 2018 these estimations reasonably take into account the new technologies in wind turbine systems and the mature wind resources in offshore sites including the southeast of china and the west coastal areas of the usa it is noted that these areas are in proximity to the pacific seismic belts and are thus prone to earthquake hazards yang et al 2018 owts operating in these locations are exposed to wind wave current and earthquake loadings the coupling effects have been growing with the increase of structural scale of owts ding et al 2019 the tower height of 10 mw offshore wind turbine has exceeded 100 m mathias et al 2017 it is necessary to assess the safety issues of support structures subjected to various loads including earthquake excitations unlike land based wind turbines owts suffer from wave and current loads as well an efficient and accurate method is needed to address the above problems many methods of coupling model were used to study structural responses of wind turbines subjected to earthquakes during normal operation in recent years santangelo et al 2016 considered that the response spectrum analysis was incapable of solving aerodynamic damping and foundation flexibility the earthquake wind induced responses of a 5 mw wind turbine was studied by using the uncoupled time domain method to reduce the computational cost the results showed that the uncoupled analyses implemented in the time domain yields acceptable results otoniel 2010 presented an efficiently simplified multi body method to model a three bladed horizontal axis wind turbine with 16 degrees of freedom the method considered aerodynamic and structural damping and gyroscopic effects the results showed that the influence of seismic load on the tower was severe the modes associated with the lateral motion of wind turbine were more susceptible to larger intensity earthquakes since the aerodynamic damping was negligible in this direction because of the existence of aerodynamic damping the effect of it in wind turbines is calculated using the simplified multi body systems in fast jonkman and buhl 2005 asareh et al 2016 and prowell et al 2011 developed a seismic module within fast to examine the coupled effect of wind and seismic loads the improved fast was used to investigate the relationships between earthquake intensity and structural responses yang et al 2018 developed and validated a numerical analysis framework naf for seismic analysis of owts based on fast the results indicated that the aeroelastic effects reduces the tower displacement due to the dissipation of earthquake excitation energy in the inflow direction by the turbulent wind it is noted that the above studies based on fast had the advantages of accuracy and efficiency but lack the ability to study local buckling of wind turbines while the fem can bridge the gap of research techniques bazeos et al 2002 studied the stability and seismic behavior of a prototype steel tower of a 450 kw wind turbine a refined finite element shell model was established to evaluate the overall and local structural performance the local buckling phenomenon indicated that the transient buckling analysis is necessary for specifically critical locations of wind turbine s structures patil et al 2016 developed an elaborate fem of the tower of vestas 1 65 mw wind turbine to examine its structural dynamics and local buckling under intense ground motions it was found that the wind turbine was most vulnerable to yielding buckling and overturning in earthquake events of an earthquake sadowski et al 2017 investigated the seismic responses of a 1 5 mw wind turbine using the fem in abaqus it was found that the tower exhibited a high stiffness however the wind turbine could collapse because the tower deformation induced by the earthquake loadings exceed the material elastic threshold by developing a highly unstable plastic hinge therefore the fem is very useful and necessary to study the seismic behavior of wind turbines however aerodynamic loads of a wind turbine increase exponentially with the rotor size the foundation of the fixed wind turbine typically penetrates into seabed to obtain sufficient stability the property of offshore soil is different from that of terrestrial soils austin and jerath 2017 more specifically the seabed soil surface is a thicker layer of silt composed of marine biological excrement accumulation and quicksand the ssi effects is that soil stiffness of the soft layer varies with structural deformation and it results in variation of structural natural frequency bhattacharya 2014 evangelos et al 2019 in ma and zhang 2016 the necessity of ssi on dynamic response of a 5 mw owt modelled using the fem under seismic loading was studied in yang et al 2019 the influence on seismic dynamic response of a 5 mw owt was further discussed the ssi in each degree of freedom of the fixed foundation was considered using the multi body model the coupling effect between seabed soil and pile is usually represented by three models coupled springs cs distributed springs ds and apparent fixity af the interaction between the seabed soil and pile was modelled as a rigid or linear elastic contact in some studies gao et al 2010 voormeeren et al 2014 arundhuti et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 ye and wang 2015 these studies have confirmed that dynamic responses on the surface exhibit nonlinear changes in both the horizontal and vertical directions of soil increasing the damping of the owt support structure and decreasing the natural frequency in this case the relative displacement between the soil and the structure exacerbates the change of soil stiffness in an earthquake event the soil reaction forces have highly nonlinear characteristics associated with the structural deformation difference ibsen and liingaard 2006 ju and huang 2019 yang et al 2017 yeter et al 2019 investigated the influence of uncertainties that were involved in modelling the linear ssi using p y curves for predicting dynamic structural responses of a monopile owt the support structure of the owt was modelled as shell 93 type element the ssi model was described using the winkler spring model that used the soil reaction forces associated the soil to define the stiffness of the linear springs during the wind turbine development from 5 0 mw to 10 0 mw the blade length increased by 26 m the output power increases and the supporting structure is adjusted accordingly the tower height increases by 29 m the bottom diameter of the tower increases by 2 3 m the first order natural frequency of the tower decreases by 21 9 and the structure s dynamic characteristics also change significantly mathias et al 2017 the support structure length of owts need to be adjusted according to the water depth and soil mechanical properties of the installed area so it is necessary to accurately evaluate the dynamic characteristics of it under the consideration of soil flexibility when an earthquake occurs the considerable energy released by crustal displacement is transmitted to the surface through the soil in shear wave and longitudinal wave after reaching the surface the energy is transferred to the wind turbine pile foundation through soil and pile foundation interaction the amount of energy is bound to be significantly different due to the significant difference in each soil mechanical properties in the seabed the soil movement during the actual earthquakes are adopted as the seismic loads and the energy of movement transfer to the structure by ssi model is in line with the actual process under earthquakes kim et al 2014 baran et al 2018 on the view of the above an accurate nonlinear ssi model is needed to study the dynamic response of owt supported structures under earthquakes the present study investigates the dynamic responses of a 10 mw owt supported by a monopile foundation subjected to combined wind wave and earthquake loadings an accurate nonlinear winkler model is established in the commercial finite element software ansys to examined ssi effects of the owt a sophisticated shell model of the soil pile tower system is developed the modal calculation results of the soil pile tower system are obtained and compared with reference values to validate the fem established in this study the time varying wind and wave loads are calculated using fast and aqwa respectively and then applied on the structure as external forces the buckling analysis is performed to capture the precise transient dynamic responses of the owt by considering nonlinearity of the material the structural responses and local damage characteristics of 10 mw owt subjected to the combined environmental loadings are studied and discussed the results and conclusion of this study are expected to offer valuable reference to the design and optimization of owts installed in earthquake prone sites 2 description of the wind turbine model 2 1 monopile model in 2012 the technical university of denmark dtu cooperated with vestas a famous danish wind power enterprise to carry out the light rotor project and a reference wind turbine rotor with a capacity of 10 mw was designed bak et al 2012 the blade length is 86 47 m accordingly the tower hub and

ensure that the mass of the structure is consistent with the actual the effective density is modified to 8500 kg m3 asce awearp 2014 kim et al 2014 yan et al 2019 2 2 model verification in order to validate the fem established in this study the modal analysis of the owt is performed the multi body model of hub and rotor are established by beam element when the wind load is calculated in fast the fem of nacelle is established base on shell element the hub and the rotor are replaced by mass points and moment of inertia when the modal and dynamic analysis is calculated in ansys the center of mass of nacelle and rotor are indicated in fig 2 the wind load acts on the center of mass and the direction of it is along the rotor axis as shown in fig 3 the natural frequencies of the tower are obtained and compared against reference results as presented in table 2 it can be seen that the frequencies of the first fore aft and side side modes of the owt predicted in this study are very close to the reference results for instance the natural frequencies of the 1st fore aft mode is 0 0 predicted by this study are identical with those in the reference a relatively larger deviation is observed in the 2nd fore aft mode frequency the reason is that the connection structures are not considered in the reference however the absolute errors between the present and reference results are lower than 5 therefore the comparison has confirmed that the fem is well established 3 methodology of the seismic analysis a 3d fem of the owt is developed the tower and monopile are modelled as shell elements the pile soil interaction effect is modelled using a nonlinear winkler approach the aerodynamic loads on the blades are calculated using fast and then applied at fem established in ansys 3 1 modelling of structural dynamics a finite difference procedure is utilized in ansys by discretizing time over the history of dynamic action and reaction to address the time dependent dynamic problems for a single degree of freedom sdof system the dynamic governing equation of time domain motion for a multi degree of freedom mdof can be derived by 1 m u t c u t k u t f t where m c and k are mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively u t u t and u t are nodal acceleration velocity and displacement respectively f t is the time dependent applied force vector the direct numerical integration of dynamic equilibrium equations is the most general approach for solving the dynamic equation of motion to obtain structural dynamic response a 3d fem of the wind turbine support structure is modelled with each model comprising of nacelle tower transition piece and foundation pile they are meshed with shell elements the mesh size of support structure is 0 2 m and 0 6 m and the mesh at each component connection is refined to 0 1 m as shown in fig 4 the number of elements and nodes is 40926 and 41130 respectively 3 2 soil structure interaction model the nonlinear winkler model is used to describe the interaction between the pile and soil the stiffness of the nonlinear springs in the horizontal and vertical direction are determined based on the p y and the q z curves respectively where ϕ is the internal friction angle e is the modulus of elasticity γ is the submerged unit weight t c is the unit skin friction compression t t is the unit friction tension q is the unit tip resistance compression the p y curve that describes the lateral soil resistance deflection relationship is nonlinear and varies with the monopile depth h american petroleum institute api assumes the p y relation of sand as a function of the ultimate lateral bearing capacity p u that depends on soil depth as presented in eqs 2 5 2 p a p u tanh k h a p u y 3 p u s c 1 h c 2 d γ h for

subgrade reaction k and the coefficients c1 c2 and c3 are functions of the angle of internal friction ϕ according to the reference american petroleum institute api 2003 c 1 c 2 c 3 are 3 2 3 6 60 respectively the p y curves corresponding to different depths are obtained in accordance with the api standard as presented in fig 5 the q z curve can describe the sum of the side shear and end bearing on the side wall the q z curve of monopile in clay without protuberance and with a flat tip the installation resistance at a given monopile tip depth z can be calculated by eqs 6 8 6 q q s q p

effective unit weight of soil z is tip penetration depth the q z curves are obtained in accordance with the api standard as presented in fig 6 to check the stability of a flexible owt system the structure and foundation interaction must be treated jointly because the survivability criteria for the support structure at seabed level and tower top are different table 3 the mechanical properties of the soil are very different from the steel pile foundation the structural stability of an owt is produced by the deeply embedded pile foundation for a long term operation the dynamic characteristics of the pile foundation are significantly affected by the seabed soil to obtain a preliminary understanding of ssi effects a modal analysis of the owt with the flexible foundation modelled using the winkler approach is performed the natural frequencies of the first and second modes in both fore aft and side side directions are obtained and compared with a without ssi model as presented in table 4 it is observed that the natural frequencies of the ssi model are smaller than those of the rigid model no ssi a relative deviation of 7 8 is produced on the 1st mode a larger error over 23 between the 2nd mode frequencies of the rigid and flexible foundation models is observed this implies that the natural modes of the owt are significantly influenced by the ssi effects fig 7 presents the vibration shapes of the owts with the rigid and flexible foundations the ssi effects have a weak influence on the 1st vibration shapes the 2nd vibration shapes are different on tower top and nacelle 4 environmental conditions as shown in fig 8 owts suffer from turbulent wind wave current and earthquake loading in order to consider the coupled effects of the environmental loads the aerodynamic forces due to wind and the hydrodynamic loads due to wave and current are respectively calculated using fast and aqwa the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads are then fed into the fem established in ansys as external forces in the fast model the turbulent wind field has a size of 250 m 236 m to cover the rotor the rotor thrust acting on the hub is predicted in fast wave and current loads are calculated using the morison s equation in aqwa the seismic load acting on the pile is determined in ansys by defining the ground motion displacement and stiffness of the springs sections 4 1 to 4 3 presents relevant descriptions of the environmental loadings 4 1 turbulent wind the paper employed the kaimal wind spectrum model to generate the turbulent wind field the spectral density of the wind speed is given as 9 s k f 4 σ k 2 l k u h u b 1 6 f l k u h u b 5 3 where k indicates the wind component f is the cycle frequency l k is a velocity component integral parameter fig 9 presents the rotor thrust predicted using fast for two wind conditions with average speeds of 11 4 m s and 25 m s the rotor thrust is applied at the hub height and directed along rotor shaft at the nacelle of the fem developed in ansys 4 2 wave and current the support structure is a cylindrical pile the hydrodynamic forces acting on a cylinder in an oscillatory flow condition can be efficiently calculated using the morison s equation as given in eq 10 sumer and fredsøe 1997 10 f wave π 4 ρ c m d 2 u wave t 1 2 ρ d c d u wave t u wave t where u wave t is the wave induced particle velocity u wave t is the wave induced particle acceleration d is diameter c m hydrodynamic mass coefficient equal to 1 0 for circular cylinders c d is the drag coefficient c m is the inertia coefficient f wave is the wave force per unit length ρ is the seawater density due to the non linearity of the drag term the current load cannot be evaluated separately from the wave load as the direction of the wave particle velocity and the current velocity is opposite for half the wave cycle it is important to calculate the term u 2 as the velocity u wave u current times its absolute value as shown in eq 11 11

given in eq 12 12 s ω 0 78 ω 5 exp 3 11 ω 4 h s 2 the significant wave height and period of common condition and severe condition are 4 m and 7 2 s 7 3 m and 11 1 s fig 10 presents the peirson moskowitz p m spectrum of above wave condition 4 3 ground motions to study seismic behavior of the 10 mw owt the ground motions with different peaks of ground displacement pgd are selected pacific earthquake engine the ground displacements were recorded at three different stations chy 036 chy 047 and tcu 071 in the chi chi earthquake with a richter magnitude of 7 62 m the pgd of the ground motions are 7 77 cm 17 81 cm and 68 84 cm respectively the spectral displacements and time varying curves of the horizontal and vertical components of the earthquake are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively the seismic load of ground motion displacement can accurately describe the process of seismic energy delivered from soil to pile when the seismic load is defined in the code the target matching is usually carried out for the acceleration time domain curve but there is no target spectrum for displacement time domain curve in the code we choose the ground displacements which were recorded by three different stations the chi chi earthquake have a richter magnitude of 7 62 m the displacement time domain curves by different seismic station have the same displacement spectrum as shown in fig 11 it is shown that the same seismic time domain curves recorded by different stations don t need to be matched by target spectra 5 results and discussions to examine the effects of turbulent wind wave current and earthquake loads on the owt this study has conducted 13 simulations under different loading combinations as presented in table 5 three earthquake records are considered regarding the wind loads the rated wind speed 11 4 m s and cut out wind speed 25 0 m s are considered two wave conditions are examined to represent the normal and severe wave conditions the significant wave heights and periods are 4 m and 7 2 s 7 3 m and 11 1 s respectively it is noted that the earthquake is assumed to occur at 40th second for each load case the simulation duration is 100 s and the load step is 0 02 s several substeps are added for each loads step according to the variation of the transient loads for accelerating the convergence the load step is divided into several substeps the maximum and maximum substeps are 2 and 20 respectively the computational time of each simulation is about 28 h on a work station with a cpu of 32 cores structural responses and buckling of the owt under the combined loads are analyzed for each load case in table 5 section 5 1 analyzes the effects of each environmental loading on the dynamic responses of the owt the tower top displacement and stress and strain energy of the entire wind turbine system in time domain are presented in order to investigate the stress distribution along the circumference of the tower at different heights the circumference probe angle is defined in fig 13 the wind direction is set as 0 5 1 dynamic analysis 5 1 1 effect of earthquake loadings fig 14 presents tower top displacement stress and strain energy of the entire wind turbine system subjected to different earthquake loads the mean speed of the turbulent wind is 11 4 m s the significant wave height and period are 4 m and 7 2 s respectively the earthquake is occurred at the 40th s in the first 20 s of start up each response has a large fluctuation range due to the transient behavior caused by the wind wave current loads afterwards the responses vary in a relatively smaller range along with the stable operation of the owt the structural responses of the owt has been rapidly increased by the earthquake loadings the tower top displacement is influenced more significantly by the earthquake loads compared to the stress and strain energy the response time series of tower top displacement at x y and z direction was decomposed to study the increased reasons the results show that top displacement of the tower occurs a reciprocating motion in x direction and the displacement in y and z caused by wind and wave loads are smaller than seismic loads the reason for this phenomenon is that although the intensity of the wind and wave loads are not stable the main flow direction is dominant the intensity of seismic loads component in each direction are determined by shear and compressional wave and they are not the dominant direction the displacement increases in the x and y directions are greater than that in the z direction this indicates that the lateral displacement of the tower is more sensitive to the earthquake loading pgd for seismic loads from case 2 to case 4 decreases successively but the strain energy and stress of case 4 are larger than that in case 2 combine fig 12 with this phenomenon the reason is that the seismic pgd of case 4 is smaller but the duration is long and the displacement for the ground motions in x and y directions is larger because of the wind and wave load the maximum value in case 4 appears between 80 s 90 s therefore when study the seismic response of the owt the lateral response of the structure caused by shear wave and wind and wave loads happen at same time should be paid attention stress of the tower in case 2 through case 4 are shown in fig 15 at its peak time instant the stress distribution of the supporting structure in the z direction shows a nonlinear increase from top to bottom turbulent wind direction is identical with the position of the probe path 0 the maximum of stress appears at path 0 and path 6 because of turbulent wind from case 1 with the earthquake in case 2 4 the maximum stress is in between 0 and 50 or between 200 and 250 in the circumferential direction and rotates counterclockwise base on the displacement and strain energy of the tower the displacement is similar to the 1st mode the strain energy greater than 1980 kj is located at 26 m above the bottom flange of the tower it was found that the tower displacement increases sharply with the startup process the earthquake induced increase of tower displacement is mainly dominated by the 1st mode the earthquake causes the phenomenon of strain energy accumulated at tower bottom comparing case 1 and 4 it was found that the displacement of tower caused by the earthquake is proportional to the strain energy increment combine figs 14 16 seismic shear wave causes obvious changes in structural displacement and strain energy and the study of the tower fore aft displacement should consider the aerodynamic effect 5 1 2 effect of turbulent wind loadings fig 17 presents the time domain responses of the entire wind turbine system under different mean speed turbulent wind loads the pgd of the ground motion is 68 84 cm the significant wave height and period are 4 m and spectral peak 7 2 s respectively the mean wind speeds of case 2 9 and 10 are 11 4 m s 0 m s and 25 0 m s the top displacement presented irregularity motion in the fore aft direction the response fluctuation range at the rated wind speed is higher since the aerodynamic load is the largest in the rated condition the tower dynamic responses increase instantly after the earthquake occurs and the top displacements of y and z direction have little difference of each examined case this phenomenon proves that the top displacement of x direction was most affected by wind loads rotor thrust caused by wind load in case 10 is weaker than that of case 2 so the tower responses are relatively smaller but the responses of case 10 are larger than those in case 2 after the earthquake occurs the responses in case 2 are even less than those in case 9 this phenomenon proves that the aerodynamic damping significant impacts on the responses of the tower under earthquakes strong wind loads may weaken the tower response while weak wind loads may aggravate it the stress distributions of the tower in case 2 case 9 and case 10 are shown in fig 18 at the time instant when the stress achieves its peak the stress distributions of the tower are close under different wind conditions the maximum stress is 0 and 180 in the circumferential direction and rotates counterclockwise it is found that the stress distribution change of the tower is mainly determined by the seismic load the fluctuation range of case 10 is larger than those in case 2 and case 9 the fluctuation ranges of the stress in case 9 and case 2 are close this phenomenon proves that when higher than the rated wind speed the aerodynamic load is smaller than the rated wind speed when an earthquake occurs the tower stress effected by aerodynamic damping more obvious with larger of wind load the tower displacement and strain energy contours before and after the earthquake are contrasted in fig 19 before the earthquake the peak displacement in case 2 is significantly higher than that in cases 9 and case 10 it was found that the structural displacement caused by low wind speed after the earthquake the displacement of case 2 decreases compared and the relevant responses in cases 9 and case 10 increased significantly the displacement of case 10 is higher than that in cases 2 and case 9 it was found that the aerodynamic load can effectively reduce the amplitude of tower displacement this phenomenon proves that the aerodynamic load can also effectively alleviate the strain energy and accelerate the energy dissipation of the structure after the structure is subjected to an earthquake 5 1 3 effect of wave and current loadings fig 20 presents the tower top displacement stress and strain energy of the entire wind turbine system subjected to different wave loads the mean speed of the turbulent wind is 11 4 m s the pgd of the ground motion is 68 84 cm before the earthquake the wave loads have a little effect on the structure as confirmed by the identical responses this means that the structural responses of owt are dominated by the wind load after the earthquake occurred the influence of the wave loads on the dynamic responses increase the difference between of the displacements of the case 2 and case 13 is small when the wave load is small but when the waves and currents intensify the structure response under earthquakes also intensifies the stress distributions of the support structure of the examined cases are presented for a specific moment when the stress achieves its peak over the simulation there is no significant difference between the stress distributions but the stress of case 6 has a significant increase the maximum node stress value is 236 4 mpa the corresponding values in case 2 and 13 are only 191 2 mpa and 196 6 mpa respectively considering the different susceptibility of the support structure to wave loads and the influence caused by the increase of sea depth the wave loads cannot be ignored before implementing detailed standards for owts the displacement and strain energy contours of the structure are given in fig 22 the wave loads only have a particular effect on the response of case 6 at the 61st s this phenomenon proves that the influence of tower displacement is small with changing of wave loads the strain energy accumulation position remains at 26 m above the bottom flange of the tower the distribution difference of strain energy is pronounced the strain energy over 1980 kj of case 6 is more obviously greater than case 2 and case 13 it was found that wave loads have a more significant impact on the tower strain energy the strain energy of tower bottom significant changed with impact of wave and current loads the multi body model may ignore this point the seismic energy is transferred from pile foundation to tower top therefore it is concluded that the wave load affects seismic energy transfer which produces the dynamic response of the owt 5 2 local buckling analysis this section focuses on the buckling analysis of the area where the strain energy and stress are concentrated after the earthquake considering that the buckling analysis requires a high quality of the overall mesh through the submodeling function in mechanical module the transient analysis results obtained in the previous section are applied as the boundary condition in the buckling analysis to closely analyze the high risk areas afterwards the data of the structure area designated as the sub model is interpolated the buckling analysis is a technique used to determine the buckling load the critical load at which the structure becomes unstable and the buckling mode shape the characteristic shape related to the structure s buckling response first the time domain response curves of the tower displacement acceleration stress and wind turbine strain energy after the earthquake are presented in fig 21 the diagrams x 1 in the 12 diagrams are under the normal load condition the diagrams x 2 are the structural dynamic responses under high wave load and normal wind load case 6 case 7 and case 8 fig 21 x 3 are the structural dynamic responses under high wind load and ordinary wave load it can be seen from fig 23 that the dynamic responses of the owt have an overall increasing trend with the change of the loads this phenomenon proves that it is necessary to consider the combination effects of turbulent wind wave and current load comparing cases 2 4 and cases 6 8 the response amplitudes increase with the change of wave load except for acceleration comparing cases 2 4 and cases 10 12 the structure suffers from low wind load with turbulent wind speed increases but the dynamic response of earthquake increases the above phenomena have proved that the change and superposition of multiple loads lead to the response uncertainty therefore many aspects should be considered in the seismic analysis of owt it is found that the acceleration response of the owt mainly depends on the seismic load as given in fig 23 the pgd of the ground motion in case 3 case 7 and case 11 is 17 81 cm the amplitude of time domain response is high under the earthquake as a result the acceleration exhibits a short term and rapid increase the others cases release slow seismic energy and the displacement fluctuation lasts for a long time but the amplitude is small resulting in continuous acceleration fluctuations the others dynamic responses also show the same phenomenon the defect factor is found at 26 m height of the tower where the stress and strain energies are concentrated because the tower does not produce buckling under this loading condition the buckling analysis is based on the first three buckling modes of the structure under the above load conditions in fig 24 in fig 24 the local buckling contours and the color bar in the red frame match are presented the viewing angle of each contour is the direction of the turbulent wind the buckling of each mode and the distribution position of the deformation in the circumferential direction changed with different loads the deformation of mode 2 deformation is similar to that of mode 3 in case 7 case 10 11 and case 12 the mode 1 is close to mode 2 in other cases this phenomenon proves that the load condition causes the changes in the dynamic characteristics and damage form of owt if a buckling occurs the buckling deformation in circumferential distribution of different load conditions may be different therefore the optimized anti buckling design for monopile wind turbines should adopt circular structure at vulnerable sites 6 conclusions in this study effects of various environmental loads including earthquake excitations on the dynamic responses of a 10 mw owt have been investigated a high fidelity fem of the support structure is development in ansys the nonlinear ssi effects are examined using the winkler springs whose stiffness is defined using p y and q z curves the time varying wind and wave loads are calculated in fast and aqwa respectively and then are applied at the hub height and the monopile in the ansys s model the ground motion displacements of three records of the chi chi earthquake event are used the structural responses and local damage characteristics of the 10 mw owt are obtained through the sophisticated fem based on the results and discussions described previously the conclusions are given as follows 1 the ssi model of a 10 mw owt is examined to obtain relatively accurate and reliable responses of the owt subjected to multiple loadings the frequencies of the first fore aft and side side modes are very close to the reference results it indicates that the fem of the owt has been well developed the natural frequencies and vibration modes of the support structure with and without ssi effects are predicted and compared the significant difference between the results indicates that the vibration characteristics of the owt are significantly influenced by the ssi effects 2 the dynamic response of the owt has a large fluctuation range due to the transient behavior caused by the wind wave current loads the structural responses are dominated by the loads in the fore aft direction the earthquake loadings cause rapid increases in the responses of both fore aft and side side directions but the response in the side side and vertical directions caused by wind and wave loads are smaller than that induced by the seismic loads the fore aft direction wave loads and aerodynamic effect are more significant 3 thirteen different environmental loading conditions are examined to investigate the influence of environmental load on the seismic behavior of the owt three group comparisons with different loading combinations are made the results indicate each one of the environmental loads change will increase or decrease the seismic responses even for wave loads it also indicates that seismic analysis of an owt should consider the changes of aerodynamic effect on tower top displacement response and changes of stress at the supporting structure by wave and current loads it implies that turbulent wind load and wave load cannot be ignored when studying the seismic dynamic responses of owts 4 variation of environment loads not only causes the difference of seismic responses but also produces a buckling of the support structure according to the time domain responses of the seismic analysis it is found that the location of the support structure prone to buckling is identical to the positions with concentrated stress and strain energy the buckling analysis of each case indicates that the change of environmental load will lead to a transition of damage form with increases of the environmental load seismic loads produce change in the buckling mode at the circumferential
